"Diagnostic Value of C-Reactive Protein Levels in Postoperative Infectious Complications After Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","Background: Bariatric surgery involves the risk of postoperative infectious complications, in particular, anastomotic leaks and intra-abdominal abscesses. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation which has gained attention as a test to predict postoperative infectious complications. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic value of CRP to detect postoperative infectious complications after bariatric surgery. Methods: Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and PubMed databases were performed. Articles measuring serum CRP postoperatively in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery were included. Main outcomes included diagnostic value of postoperative serum CRP (area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV)). Diagnostic accuracy of included studies was assessed using QUADAS-2. Results: Six studies including 2770 patients met the inclusion criteria. The derived CRP cutoff values were 71.4?mg/dL, 130.3?mg/dL, and 118.7?mg/dL on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Pooled AUC was similar across PODs 1, 3, and 5 with AUC being highest on POD 5 (0.88 ± 0.07). PPV was between 19 and 21%, and NPV was between 98 and 99%. CRP levels were significantly higher (P?<.0001) in postoperative infectious complication group versus the no complication group on PODs 3 and 5. Conclusions: High NPV and moderately high sensitivity on PODs 1, 3, and 5 may help predict patients who are at a low risk of infectious complication following bariatric surgery. High specificity on PODs 1 and 3 also indicates that it can be useful for early diagnosis of postoperative infectious complications. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""

"Thromboprophylaxis in Patients with Acute Spinal Cord Injury: A Narrative Review","2019","Patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) have the highest risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among hospitalized patients. The incidence of total deep vein thrombosis ranges from 50 to 100% in untreated patients and pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of mortality in these patients. The pathophysiology of the increased risk of VTE is explained by venous stasis after injury, endothelial vessel wall injury from surgery, and a hypercoagulable state associated with trauma. The current thromboprophylaxis options are limited, with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) being the current standard of care. LMWH is commonly administered for 3 months, during which period the risk of VTE is especially high. Some uncertainty exists regarding the optimal timing to initiate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and the best regimen of LMWH prophylaxis. High-quality data are currently lacking in thromboprophylaxis in patients with SCI. Many questions in this area remain to be answered, which are described in this narrative review. ? 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.","anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; low molecular weight heparin; biological marker; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; acute disease; disease marker; human; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk factor; spinal cord injury; thrombosis prevention; time to treatment; treatment duration; venous thromboembolism; acute disease; blood; complication; spinal cord injury; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; Acute Disease; Anticoagulants; Biomarkers; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Spinal Cord Injuries; Venous Thromboembolism; Venous Thrombosis"

"Femoroacetabular Impingement: What the Surgeon Wants to Know","2019","Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for early hip degeneration in young active patients. The diagnosis depends on clinical examination and proper imaging that should be able to identify abnormal and sometimes subtle morphological changes. Labral tears and cartilage lesions rarely occur without underlying bone abnormalities. Surgical approaches to treat FAI are increasing significantly worldwide, even without a clearly defined consensus of what should be accepted as the standard imaging diagnosis for FAI morphology. Hip abnormalities encompass many variations related to the shape, size, and spatial orientation of both sides of the joint and can be difficult to characterize if adequate imaging is not available. This article presents a comprehensive review about the information orthopaedic surgeons need to know from radiologists to plan the most rational approach to a painful hip resulting from a mechanical abnormality. ? 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.","cartilage; femoral torsion; femoroacetabular impingement; hip arthroscopy; hip disease; human; ischiofemoral impingement; orthopedic surgeon; priority journal; radiologist; Review; spine disease; subspine impingement; torsion; trochanteric impingement; arthroscopy; diagnostic imaging; femoroacetabular impingement; hip; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; radiography; surgeon; Arthroscopy; Femoracetabular Impingement; Hip Joint; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Radiography; Surgeons"
"Implementation process and quality of a primary health care system improvement initiative in a decentralized context: A retrospective appraisal using the quality implementation framework","2019","Background: Effective implementation processes are essential in achieving desired outcomes of health initiatives. Whereas many approaches to implementation may seem straightforward, careful advanced planning, multiple stakeholder involvements, and addressing other contextual constraints needed for quality implementation are complex. Consequently, there have been recent calls for more theory-informed implementation science in health systems strengthening. This study applies the quality implementation framework (QIF) developed by Meyers, Durlak, and Wandersman to identify and explain observed implementation gaps in a primary health care system improvement intervention in Nigeria. Methods: We conducted a retrospective process appraisal by analyzing contents of 39 policy document and 15 key informant interviews. Using the QIF, we assessed challenges in the implementation processes and quality of an improvement model across the tiers of Nigeria's decentralized health system. Results: Significant process gaps were identified that may have affected subnational implementation quality. Key challenges observed include inadequate stakeholder engagements and poor fidelity to planned implementation processes. Although needs and fit assessments, organizational capacity building, and development of implementation plans at national level were relatively well carried out, these were not effective in ensuring quality and sustainability at the subnational level. Conclusions: Implementing initiatives between levels of governance is more complex than within a tier. Adequate preintervention planning, understanding, and engaging the various interests across the governance spectrum are key to improving quality. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","article; capacity building; decentralization; health care policy; human; interview; Nigeria; primary health care; retrospective study; stakeholder engagement; health care policy; Nigeria; organization and management; politics; primary health care; qualitative research; standards; total quality management; Capacity Building; Health Policy; Interviews as Topic; Nigeria; Politics; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Quality Improvement; Retrospective Studies"
"N-acetylcysteine use among patients undergoing cardiac surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials","2019","Background Cardiac surgeries are complex procedures aiming to re-establish coronary flow and correct valvular defects. Oxidative stress, caused by inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury, is associated with these procedures, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) acts as an antioxidant by replenishing the glutathione stores, and emerging evidence suggests that NAC may reduce the risk of adverse perioperative outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the addition of NAC to a standard of care among adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods We searched four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS) from inception to October 2018 and the grey literaure for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of NAC on pre-defined outcomes including mortality, acute renal insufficiency (ARI), acute cardiac insufficiency (ACI), hospital length of stay (HLoS), intensive care unit length of stay (ICULoS), arrhythmia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias among eligible articles. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome. Results Twenty-nine RCTs including 2,486 participants proved eligible. Low to moderate certainty evidence demonstrated that the addition of NAC resulted in a non-statistically significant reduction in mortality (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.25), ARI (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09), ACI (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.38), HLoS (Mean Difference (MD) 0.21; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.23), ICULoS (MD -0.04; 95% CI -0.29 to 0.20), arrhythmia (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20), and AMI (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48). Limitations Among eligible trials, we observed heterogeneity in the population and interventions including patients with and without kidney dysfunction and interventions that differed in route of administration, dosage, and duration of treatment. This observed heterogeneity was not explained by our subgroup analyses. Conclusions The addition of NAC during cardiac surgery did not result in a statistically significant reduction in clinical outcomes. A large randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial is needed to determine whether NAC reduces mortality. ? 2019 Pereira et al.

"Thermal Stabilization of Viral Vaccines in Low-Cost Sugar Films","2019","Most currently available vaccines, particularly live vaccines, require the cold chain, as vaccine efficacy can be significantly hampered if they are not stored in a temperature range of 2–8 °C at all times. This necessity places a tremendous financial and logistical burden on vaccination programs, particularly in the developing world. The development of thermally stable vaccines can greatly alleviate this problem and, in turn, increase vaccine accessibility worldwide. In this paper, we detail a simple and cost-effective method for stabilizing live vaccines that uses FDA-approved materials. To this end, we dried enveloped DNA (Herpes Simplex Virus type 2) and RNA (Influenza A virus) viral vaccines in a pullulan and trehalose mixture. The results of these studies showed that the live-attenuated HSV-2 vaccine retained its efficacy for at least 2 months of storage at 40 °C, while the inactivated influenza vaccine was able to retain its immunogenicity for at least 3 months of storage at 40 °C. This work presents a simple approach that allows thermo-sensitive vaccines to be converted into thermo-stable vaccines that do not require refrigeration, thus contributing to the improvement of vaccine deployment throughout the world. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Using street imagery and crowdsourcing internet marketplaces to measure motorcycle helmet use in Bangkok, Thailand","2019","Introduction: The majority of Thailand's road traffic deaths occur on motorised two-Wheeled or three-Wheeled vehicles. Accurately measuring helmet use is important for the evaluation of new legislation and enforcement. Current methods for estimating helmet use involve roadside observation or surveillance of police and hospital records, both of which are time-Consuming and costly. Our objective was to develop a novel method of estimating motorcycle helmet use. Methods: Using Google Maps, 3000 intersections in Bangkok were selected at random. At each intersection, hyperlinks of four images 90° apart were extracted. These 12 000 images were processed in Amazon Mechanical Turk using crowdsourcing to identify images containing motorcycles. The remaining images were sorted manually to determine helmet use. Results: After processing, 462 unique motorcycle drivers were analysed. The overall helmet wearing rate was 66.7 % (95% CI 62.6 % to 71.0 %). Taxi drivers had higher helmet use, 88.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 94.9%), compared with non-Taxi drivers, 62.8% (95% CI 57.9% to 67.6%). Helmet use on non-Residential roads, 85.2% (95% CI 78.1 % to 90.7%), was higher compared with residential roads, 58.5% (95% CI 52.8% to 64.1%). Using logistic regression, the odds of a taxi driver wearing a helmet compared with a non-Taxi driver was significantly increased 1.490 (p<0.01). The odds of helmet use on non-Residential roads as compared with residential roads was also increased at 1.389 (p<0.01). Conclusion: This novel method of estimating helmet use has produced results similar to traditional methods. Applying this technology can reduce time and monetary costs and could be used anywhere street imagery is used. Future directions include automating this process through machine learning. ?

"Adaptation and Preliminary Validation of the Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey for Surrogate Decision Makers","2019","Context: Although measures that assess patient engagement in the advance care planning (ACP) process exist, there are no validated tools to assess surrogate decision makers' (SDMs') role in ACP. Objectives: The objective of this study was to adapt and begin to validate a patient-oriented questionnaire for use with SDMs of patients with chronic illness. Methods: Questions from the 55-item patient-oriented ACP engagement survey were adapted for SDMs and assessed for face validity. The resultant 47-item questionnaire was administered to 65 SDMs of patients with chronic illness. Responses were assessed and items were flagged for removal based on item redundancy, nonresponses, and ceiling effects. A preliminary exploratory factor analysis was performed, internal consistency was assessed, and domains were constructed based on findings. Results: The 47-item questionnaire was administered to 65 participants (mean age 51.8; 81% female; 96% Caucasian). Seventeen items were removed owing to redundancy (r > 0.80), and 13 items lacking face validity were removed. In a preliminary exploratory factor analysis of the resultant 17-item questionnaire, a three-factor solution was deemed most statistically and conceptually sound. Items were organized into domains: 1) serving as an SDM (seven items); 2) contemplation (four items); 3) readiness (six items). Internal consistency for each domain was high (Cronbach alpha 0.90–0.91). Conclusion: The 17-item ACP engagement survey for SDMs (ACP-17-SDM) is a conceptually sound and reliable questionnaire adaptation of the original ACP engagement survey. This questionnaire may be used by researchers in parallel with the patient-oriented ACP engagement survey to more fully understand the impact of ACP interventions on SDMs. Larger studies are needed to more closely examine construct validity. ? 2019","adult; advance care planning; Article; behavior change; chronic disease; construct validity; exploratory factor analysis; face validity; female; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; middle aged; prospective study; quality of life; questionnaire; Social Cognitive Theory; validation study"

"‘The disease isn't listening to the drug’: The socio-cultural context of antibiotic use for viral respiratory infections in rural Uganda","2019","To identify factors precipitating antibiotic misuse and discuss how to promote safe antibiotics use and curb antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic misuse is a significant problem globally, leading to increased antibiotic resistance. Many socio-cultural factors facilitate antibiotic misuse: patient and provider beliefs about antibiotics, inadequate regulation, poor health literacy, inadequate healthcare provider training, and sub-optimal diagnostic capability. This study investigates the influence of such factors on antibiotic use and community health in rural Uganda. Attention was paid to patient-provider dynamics, providers’ concerns, and the role of drug shops in the communities and how these situations exacerbate antibiotic misuse. Using a grounded ethnographic approach, interviews, focus groups, and observations were conducted over six weeks. Five salient themes emerged from data analysis. Based on the study results and a review of past literature on antibiotic resistance, there is need for improved health literacy and education, continued focus on efficiency and affordability in healthcare, and recognition of the role of stewardship and government in providing better healthcare. The problem of antibiotic misuse is multifactorial. Proposed solutions must target multiple contributing factors and must ultimately modify the culture and beliefs surrounding antibiotic use and encourage proper use. Such a multi-pronged approach would be most effective and would decrease rates of antibiotic resistance. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; antimicrobial stewardship; Article; community; cultural factor; data analysis; drug misuse; education; female; government; health care; health care personnel; health literacy; health promotion; human; male; priority journal; rural area; semi structured interview; social aspect; Uganda; viral respiratory tract infection; antiviral resistance; attitude to health; drug effect; help seeking behavior; information processing; interview; qualitative research; respiratory tract infection; rural population; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Stewardship; Drug Resistance, Viral; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Help-Seeking Behavior; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Qualitative Research; Respiratory Tract Infections; Rural Population; Uganda"
"Work-focused interventions that promote the labour market transition of young adults with chronic disabling health conditions: A systematic review","2019","Objective: Young adulthood is an important transitional life phase where careers are established. Young adults with chronic disabling health conditions are underrepresented in the labour market. Our study aims to examine the effectiveness of work-focused interventions that support the labour market transition of young adults with chronic disabling health conditions; and to examine whether the effectiveness of work-focused interventions differ across work transition phase (eg, preparation, entry and sustaining work, employment advancement) and disability type. Methods: A systematic review of articles published between January 1990 and July 2018 was conducted. Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo were searched, and titles/abstracts and full texts of articles were reviewed for eligibility. Relevant articles were appraised for methodological quality. A best evidence synthesis was applied to medium-quality/high-quality studies to develop recommendations. Results: 5816 articles were identified; 10 articles were relevant and of moderate-high methodological quality. Six intervention categories were identified which focused on young adults with mental health or intellectual/learning disabilities (n=3) and addressed employment preparation (n=10) and/or work entry (n=9). No interventions addressed at-work issues or career advancement. Strong evidence existed for tailored supported employment (SE) interventions having a positive impact on preparation and entry into competitive employment. Also, moderate evidence existed for the positive impact of SE on preparation and entry into competitive employment for young adults with mental health conditions. Conclusions: Tailored SE is recommended to foster preparation and entry into the labour market. Evidence-based interventions are needed to facilitate sustained work and career advancement of young adults living with different disabling health conditions. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","adult; career; chronic disease; disability; disabled person; Embase; hearing disorder; human; intellectual impairment; job market; learning disorder; Medline; mental health; physical disease; priority journal; PsycINFO; Review; speech disorder; supported employment; systematic review; visual disorder; work; young adult; chronic disease; disabled person; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); vocational rehabilitation; Adult; Chronic Disease; Disabled Persons; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rehabilitation, Vocational; Young Adult"
"Exposure to antenatal corticosteroids and reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia in adult survivors of extremely low birth weight","2019","Purpose/aim: Antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) therapy has dramatically increased survival rates among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. However, the long-term effects of ACS on autonomic nervous system function have not been explored. Using the world’s oldest longitudinally followed cohort of ELBW infants we compared respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) among ELBW survivors whose mothers received ACS (ELBW-S), those who did not (ELBW-NS) and normal birth weight (NBW) controls in their 20 and 30 s. Methods: Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from ELBW-S (n=28), ELBWNS (n=36), and matched NBW controls (n=79) at 22-26 and 29-36 years. Resting RSA was compared across groups via analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for sex, medication use, postnatal steroid exposure and the presence of chronic health conditions. RSA was also compared across assessments for each group. Results: At 29-36 years, resting RSA in ELBW-S was significantly lower than in NBW controls. RSA in the ELBW-NS group was intermediate between ELBW-S and NBW groups. Although the ELBW-S group also showed nominally reduced RSA compared to NBW controls at the 22-26-year visit, this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: ELBW survivors exposed to ACS had lower RSA than NBW controls during their 30 s, suggestive of a decline in parasympathetic input to heart. ELBW survivors who received ACS may be particularly vulnerable to cardiovascular problems in later life. ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","betamethasone; contraceptive agent; corticosteroid derivative; psychotropic agent; corticosteroid; adult; Article; birth weight; body mass; breathing rate; comparative study; controlled study; depolarization; electrocardiogram; extremely low birth weight; female; follow up; gestational age; heart ventricle contraction; human; major clinical study; male; prenatal exposure; R wave; respiratory sinus arrhythmia; sex difference; social status; autonomic neuropathy; cholinergic system; electrocardiography; extremely low birth weight; longitudinal study; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; respiratory sinus arrhythmia; young adult; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia; Young Adult"
"The trypan blue cellular debris assay: a novel low-cost method for the rapid quantification of cell death","2019","Cell death is a common driver of human disease and is frequently studied in a variety of in vitro settings. There currently exists a range of commercially available assays to examine cell death, however, most are costly and require assay-specific experimental conditions that may not be suitable for many cell types. Here, we show that cellular debris occurring as a result of cell death can be used to quantify cell death using trypan blue. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the data generated using this technique are comparable to the widely-used lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)assay. Overall, we describe a novel application for trypan blue, a stain found in most biology laboratories, as a novel and cost-effective method for the quantification of cell death via staining of cell debris. ? 2019 The Author(s)","lactate dehydrogenase; trypan blue; adherent cell; Article; cell assay; cell death; cells by body anatomy; cellular debris assay; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; laboratory test; limit of quantitation; liver cell; non invasive procedure; priority journal; staining"
"A survey of oncology healthcare professionals’ knowledge and attitudes toward the use of music as a therapeutic tool in healthcare","2020","Background: Music as a therapeutic tool, defined as “music care,” can help manage physical and psychological symptoms in individuals with cancer. There is further need to understand interest level and the potential role of music care among health professionals working in the field of oncology. Purpose: To investigate knowledge of and attitudes toward the use of music as a therapeutic tool in cancer and palliative care, as well as to identify barriers associated with learning to use music in care among health professionals. Methods: Participants (N = 204), mostly nurses working in oncology and palliative care, completed a survey to assess awareness, knowledge, and attitudes toward the use of music in healthcare practice. Results: In total, 55.5% of participants reported being “somewhat or very knowledgeable” about how to apply/use music therapy for the management of symptoms or on how to make a music therapy referral or for any application of music care. Participants demonstrated a high interest level in learning how to incorporate music into practice (mean = 4.05; SD = 1.045). Conclusion: While there is generally high interest and perceived value among nurses in music care interventions, knowledge level about such interventions was low. The study has implications for knowledge translation and education needed to further support uptake and use of music care in nursing practice. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; awareness; cancer palliative therapy; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; female; health care personnel; health care survey; health personnel attitude; human; learning; male; malignant neoplasm; motivation; music therapy; paramedical personnel; patient referral; physician; practical nurse; priority journal; professional knowledge; radiotherapist; social worker"
"Relevance of non-targeted effects for radiotherapy and diagnostic radiology; A historical and conceptual analysis of key players","2019","Non-targeted effects (NTE) such as bystander effects or genomic instability have been known for many years but their significance for radiotherapy or medical diagnostic radiology are far from clear. Central to the issue are reported differences in the response of normal and tumour tissues to signals from directly irradiated cells. This review will discuss possible mechanisms and implications of these different responses and will then discuss possible new therapeutic avenues suggested by the analysis. Finally, the importance of NTE for diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine which stems from the dominance of NTE in the low-dose region of the dose-response curve will be presented. Areas such as second cancer induction and microenvironment plasticity will be discussed. ? 2019 by the authors.","protein p53; tumor protein; Article; bystander effect; cancer cell; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell communication; cell plasticity; gap junction; genetics; genomic instability; human; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; radiodiagnosis; radiotherapy; signal transduction; tumor microenvironment"
"Specificity of Acyl Chain Composition of Phosphatidylinositols","2019","Phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids have a predominance of a single molecular species present through the organism. In healthy mammals this molecular species is 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl (18:0/20:4) PI. Although the importance of PI lipids for cell physiology has long been appreciated, less is known about the biological role of enriching PI lipids with 18:0/20:4 acyl chains. In conditions with dysfunctional lipid metabolism, the predominance of 18:0/20:4 acyl chains is lost. Recently, molecular mechanisms underpinning the enrichment or alteration of these acyl chains in PI lipids have begun to emerge. In the majority of the cases a common feature is the presence of enzymes bearing substrate acyl chain specificity. However, in cancer cells, it has been shown that one (not the only) of the mechanisms responsible for the loss in this acyl chain enrichment is mutation on the transcription factor p53 gene, which is one of the most highly mutated genes in cancers. There is a compelling need for a global picture of the specificity of the acyl chain composition of PIs. This can be possible once high-resolution spatio-temporal information is gathered in a cellular context; which can ultimately lead to potential novel targets to combat conditions with altered PI acyl chain profiles. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Comorbidity Patterns of Psychiatric Conditions in Canadian Armed Forces Personnel [Mod?les de comorbidit? des affections psychiatriques chez les membres des Forces arm?es canadiennes]","2019","Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often accompanied by other mental health conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), substance misuse disorders, and anxiety disorders. The objective of the current study is to delineate classes of comorbidity and investigate predictors of comorbidity classes amongst a sample of Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Regular Force personnel. Methods: Latent class analyses (LCAs) were applied to cross-sectional data obtained between April and August 2013 from a nationally representative random sample of 6700 CAF Regular Force personnel who deployed to the mission in Afghanistan. Results: MDD was the most common diagnosis (8.0%), followed by PTSD (5.3%) and generalized anxiety disorder (4.7%). Of those with a mental health condition, LCA revealed 3 classes of comorbidity: a highly comorbid class (8.3%), a depressed-only class (4.6%), and an alcohol use–only class (3.1%). Multinomial logit regression showed that women (adjusted relative risk ratio [ARRR] = 2.77; 95% CI, 2.13 to 3.60; P < 0.01) and personnel reporting higher trauma exposure (ARRR = 4.18; 95% CI, 3.13 to 5.57; P < 0.01) were at increased risk of membership in the comorbid class compared to those without a mental health condition. When compared to those with no mental health condition, experiencing childhood abuse increased the risk of being in any comorbidity class. Conclusions: Results provide further evidence to support screening for and treatment of comorbid mental health conditions. The role of sex, childhood abuse, and combat deployment in determining class membership may also prove valuable for clinicians treating military-related mental health conditions. ?

"Tunable degradation of low-fouling carboxybetaine-hyaluronic acid hydrogels for applications in cell encapsulation","2019","Low-fouling hydrogels with tunable degradation rates and biochemical environments have the potential to improve adoptive cell therapies for cancer immunotherapy and regenerative medicine. To this end, we developed in situ gelling hydrogels from low-fouling poly(carboxybetaine-co-maleimide) (pCBM) random copolymers and thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH). pCBM-HA hydrogel enzymatic degradation rates were tuned 5 fold by altering pCBM composition (4, 11, and 16 maleimide mol%) and 2.3 fold by HA-SH concentration (1-2 wt%). pCBM-HA gels were low-fouling towards bovine serum albumin (BSA; adsorbed ?20 μg cm-2) and resisted fibroblast adhesion. To control pCBM-HA bioactivity, the cell adhesive peptide CGRGDS was immobilized on pCBM to promote fibroblast adhesion (39% decrease in circularity), which increased metabolic activity by ?50%. pCBM-HA modified with CGRGDS enhanced the metabolic activity of encapsulated T cells by ?21% compared to gels without HA, indicating their potential for immunotherapies. Low-fouling pCBM-HA hydrogels provide a vehicle with tunable degradation rates and biochemical environments for encapsulation applications in cell adoptive therapies. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Adhesion; Adhesives; Biodegradation; Cell culture; Degradation; Fibroblasts; Fouling; Gels; Hydrogels; Mammals; Metabolism; Organic acids; Bioactive hydrogels; Bovine serum albumins; Cancer immunotherapy; Carboxybetaine; Cell encapsulations; Enzymatic Degradation; Fibroblast adhesion; Hyaluronic acid hydrogels; Hyaluronic acid; betaine derivative; bovine serum albumin; cgrgds peptide; copolymer; hyaluronic acid; maleimide derivative; peptide; thiol derivative; unclassified drug; Article; biocompatibility; cell adhesion; cell encapsulation; cell metabolism; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; enzymatic degradation; fibroblast; hydrogel; protein immobilization"
"MiR-96-5p targets PTEN expression affecting radio-chemosensitivity of HNSCC cells","2019","Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading cancer worldwide. They are typically characterized by a high incidence of local recurrence, which is the most common cause of death in HNSCC patients. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in HNSCC and patients carrying TP53 mutations are associated with a higher probability to develop local recurrence. MiRNAs, which are among the mediators of the oncogenic activity of mt-p53 protein, emerge as an appealing tool for screening, diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We previously identified a signature of 12 miRNAs whose aberrant expression associated with TP53 mutations and was prognostic for HNSCC. Among them miR-96-5p emerges as an oncogenic miRNAs with prognostic significance in HNSCC. Methods: To evaluate the oncogenic role of miR-96-5p in a tumoral context, we performed colony formation, cell migration and cell viability assays in two HNSCC cell lines transfected for miR-96-5p mimic or inhibitor and treated with or without radio/chemo-therapy. In addition, to identify genes positively and negatively correlated to miR-96-5p expression in HNSCC, we analyzed the correlation between gene expression and miR-96-5p level in the subset of TCGA HNSCC tumors carrying missense TP53 mutations by Spearman and Pearson correlation. To finally identify targets of miR-96-5p, we used in silico analysis and the luciferase reporter assay to confirm PTEN as direct target. Results: Our data showed that overexpression of miR-96-5p led to increased cell migration and radio-resistance, chemotherapy resistance in HNSCC cells. In agreement with these results, among the most statistically significant pathways in which miR-96-5p is involved, are focal Adhesion, extracellular matrix organization and PI3K-Akt-mTOR-signaling pathway. As a direct target of miR-96-5p, we identified PTEN, the main negative regulator of PI3K-Akt signalling pathway activation. Conclusions: These results highlight a new mechanism of chemo/radio-resistance insurgence in HNSCC cells and support the possibility that miR-96-5p expression could be used as a novel promising biomarker to predict radiotherapy response and local recurrence development in HNSCC patients. In addition, the identification of pathways in which miR-96-5p is involved could contribute to develop new therapeutic strategies to overcome radio-resistance. ? 2019 The Author(s).","mammalian target of rapamycin; microRNA; microRNA 96 5p; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIRN96 microRNA, human; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; PTEN protein, human; Article; cancer resistance; cell migration; cell viability; chemosensitivity; cohort analysis; colony formation; controlled study; extracellular matrix; gene overexpression; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; missense mutation; priority journal; protein expression; protein targeting; signal transduction; 3' untranslated region; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; head and neck tumor; prognosis; radiation tolerance; survival analysis; tumor cell line; 3' Untranslated Regions; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; MicroRNAs; Prognosis; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Radiation Tolerance; Signal Transduction; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Survival Analysis"

"Deprescribing guidelines: An international symposium on development, implementation, research and health professional education","2019","Deprescribing is a clinically important and feasible innovation that ensures medication efficacy, reduces harms, and mitigates polypharmacy. It involves reducing doses or stopping medications that are not useful, no longer needed, or which may be causing harm. It may also involve changing to a safer agent or using non-pharmacological approaches for care instead. Clinical guidelines combined with behaviour changes (of health care providers (HCPs), the public, and health care decision-makers) are needed to integrate deprescribing into routine practice. Using rigorous international standards, the Bruy?re Research Institute Deprescribing Guidelines research team validated a ground-breaking deprescribing guideline methodology and developed or co-developed 5 evidence-based deprescribing guidelines. In March 2018, the team hosted an international symposium convening HCPs, researchers, public agencies, policymakers, and patient advocates in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. This 3-day symposium aimed to facilitate knowledge exchange amongst guideline developers, users, and the public; initiate partnerships and collaborations for new deprescribing guideline recommendations and effectiveness research; and to continue work on HCP deprescribing education activities. An interprofessional planning committee developed an overall agenda, and small groups worked on session objectives and formats for different components: methods for rigorous deprescribing guideline development, implementation experiences, research/evaluation experiences and educational needs. Through a series of keynote speakers, panel discussions, and small working groups, the symposium provided a forum for participants to meet one another, learn about their different experiences with deprescribing guidelines, and develop collaborations for future initiatives. One hundred thirty participants, from 10 countries and representing over 100 institutions and organizations took part. Symposium proceedings are presented in this issue of RSAP for sharing with the wider community engaged in the care of patients with problematic polypharmacy. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; article; behavior change; education; female; health care personnel; human; major clinical study; male; medication therapy management; Ontario; organization; polypharmacy; scientist; implementation science"
"Performance of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 as a biomarker in patients undergoing coronary angiography: Analytical and biological considerations","2019","Introduction and objective: Target lesion failure continues to limit the efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention despite advancements in stent design and medical therapy. Identification of biomarkers to risk stratify patients after percutaneous coronary intervention has the potential to focus therapies on cohorts with increased benefits. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 has been identified as a candidate biomarker. Herein, we evaluate biological variables which impact plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels and analytical characteristics which impact its utility as a biomarker in humans. Methods: Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was measured in 689 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels were measured. Clinical and procedural characteristics were collected in a prospective registry. Results: Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 analytical (CVa = 4.1%), intra-individual (CVi = 44.0%) and inter-individual (CVg = 118.6%) variations with reference change value of 122.3% were calculated. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels were elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, smokers, obesity, hypertension, and daytime variation in procedure and blood draw. Conclusion: Variation in plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels is influenced by multiple biological and procedural characteristics. The performance of plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is consistent with biomarkers in clinical use (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein) and its applicability is promising. ?

"An Epidemiological Study of Substance Use Disorders Among Emerging and Young Adults [Une ?tude ?pid?miologique des troubles d'utilisation de substances chez les adultes ?mergeants et jeunes]","2019","Objectives: We investigated the prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs) among emerging adults and quantified the extent to which emerging adults, compared with young adults, have increased odds for SUDs. Methods: Data were from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–Mental Health (CCHS-MH). Respondents were 15 to 39 y of age (n = 9228) and were categorized as: early emerging adults (15 to 22 y); late emerging adults (23 to 29 y); and, young adults (30 to 39 y). SUDs [alcohol or drug abuse/dependence (AAD or DAD)] were measured using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. The prevalence of SUDs was compared across age groups, and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed from logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographic and health covariates. Analyses were weighted to maintain representativeness to the Canadian population. Results: The prevalence of AAD was 8.0%, 6.6%, and 2.7% for early emerging adults, late emerging adults, and young adults, respectively. For DAD, the prevalence was 6.4%, 3.6%, and 1.3%. After covariate adjustment, early and late emerging adults had greater odds of reporting AAD (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.2 to 4.9 and OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.6 to 3.4, respectively) or DAD (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 2.5 to 7.0 and OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 4.1, respectively) compared with young adults. Differences between early and late emerging adults were not significant. Conclusion: Emerging adults are at increased odds for SUDs. Lack of differences between early and late emerging adults provide evidence of the extension of emerging adulthood into the late 20s. Findings have implications for the provision of screening and treatment of SUDs during this developmental period. ?

"Flexible piecewise linear model for investigating dose-response relationship in meta-analysis: Methodology, examples, and comparison","2019","Objectives: Dose-response meta-analysis (DRMA) is widely employed in establishing the potential dose-response relationship between continuous exposures and disease outcomes. However, there is no valid DRMA method readily for discrete exposures, especially when the possible dose-response trend not likely to be linear. We proposed a piecewise linear DRMA model as a solution to this issue. Methods: We illustrated the methodology of piecewise linear model in both one-stage DRMA approach and two-stage DRMA approach. The method by testing the equality of slopes of each piecewise was employed to judge if there is “piecewise effect” against a simple linear trend. We then used sleep (continuous exposure) and parity (discrete exposure) data as examples to illustrate how to apply the model in DRMA using the Stata code attached. We also empirically compared the slopes of piecewise linear model with simple linear as well as restricted cubic spline model. Results: Both one-stage and two-stage piecewise linear DRMA model fitted well in our examples, and the results were similar. Obvious “piecewise effects” were detected in both the two samples by the method we used. In our example, the new model showed a better fitting effect and practical, reliable results compared to the simple linear model, while similar results for to restricted cubic spline model. Conclusion: Piecewise linear function is a valid and straightforward method for DRMA and can be used for discrete exposures, especially when the simple linear function is under fitted. It represents a superior model to linear model in DRMA and may be an alternative model to the nonlinear model. ? 2019 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","algorithm; Article; calculation; correlation coefficient; dose response; dose response meta analysis model; least square analysis; mathematical analysis; mortality; priority journal; regression analysis; reliability; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; sleep time; statistical model; comparative study; human; meta analysis (topic); Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Linear Models; Meta-Analysis as Topic"
"Biological and psychosocial predictors of anxiety worsening in the postpartum period: A longitudinal study","2019","Background: As many as 20% of women will experience an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period. Women with pre-existing anxiety disorders are at increased risk of worsening during this time, yet little is known about its predictors. Study Aim: To investigate the psychosocial and biological risk factors for anxiety worsening in the postpartum in women with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Methods: Thirty-five (n = 35) pregnant women with pre-existing DSM-5 anxiety disorders were enrolled in this prospective study investigating the psychosocial (e.g., childhood trauma, intolerance of uncertainty, depression) and biological risk factors (e.g. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) for anxiety worsening in the postpartum period. Anxiety worsening was defined as an increase of ?50% or greater on Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores from the third trimester of pregnancy (32.94 ± 3.35 weeks) to six weeks postpartum. Results: Intolerance of uncertainty, depressive symptom severity, and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms present in pregnancy were significant predictors of anxiety worsening in the postpartum. Limitations: Sample heterogeneity and limited sample size may affect study generalizability. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to investigate psychosocial and biological risk factors for anxiety worsening in the postpartum in women with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Continued research investigating these risk factors is needed to elucidate whether they differ from women experiencing new-onset anxiety disorders in the perinatal period, and those in non-puerperal groups. Identifying these risk factors can guide the development of screening measures for early and accurate symptom detection. This can lead to the implementation of appropriate interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of perinatal anxiety worsening. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","biological factor; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; biological marker; C reactive protein; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; TNF protein, human; tumor necrosis factor; adult; agoraphobia; anxiety disorder; Article; clinical article; depression; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; DSM-5; female; general condition deterioration; Hamilton Anxiety Scale; human; limit of detection; longitudinal study; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; obsessive compulsive disorder; panic; priority journal; prospective study; psychological aspect; puerperium; risk factor; social phobia; third trimester pregnancy; adolescent; anxiety disorder; blood; child; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; metabolism; postnatal depression; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnant woman; psychological rating scale; psychology; risk factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Child; Depression, Postpartum; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Longitudinal Studies; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Pregnant Women; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Young Adult"
"Inflammation, depression and cardiovascular disease in women: The role of the immune system across critical reproductive events","2019","Women are at increased risk for developing depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) across the lifespan and their comorbidity is associated with adverse outcomes that contribute significantly to rates of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Immune-system activity has been implicated in the etiology of both depression and CVD, but it is unclear how inflammation contributes to sex differences in this comorbidity. This narrative review provides an updated synthesis of research examining the association of inflammation with depression and CVD, and their comorbidity in women. Recent research provides evidence of pro-inflammatory states and sex differences associated with alterations in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and the serotonin/kynurenine pathway, that likely contribute to the development of depression and CVD. Changes to inflammatory cytokines in relation to reproductive periods of hormonal fluctuation (i.e. the menstrual cycle, perinatal period and menopause) are highlighted and provide a greater understanding of the unique vulnerability women experience in developing both depressed mood and adverse cardiovascular events. Inflammatory biomarkers hold substantial promise when combined with a patient’s reproductive and mental health history to aid in the prediction, identification and treatment of the women most at risk for CVD and depression. However, more research is needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation in relation to their comorbidity, and how these findings can be translated to improve women’s health. ?

"Perceived Barriers and Existing Challenges in Participation of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: “He Did Not Understand and No One Else Seemed to Understand Him”","2019","Social participation is one of the most important predictors of the children’s physical and mental health. Although it is evidenced that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have restricted social participation, it is unclear which factors play a significant role. This research aimed to uncover perceived barriers of social participation by involving 26 stakeholders including parents of children with ASD, youth with ASD, and clinicians working with individuals with ASD in focus groups and interviews. Using thematic analysis yielded three themes including (a) difficulty understanding social situations; (b) maladaptive behaviours; and (c) conflicting priorities and restricted nature of training. This project was the first study to involve key stakeholders to highlight barriers of social participation among individuals with ASD. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; autism; childhood disease; clinical article; clinician; conflict; female; human; interview; maladjustment; male; parent; patient participation; priority journal; social participation; autism; child; mental health; psychology; Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Social Participation"
"Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Male Sex Hormones and Sperm Quality: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to establish the effects of bariatric surgery on male sex hormones, sperm parameters, and sexual function. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus from database inception through June 2018. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they examined the effect of bariatric surgery on male sex hormones and sperm parameters in patients with obesity. Primary outcomes of interest were sex hormones and sperm quality. Secondary outcome was sexual function (International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score). Pooled estimates were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. A total of 28 cohort studies with 1022 patients were identified from 3896 potentially relevant citations. Both free and calculated testosterone levels were significantly increased after bariatric surgery (mean difference (MD) ? 7.47?nM, 95% CI ? 8.62 to ? 6.31, p < 0.001 and MD ? 0.05?nM, 95% CI ? 0.07 to ? 0.02, p < 0.001, respectively). Consistent with the increase in testosterone, LH, FSH, and SHBG levels were also significantly increased after surgery. In contrast, free and total estradiol and prolactin levels were significantly decreased after bariatric surgery. From studies that reported the IIEF score, bariatric surgery led to a significant increase in erectile function after surgery (MD ? 0.46, 95% CI ? 0.89 to ? 0.02, p = 0.04). However, bariatric surgery did not affect sperm quality, DHEA, androstenedione, and inhibin B levels. Sustained weight-loss induced by bariatric surgery had a significant effect on increasing male sex hormones and decreasing female sex hormones in male patients with obesity. However, sperm quality and function were not improved after surgery. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","androstenedione; estradiol; follitropin; inhibin B; luteinizing hormone; prasterone; prolactin; sex hormone; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; sex hormone; testosterone; bariatric surgery; biliopancreatic bypass; body weight loss; follow up; gastric banding; gastroplasty; human; International Index of Erectile Function; meta analysis; obesity; priority journal; Review; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; sexual function; sleeve gastrectomy; sperm quality; spermatozoon density; spermatozoon motility; systematic review; blood; cohort analysis; female; male; morbid obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; semen analysis; Bariatric Surgery; Cohort Studies; Female; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Male; Obesity; Obesity, Morbid; Semen Analysis; Testosterone; Weight Loss"
"Explicit emotional memory biases in mood disorders: A systematic review","2019","Research suggests that major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are both associated with unique emotional memory (EM) biases. To better elucidate the EM phenotypes of these disorders, we systematically reviewed the literature on non-autobiographical explicit EM biases in individuals with MDD and BD compared to healthy controls. The following databases were searched: Cochrane, Embase, HAPI, LILACs, Medline, PsycInfo and Web of Science. Grey literature and hand searches were also performed. Fourteen studies met full eligibility criteria. Eleven studies included data from an MDD sample (10 during acute depression, 1 during euthymia) and 3 studies included data from a BD sample (2 during acute mood episodes, 1 during euthymia). Only 3 of the studies in acute depression revealed a negative explicit EM bias. One study in MDD during euthymia revealed an EM deficit for negative stimuli. One of the two studies in BD (type I; BD-I) during an acute mood episode revealed a positive explicit EM bias, while the other showed no bias. One study in BD during euthymia showed an EM deficit for negative stimuli. Overall, this review concludes that current empirical evidence does not readily support the existence of an explicit EM bias in MDD during acute depression. The identification and implications of potential moderating factors on explicit EM performance in MDD and BD during both illness stages are discussed. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","bipolar disorder; comorbidity; disease classification; disease severity; emotional memory; empirical research; explicit memory; human; major depression; memory bias; mood disorder; panic; priority journal; Review; systematic review"
"Multicentre, randomised clinical trial of paediatric concussion assessment of rest and exertion (PedCARE): A study to determine when to resume physical activities following concussion in children","2019","Introduction Rest until symptom-free, followed by a progressive stepwise return to activities, is often prescribed in the management of paediatric concussions. Recent evidence suggests prolonged rest may hinder recovery, and early resumption of physical activity may be associated with more rapid recovery postconcussion. The primary objective is to determine whether the early reintroduction of non-contact physical activity beginning 72 hours postinjury reduces postconcussive symptoms at 2 weeks in children following an acute concussion as compared with a rest until asymptomatic protocol. Methods and analysis This study is a randomised clinical trial across three Canadian academic paediatric emergency departments. A total of 350 participants, aged 10-17.99 years, who present within 48 hours of an acute concussion, will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the study intervention protocol (resumption of physical activity 72 hours postconcussion even if experiencing symptoms) or physical rest until fully asymptomatic. Participants will document their daily physical and cognitive activities. Follow-up questionnaires will be completed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks postinjury. Compliance with the intervention will be measured using an accelerometer (24 hours/day for 14 days). Symptoms will be measured using the validated Health and Behaviour Inventory. A linear multivariable model, adjusting for site and prognostically important covariates, will be tested to determine differences between groups. The proposed protocol adheres to the RCT-CONSORT guidelines. Discussion This trial will determine if early resumption of non-contact physical activity following concussion reduces the burden of concussion and will provide healthcare professionals with the evidence by which to recommend the best timing of reintroducing physical activities.

"The Potential Effect of the Psychiatric Clerkship and Contact-Based Hypothesis on Explicit and Implicit Stigmatizing Attitudes of Canadian Medical Students Towards Mental Illness","2019","Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess if having completed a psychiatric clerkship or having increased exposure to mental illness in general was associated with reduced explicit and implicit stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness in undergraduate medical students. Methods: A secondary analysis of data specific to medical students from McMaster University was completed. Data were obtained through a cross-sectional survey administered electronically. It consisted of a demographic questionnaire, the Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers (OMS-HC) 12-item survey, and an Implicit Association Test (IAT). The OMS-HC was used as a measure of explicit stigmatizing attitudes, whereas the IAT was used as a measure of implicit bias. All analyses were completed using Stata/IC 15 and were two-tailed with significance defined as p < 0.05. Results: Individuals that self-reported either having had a mental illness or diagnosis by a health care professional had significantly lower levels of explicit stigma. Final-year medical students had significantly lower levels of implicit stigmatizing attitudes than first-year medical students. Neither having completed a psychiatric clerkship nor having a close relationship with someone experiencing a mental illness was significantly associated with the explicit or implicit stigmatizing attitudes of medical students. Conclusion: More years in medical school and self-identifying or receiving a diagnosis of mental illness are associated with reduced stigmatizing attitudes, whereas having completed the psychiatric clerkship and having a close relationship with an individual experiencing mental illness were not. This study suggests that the psychiatric clerkship may have limited impact on the stigmatizing attitudes of medical students. ? 2019, Academic Psychiatry.",""
"Rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer","2019","BACKGROUND Ambulatory patients receiving systemic cancer therapy are at varying risk for venous thromboembolism. However, the benefit of thromboprophylaxis in these patients is uncertain. METHODS In this double-blind, randomized trial involving high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer (Khorana score of ?2, on a scale from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of venous thromboembolism), we randomly assigned patients without deep-vein thrombosis at screening to receive rivaroxaban (at a dose of 10 mg) or placebo daily for up to 180 days, with screening every 8 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of objectively confirmed proximal deep-vein thrombosis in a lower limb, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis in an upper limb or distal deep-vein thrombosis in a lower limb, and death from venous thromboembolism and was assessed up to day 180. In a prespecified supportive analysis involving the same population, the same end point was assessed during the intervention period (first receipt of trial agent to last dose plus 2 days). The primary safety end point was major bleeding. RESULTS Of 1080 enrolled patients, 49 (4.5%) had thrombosis at screening and did not undergo randomization. Of the 841 patients who underwent randomization, the primary end point occurred in 25 of 420 patients (6.0%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 37 of 421 (8.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 1.09; P=0.10) in the period up to day 180. In the prespecified intervention-period analysis, the primary end point occurred in 11 patients (2.6%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 27 (6.4%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.80). Major bleeding occurred in 8 of 405 patients (2.0%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 4 of 404 (1.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 0.59 to 6.49). CONCLUSIONS In high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer, treatment with rivaroxaban did not result in a significantly lower incidence of venous thromboembolism or death due to venous thromboembolism in the 180-day trial period. During the intervention period, rivaroxaban led to a substantially lower incidence of such events, with a low incidence of major bleeding. ? 2019 Massachusetts Medical Society.","placebo; rivaroxaban; antineoplastic agent; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; rivaroxaban; adult; aged; ambulatory care; Article; bleeding; controlled study; death; deep vein thrombosis; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; high risk population; human; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mass screening; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; scoring system; thrombosis prevention; venous thromboembolism; bleeding; chemically induced; clinical trial; complication; incidence; intention to treat analysis; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; neoplasm; oral drug administration; phase 3 clinical trial; risk factor; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; very elderly; Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Double-Blind Method; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Female; Hemorrhage; Humans; Incidence; Intention to Treat Analysis; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Rivaroxaban; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism"
"Paediatric vision screening by non-healthcare volunteers: Evidence based practices","2019","Background: The purpose of this study was to test the sensitivity and specificity of eight undergraduate volunteer examiners conducting vision screening tests in a community setting, in order to determine if non-eye care professionals were able to be trained to an appropriate level of skill. Methods: Eight undergraduate volunteer examiners were trained to conduct vision screening tests to address a gap in pediatric community eye care. Phase I of the study was implemented in the pediatric ophthalmology clinic, and phase II was conducted in nine local schools. Phase I consisted of 40 h of training for each volunteer regarding specific vision tests. Phase II consisted of screening children at nine local schools. Results: A total of 690 children from nine local schools were screened by both the volunteer examiners and the optometrist during the course of this study. Volunteer examiners had a screening sensitivity of 0.80 (95%CI 0.66-0.90) and screening specificity of 0.75 (95%CI 0.71-0.78) when compared to the study optometrist. The overall accuracy of volunteer examiners was 75%. The resulting positive likelihood ratio was 3.24 (95%CI 2.6-3.9), indicating that a child with vision impairment was 3.2 times more likely to fail the vision test performed by the volunteer examiners compared to a child with no vision impairment. Conclusions: Non-healthcare professionals can be trained to an acceptable degree of accuracy to perform vision screening tests on children, which may assist in mitigating existing gaps in paediatric eye care. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; child; clinical competence; education; evidence based practice; female; human; male; optometry; organization and management; paramedical personnel; pediatrics; predictive value; preschool child; prospective study; reproducibility; school health service; sensitivity and specificity; standards; student; vision test; visual acuity; visual disorder; volunteer; Adolescent; Allied Health Personnel; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Competence; Evidence-Based Practice; Female; Humans; Male; Optometry; Pediatrics; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; School Health Services; Sensitivity and Specificity; Students; Vision Disorders; Vision Screening; Visual Acuity; Volunteers"
"An intelligent quality-based approach to fusing multi-source possibilistic information","2020","Recently, Yager and Petry were proposing a quality-based methodology to combine data provided by multiple probabilistic sources to improve the quality of information for decision-makers. This paper offers a sort of companion paper that adapts this methodology to possibilistic sources. Possibility theory is particularly well suited to cope with incomplete information from poor-data sources. The methodology and algorithms used for the probabilistic approach are adapted for the possibilistic case. Both approaches are then compared by the means of a numerical example and four experimental benchmark datasets: one, the IRIS data set, being data-poorer than the three other ones (Diabetes dataset, Glass dataset and Liver-disorder dataset). A vector representation is introduced for a possibility distribution as in the probabilistic case and, the Gini's formulation of entropy is being used. However, the Gini's entropy has to be used differently than with the probabilistic case. This has an impact on the selection of subsets. A fusion scheme is designed to select the best-quality subsets according to two information quality factors: quantity of information and source credibility. Results obtained from comparison of both approaches on the four experimental benchmarks confirm the superiority of the possibilistic approach in the presence of information scarcity or incompleteness. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decision making; Entropy; Information fusion; Experimental benchmarks; Possibilistic informations; Possibility distributions; Possibility theory; Probabilistic approaches; Quality of information; Source credibilities; Uncertainty; Probability distributions"
"Qualitative study of cardiologists' perceptions of factors influencing clinical practice decisions","2019","Background Healthcare costs are increasing in the USA and Canada and a substantial portion of health spending is devoted to services that do not improve health outcomes. Efforts to reduce waste by adopting evidence-based clinical practice guideline recommendations have had limited success. We sought insight into improving health system efficiency through understanding cardiologists' perceptions of factors that influence clinical decision-making. Methods In this descriptive qualitative study, we conducted in-depth interviews with 18 American and 3 Canadian cardiologists. We used conventional content analysis including inductive and deductive approaches for data analysis and mapped findings to the ecological systems framework. Results Physicians reported that major determinants of practice included interpersonal interactions with peers, patients and administrators; financial incentives and system factors. Patients' insurance status represented an important consideration for some cardiologists. Other major influences included time constraints, fear of litigation (less prominent in Canada), a sense that their obligation was never to miss any underlying pathology, and patient demands. The need to bring income into their health system influenced American cardiologists' practice; personal income implications influenced Canadian cardiologists' practice. Cardiologists reported that knowledge limitations and logistical challenges limit their ability to assist patients with cost considerations. All these considerations were more influential than guidelines; some cardiologists expressed a high level of scepticism regarding guidelines. Conclusions Clinical decision-making by cardiologists is shaped by individual, interpersonal, organisational, environmental, financial and sociopolitical influences and only to a limited extent by guideline recommendations. Successful strategies to achieve efficient, evidence-based care will require addressing socioecological influences on decision-making. ? 2019 Author(s).","administrative personnel; adult; article; Canada; cardiologist; clinical decision making; content analysis; data analysis; ecosystem; fear; health care cost; human; insurance; interview; law suit; perception; personal income; practice guideline; qualitative research"
"Is Nonoperative Management the Best First-line Option for High-grade Renal trauma? A Systematic Review","2019","Context: The management of high-grade (Grade IV–V) renal injuries remains controversial. There has been an increase in the use of (NOM) but limited data exists comparing outcomes with open surgical exploration. Objective: To conduct a systematic review to determine if NOM is the best first-line option for high-grade renal trauma in terms of safety and effectiveness. Evidence acquisition: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for all relevant publications, without time or language limitations. The primary harm outcome was overall mortality and the primary benefit outcome was renal preservation rate. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and complication rate. Single-arm studies were included as there were few comparative studies. Only studies with more than 50 patients were included. Data were narratively synthesised in light of methodological and clinical heterogeneity. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed. Evidence synthesis: Seven nonrandomised comparative and four single-arm studies were selected for data extraction. Seven hundred and eighty-seven patients were included from the comparative studies with 535 patients in the NOM group and 252 in the open surgical exploration group. A further 825 patients were included from single-arm studies. Results from comparative studies: overall mortality: NOM (0–3%), open surgical exploration (0–29%); renal preservation rate: NOM (84–100%), open surgical exploration (0–82%); complication rate: NOM (5–32%), open surgical exploration (10–76%). Overall mortality and renal preservation rate were significantly better in the NOM group whereas there was no statistical difference with regard to complication rate. Length of hospital stay was found be significantly reduced in the NOM group. Patients in the open surgical exploration group were more likely to have Grade V injuries, have a lower systolic blood pressure, and higher injury severity score on admission. Conclusions: No randomised controlled trials were identified and significant heterogeneity existed with regard to outcome reporting. However, NOM appeared to be safe and effective in a stable patient with a higher renal preservation rate, a shorter length of stay, and a comparable complication rate to open surgical exploration. Overall mortality was higher in the open surgical exploration group, though this was likely due to selection bias. Patient summary: The data of this systematic review suggest nonoperative management continues to be favoured to surgical exploration in the management of high-grade renal trauma whenever possible. However, comparisons between both interventions are difficult as patients who have surgery are often more seriously injured than those managed nonoperatively, and existing studies do not report on outcomes consistently. ? 2017 European Association of UrologyThe data of this systematic review suggest nonoperative management continues to be favoured to open surgical exploration in the management of high-grade renal trauma. The study suggests that nonoperative management resulted in a higher renal preservation rate, shorter length of stay, and similar complication rates compared with open surgical exploration. However, limitations exist related to selection bias and outcome heterogeneity of included studies. ? 2017 European Association of Urology","clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; comparative study; conservative treatment; evidence based practice; hospital admission; human; injury scale; kidney injury; kidney preservation; length of stay; mortality rate; open surgical exploration; outcome assessment; patient safety; primary health care; Review; risk factor; surgical technique; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; treatment outcome; ureteral stenting; blunt trauma; conservative treatment; controlled clinical trial (topic); diagnostic imaging; injury; kidney; mortality; procedures; surgery; Conservative Treatment; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Kidney; Length of Stay; Mortality; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Wounds, Nonpenetrating"
"Exploring pathways to mental healthcare for urban Aboriginal young people: A qualitative interview study","2019","Objectives: To explore the perceptions of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service (ACCHS) staff involved in providing mental healthcare to Aboriginal young people of the current and ideal pathways to mental healthcare for urban Aboriginal young people attending ACCHSs, and to identify what additional supports staff may need to provide optimal mental healthcare to Aboriginal young people. Design: Qualitative interview study conducted during May 2016-2017. Setting: Primary care, at two ACCHSs participating in the Study of Environment on Aboriginal Resilience and Child Health in New South Wales. Participants: Purposive sampling of staff involved in mental healthcare pathways of Aboriginal young people, including general practitioners (GPs), nurses and Aboriginal Health Workers (AHWs). Results: All individuals approached for interview (n=21) participated in the study. Four overarching themes and seven sub-themes were identified: availability and use of tools in practice (valuing training and desire for tools and established pathways), targeting the ideal care pathway (initiating care and guiding young people through care), influencing the care pathway (adversities affecting access to care and adapting the care pathway) and assessing future need (appraising service availability). Conclusions: Participants desired screening tools, flexible guidelines and training for healthcare providers to support pathways to mental healthcare for Aboriginal young people. Both GPs and AHWs were considered key in identifying children at risk and putting young people onto a pathway to receive appropriate mental healthcare. AHWs were deemed important in keeping young people on the care pathway, and participants felt care pathways could be improved with the addition of dedicated child and adolescent AHWs. The ACCHSs were highlighted as essential to providing culturally appropriate care for Aboriginal young people experiencing mental health problems, and funding for mental health specialists to be based at the ACCHSs was considered a priority. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; Article; attitude to health; general practitioner; health care; health care access; health care availability; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; indigenous people; mental health; nurse; practice guideline; qualitative research; semi structured interview; transcultural care; urban health"
"The role of the endocannabinoid system in female reproductive tissues","2019","There has been increasing interest in the role of endocannabinoids as critical modulators of the female reproductive processes. Endocannabinoids are natural ligands of cannabinoid, vanilloid, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Together with their receptors, enzymes and downstream signaling targets, they form the endocannabinoid system (ECS). While the ECS is known to modulate pain and neurodevelopment, it is also known to impact the female reproductive system where it affects folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation, and ovarian endocrine secretion. In addition, the ECS affects oviductal embryo transport, implantation, uterine decidualization and placentation. There is a complex interplay between the ECS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, and an intricate crosstalk between the ECS and steroid hormone production and secretion. Exogenous cannabinoids, derived from plants such as Cannabis sativa, are also ligands for cannabinoid receptors. These have been shown to have clinical outcomes related to ECS dysregulation, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, along with adverse effects on female reproduction. The aim of this review is to describe and discuss data from human, animal, and in vitro studies that support the important role of the endocannabinoid system in female reproductive tissues and processes. In particular, we will discuss some of the mechanisms by which endocannabinoid signaling can affect ovarian function in both physiological and pathophysiological states. ? 2019 The Author(s).","2 arachidonoylglycerol; anandamide; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid 2 receptor; dronabinol; endocannabinoid; G protein coupled receptor; protein GPR119; protein GPR55; tetrahydrocannabinolic acid; unclassified drug; endocannabinoid; adipose tissue; antineoplastic activity; biosynthesis; drug degradation; drug transport; female genital system; human; hypothalamus hypophysis system; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; ovary cancer; ovary function; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; priority journal; reproduction; Review; signal transduction; synthesis; animal; female; metabolism; ovary; ovary disease; Animals; Endocannabinoids; Female; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Ovarian Diseases; Ovary; Reproduction"
"Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: BODY-Q","2019","Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are questionnaires designed to measure outcomes of importance to patients from their perspective. The BODY-Q is a PROM designed to measure outcomes in weight loss and/or body contouring surgery. To develop the BODY-Q, a literature review, 63 patient interviews, 22 cognitive interviews, and input from 9 clinical experts were used to develop a conceptual framework that covers 3 broad domains: appearance concerns, health-related quality of life, and experience of care. For each aspect of the framework, multiple independently functioning scales were developed. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; bariatric surgery; body contouring; body weight loss; conceptual framework; female; human; interview; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; personal experience; quality of life; review; bariatric surgery; body weight loss; obesity; patient satisfaction; physiology; questionnaire; standards; Bariatric Surgery; Humans; Obesity; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Weight Loss"
"Effects of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by GAP stage","2019","We conducted a post hoc analysis to assess the potential impact of GAP (gender, age, physiology) stage on the treatment effect of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Outcomes were compared in patients at GAP stage I versus II/III at baseline in the INPULSIS? trials. At baseline, 500 patients were at GAP stage I (nintedanib 304, placebo 196), 489 were at GAP stage II (nintedanib 296, placebo 193) and 71 were at GAP stage III (nintedanib 38, placebo 33). In nintedanibtreated patients, the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) was similar in patients at GAP stage I and GAP stage II/III at baseline (-110.1 and -116.6 mL.year-1, respectively), and in both subgroups was lower than in placebo-treated patients (-218.5 and -227.6 mL.year-1, respectively) (treatment-by-time-by-subgroup interaction p=0.92). In the nintedanib group, the number of deaths was 43.8% of those predicted based on GAP stage (35 versus 79.9). In the placebo group, the number of deaths was 59.8% of those predicted based on GAP stage (33 versus 55.2). In conclusion, data from the INPULSIS? trials suggest that nintedanib has a similar beneficial effect on the rate of FVC decline in patients at GAP stage I versus II/III at baseline. ?

"Secretory carcinoma of the major salivary gland: Provincial population-based analysis of clinical behavior and outcomes","2019","Background: Our aim was to identify the number of cases of secretory carcinoma (SC) of the major salivary gland in a population-based cohort and review its clinical behavior with long-term follow-up. Methods: All malignant salivary gland tumors (MSGTs) diagnosed between 1980 and 2014 were assessed for histological features compatible with SC and 140 were selected for further analysis. Results: Twenty two new cases of SC were identified, 19 of which were originally classified as acinic cell carcinoma, and 3 as adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS). Lymph node involvement was less common in SC tumors (5%) than in the control group (11%). Disease recurrence was seen less frequently in SC (9%) than the control group (20%). Mean disease-free survival was 192 months for SC compared with 162 months for controls (P = 0.15). Conclusion: The clinical course of SC is typically indolent with a low risk of relapse not significantly different from other low-grade MSGT. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","acinar cell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma; adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified; adult; Article; cancer diagnosis; clear cell carcinoma; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; colloid carcinoma; disease free survival; female; follow up; histopathology; human; lymph node; male; middle aged; mucoepidermoid tumor; outcome assessment; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; salivary gland carcinoma; secretory carcinoma of the major salivary gland"
"Higher postinduction infliximab serum trough levels are associated with healing of fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease in children","2019","Background There is some evidence in adults that higher serum infliximab (IFX) levels are needed to adequately treat fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease (CD). However, data in children are lacking. We aimed to determine postinduction serum trough IFX levels that are associated with healing of fistulizing perianal CD (PCD) at week 24. Methods In a multicenter inception cohort study, consecutive children younger than age 17 years with fistulizing perianal CD treated with IFX between April 2014 and June 2017 who had serum trough IFX titers measured before the fourth infusion were included. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated to determine the best cutoff to predict fistula healing. Results A total of 667 children with Crohn's disease were recruited, with 85 (12.7%) patients diagnosed with fistulizing PCD. There were 27 of 52 (52%) children in whom pre-fourth infusion IFX levels were measured (mean age, 12.57 ± 5.12 years). At week 24, 14 of 27 (52%) patients responded with healing/healed PCD, whereas the rest had ongoing active fistulizing disease. The median IFX pre-fourth dose level in the responders was 12.7 ug/mL, compared with 5.4 ug/mL in the active disease group (P = 0.02). There was a strong correlation between IFX levels and healing of fistulizing PCD at week 24 (r = 0.65; P < 0.001). The AUROC was 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.97; P = 0.007) for pre-fourth IFX level to predict response of fistulizing PCD at week 24, and a level of 12.7 ug/mL best predicted fistula healing.

"Diet patterns in an ethnically diverse pediatric population with celiac disease and chronic gastrointestinal complaints","2019","Introduction: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease requiring lifelong adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD). The GFD has significant nutritional limitations which may result in poor diet quality (DQ). We hypothesized that biopsy-proven children with CD (CCD) would have dietary patterns characterized by high saturated fat/simple sugar intake with a low micronutrient density contributing to lower DQ when compared to children with mild-gastrointestinal complaints (GI-CON). In addition, we hypothesized that ethnicity may further impact DQ. Methods: Socio-demographic (age, CD duration, parent/child ethnicity, education), household characteristics, anthropometric, dietary intake (24-h recalls), gastrointestinal pain and adherence was collected in CCD (n = 243) and GI-CON (n = 148). Dietary patterns were determined using k-mean Cluster Analysis. Results: GI-CON had significantly lower DQ than CCD (p < 0.001). Most CCD and GI-CON (>80%) had dietary patterns characterized by1) Western Diet (Cluster 1: %BMR: 110–150, low DQ, high fat, moderate CHO, high sodium) and 2) High Fat-Western Diet (Cluster 2: %BMR:130–150, low DQ, high Fat, high processed meats, high fat dairy products, CHO. Fewer children (<20%) had Prudent, Lower Fat/High Carbohydrate dietary patterns (% BMR:100–150, higher DQ, lower fat/sodium, higher CHO) with a greater proportion of non-Caucasian CCD consuming a Prudent dietary pattern. Seventy-seven percent and 37.5% of CCD and GI-CON, respectively, did not meet estimated average requirements for folate (p < 0.001). Conclusions: CCD and GI-CON have predominantly Western dietary patterns with low DQ, particularly GI-CON. Non-caucasian CCD consume more prudent dietary patterns with higher DQ. Nutrition education is warranted to ensure optimal DQ in children with chronic gastrointestinal diseases. ? 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","folic acid; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase antibody; riboflavin; selenium; trace element; vitamin D; adolescent; anthropometric parameters; Article; basal metabolic rate; biochemical analysis; body mass; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; celiac disease; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; dietary intake; dietary pattern; fat intake; female; follow up; gastrointestinal pain; gastrointestinal symptom; gluten free diet; glycemic index; glycemic load; Healthy Eating Index Score; histology; histopathology; human; human tissue; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; intestine biopsy; lipid diet; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nutritional assessment; nutritional parameters; PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale; questionnaire; scoring system; self report; sodium intake; sugar intake; Western diet"
"Endovascular Thrombus Removal for Acute Iliofemoral Deep Vein Thrombosis: Analysis from a Stratified Multicenter Randomized Trial","2019","Background: The ATTRACT trial (Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal with Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis) previously reported that pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) did not prevent postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis. In the current analysis, we examine the effect of PCDT in ATTRACT patients with iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis. Methods: Within a large multicenter randomized trial, 391 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis involving the iliac or common femoral veins were randomized to PCDT with anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone (No-PCDT) and were followed for 24 months to compare short-term and long-term outcomes. Results: Between 6 and 24 months, there was no difference in the occurrence of PTS (Villalta scale ?5 or ulcer: 49% PCDT versus 51% No-PCDT; risk ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.15; P=0.59). PCDT led to reduced PTS severity as shown by lower mean Villalta and Venous Clinical Severity Scores (P<0.01 for comparisons at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and fewer patients with moderate-or-severe PTS (Villalta scale ?10 or ulcer: 18% versus 28%; risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.94; P=0.021) or severe PTS (Villalta scale ?15 or ulcer: 8.7% versus 15%; risk ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-1.01; P=0.048; and Venous Clinical Severity Score ?8: 6.6% versus 14%; risk ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.87; P=0.013). From baseline, PCDT led to greater reduction in leg pain and swelling (P<0.01 for comparisons at 10 and 30 days) and greater improvement in venous disease-specific quality of life (Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study Quality of Life unit difference 5.6 through 24 months, P=0.029), but no difference in generic quality of life (P>0.2 for comparisons of SF-36 mental and physical component summary scores through 24 months). In patients having PCDT versus No-PCDT, major bleeding within 10 days occurred in 1.5% versus 0.5% (P=0.32), and recurrent venous thromboembolism over 24 months was observed in 13% versus 9.2% (P=0.21). Conclusions: In patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, PCDT did not influence the occurrence of PTS or recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, PCDT significantly reduced early leg symptoms and, over 24 months, reduced PTS severity scores, reduced the proportion of patients who developed moderate-or-severe PTS, and resulted in greater improvement in venous disease-specific quality of life.

"IL-15 and IFN-γ signal through the ERK pathway to inhibit HCV replication, independent of type I IFN signaling","2019","Despite effective new treatments for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, development of drug resistance, safety concerns and cost are remaining challenges. More importantly, there is no vaccine available against hepatitis C infection. Recent data suggest that there is a strong correlation between spontaneous HCV clearance and human NK cell function, particularly IFN-γ production. Further, IL-15 has innate antiviral activity and is also one of the main factors that activates NK cells to produce IFN-γ. To examine whether IL-15 and IFN-γ have direct antiviral activity against HCV, Huh7.5 cells were treated with either IFN-γ or IL-15 prior to HCV infection. Our data demonstrate that IFN-γ and IL-15 block HCV replication in vitro. Additionally, we show that IL-15 and IFN-γ do not induce anti-HCV effects through the type I interferon signaling pathway or nitric oxide (NO) production. Instead, IL-15 and IFN-γ provide protection against HCV via the ERK pathway. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells with a MEK/ERK inhibitor abrogated the anti-HCV effects of IL-15 and IFN-γ and overexpression of ERK1 prevented HCV replication compared to control transfection. Our in vitro data support the hypothesis that early production of IL-15 and activation of NK cells in the liver lead to control of HCV replication. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","gamma interferon; interferon; interleukin 15; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor; nitric oxide; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; genetic transfection; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; Huh-7.5 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; lymphocyte activation; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; virus cell interaction; virus inhibition; virus replication"
"Complete elimination of a pathogenic homoplasmic mtDNA mutation in one generation","2019","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been implicated in a wide variety of neurological conditions and are maternally inherited through a complex process which is not fully understood. Genetic counselling for mitochondrial conditions secondary to a mtDNA mutation can be challenging as it is not currently possible to accurately predict the mutational load/heteroplasmy of the mutation which could be passed to the offspring. In general, one expects that the higher the level of heteroplasmy the more likely that the same mtDNA mutation will be seen in the offspring. We report here a family which places a caveat on genetic counselling for mtDNA disorders. The proband is a 63 year old woman with m.14459G>A associated dystonia/spasticity/ataxia. The m.14459G>A mutation was detected at homoplasmic/near homoplasmic levels in her muscle tissue and fibroblasts, but did not appear to have been passed on to any of her offspring. To our knowledge, this is the first report of complete selection against a homoplasmic variant within maternally transmitted mtDNA. It is not clear if this novel phenomenon occurred by random chance or by another method of mitochondrial selection. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society","alanine; glycine; mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial DNA; adult; amino acid substitution; Article; ataxia; ataxic gait; case report; clinical article; cranial nerve; disorders of mitochondrial functions; dystonia; European; family history; female; gaze; gene mutation; genetic counseling; genetic screening; genetic variability; homoplasmic variant; human; human cell; human tissue; maternal inheritance; medical history; middle aged; migraine; mitochondrial DNA disorder; mitochondrial genome; MTND6 gene; multiple sclerosis; muscle biopsy; muscle tissue; neuroimaging; neurologic examination; next generation sequencing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nystagmus; Parkinson disease; patient referral; pedigree; priority journal; skin fibroblast; spasticity; speech disorder; vastus lateralis muscle; wheelchair user; fibroblast; genetics; muscle; pathology; point mutation; vertical transmission; Ataxia; DNA, Mitochondrial; Dystonia; Female; Fibroblasts; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Diseases; Muscle Spasticity; Muscles; Point Mutation"
"Ethical Challenges Related to Patient Involvement in Health Technology Assessment","2019","Including information and values from patients in HTA has the potential to improve both the process and outcomes of health technology policy decisions. Accordingly, funding and structural incentives to include patients in HTA activities have increased over the past several years. Unfortunately, these incentives have not yet been accompanied by a corresponding increase in resources, time, or commitment to responsiveness. In this Perspectives piece, we reflect on our collective experiences participating in, conducting, and overseeing patient engagement activities within HTA to highlight the ethical challenges associated with this area of activity. While we remain committed to the idea that patient engagement activities strengthen the findings, relevance, and legitimacy of health technology policy, we are deeply concerned about the potential for these activities to do ethical harm. We use this analysis to call for action to introduce strong protections against ethical violations that may harm patients participating in HTA engagement activities. ? 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Health; Ethics; Health technology assessments; Patient engagement; Patient involvement; Patient participation; Philosophical aspects; adult; article; biomedical technology assessment; ethics; human; patient participation; biomedical technology assessment; ethics; knowledge; morality; organization and management; risk assessment; Ethical Analysis; Humans; Knowledge; Morals; Patient Participation; Risk Assessment; Technology Assessment, Biomedical"
"Effect of a Recombinant Human Soluble Thrombomodulin on Mortality in Patients with Sepsis-Associated Coagulopathy: The SCARLET Randomized Clinical Trial","2019","Importance: Previous research suggested that soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin may reduce mortality among patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Objective: To determine the effect of human recombinant thrombomodulin vs placebo on 28-day all-cause mortality among patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The SCARLET trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter phase 3 study conducted in intensive care units at 159 sites in 26 countries. All adult patients admitted to one of the participating intensive care units between October 2012 and March 2018 with sepsis-associated coagulopathy and concomitant cardiovascular and/or respiratory failure, defined as an international normalized ratio greater than 1.40 without other known etiology and a platelet count in the range of 30 to 150 × 109/L or a greater than 30% decrease in platelet count within 24 hours, were considered for inclusion. The final date of follow-up was February 28, 2019. Interventions: Patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy were randomized and treated with an intravenous bolus or a 15-minute infusion of thrombomodulin (0.06 mg/kg/d [maximum, 6 mg/d]; n = 395) or matching placebo (n = 405) once daily for 6 days. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary end point was 28-day all-cause mortality. Results: Among 816 randomized patients, 800 (mean age, 60.7 years; 437 [54.6%] men) completed the study and were included in the full analysis set. In these patients, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate was not statistically significantly different between the thrombomodulin group and the placebo group (106 of 395 patients [26.8%] vs 119 of 405 patients [29.4%], respectively; P =.32). The absolute risk difference was 2.55% (95% CI, -3.68% to 8.77%). The incidence of serious major bleeding adverse events (defined as any intracranial hemorrhage; life-threatening bleeding; or bleeding event classified as serious by the investigator, with administration of at least 1440 mL [typically 6 units] of packed red blood cells over 2 consecutive days) was 23 of 396 patients (5.8%) in the thrombomodulin group and 16 of 404 (4.0%) in the placebo group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy, administration of a human recombinant thrombomodulin, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce 28-day all-cause mortality.

"Early Risks of Death, Stroke/Systemic Embolism, and Major Bleeding in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation","2019","BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased risks of death, stroke/systemic embolism, and bleeding (incurred by antithrombotic therapy), which may occur early after diagnosis. METHODS: We assessed the risk of early events (death, stroke/systemic embolism, and major bleeding) over 12 months and their relation to the time after diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in 52?014 patients prospectively enrolled in the GARFIELD-AF registry (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-Atrial Fibrillation) between March 2010 and August 2016. RESULTS: Over 12 months, 2140 patients died (mortality rate, 4.3; 95% CI, 4.2-4.5 per 100 person-years), of whom 288 (13.5%) died in the first month (6.8; 95% CI, 6.1-7.6). Over 12 months, 657 patients had a stroke/systemic embolism (1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4) and 411 had a major bleeding (0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9). During the first month, the rates (per 100 person-years) of stroke/systemic embolism and major bleed were 2.3 (95% CI, 1.9-2.8) and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.9), respectively. The elevated 1-month mortality rate was mostly attributable to cardiovascular mortality (3.5; 95% CI, 3.0-4.1), in particular, heart failure, sudden death, and acute coronary syndromes (1.0 [95% CI, 0.8-1.4], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4-0.8], and 0.5 [95% CI, 0.3-0.8], respectively). Age, heart failure, prior stroke, history of cirrhosis, vascular disease, moderate-to-severe kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and living in North or Latin America were independent predictors of a higher risk of early death, whereas anticoagulation and living in Europe or Asia were independent predictors of a lower risk of early death. A predictive model developed for the 1-month risk of death had a C-statistic of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The increased hazard of early events, in particular, cardiovascular mortality, in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation points to the importance of comprehensive care for such patients and should alert clinicians to detect warning signs of possible early mortality.

"Rome Foundation Working Team Report on Post-Infection Irritable Bowel Syndrome","2019","Background & Aims: The existence of postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) has been substantiated by epidemiology studies conducted in diverse geographic and clinical settings. However, the available evidence has not been well summarized, and there is little guidance for diagnosis and treatment of PI-IBS. The ROME Foundation has produced a working team report to summarize the available evidence on the pathophysiology of PI-IBS and provide guidance for diagnosis and treatment, based on findings reported in the literature and clinical experience. Methods: The working team conducted an evidence-based review of publication databases for articles describing the clinical features (diagnosis), pathophysiology (intestinal sensorimotor function, microbiota, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction, enteroendocrine pathways, and genetics), and animal models of PI-IBS. We used a Delphi-based consensus system to create guidelines for management of PI-IBS and a developed treatment algorithm based on published findings and experiences of team members. Results: PI-IBS develops in about 10% of patients with infectious enteritis. Risk factors include female sex, younger age, psychological distress during or before acute gastroenteritis, and severity of the acute episode. The pathogenesis of PI-PBS appears to involve changes in the intestinal microbiome as well as epithelial, serotonergic, and immune system factors. However, these mechanisms are incompletely understood. There are no evidence-based, effective pharmacologic strategies for treatment of PI-IBS. We provide a consensus-based treatment algorithm, based on clinical presentation and potential disease mechanisms. Conclusions: Based on a systematic review of the literature and team experience, we summarize the clinical features, pathophysiology (from animal models and human studies), and progression of PI-IBS. Based on these findings, we present an algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of PI-IBS based on team consensus. We also propose areas for future investigation. ? 2019 AGA Institute","Article; Campylobacter jejuni; Citrobacter rodentium; clinical feature; consensus; Cryptosporidium parvum; differential diagnosis; enteroendocrine cell; genetic association; Giardia intestinalis; human; hypersensitivity; immune dysregulation; infection complication; intestinal dysmotility; intestine flora; intestine infection; intestine mucosa permeability; irritable colon; Nippostrongylus brasiliensis; nonhuman; pathophysiology; patient education; prevalence; priority journal; reassurance; risk factor; Trichinella spiralis; viscera; algorithm; animal; clinical decision making; communicable disease; Delphi study; gastroenteritis; irritable colon; practice guideline; predictive value; prognosis; Algorithms; Animals; Clinical Decision-Making; Communicable Diseases; Consensus; Delphi Technique; Gastroenteritis; Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Prognosis; Risk Factors"

"An update on immunologic mechanisms in the respiratory mucosa in response to air pollutants","2019","Every day, we breathe in more than 10,000 L of air that contains a variety of air pollutants that can pose negative consequences to lung health. The respiratory mucosa formed by the airway epithelium is the first point of contact for air pollution in the lung, functioning as a mechanical and immunologic barrier. Under normal circumstances, airway epithelial cells connected by tight junctions secrete mucus, airway surface lining fluid, host defense peptides, and antioxidants and express innate immune pattern recognition receptors to respond to inhaled foreign substances and pathogens. Under conditions of air pollution exposure, the defenses of the airway epithelium are compromised by reductions in barrier function, impaired host defense to pathogens, and exaggerated inflammatory responses. Central to the mechanical and immunologic changes induced by air pollution are activation of redox-sensitive pathways and a role for antioxidants in normalizing these negative effects. Genetic variants in genes important in epithelial cell function and phenotype contribute to a diversity of responses to air pollution in the population at the individual and group levels and suggest a need for personalized approaches to attenuate the respiratory mucosal immune responses to air pollution. ? 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","antioxidant; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; pattern recognition receptor; STAT3 protein; tumor necrosis factor; air pollutant; air pollution; airway epithelium cell; allergic asthma; cell function; environmental exposure; epigenetics; epithelium cell; genetic variability; host resistance; human; immune response; lung fluid; lung function; medical literature; oxidative stress; phenotype; priority journal; respiratory epithelium; respiratory mucosa; Review; signal transduction; tight junction"
"Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review","2019","Context: In men with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with curative intent, controversy exists regarding the impact of biochemical recurrence (BCR) on oncological outcomes. Objective: To perform a systematic review of the existing literature on BCR after treatment with curative intent for nonmetastatic PCa. Objective 1 is to investigate whether oncological outcomes differ between patients with or without BCR. Objective 2 is to study which clinical factors and tumor features in patients with BCR have an independent prognostic impact on oncological outcomes. Evidence acquisition: Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. For objective 1, prospective and retrospective studies comparing survival outcomes of patients with or without BCR following radical prostatectomy (RP) or radical radiotherapy (RT) were included. For objective 2, all studies with at least 100 participants and reporting on prognostic patient and tumor characteristics in patients with BCR were included. Risk-of-bias and confounding assessments were performed according to the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Both a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis were undertaken. Evidence synthesis: Overall, 77 studies were included for analysis, of which 14 addressed objective 1, recruiting 20 406 patients. Objective 2 was addressed by 71 studies with 29 057, 11 301, and 4272 patients undergoing RP, RT, and a mixed population (mix of patients undergoing RP or RT as primary treatment), respectively. There was a low risk of bias for study participation, confounders, and statistical analysis. For most studies, attrition bias, and prognostic and outcome measurements were not clearly reported. BCR was associated with worse survival rates, mainly in patients with short prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) and a high final Gleason score after RP, or a short interval to biochemical failure (IBF) after RT and a high biopsy Gleason score. Conclusions: BCR has an impact on survival, but this effect appears to be limited to a subgroup of patients with specific clinical risk factors. Short PSA-DT and a high final Gleason score after RP, and a short IBF after RT and a high biopsy Gleason score are the main factors that have a negative impact on survival. These factors may form the basis of new BCR risk stratification (European Association of Urology BCR Risk Groups), which needs to be validated formally. Patient summary: This review looks at the risk of death in men who shows rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood test performed after curative surgery or radiotherapy. For many men, rising PSA does not mean that they are at a high risk of death from prostate cancer in the longer term. Men with PSA that rises shortly after they were treated with radiotherapy or rapidly rising PSA after surgery and a high tumor grade for both treatment modalities are at the highest risk of death. These factors may form the basis of new risk stratification (European Association of Urology biochemical recurrence Risk Groups), which needs to be validated formally. In patients who underwent radical prostatectomy as primary treatment and who subsequently developed biochemical recurrence (BCR), the main prognostic factor for distant metastases, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality is short prostate-specific antigen doubling time (ie, <1 yr), and to a lesser extent an increasing pathological Gleason score (GS) and a short interval to biochemical failure (IBF). The main prognostic factors for patients developing BCR following primary radiotherapy are a short IBF (<18 mo) and to a lesser extent an increasing biopsy GS. ? 2018 European Association of Urology","bibliographic database; biochemical recurrence; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer screening; cancer survival; cancer therapy; disease association; distant metastasis; follow up; Gleason score; human; male; medical record; meta analysis; multimodality cancer therapy; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; radiation oncology; Review; risk factor; surgical margin; surgical patient; survival rate; systematic review"

"Statin Use in Primary Prevention: A Simple Trial-Based Approach Compared With Guideline-Recommended Risk Algorithms for Selection of Eligible Patients","2019","Background: Cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools help identify individuals likely to benefit from preventative therapies. In this study we compared outcomes using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) risk algorithm and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) tool in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)-3 study. Methods: We compared outcomes using the ACC/AHA algorithm and the FRS with those seen in HOPE-3, which randomized participants to 10 mg rosuvastatin or placebo. The first coprimary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; second coprimary outcome additionally included heart failure, cardiac arrest, and revascularization. Results: Relative risks using risk scores were similar to those observed in the HOPE-3. Hazards ratios for the first coprimary outcome according to risk categories of ? 10%, 10%-20%, and ? 20% using the ACC/AHA algorithm were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.28), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53-0.96), and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55-0.93), and absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 0.18%, 1.33%, and 1.85%, respectively, over a median of 5.6 years. Corresponding results using the FRS were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.36-1.35), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.52-1.01), and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.60- 0.94); and ARR of 1.32%, 0.61%, and 1.43%. Hazard ratios for the second coprimary outcome were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.51-1.14), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.56-0.95), and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58-0.94); and ARR of 0.36%, 1.49%, and 1.85%, using the ACC/AHA algorithm and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.41-1.41), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52-0.95), and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.94); and ARR of 1.08%, 0.83%, and 1.56% using the FRS. Conclusions: The pragmatic HOPE-3 trial approach identifies in an ethnically diverse primary prevention population individuals at intermediate risk who benefit from statin therapy using simple clinical characteristics without the need for complex, currently used risk assessment tools. ? 2019","candesartan; hydrochlorothiazide; placebo; rosuvastatin; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug use; female; Framingham risk score; heart arrest; heart failure; heart infarction; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; patient selection; practice guideline; primary prevention; randomized controlled trial; revascularization"
"Oxytocin and Oxytocinase in the Obese and Nonobese Parturients during Induction and Augmentation of Labor","2019","Objective To investigate differences in oxytocin (OXT) biodistribution between nonobese and obese parturients during labor. Study Design Patients with body mass index (BMI) of either ? 18 ? 24.9 kg/m 2 (nonobese) or ? 30 kg/m 2 (obese) undergoing elective induction of labor were included (N = 25 each). Blood samples were collected at baseline (T 0), and 20 minutes after maximal OXT augmentation or adequate uterine contractions (T 1) for OXT and oxytocinase assays. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test for group versus time interaction and analysis of covariance to detect a difference in OXT level at T 1. Data presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), with p &lt; 0.05 considered significant. Results The mean BMIs (kg/m 2) were 22.1 ± 1.6 and 35.9 ± 5.1 in the nonobese and obese groups, respectively. No differences were observed in either the duration of OXT infusion, total dose of OXT, or plasma OXT (pg/mL) either at T 0 or T 1. However, plasma oxytocinase (ng/mL) was significantly lower at T 0 (1.41 [0.67, 3.51] vs. 0.40 [0.29, 1.12]; p = 0.03) in the obese group. Conclusion We provide preliminary evidence that the disposition of OXT may not be different between obese and nonobese women during labor.

"Pantoprazole to Prevent Gastroduodenal Events in Patients Receiving Rivaroxaban and/or Aspirin in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial","2019","Background & Aims: Antiplatelets and anticoagulants are associated with increased upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We evaluated whether proton pump inhibitor therapy could reduce this risk. Methods: We performed a 3 × 2 partial factorial double-blind trial of 17,598 participants with stable cardiovascular disease and peripheral artery disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given pantoprazole 40 mg daily or placebo, as well as rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with aspirin 100 mg once daily, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or aspirin 100 mg alone. The primary outcome was time to first upper gastrointestinal event, defined as a composite of overt bleeding, upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a gastroduodenal lesion or of unknown origin, occult bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcer or ?5 erosions, upper gastrointestinal obstruction, or perforation. Results: There was no significant difference in upper gastrointestinal events between the pantoprazole group (102 of 8791 events) and the placebo group (116 of 8807 events) (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67–1.15). Pantoprazole significantly reduced bleeding of gastroduodenal lesions (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.94; P = .03); this reduction was greater when we used a post-hoc definition of bleeding gastroduodenal lesion (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.74), although the number needed to treat still was high (n = 982; 95% confidence interval, 609–2528). Conclusions: In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, we found that routine use of proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving low-dose anticoagulation and/or aspirin for stable cardiovascular disease does not reduce upper gastrointestinal events, but may reduce bleeding from gastroduodenal lesions.

"Predicting worsening suicidal ideation with clinical features and peripheral expression of messenger RNA and microRNA during antidepressant treatment","2019","Objective: To investigate how the combination of clinical and molecular biomarkers can predict worsening of suicidal ideation during antidepressant treatment. Methods: Samples were obtained from 237 patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) treated with either duloxetine or placebo in an 8-week randomized controlled trial. Data were collected between 2007 and 2011. The relationship between treatment-worsening suicidal ideation (TWSI) and a number of clinical variables, as well as peripheral expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), was assessed at baseline. We generated 4 predictive models for TWSI: clinical, mRNA, miRNA, and a combined model comprising the best predictive variables from clinical, mRNA, and miRNA data. Results: Eleven patients (9.8%) presented with TWSI in the duloxetine group. Among the clinical variables, only baseline depressive severity was found to be mildly predictive of TWSI. Two mRNAs (stathmin 1 [STMN1] and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 9B [PPP1R9B]) and 2 miRNAs (miR-3688 and miR-5695) were identified that were significantly predictive of TWSI when mRNA and miRNA were assessed separately (P=.002,.044,.004, and.005, respectively). The best model included baseline depression severity and expression of STMN1 and miR-5695 and predicted TWSI with area under the curve = 0.94 (P<.001). Additionally, the combined model did not significantly predict TWSI in the placebo group. Conclusions: This study generated a predictive tool for TWSI that combines both biological and clinical variables. These biological variables can be easily quantified in peripheral tissues, thus rendering them viable targets to be used in both clinical practice and future studies of suicidal behaviors. ?

"Deprescribing benzodiazepine receptor agonists taken for insomnia: A review and key messages from practice guidelines","2019","Long-term benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use for insomnia is common and highly prevalent in adults in all care settings. Evidence syntheses suggest that the therapeutic benefits of benzodiazepines for insomnia are marginal and very short term. On the harm side, BZRAs are associated with daytime sedation and confusion. Long-term use increases the risk of falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, and motor vehicle accidents. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline has been developed to assist with deprescribing BZRAs. This review highlights the rationale for deprescribing BZRAs used for insomnia and summarizes key messages for clinicians from the new BZRA deprescribing guideline and their supporting evidence. ?

"Clinical outcomes and childhood trauma in bipolar disorder: A community sample of young adults","2019","Childhood trauma is a complex experience, much reported by subjects with bipolar disorder. There are still few studies that assess its consequences in a community sample of bipolar in early stage. The aim of the present study is to assess the association between childhood trauma and clinical outcomes, including the global functioning, in a community sample of young adults with bipolar disorder. This is a cross-sectional study with a community sample of subjects with bipolar disorder, from 23 to 30 years old, with and without childhood trauma. The trauma experiences during childhood were assessed by Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The functioning was assessed by Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST). Ninety subjects with bipolar disorder were included in the study (30 with childhood trauma and 60 without childhood trauma). Young adults with bipolar disorder and childhood trauma showed higher prevalence of current suicide risk, higher severity of depressive symptoms, and higher functioning impairment as compared to subjects with bipolar disorder without childhood trauma. The childhood trauma experiences appear to be an environmental risk factor for worse clinical outcomes and higher functional impairment. ? 2018","psychotropic agent; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; childhood trauma; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; clinical assessment tool; clinical outcome; community sample; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; disease severity; environmental factor; female; function test; functional assessment; functional disease; Functioning Assessment Short Test; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; personal experience; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; suicide; symptom; young adult; bipolar disorder; childhood trauma survivor; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Bipolar Disorder; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Ascertaining top evidence in emergency medicine: A modified Delphi study","2019","Objectives The application of evidence-informed practice in emergency medicine (EM) is critical to improve the quality of patient care. EM is a specialty with a broad knowledge base making it daunting for a junior resident to know where to begin the acquisition of evidence-based knowledge. Our study's objective was to formulate a list of top papers in the field of EM using a Delphi approach to achieve an expert consensus.Methods Participants were recruited from all 14 specialty EM programs across Canada by a nomination process by the program directors. The modified Delphi survey consisted of three study rounds, each round sent out via email. The study tool was piloted first with McMaster University's specialty EM residents. During the first round, participants individually listed top papers relevant to EM. During the two subsequent rounds, participants ranked the papers listed in the first round, with a chance to adjust ranking based on group responses.Results A total of eight EM specialty programs responded with 30 responses across the three rounds. There were 119 studies suggested in the first round, and, by the third round, a consensus of>70% agreement was reached to generate the final list of 29 studies.Conclusions We produced, via an expert consensus, a list of top studies relevant for Canadian EM physicians in training.

"Qualitative descriptive study to explore nurses' perceptions and experience on pain, agitation and delirium management in a community intensive care unit","2019","Objectives The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences, beliefs and perceptions of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses on the management of pain, agitation and delirium (PAD) in critically ill patients. Design A qualitative descriptive study. Setting This study took place in a community hospital ICU located in a medium size Canadian city. Participants Purposeful sampling was conducted. Participants included full-time nurses working in the ICU. Forty-six ICU nurses participated. Methods A total of five focus group sessions were held to collect data. There were one to three separate groups in each focus group session, with no more than seven participants in each group. There were 10 separate groups in total. A semistructured question guide was used. Thematic analysis method was adopted to analyse the data, and to search for emergent themes and patterns. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) the professional perspectives on patient wakefulness state, (2) the professional perspectives on PAD management of critically ill patients and (3) the factors impacting PAD management. Nurses have different opinions on the optimal level of patient sedation and felt that many factors, including environmental, healthcare teams, patients and family members, can influence PAD management. This potentially leads to inconsistent PAD management in critically ill patients. The nurses also believed that PAD management requires a multidisciplinary approach including healthcare teams and patients' families. Conclusions Many external and internal factors contribute to the complexity of PAD management including the attitudes of nursing staff towards PAD. The themes emerged from this study suggested the need of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary quality improvement programme to optimise the management of PAD in the ICU. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

"Development and Validation of a Nomogram to Predict Lymphedema After Axillary Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Women With Breast Cancer From the NCIC CTG MA.20 Randomized Trial","2019","Purpose: Regional nodal irradiation for women with breast cancer is known to be an important risk factor for the development of upper extremity lymphedema, but tools to accurately predict lymphedema risks for individual patients are lacking. This study sought to develop and validate a nomogram to predict lymphedema risk after axillary surgery and radiation therapy in women with breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Data from 1832 women accrued on the MA.20 trial between March 2000 and February 2007 were used to create a prognostic model with National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0 grade 2 or higher lymphedema as the primary endpoint. Multivariable logistic regression estimated model performance. External validation was performed on data from a single large academic cancer center (N = 785). Results: In the MA.20 trial cohort, 3 risk factors were predictive of lymphedema risk: body mass index (adjusted odds ratio, 1.05 per unit body mass index; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.08, P < .001), extent of axillary surgery (adjusted odds radio for 8-11 lymph nodes removed, 3.28 [95% CI, 1.53-7.89] P = .004; 12-15 lymph nodes, 4.04 [95% CI, 1.76-10.26] P = .002; ?16 nodes, 5.08 [95% CI, 2.26-12.70] P < .001), and extent of nodal irradiation (adjusted odds radio for limited, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.08-2.56] P = .02; for extensive, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.28-4.10] P = .004). A nomogram was created from these data that predicted lymphedema risk with reasonable accuracy confirmed by both internal (concordance index, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.64-0.74) and external validation (concordance index, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76). Conclusions: The nomogram created from the MA.20 randomized trial data using clinical information may be useful for lymphedema screening and risk stratification for therapeutic intervention trials. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Body fluids; Diagnosis; Diseases; Forecasting; Irradiation; Nomograms; Surgery; Clinical information; Confidence interval; Logistic regressions; Methods and materials; National Cancer Institute; Reasonable accuracy; Regional nodal irradiation; Therapeutic intervention; Radiotherapy; adult; Article; axillary surgery; body mass; breast cancer; breast radiotherapy; cancer center; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; lymphedema; major clinical study; national health organization; nomogram; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; validation study; adverse event; axilla; breast tumor; Canada; clinical trial; confidence interval; lymph node dissection; lymphedema; middle aged; nomogram; odds ratio; phase 3 clinical trial; postoperative complication; risk assessment; Adult; Axilla; Body Mass Index; Breast Neoplasms; Canada; Confidence Intervals; Female; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymphatic Irradiation; Lymphedema; Middle Aged; Nomograms; Odds Ratio; Postoperative Complications; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors"
"Neurodevelopmental Differences to Social Exclusion: An Event-Related Neural Oscillation Study of Children, Adolescents, and Adults","2019","Although the neural correlates of social exclusion have been well-documented, most studies have examined single age groups. No studies have directly compared specific age-related differences in social exclusion across children, adolescents, and adults using event-related oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics. The authors examined event-related theta EEG power and phase coherence in fair play and social exclusion conditions during the Cyberball task in 166 participants: 42 children (ages 1012), 56 adolescents (ages 1417), and 68 adults (ages 1828). Children and adolescents displayed the greatest theta power to rejection events, whereas adults displayed the greatest theta power to not my turn events. Moreover, the functional link between theta power to rejection and self-reported distress was strongest among the adolescents. These findings suggest that an enhanced neural response to social exclusion is present by preadolescence, but the association between neural and subjective responses is most prominent during adolescence. ? 2018 American Psychological Association.","adolescent; adult; Article; child; event related potential; event related spectral perturbation; female; human; human experiment; intertrial phase coherence; male; normal human; school child; self report; social exclusion; social rejection; social stress; theta rhythm; mental disease; social distance; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Social Distance; Young Adult"
"Smartphone sensors for health monitoring and diagnosis","2019","Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a dramatic rise in life expectancy owing to significant advances in medical science and technology, medicine as well as increased awareness about nutrition, education, and environmental and personal hygiene. Consequently, the elderly population in many countries are expected to rise rapidly in the coming years. A rapidly rising elderly demographics is expected to adversely affect the socioeconomic systems of many nations in terms of costs associated with their healthcare and wellbeing. In addition, diseases related to the cardiovascular system, eye, respiratory system, skin and mental health are widespread globally. However, most of these diseases can be avoided and/or properly managed through continuous monitoring. In order to enable continuous health monitoring as well as to serve growing healthcare needs; affordable, non-invasive and easy-to-use healthcare solutions are critical. The ever-increasing penetration of smartphones, coupled with embedded sensors and modern communication technologies, make it an attractive technology for enabling continuous and remote monitoring of an individual’s health and wellbeing with negligible additional costs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research and developments in smartphone-sensor based healthcare technologies. A discussion on regulatory policies for medical devices and their implications in smartphone-based healthcare systems is presented. Finally, some future research perspectives and concerns regarding smartphone-based healthcare systems are described. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Understanding paediatric patients' attitudes toward obesity and expectations prior to entering a weight management program","2019","Objective: This qualitative study explored attitudes toward weight management and knowledge of healthy, active living among paediatric patients referred to a weight management program. The objective of this study was to determine the emotional state and attitudes of patients entering into a paediatric weight management program. Methods: Study participants (aged 7 to 17 years old) were recruited during clinic orientation. Semistructured interviews were conducted, audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative content analysis generated a thematic coding scheme, identifying concepts and linkages in the data. Study rigour was achieved collaboratively through an audit trail, and data triangulation. Results: Fifteen patients (median age 11 years) consented to interviews. Three recurring themes emerged: emotions, motivation and learning. A total of nine subthemes were identified. Four key spheres of influence (family, peers, school and health care providers) affected the patient's outlook on obesity positively by providing support or negatively by adversely influencing their emotions and motivation. The level of individual motivation to engage in the weight management program varied. A positive outlook toward learning about obesity from school officials and health care providers emerged. Conclusions: This study provided insight regarding paediatric attitudes related to entering a weight management program. The negative emotional state and sometimes fear of the program expressed should be considered by the referring physician and by clinicians in weight management programs engaging in their care. ?

"Predictors of longer-term development of expressive language in two independent longitudinal cohorts of language-delayed preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder","2019","Background: Studies estimate that 30% of individuals with autism are minimally verbal. Understanding what factors predict longer-term expressive development in children with language delays is critical to inform identification and treatment of those at-risk for persistent language impairments. The present study examined predictors of expressive language development in language-delayed preschoolers followed through later school-age and young adulthood. Methods: Children using single words or less on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at approximately 3?years old were drawn from the Early Diagnosis (EDX) and Pathways in ASD longitudinal cohorts. Age-3 predictors of Age-19 ADOS language level were identified using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the EDX sample. Linear mixed models examined the effects of CART-identified predictors on Vineland expressive communication (VExp) trajectories from Age-3 to Age-19. The same linear mixed models were examined in the Pathways sample, identifying predictors of VExp from ages 3 to 10.5?years. Results: Significantly delayed fine motor skills (T-score?<?20) was the strongest CART predictor of Age-19 language. In the linear mixed models, time, Age-3 fine motor skills and initiation of joint attention (IJA) predicted VExp trajectories in the EDX sample, even when controlling for Age-3 visual receptive abilities. In the Pathways sample, time and Age-3 fine motor skills were significant predictors of VExp trajectories; IJA and cognitive skills were not significant predictors. Conclusions: Marked deficits in fine motor skills may be a salient proxy marker for identifying language-delayed children with ASD who are at risk for persistent language impairments. This finding adds to the literature demonstrating a relation between motor and language development in ASD. Investigating individual skill areas (e.g., fine motor and nonverbal problem-solving skills), rather than broader indices of developmental level (e.g., nonverbal IQ) may provide important cues to understanding longer-term language outcomes that can be targeted in early intervention. ? 2019 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health",""

"Optimal Approach to Lobectomy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","Objective Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy was introduced over 25 years ago. More recently, the technique has been modified from a multiport video-assisted thoracic surgery (mVATS) to uniportal (uVATS) and robotic (rVATS), with proponents for each approach. Additionally most lobectomies are still performed using an open approach. We sought to provide evidence-based recommendations to help define the optimal surgical approach to lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of articles searched without limits from January 2000 to January 2018 comparing open, mVATS, uVATS, and rVATS using sources Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were considered for inclusion. Articles were individually scrutinized by ISMICS consensus conference members, and evidence-based statements were created and consensus processes were used to determine the ensuing recommendations. The ACC/AHA Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendation Classification system was used to assess the overall quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. Results and recommendations One hundred and forty-five studies met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Comparisons were analyzed between VATS and open, and between different VATS approaches looking at oncological outcomes (survival, recurrence, lymph node evaluation), safety (adverse events), function (pain, quality of life, pulmonary function), and cost-effectiveness. Fifteen statements addressing these areas achieved consensus. The highest level of evidence suggested that mVATS is preferable to open lobectomy with lower adverse events (36% versus 42%; 88,460 patients) and less pain (IIa recommendation). Our meta-analysis suggested that overall survival was better (IIb) with mVATS compared with open (71.5% versus 66.7% 5-years; 16,200 patients). Different VATS approaches were similar for most outcomes, although uVATS may be associated with less pain and analgesic requirements (IIb). Conclusions This meta-analysis supports the role of VATS lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. Apart from potentially less pain and analgesic requirement with uVATS, different minimally invasive surgical approaches appear to have similar outcomes. ?

"Outcomes of hyaluronic acid injections for glenohumeral osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an analgesic and chondroprotective agent often used for the nonoperative treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). The effects of HA injections are well studied in the treatment of knee OA, but the effects in glenohumeral OA remain unclear. This study evaluated the efficacy of HA to reduce pain in patients with glenohumeral OA. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase were searched from the database inception date through January 16, 2018. Two reviewers independently screened articles for eligibility and extracted data for analysis. A methodological quality assessment was completed for all included studies, including assessment of risk of bias. The primary outcome was change in visual analog scale for pain. The secondary outcomes were functional outcome and adverse events. Results: In the HA arm, the reduction of visual analog scale pain score at 3 months was 26.2 mm (95% confidence interval, 22.0-30.3 mm; I 2 = 31%) and at 6 months was 29.5 mm (95% confidence interval, 25.5-33.4 mm; I 2 = 19%). All studies reported an improvement in functional outcome. Similar clinical improvements were reported in the intervention and control groups, suggesting that these improvements may not be directly related to HA. Commonly reported adverse events were rare and included swelling and mild pain at the injection site, local effusion, lethargy, and face rash. Conclusion: Intra-articular HA injection is safe and improves pain for patients with glenohumeral OA. Pain improvements also reported in the control group suggest that a significant placebo effect may be present with respect to intra-articular shoulder injection. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of HA and identify optimal dosing and route of administration. ? 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees","hyaluronic acid; hyaluronic acid; viscosupplement; clinical outcome; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; effusion; face rash; flu like syndrome; functional assessment; headache; human; injection site pain; injection site swelling; lethargy; meta analysis; musculoskeletal pain; pain assessment; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk assessment; shoulder arthritis; systematic review; visual analog scale; complication; intraarticular drug administration; osteoarthritis; pain measurement; shoulder pain; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Injections, Intra-Articular; Osteoarthritis; Pain Measurement; Shoulder Pain; Viscosupplements"
"Health-related quality of life and anxiety in the PAN-CAN lung cancer screening cohort","2019","Objectives The impact of lung cancer screening with low-dose chest CT (LDCT) on participants' anxiety levels and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important consideration in the implementation of such programmes. We aimed to describe changes in anxiety and HRQoL in a high-risk Canadian cohort undergoing LDCT lung cancer screening. Methods 2537 subjects who had 2% or greater lung cancer risk over 6 years using a risk prediction tool were recruited from eight centres across Canada in the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (2008-2010). We compared HRQoL and anxiety levels before and after screening of 1237 participants with LDCT (excluding a subset of 1300 participants who also underwent autofluorescence bronchoscopy screening), as well as after investigations performed because of a positive screening examination. The 12-item short-form Physical and Mental Component Scales (SF-12), EQ-5D-3L scores and State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State anxiety were used at each assessment. Results Overall, there were no clinically significant differences in HRQoL outcomes between baseline and each of the survey time points following initial screening. No mean change in anxiety in the overall cohort was noted following baseline LDCT, but more participants had clinically significant increase in anxiety versus decrease after baseline screening (increase >minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (n=180) vs decrease >MCID (n=50), p<0.001). This finding persisted but to a lesser degree at the 12 month time point (increase >MCID (n=146) vs decrease >MCID (n=87), p<0.001). Conclusions CT screening for lung cancer has no major overall impact on HRQoL among participants, although a minority of participants (number-needed-to-harm=7 after baseline screening and 18 at 1 year) demonstrated clinically significant increased anxiety levels. ?

"Availability of legalized cannabis reduces demand for illegal cannabis among Canadian cannabis users: evidence from a behavioural economic substitution paradigm","2019","In the context of cannabis legalization, an important question among clinicians, policymakers, and the public is whether availability of legal cannabis will significantly reduce consumption (demand) of illegal cannabis. Using paradigms from behavioural economics, we tested the prediction that legal cannabis would be an asymmetrical substitute for illegal cannabis, with legal cannabis operating as a superior commodity based on its regulated status. In a sample of 289 adult cannabis users in Ontario, we found evidence of substitutability for both legal and illegal cannabis, but significantly lower substitutability of illegal for legal cannabis, a pattern that was also present for price elasticity (α) and Pmax. Thus, the data indicated asymmetric substitution such that the availability of legal cannabis substantially decreased demand for illegal cannabis, but a significantly smaller effect in reverse. These results suggest that the introduction of legal cannabis into the market may disrupt and reduce illegal purchases, contributing to the reduction of the potential harms associated with the illegal market. However, in revealing price windows in which legal cannabis is preferred over the contraband alternative, these data also have significant implications for pricing policies. ? 2018, The Canadian Public Health Association.","cannabis; adult; behavioral economics; cannabis use; commercial phenomena; drug legislation; economics; female; human; male; Ontario; psychology; Adult; Cannabis; Commerce; Economics, Behavioral; Female; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Legislation, Drug; Male; Marijuana Use; Ontario"
"A candidate-gene approach identifies novel associations between common variants in/near syndromic obesity genes and BMI in pediatric and adult European populations","2019","We hypothesized that monogenic syndromic obesity genes are also involved in the polygenic variation of BMI. Single-marker, tag single nucleotide polymorphism (tagSNP) and gene-based analysis were performed on common variants near 54 syndromic obesity genes. We used publicly available data from meta-analyses of European BMI genome-wide association studies conducted by the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium and the UK Biobank (UKB) (N = 681,275 adults). A total of 33 loci were identified, of which 19 of 33 (57.6%) were located at SNPs previously identified by the GIANT Consortium and UKB meta-analysis, 11 of 33 (33.3%) were located at novel SNPs, and 3 of 33 (9.1%) were novel genes identified with gene-based analysis. Both single-marker and tagSNP analyses mapped the previously identified 19 SNPs by the GIANT Consortium and UKB meta-analysis. Gene-based analysis confirmed 15 of 19 (78.9%) of the novel SNPs’ associated genes. Of the 11 novel loci, 8 were identified with single-marker analysis and the remaining 3 were identified with tagSNP analysis. Gene-based analysis confirmed 4 of 11 (36.3%) of these loci. Meta-analysis with the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium (N = 35,668 children) was conducted post hoc for top SNPs, confirming 17 of 33 (51.5%) loci, of which 5 were novel. This study supports evidence for a continuum between rare monogenic syndromic and common polygenic forms of obesity. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","adult; Article; body mass; child; diabetes mellitus; European; gene identification; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic association; genetic variability; human; marker gene; obesity; post hoc analysis; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; body weight; Caucasian; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; male; obesity; phenotype; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Child; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Obesity; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"
"Genotypic diversity and antifungal susceptibility of Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from paediatric patients in China","2019","Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening mycosis primarily occurring in adult patients particularly those with immunosuppression such as HIV infection/AIDS. The number of reported cases of paediatric cryptococcosis has increased in the last decade around the world, including China. However, current information on the characteristics of cryptococcosis in children, particularly the genotypic diversity and antifungal susceptibility of the isolates, is limited. In the present study, a total of 25 paediatric isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans were genotyped using the ISHAM-MLST scheme. In vitro susceptibility to antifungal agents of the 22 isolates was tested using the CLSI M27-A3 method. Our analyses revealed that the genotypic diversity of C.?neoformans isolates from Chinese paediatric patients was low, with ST 5 (80%) and ST 31 (12%) being the two major sequence types. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole (FLU), 5-flucytosine (5-FC) and itraconazole (ITR) was observed among C.?neoformans isolates from Chinese paediatric patients, particularly among the ST5 isolates, which was similar to observations made on C.?neoformans isolates from Chinese adult patients. In addition, the majority of isolates (3/4, 75%) obtained from deceased patients showed decreased antifungal susceptibility, which indicates that further monitoring of antifungal susceptibility of Cryptococcus isolates is warranted in management of paediatric cryptococcosis. ? 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","amphotericin B; fluconazole; flucytosine; isavuconazole; itraconazole; posaconazole; voriconazole; antifungal agent; adolescent; antifungal susceptibility; Article; child; China; cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; female; fungus isolation; genetic variability; genotype; human; immunosuppressive treatment; male; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; antifungal resistance; classification; Cryptococcus neoformans; drug effect; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiological examination; microbiology; multilocus sequence typing; preschool child; Adolescent; Antifungal Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; Drug Resistance, Fungal; Female; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Mycological Typing Techniques"

"Prenatal influences on the development and stability of personality","2019","The brain rapidly develops during the prenatal period; therefore, intrauterine conditions can affect neurodevelopment, behavior and health across the lifespan. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis posits that physiological alterations are made by the fetus to adapt to prenatal conditions. Research examining links between perinatal adversity and neurodevelopment has focused mainly on the risk for mental health problems. However, these disorders are likely the product of multiple subtle changes in the brain occurring in response to intrauterine stress, alterations that may have important implications for the development of personality. Here, we review the evidence that bears on the question of if and how prenatal conditions influence personality development. We hypothesize that prenatal conditions lead to alterations in systems mediating stress and reward sensitivity and effortful control, changes that may affect personality traits and their stability across time. Understanding how the prenatal environment influences personality development can help to advance theories of personality development and our understanding of normal behavior. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Child sexual abuse, disclosure and PTSD: A systematic and critical review","2019","Background: Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a prevalent exposure with potentially serious, negative health consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its symptomatology. Objective: To conduct a systematic and critical review in order to investigate the relationship between CSA disclosure patterns and PTSD. Participants and setting: Studies included clinical, college and community-based samples of adults’ and children's experiences of CSA. Methods: We conducted systematic searches in five databases (Medline, Embase, PyscINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts) from database inception to October 17, 2017 using index terms and keywords for CSA, disclosure, and PTSD. We included any English-language, primary studies involving children or adults with experiences of CSA that used quantitative research designs to explore the relationship between disclosure and PTSD. We used systematic critical review methodology in order to investigate the relationship between disclosure and PTSD symptoms and disorders. We also investigated factors that explained the relationship between disclosure and PTSD, such as individual, exposure or environmental factors. Results: Twenty-two articles reporting 20 studies were included in this review. Studies assessing the relationship between CSA and PTSD tended to account for personal (e.g., gender) and CSA exposure variables (e.g., severity of CSA) only. While authors generally used validated measures to assess for PTSD symptoms and disorders, they tended to use author-generated or unvalidated measures to assess for disclosure process variables. Conclusion: The relationship between factors that affect disclosure, and responses to disclosure, are not well theorized in quantitative literature. Study findings suggest important avenues for future research, such as the need to assess disclosure longitudinally. ? 2019","Article; child behavior; child sexual abuse; childhood trauma; disease association; emotion; emotional attachment; human; interpersonal communication; parental attitude; posttraumatic stress disorder; risk factor; social support; systematic review"

"Maternal experiences of ethnic discrimination and child cardiometabolic outcomes in the Study of Latino Youth","2019","Purpose: Limited research has examined maternal experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination in relation to child cardiometabolic health. In this study, we investigated whether maternal experiences of ethnic discrimination were associated with cardiometabolic risk in Hispanic/Latino youth several years later. Methods: Our sample included 1146 youth (8–16 years)from the Study of Latino Youth (2012–2014), who were children of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos participants (2008–2011). We used regression models to examine the prospective associations between maternal report of ethnic discrimination in relation to her child's body mass index (BMI)z-score, metabolic syndrome score (MetS), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)levels 2 years later. Results: Maternal ethnic discrimination was associated with youth hsCRP, but not BMI or MetS (P-values >.05). Adjusting for age, nativity, and national background, maternal ethnic discrimination was associated with higher (log)hsCRP levels (β = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.32)in children. This association was robust to adjustment for maternal and household characteristics (β = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.31), as well as maternal depression and maternal BMI. Conclusions: Maternal ethnic discrimination is associated with inflammation among Hispanic/Latino youth, and not BMI z-score or MetS. Studies are needed to address temporality and pathways. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","C reactive protein; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; child; clinical outcome; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; female; Hispanic; household; human; inflammation; juvenile; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; mother; personal experience; postnatal depression; priority journal; prospective study; racism; school child; sensitivity analysis; social background; United States"
"Socioeconomic status and risk of cardiovascular disease in 20 low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries: the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiologic (PURE) study","2019","Background: Socioeconomic status is associated with differences in risk factors for cardiovascular disease incidence and outcomes, including mortality. However, it is unclear whether the associations between cardiovascular disease and common measures of socioeconomic status—wealth and education—differ among high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries, and, if so, why these differences exist. We explored the association between education and household wealth and cardiovascular disease and mortality to assess which marker is the stronger predictor of outcomes, and examined whether any differences in cardiovascular disease by socioeconomic status parallel differences in risk factor levels or differences in management. Methods: In this large-scale prospective cohort study, we recruited adults aged between 35 years and 70 years from 367 urban and 302 rural communities in 20 countries. We collected data on families and households in two questionnaires, and data on cardiovascular risk factors in a third questionnaire, which was supplemented with physical examination. We assessed socioeconomic status using education and a household wealth index. Education was categorised as no or primary school education only, secondary school education, or higher education, defined as completion of trade school, college, or university. Household wealth, calculated at the household level and with household data, was defined by an index on the basis of ownership of assets and housing characteristics. Primary outcomes were major cardiovascular disease (a composite of cardiovascular deaths, strokes, myocardial infarction, and heart failure), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. Information on specific events was obtained from participants or their family. Findings: Recruitment to the study began on Jan 12, 2001, with most participants enrolled between Jan 6, 2005, and Dec 4, 2014. 160 299 (87·9%) of 182 375 participants with baseline data had available follow-up event data and were eligible for inclusion. After exclusion of 6130 (3·8%) participants without complete baseline or follow-up data, 154 169 individuals remained for analysis, from five low-income, 11 middle-income, and four high-income countries. Participants were followed-up for a mean of 7·5 years. Major cardiovascular events were more common among those with low levels of education in all types of country studied, but much more so in low-income countries. After adjustment for wealth and other factors, the HR (low level of education vs high level of education) was 1·23 (95% CI 0·96–1·58) for high-income countries, 1·59 (1·42–1·78) in middle-income countries, and 2·23 (1·79–2·77) in low-income countries (pinteraction&lt;0·0001). We observed similar results for all-cause mortality, with HRs of 1·50 (1·14–1·98) for high-income countries, 1·80 (1·58–2·06) in middle-income countries, and 2·76 (2·29–3·31) in low-income countries (pinteraction&lt;0·0001). By contrast, we found no or weak associations between wealth and these two outcomes. Differences in outcomes between educational groups were not explained by differences in risk factors, which decreased as the level of education increased in high-income countries, but increased as the level of education increased in low-income countries (pinteraction&lt;0·0001). Medical care (eg, management of hypertension, diabetes, and secondary prevention) seemed to play an important part in adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes because such care is likely to be poorer in people with the lowest levels of education compared to those with higher levels of education in low-income countries; however, we observed less marked differences in care based on level of education in middle-income countries and no or minor differences in high-income countries. Interpretation: Although people with a lower level of education in low-income and middle-income countries have higher incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, they have better overall risk factor profiles. However, these individuals have markedly poorer health care. Policies to reduce health inequities globally must include strategies to overcome barriers to care, especially for those with lower levels of education.

"Estimates of the current and future burden of cancer attributable to alcohol consumption in Canada","2019","Alcohol consumption is associated with elevated risk of oropharyngeal, laryngeal, esophageal, colon, rectal, breast, liver, pancreatic and stomach cancers. The purpose of this analysis was to provide national and provincial estimates of the number and proportion of cancers attributable to alcohol consumption in Canada and to project the numbers of potentially avoidable cancers using possible intervention scenarios. We estimated the population attributable risk (PAR)for cancers associated with alcohol consumption levels (drinks/day)using: i)relative risks obtained from the World Cancer Research Fund/(WCRF)reports or meta-analyses, ii)alcohol consumption (prevalence)data from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey, and iii)cancer incidence data from the 2015 Canadian Cancer Registry. We used potential impact fractions (PIFs)to estimate the future avoidable cancer burden under four counterfactual scenarios: (1)lowering alcohol consumption to meet the WCRF low risk guidelines, (2)meeting the Canada's Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines, (3)reducing daily intake by one drink/day, and (4)decreasing consumption to 50% of the 2003 levels by 2032. We estimated that 3282 incident cancer cases (5.2% of alcohol-associated cancers and 1.8% of all cancers)diagnosed in Canada in 2015 were attributable to alcohol consumption. At the current consumption levels, alcohol-attributable cancers are expected to increase to 10,122 (8.8% of cases among alcohol-associated cancers)by 2042. Under the best case scenario, reducing alcohol consumption to 50% of 2003 levels by 2032, could prevent 70,261 cases by 2042. Strategies that effectively reduce alcohol consumption at a population level can have a meaningful impact on reducing the cancer burden in Canada. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; attributable risk; Canada; cancer incidence; cancer registry; cancer research; cancer risk; cohort analysis; evidence based practice; female; global disease burden; human; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; population risk; priority journal; risk factor"
"Comprehensive identification of pleiotropic loci for body fat distribution using the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies","2019","We conducted a hypothesis-free cross-trait analysis for waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (WHR adjBMI ) loci derived through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Summary statistics from published GWAS were used to capture all WHR adjBMI single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and their proxy SNPs were identified. These SNPs were used to extract cross-trait associations between WHR adjBMI SNPs and other traits through the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. Pathway analysis was conducted for pleiotropic WHR adjBMI SNPs. We found 160 WHR adjBMI SNPs and 3675 proxy SNPs. Cross-trait analysis identified 239 associations, of which 100 were for obesity traits. The remaining 139 associations were filtered down to 101 unique linkage disequilibrium block associations, which were grouped into 13 categories: lipids, red blood cell traits, white blood cell counts, inflammatory markers and autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes-related traits, adiponectin, cancers, blood pressure, height, neuropsychiatric disorders, electrocardiography changes, urea measurement, and others. The highest number of cross-trait associations were found for triglycerides (n?=?10), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (n?=?9), and reticulocyte counts (n?=?8). Pathway analysis for WHR adjBMI pleiotropic SNPs found immune function pathways as the top canonical pathways. Results from our original methodology indicate a novel genetic association between WHR adjBMI and reticulocyte counts and highlight the pleiotropy between abdominal obesity, immune pathways, and other traits. ? 2018 World Obesity Federation","adiponectin; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; apolipoprotein B; bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 1B; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; proline dipeptidase; protein; protein C; R spondin 3 homolog; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; urea; vasculotropin A; zinc finger protein; abdominal obesity; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; Article; autoimmune disease; birth weight; blood pressure; body fat distribution; body height; body mass; cholesterol blood level; electrocardiography; erythrocyte count; female; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; granulocyte; hematocrit; human; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; leukocyte count; male; malignant neoplasm; mental disease; newborn; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pleiotropy; reticulocyte count; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; skinfold; subcutaneous fat; triacylglycerol blood level; waist hip ratio; genetic predisposition; genetics; national health organization; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; phenotype; pleiotropy; United States; Body Fat Distribution; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; National Human Genome Research Institute (U.S.); Obesity; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; United States; Waist-Hip Ratio"
"Impact of residential area on the management of rheumatoid arthritis patients initiating their first biologic DMARD: Results from the Ontario Best Practices Research Initiative (OBRI)","2019","Access to care and management of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients may differ based on residential area. We described differences in the profile of patients initiating their first biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) based on their residential area type.Cross-sectional analysis of 793 adult RA patients in the longitudinal Ontario Best Practices Research Initiative (OBRI) registry initiating their first bDMARD <30 days prior to or anytime post-enrolment. Patient residential and clinic areas (rural vs. urban) were classified using 2 methods: postal codes and Statistics Canada population centres. Sociodemographics, disease characteristics, and RA medications (tumor necrosis factor inhibitor [TNFi] vs. non-TNFi, concurrent use of conventional synthetic DMARDs [csDMARDs], and intravenous [IV] vs. subcutaneous [SC] bDMARD) at initiation of first bDMARD were contrasted between residential area types.Other than marital status, first language, and race (higher proportion of married, English speaking, Caucasian patients in rural areas), no significant differences were observed in the demographic and disease characteristics of patients living in rural and urban areas. In multivariate analysis, there was no association between residential area type and type of bDMARD use, concurrent csDMARD(s) use or route of bDMARD. However, patients living farther from their treating clinic were significantly less likely to initiate IV bDMARD. Female rheumatologist and rural clinic location were independently associated with lower odds of IV bDMARD use.The use of SC vs. IV bDMARD was associated with being seen in a clinic located in a rural area, being treated by a female rheumatologist, and living farther from treating clinic. These results suggest possible prescription bias in bDMARD selection and/or patient preferences due to convenience.","antirheumatic agent; biological product; tumor necrosis factor; adult; age; aged; antagonists and inhibitors; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; demography; drug administration route; female; health care delivery; human; male; middle aged; Ontario; rheumatoid arthritis; rural population; severity of illness index; sex factor; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; urban population; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biological Products; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Administration Routes; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Urban Population"
"Heterotopic ossification after total elbow arthroplasty: a systematic review","2019","Background: Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a known complication that can arise after total elbow arthroplasty (TEA). In most cases, it is asymptomatic; however, in some patients, it can limit range of motion and lead to poor outcomes. The objective of this review was to assess and report the incidence, risk factors, prophylaxis, and management of HO after TEA. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed to retrieve all relevant studies evaluating the occurrence of HO after TEA. The search was performed in duplicate, and a quality assessment of all included studies was performed. Results: A total of 1907 studies were retrieved, of which 45 were included involving 2256 TEA patients. HO was radiographically present in 10% of patients and was symptomatic in 3%. Fewer than 1% of patients went on to undergo surgical excision of HO, with outcomes after surgery reported as good or excellent as assessed by range of motion and the Mayo Elbow Performance Score. HO appears more likely to develop in patients undergoing TEA because of ankylosis, primary osteoarthritis, and distal humeral fractures. Surgical intervention is more likely to be required in patients in whom HO develops after TEA performed for ankylosis and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Conclusion: HO is an uncommon complication after TEA, with most patients in whom HO develops being asymptomatic and requiring no surgical management. Routine HO prophylaxis for TEA is not supported by the literature. The effectiveness of prophylaxis in high-risk patients is uncertain, and future studies are required to clarify its usefulness. ? 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees","ankylosis; distal humeral fracture; elbow arthroplasty; evaluation study; heterotopic ossification; human; Mayo Elbow Performance Score; morbidity; obesity; osteoarthritis; priority journal; quality control; Review; risk factor; systematic review; treatment outcome; asymptomatic disease; elbow; elbow replacement; heterotopic ossification; humerus fracture; incidence; joint characteristics and functions; pathophysiology; Ankylosis; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Elbow; Asymptomatic Diseases; Elbow Joint; Humans; Humeral Fractures; Incidence; Ossification, Heterotopic; Osteoarthritis; Range of Motion, Articular; Risk Factors"
"Sensitivity and specificity of chest imaging for sarcoidosis screening in patients with cardiac presentations","2019","Background: Patients with sarcoidosis can present with cardiac symptoms as the first manifestation of disease in any organ. In these patients, the use of chest imaging modalities may serve as an initial screening tool towards the diagnosis of sarcoidosis through identification of pulmonary/mediastinal involvement; however, the use of chest imaging for this purpose has not been well studied. We assessed the utility of different chest imaging modalities for initial screening for cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). Methods and Results: All patients were investigated with chest x-ray, chest computed tomography (CT) and/or cardiac/thorax magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We then used the final diagnosis (CS versus no CS) and adjudicated imaging reports (normal versus abnormal) to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of individual and combinations of chest imaging modalities. We identified 44 patients (mean age 54 (±8) years, 35.4% female) and a diagnosis of CS was made in 18/44 patients (41%). The sensitivity and specificity for screening for sarcoidosis were 35% and 85% for chest x-ray, respectively (AUC 0.60; 95%CI 0.42-0.78; p value=0.27); 94% and 86% for chest CT (AUC 0.90; 95%CI 0.80-1.00; p value <0.001); 100% and 50% for cardiac/thorax MRI (AUC 0.75; 95%CI 0.56-0.94; p value=0.04). Conclusions: During the initial diagnostic workup of patients with suspected CS, chest x-ray was suboptimal as a screening test. In contrast CT chest and cardiac/thorax MRI had excellent sensitivity. Chest CT has the highest specificity among imaging modalities. Cardiac/thorax MRI or chest CT could be used as an initial screening test, depending on local availability. ?

"Advancing Rehabilitation Practice Through Improved Specification of Interventions","2019","Rehabilitation clinicians strive to provide cost-effective, patient-centered care that optimizes outcomes. A barrier to this ideal is the lack of a universal system for describing, or specifying, rehabilitation interventions. Current methods of description vary across disciplines and settings, creating barriers to collaboration, and tend to focus mostly on functional deficits and anticipated outcomes, obscuring connections between clinician behaviors and changes in functioning. The Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System (RTSS) is the result of more than a decade of effort by a multidisciplinary group of rehabilitation clinicians and researchers to develop a theory-based framework to specify rehabilitation interventions. The RTSS describes interventions for treatment components, which consist of a target (functional change brought about as a direct result of treatment), ingredients (actions taken by clinicians to change the target), and a hypothesized mechanism of action, as stated in a treatment theory. The RTSS makes explicit the connections between functional change and clinician behavior, and recognizes the role of patient effort in treatment implementation. In so doing, the RTSS supports clinicians’ efforts to work with their patients to set achievable goals, select appropriate treatments, adjust treatment plans as needed, encourage patient participation in the treatment process, communicate with team members, and translate research findings to clinical care. The RTSS may help both expert and novice clinicians articulate their clinical reasoning processes in ways that benefit treatment planning and clinical education, and may improve the design of clinical documentation systems, leading to more effective justification and reimbursement for services. Interested clinicians are invited to apply the RTSS in their local settings. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","adult; article; clinical education; clinician; cognition; documentation; human; patient care; patient participation; rehabilitation; reimbursement; scientist; treatment planning; clinical decision making; clinical protocol; patient care planning; procedures; rehabilitation medicine; Clinical Decision-Making; Clinical Protocols; Humans; Patient Care Planning; Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine"

"The role of context in implementation research for non-communicable diseases: Answering the 'how-to' dilemma","2019","Introduction Understanding context and how this can be systematically assessed and incorporated is crucial to successful implementation. We describe how context has been assessed (including exploration or evaluation) in Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) implementation research projects focused on improving health in people with or at risk of chronic disease and how contextual lessons were incorporated into the intervention or the implementation process. Methods Using a web-based semi-structured questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data across GACD projects (n = 20) focusing on hypertension, diabetes and lung diseases. The use of context-specific data from project planning to evaluation was analyzed using mixed methods and a multi-layered context framework across five levels; 1) individual and family, 2) community, 3) healthcare setting, 4) local or district level, and 5) state or national level. Results Project teams used both qualitative and mixed methods to assess multiple levels of context (avg. = 4). Methodological approaches to assess context were identified as formal and informal assessments, engagement of stakeholders, use of locally adapted resources and materials, and use of diverse data sources. Contextual lessons were incorporated directly into the intervention by informing or adapting the intervention, improving intervention participation or improving communication with participants/stakeholders. Provision of services, equipment or information, continuous engagement with stakeholders, feedback for personnel to address gaps, and promoting institutionalization were themes identified to describe how contextual lessons are incorporated into the implementation process. Conclusions Context is regarded as critical and influenced the design and implementation of the GACD funded chronic disease interventions. There are different approaches to assess and incorporate context as demonstrated by this study and further research is required to systematically evaluate contextual approaches in terms of how they contribute to effectiveness or implementation outcomes. ? 2019 Daivadanam et al.

"Applying the concept of structural empowerment to interactions between families and home-care nurses","2020","Interpretations of family carer empowerment in much nursing research, and in home-care practice and policy, rarely attend explicitly to families’ choice or control about the nature, extent or length of their involvement, or control over the impact on their own health. In this article, structural empowerment is used as an analytic lens to examine home-care nurses’ interactions with families in one Western Canadian region. Data were collected from 75?hrs of fieldwork in 59 interactions (18 nurses visiting 16 families) and interviews with 12 nurses and 11 family carers. Generally, nurses prioritized client empowerment, and their practice with families appeared oriented to supporting their role and needs as carers (i.e. rather than as unique individuals beyond the caring role), and reinforcing the caring role through validation and recognition. Although families generally expressed appreciation for these interactions, a structural empowerment lens illustrates how the broad context of home care shapes the interpretation and practice of empowerment in ways that can, paradoxically, be disempowering for families. Opportunities to effectively support family choice and control when a client is being cared for at home are discussed. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; empowerment; field work; home visit; human; interview; nurse; nursing research; validation process"

"Radiobiological characteristics of descendant progeny of fish and amphibian cells that survive the initial ionizing radiation dose","2019","Purpose: To evaluate the development of delayed lethal mutations, the production of medium borne lethal bystander signals, and the acquirement of radiosensitive or radioresistant traits in distant descendant progeny of fish and amphibian cells surviving ionizing radiation Materials and methods: American eel brain endothelial cells (eelB) and African clawed frog epithelial cells (A6) were initially irradiated with gamma rays at 0.5 Gy or 2 Gy. Ionizing radiation (IR)-surviving cells were grown for 27 population doublings (PDs) for eelB and 43 PDs for A6. Reproductive cell death as quantified by clonogenic survival assays was used to determine the development of delayed lethal mutations, the production of medium borne lethal bystander signals, and the acquirement of radiosensitive or radioresistant traits in the progeny survivors. Results: Only medium borne bystander signals produced by 2-Gy-irradiated eelB progeny survivors at 12 PDs could reduce the clonogenic survival of the bystander reporter cells. IR-induced delayed lethal mutations occurred in irradiated eelB cells at 15–18 PDs; however, subsequently propagated progeny cells retained normal replicative abilities. No IR-induced delayed lethal mutations developed in progeny of irradiated A6 cells at up to 43 PDs. eelB progeny survivors did not develop new radiosensitive or radioresistant traits while A6 progeny survivors acquired a new radiosensitive characteristic. Conclusion: This study enriches the current literature on the radiobiological characteristics of distant surviving progeny of irradiated fish and amphibian cells and highlights cell-type/species-dependent differential responses to IR. This study is the first to examine the potential transgenerational effects of progenitor irradiation in amphibian cells. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","amphibian; apoptosis; bioassay; cell; dose-response relationship; fish; induced response; irradiation; mutation; nontarget organism; radiation exposure; adult; article; brain; cancer resistance; cell death; endothelium cell; gamma radiation; germ cell; human; human cell; irradiation; lethal mutation; nonhuman; progeny; radiation; survivor; Xenopus laevis; Amphibia; animal; bystander effect; gamma radiation; ionizing radiation; radiation response; Amphibia; Anguilla rostrata; Anura; Xenopus laevis; Amphibians; Animals; Bystander Effect; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Endothelial Cells; Gamma Rays; Radiation, Ionizing"
"Pelvic congestion syndrome due to agenesis of the infrarenal inferior vena cava","2019","The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the main conduit of venous return to the right atrium from the lower extremities and abdominal organs. Agenesis of the IVC has an incidence of <1% in the general population [1], although it has been reported in the literature as occurring in up to 8.7% of the population [2]. Patients with absent IVC may present with symptoms of lower extremity venous insufficiency [6], idiopathic deep venous thrombosis [7], or pelvic congestion syndrome. To our knowledge there have only been a few cases reported in the literature of agenesis of the IVC associated with pelvic congestion syndrome [3,10,11].

"An examination of motivation to change and neural alcohol cue reactivity following a brief intervention","2019","Background: Brief interventions represent a promising psychological intervention targeting individuals with heavy alcohol use. Motivation to change represents an individual's openness to engage in a behavior change strategy and is thought to be a crucial component of brief interventions. Neuroimaging techniques provide a translational tool to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying potential mediators of treatment response, including motivation to change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of a brief intervention on motivation to change drinking behavior and neural alcohol taste cue reactivity. Methods: Non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers were randomized to receive a brief drinking intervention (n = 22) or an attention-matched control (n = 24). Three indices of motivation to change were assessed at baseline and after the intervention or control session: importance, confidence, and readiness. Immediately following the intervention or control session, participants also underwent an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during which they completed an alcohol taste cues paradigm. Results: There was a significant effect of the brief intervention on increasing ratings of importance of changing drinking behavior, but not on ratings of confidence or readiness to change. Ratings of importance after the intervention or control session were associated with neural alcohol taste cue reactivity, but notably, this effect was only significant for participants who received the intervention. Individuals in the intervention condition showed a positive association between ratings of importance and activation in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and insula. Conclusions: The brief drinking intervention was successful at improving one dimension of motivation to change among non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers. The brief intervention moderated the relationship between ratings of importance and brain activation in circuitry associated with interoceptive awareness and self-reflection. Together, findings represent an initial step toward understanding the neurobiological mechanisms through which a brief intervention may improve motivation to change. ? 2007-2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Safety and efficacy of active and passive immunotherapy in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and network meta-analysis","2019","Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review and conduct a direct and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that have examined the clinical safety and efficacy of using passive and active immunotherapies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research questions: (1) Is amyloid-based immunotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate AD associated with more efficacy benefits compared to placebo? (2) Which immunotherapy agent is associated with more comparative benefit? (3) Is passive or active immunotherapy associated with more benefits? Data sources: A systematic review of published randomized controlled trials was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane library. Review methods and meta-analysis: Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Important AD cognitive scales as clinical efficacy outcomes were ADAS-cog, CDR and MMSE whereas edema, neoplasms and mortality were included as safety outcomes. A direct comparison meta-analysis using a random effect model and a network (direct and indirect) comparison was conducted to calculate mean differences in treatment effects, SUCRA and ranking probabilities for each medicine per safety and efficacy outcome. Quality of network results were assessed using GRADE methodology. Principle findings: Thirteen RCT-assessed patients with mild-to-moderate AD were included in the final analysis. The results showed that immunotherapies compared with placebo produced a statistically, but not clinically significant, improvement in ADAS-cog (MD=-0.39; 95% CI -0.42, -0.35, P=0.00) and MMSE. In terms of safety, the rate of ARIA-E was significantly higher with monoclonal antibodies. Solanezumab and AN1792 (vaccine) were the drugs of choice both from efficacy and safety perspectives. Conclusion: In terms of efficacy, the review showed a statistically, but not clinically significant, improvement in favor of immunotherapy versus placebo. Further clinical trials are required to demonstrate any cognitive benefits of immunotherapies in mild-to-moderate AD. ? 2019 CIM.",""
"Perinatal or neonatal mortality among women who intend at the onset of labour to give birth at home compared to women of low obstetrical risk who intend to give birth in hospital: A systematic review and meta-analyses","2019","Background: More women are choosing to birth at home in well-resourced countries. Concerns persist that out-of-hospital birth contributes to higher perinatal and neonatal mortality. This systematic review and meta-analyses determines if risk of fetal or neonatal loss differs among low-risk women who begin labour intending to give birth at home compared to low-risk women intending to give birth in hospital. Methods: In April 2018 we searched five databases from 1990 onward and used R to obtain pooled estimates of effect. We stratified by study design, study settings and parity. The primary outcome is any perinatal or neonatal death after the onset of labour. The study protocol is peer-reviewed, published and registered (PROSPERO No.CRD42013004046). Findings: We identified 14 studies eligible for meta-analysis including ~ 500,000 intended home births. Among nulliparous women intending a home birth in settings where midwives attending home birth are well-integrated in health services, the odds ratio (OR) of perinatal or neonatal mortality compared to those intending hospital birth was 1.07 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.65); and in less integrated settings 3.17 (95% CI, 0.73 to 13.76). Among multiparous women intending a home birth in well-integrated settings, the estimated OR compared to those intending a hospital birth was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.38); and in less integrated settings was 1.58 (95% CI, 0.50 to 5.03). Interpretation: The risk of perinatal or neonatal mortality was not different when birth was intended at home or in hospital. Funding: Partial funding: Association of Ontario Midwives open peer reviewed grant. Research in Context: Evidence before this study Although there is increasing acceptance for intended home birth as a choice for birthing women, controversy about its safety persists. The varying responses of obstetrical societies to intended home birth provide evidence of contrasting views. A Cochrane review of randomised controlled trials addressing this topic included one small trial and noted that in the absence of adequately sized randomised controlled trials on the topic of intended home compared to intended hospital birth, a peer reviewed protocol be published to guide a systematic review and meta-analysis including observational studies. Reviews to date have been limited by design or methodological issues and none has used a protocol published a priori. Added value of this study Individual studies are underpowered to detect small but potentially important differences in rare outcomes. This study uses a published peer-reviewed protocol and is the largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis comparing outcomes of intended home and hospital birth. We take study design, parity and jurisdictional support for home birth into account. Our study provides much needed information to policy makers, care providers and women and families when planning for birth. Implications of all the available evidence Women who are low risk and who intend to give birth at home do not appear to have a different risk of fetal or neonatal loss compared to a population of similarly low risk women intending to give birth in hospital. ? 2019","Article; fetus risk; health care policy; home delivery; hospital birth; human; labor onset; low risk population; meta analysis; mortality risk; multipara; newborn death; newborn mortality; nullipara; obstetric delivery; outcome assessment; parity; patient safety; peer review; perinatal mortality; study design; systematic review; treatment planning"
"Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms in childhood and suicide-related thoughts and attempts in Canadian youth: test of effect-modifying factors","2019","Purpose: To (1) determine the association between exposure to maternal depressive symptoms in childhood and offspring suicide-related thoughts (SRT) and attempts (SA) in youth and young adults and (2) identify effect measure modifiers (offspring sex, family structure, maternal perceived social support, and social cohesion) of the association in 1. Method: A cohort was constructed by linking all cycles from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a Canadian nationally representative survey, from 1994 to 2009 in 16,903 subjects 0 to 25?years. Exposure to maternal-reported depressive symptoms was measured when offspring were between 0 and 10?years. Offspring self-reported incident and recurrent SRT and SA were measured between 11 and 25?years. Time-to-event models under a counting process framework were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and relative rates (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Effect measure modifiers were examined across adjusted stratum-specific estimates. Results: In offspring exposed to maternal depressive symptoms, the adjusted rates of incident SRT and SA (HR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.37, 2.08; HR: 1.93, 95% CI 1.43, 2.50) and of recurrent SRT and SA (RR: 1.61, 95% CI 1.33, 1.96; RR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.40, 2.36) were significantly elevated compared to non-exposed offspring. The stratum-specific rates of incident and recurrent SRT and SA were significantly elevated in females but not in males. Conclusions: Girls exposed to maternal depressive symptoms in childhood are a target group for childhood suicide preventive strategies. Family-based preventions, and strategies to identify and effectively treat maternal depressive episodes could be beneficial for suicide prevention in offspring. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adolescent; Canada; child; child of impaired parents; cohort analysis; depression; female; human; longitudinal study; male; mother; preschool child; psychology; risk factor; social support; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; young adult; Adolescent; Canada; Child; Child of Impaired Parents; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mothers; Risk Factors; Social Support; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult"
"Cigarette consumption estimates for 71 countries from 1970 to 2015: Systematic collection of comparable data to facilitate quasi-experimental evaluations of national and global tobacco control interventions","2019","Objectives To collect, appraise, select, and report the best available national estimates of cigarette consumption since 1970. Design Systematic collection of comparable data. Setting and population 71 of 214 countries for which searches for national cigarette consumption data were conducted, representing over 95% of global cigarette consumption and 85% of the world's population. Main outcome measures Validated cigarette consumption data covering 1970-2015 were identified for 71 countries. Data quality appraisal was conducted by two research team members in duplicate, with greatest weight given to official government sources. All data were standardised into units of cigarettes consumed per year in each country, a detailed accounting of data quality and sourcing was prepared, and all collected data and metadata were made freely available in an open access dataset. Results Cigarette consumption fell in most countries over the past three decades but trends in country specific consumption were highly variable. For example, China consumed 2.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of cigarettes in 2013, more than Russia (0.36 MMT), the United States (0.28 MMT), Indonesia (0.28 MMT), Japan (0.20 MMT), and the next 35 highest consuming countries combined. The US and Japan achieved reductions of more than 0.1 MMT from a decade earlier, whereas Russian consumption plateaued, and Chinese and Indonesian consumption increased by 0.75 MMT and 0.1 MMT, respectively. These data generally concord with modelled country level data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and have the additional advantage of not smoothing year-over-year discontinuities that are necessary for robust quasi-experimental impact evaluations. Conclusions Before this study, publicly available data on cigarette consumption have been limited; they have been inappropriate for quasi-experimental impact evaluations (modelled data), held privately by companies (proprietary data), or widely dispersed across many national statistical agencies and research organisations (disaggregated data). This new dataset confirms that cigarette consumption has decreased in most countries over the past three decades, but that secular country specific consumption trends are highly variable. The findings underscore the need for more robust processes in data reporting, ideally built into international legal instruments or other mandated processes. To monitor the impact of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and other tobacco control interventions, data on national tobacco production, trade, and sales should be routinely collected and openly reported. ?

"Palliative Care Transitions From Acute Care to Community-Based Care—A Systematic Review","2019","Context: Although the literature on transitions from hospital to the community is extensive, little is known about this experience within the context of palliative care (PC). Objective: We conducted a systematic review to investigate the impact of receiving palliative care in hospital on the transition from hospital to the community. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, ProQuest, and CINAHL from 1995 until April 10, 2018, and extracted relevant references. Eligible articles were published in English, included adult patients receiving PC as inpatients, and explored transitions from hospital to the community. Results: A total of 1514 studies were identified and eight met inclusion criteria. Studies were published recently (>2012; n = 7, 88%). Specialist PC interventions were delivered by multidisciplinary care teams as part of inpatient PC triggers, discharge planning programs, and transitional care programs. Common outcomes reported with significant findings consisted of length of stay (n = 5), discharge support (n = 5), and hospital readmissions (n = 6) for those who received inpatient PC. Most studies were at high risk of bias. Conclusion: Heterogeneity of study designs, outcomes, findings, and poor methodological quality renders it challenging to draw conclusions regarding PC's impact on the transition from hospital to home. Further research should use standardized outcomes with randomized controlled trial and/or propensity matched cohort designs. ? 2019 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","adult; Cinahl; cohort analysis; Embase; emergency care; female; hospital discharge; hospital patient; hospital readmission; human; length of stay; male; Medline; palliative therapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; systematic review; transitional care"
"Intracranial Dural Parafalcine Chondroma: Case Report and Systematic Review of the Literature","2019","Intracranial chondromas are rare, benign neoplasms representing only 0.2%–0.3% of neoplastic intracranial lesions. They commonly originate from the skull base but can infrequently arise from the falx, convexity dura, or ventricular ependyma. Diagnosis requires histopathologic confirmation, as patients present with nonspecific symptoms related to mass effect, and imaging characteristics often resemble meningiomas, oligodendrogliomas, and vascular malformations. We describe the case of a patient harboring a parafalcine dural chondroma that was discovered incidentally and was managed surgically at our institution. We also provide a systematic review of the literature to elucidate incidence, origin, imaging findings, surgical management approaches, and prognosis of this rare tumor. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; cancer surgery; case report; chondroma; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; craniotomy; dural parafalcine chondroma; histopathology; human; incidental finding; information retrieval; intracranial tumor; male; Medline; neuroimaging; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Review; traffic accident; brain tumor; chondroma; diagnostic imaging; dura mater; meningioma; pathology; Adult; Brain Neoplasms; Chondroma; Dura Mater; Humans; Male; Meningeal Neoplasms"
"Outcomes Among Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, and Ticagrelor in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients Who Underwent Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention From the TOTAL Trial","2019","Background: Robust comparisons between oral P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention are lacking. We sought to evaluate outcomes on the basis of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients from the Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI Undergoing Primary PCI (TOTAL) trial. Methods: We grouped 9932 patients according to P2Y12 inhibitor at hospital discharge: clopidogrel (n = 6500; 65.5%), prasugrel (n = 1244; 12.5%), or ticagrelor (n = 2188; 22.0%). The primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or New York Heart Association class IV heart failure was examined at 1 year. Secondary efficacy and safety end points were also assessed. Cox proportional hazard ratios were determined and adjusted for confounders via propensity scoring. Results: Baseline characteristics differing between the 3 groups were mainly age 75 years or older, diabetes, and previous stroke. After adjustment, ticagrelor use was associated with a lower rate of the primary composite outcome compared with clopidogrel (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.91; P < 0.02) and prasugrel (aHR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.89; P = 0.02). Prasugrel use was not associated with a lower rate of the primary outcome compared with clopidogrel (aHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.86-1.39; P > 0.99). Neither prasugrel nor ticagrelor were associated with increased risk of stroke compared with clopidogrel. Compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor was associated with significantly lower rates of major bleeding. Conclusions: In this observational analysis of STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention, ticagrelor was associated with improved outcomes compared with clopidogrel and prasugrel. An appropriately powered randomized trial is needed to confirm these findings. ? 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society","bivalirudin; clopidogrel; enoxaparin; fondaparinux; heparin; prasugrel; ticagrelor; aged; anticoagulant therapy; Article; bleeding; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug use; female; heart failure; heart infarction; hospital discharge; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; New York Heart Association class; observational study; percutaneous coronary intervention; post hoc analysis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; smoking; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; stent thrombosis; target vessel revascularization; thrombectomy; thrombus aspiration; transient ischemic attack; treatment outcome; unstable angina pectoris"
"Hoarding: A meta-analysis of age of onset","2019","Hoarding disorder is present in 2–6% of the population and can have an immense impact on the lives of patients and their families. Before its inclusion the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, pathological hoarding was often characterized as a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder, and several different diagnostic assessment methods were used to identify and characterize it. Although the age of onset of pathological hoarding is an important epidemiological measure, as clarifying the age of onset of hoarding symptoms may allow for early identification and implementation of evidence-based treatments before symptoms become clinically significant, the typical age of onset of hoarding is still uncertain. To that end, this study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of research published in English between the years 1900 and 2016 containing information on age of onset of hoarding symptoms. Twenty-five studies met inclusion criteria. The mean age of onset of hoarding symptoms across studies was 16.7 years old, with evidence of a bimodal distribution of onset.

"Targeted screening for prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in a community setting in India","2019","Background and objectives: Data to support the use of risk scores in screening programs to detect people with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are limited. We evaluated a targeted screening program involving a diabetes risk score in a community setting in India in terms of its uptake, yield, and costs. Methods: In the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program, 2586 individuals (age 30–60 years) without known diabetes were screened using a two-step procedure. Step 1: screening with the Indian Diabetes Risk Score at participants’ homes by trained non-medical staff. Step 2: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) among those with IDRS score ?60 (“screen-positive”) at community-based clinics. Screening costs were expressed in 2013 US dollars. Results: 96.3% of those invited for the IDRS screening consented and 79.1% of screen-positives attended clinics for an OGTT. Older age and male gender were associated with higher IDRS uptake. Female gender, higher monthly household expenditure, and higher IDRS score were associated with higher OGTT uptake. The number needed to screen (yield) to detect one person with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes was two and six, respectively. The average screening cost of identifying one person with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes was $33.8 and $116.5, respectively. Conclusion: This targeted screening program had a high uptake and high yield for prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in a community setting in India. Alternative strategies are likely required to enhance the uptake of screening in certain groups. ? 2019","adult; Article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; health care cost; human; impaired glucose tolerance; India; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oral glucose tolerance test; priority journal; screening; blood; diabetes mellitus; follow up; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; impaired glucose tolerance; lifestyle; mass screening; procedures; prognosis; biological marker; Adult; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; India; Life Style; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Prediabetic State; Prognosis"
"Sprint exercise snacks: a novel approach to increase aerobic fitness","2019","Purpose: Sprint interval training (SIT), involving brief intermittent bursts of vigorous exercise within a single training session, is a time-efficient way to improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). It is unclear whether performing sprints spread throughout the day with much longer (? 1?h) recovery periods can similarly improve CRF, potentially allowing individuals to perform “sprint snacks” throughout the day to gain health benefits. Methods: Healthy, young, inactive adults (~ 22 years, peak oxygen uptake [VO 2 peak] ~ 35?ml?kg ? 1 ?min ? 1 ) were randomly assigned to one of two groups and performed 18 training sessions over 6 wks. Sprint snacks (SS) involved 3 × 20-s ‘all out’ cycling bouts separated by 1–4-h rest (n = 12, 7 females). Traditional SIT involved 3 × 20-s bouts interspersed with 3-min rest within a 10-min training session (n = 16, 7 females). The primary outcome was CRF determined by a VO 2 peak test conducted before and after training. Secondary outcomes included a 150?kJ cycling time trial and exercise enjoyment. Results: Absolute VO 2 peak increased by ~ 6% after SIT and ~ 4% for SS (main effect of time P = 0.002) with no difference between groups (group × time interaction, P = 0.52). 150?kJ time trial performance improved by ~ 13% in SIT and ~ 9% in SS (main effect of time, P &lt; 0.001) with no difference between groups (group × time interaction, P = 0.36). Conclusion: CRF was similarly increased by a protocol involving sprint snacks spread throughout the day and a traditional SIT protocol in which bouts were separated by short recovery periods within a single training session. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adolescent; adult; anaerobic threshold; cardiorespiratory fitness; controlled study; fast food; high intensity interval training; human; male; oxygen consumption; physiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; Adolescent; Adult; Anaerobic Threshold; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; High-Intensity Interval Training; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Snacks"
"Associations of Participation-Focused Strategies and Rehabilitation Service Use With Caregiver Stress After Pediatric Critical Illness","2019","Objective(s): Determine the associations between having participation-focused strategies and receiving rehabilitation services in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with caregiver stress over 6 months post-PICU discharge. Design: Substudy of a data from Wee-Cover, a prospective cohort study. Setting: Two PICU sites. Participants: Caregivers (N=168) of children 1-17 years old admitted into a PICU for ?48 hours. Main Outcome Measures: Data were collected from caregivers at enrollment and 3 and 6 months post-PICU discharge. Caregiver stress was assessed using the Pediatric Inventory for Parents. Having strategies to support their child's participation in home-based activities was assessed using the Participation and Environment Measure (PEM). In PEM, caregivers report on strategies used to support their child's participation in home-based activities. Data were dichotomized (yes, no) to denote having participation-focused strategies and if their child received PICU rehabilitation services. Additional covariates were history of a preexisting condition, child age, length of PICU stay, and change in functional capacities at PICU discharge. Results: History of a preexisting condition, time, and change in functional capacities significantly predicted caregiver stress frequency and difficulty. The interaction of having strategies-by-rehabilitation-by-time significantly predicted caregiver stress frequency and difficulty. Conclusion(s): Results highlight the role of early rehabilitation and the importance of working with caregivers to develop participation-focused strategies to support their child's functioning post-PICU. Families of children with a preexisting condition or those who experience a decrease in function during a PICU stay are susceptible to higher levels of stress and may be a priority population to target for rehabilitation services. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","adolescent; Article; caregiver burden; child; cohort analysis; critical illness; daily life activity; female; functional status; hospital discharge; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; patient participation; pediatric intensive care unit; predictive value; rehabilitation center; caregiver; child parent relation; clinical trial; critical illness; etiology; infant; mental stress; multicenter study; patient participation; pediatric intensive care unit; preschool child; procedures; prospective study; psychology; time factor; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Critical Illness; Female; Humans; Infant; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Male; Parents; Patient Discharge; Patient Participation; Prospective Studies; Stress, Psychological; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Evidence-based medicine: A cornerstone for clinical care but not for quality improvement","2019","Quality improvement (QI) as a clinical improvement science has been criticized for failing to deliver broad patient outcome improvement and for being a top-down regulatory and compliance construct. These critics have argued that the focus of QI should be on increasing adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and, as a result, should be consolidated into research structures with the science of evidence-based medicine (EBM) at the helm. We argue that EBM often overestimates the role of knowledge as the root cause of quality problems and focuses almost exclusively on the effectiveness of care while often neglecting the domains of safety, efficiency, patient-centredness, and equity. Successfully addressing quality problems requires a much broader, systems-based view of health-care delivery. Although essential to clinical decision-making and practice, EBM cannot act as the cornerstone of health system improvement. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; article; clinical decision making; drug safety; health care delivery; human; medical research; patient care; practice guideline; total quality management; treatment failure; evidence based medicine; knowledge; Delivery of Health Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Knowledge; Quality Improvement"

"Predictors of bleeding complications following percutaneous image-guided liver biopsy: A scoping review","2019","PURPOSE Percutaneous tissue biopsy is a mainstay of diagnostic and interventional radiology, providing a minimally invasive method for diagnosing malignant and benign disease. The purpose of this review was to collect and summarize the best available evidence regarding the risk factors associated with bleeding complications in image-guided liver biopsy. METHODS A literature review was performed, searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH) databases for any studies evaluating bleeding complications in image-guided liver biopsy. A total of 68 articles, published between January 1994 and April 2015, were reviewed in full, with 34 ultimately eligible for inclusion in the review. RESULTS Bleeding of any kind occurred in up to 10.9% of image-guided liver biopsies, with major bleeding episodes ranging from 0.1% to 4.6% and minor bleeding events occurring in up to 10.9% of biopsies. The overall rate of bleeding was, however, found to be less than 2%. Several risk factors (patient, operator, and procedure-related) were identified as potentially indicative of an increased risk of post-biopsy bleeding. Patient-related risk factors included patient age (>50 years or <2 years), inpatient status (8/12 vs. 4/12, P < 0.001), comorbidities and/or concurrent diagnoses and coagulation status (rate of bleeding was 3.3% for international normalized ratio [INR] 1.2–1.5 vs. 7.1% for INR >1.5, P < 0.001). There was no consensus on impact of operator experience (>200 biopsies/year vs. <50/year) on post-biopsy bleeding rate. Procedure-related risk factors included needle size (cutting biopsy vs. fine needle aspiration, P < 0.001) and the presence of a patent track on post-biopsy ultrasound (P < 0.001). Lastly there was no difference found between targeted vs. nontargeted biopsies and number of needle passes. CONCLUSION Reported rate of post-biopsy bleeding ranges between 0% and 10.9%, although the vast majority of studies reported bleeding rates under 2%. Several patient, operator, and procedure-related risk factors are associated with a higher risk of bleeding following liver biopsy. ?

"Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association","2019","The increasing recognition of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in adults prompted the development of these evidence-based guidelines on the management of CVS in adults, which was sponsored by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA). GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework was used and a professional librarian performed the literature search. The expert committee included the President of the CVSA who brought a patient perspective into the deliberations. The committee makes recommendations for the prophylaxis of CVS, treatment of acute attacks, diagnosis, and overall management of CVS. The committee strongly recommends that adults with moderate-to-severe CVS receive a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), such as amitriptyline, as a first-line prophylactic medication and receive topiramate or aprepitant as alternate prophylactic medications. Zonisamide or levetiracetam and mitochondrial supplements (Coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and riboflavin) are conditionally recommended as alternate prophylactic medications, either alone or concurrently with other prophylactic medications. For acute attacks, the committee conditionally recommends using serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, and/or triptans, such as sumatriptan or aprepitant to abort symptoms. Emergency department treatment is best achieved with the use of an individualized treatment protocol and shared with the care team (example provided). The committee recommended screening and treatment for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, migraine headache, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use with referral to appropriate allied health services as indicated. Techniques like meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback may be offered as complementary therapy to improve overall well-being and patient care outcomes. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Direct-acting antiviral treatment failure among hepatitis C and HIV-coinfected patients in clinical care","2019","Background. There are limited data on the real-world effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment in patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV-a population with complex challenges including ongoing substance use, cirrhosis, and other comorbidities. We assessed how patient characteristics and the appropriateness of HCV regimen selection according to guidelines affect treatment outcomes in coinfected patients. Methods. We included all patients who initiated DAA treatment between November 2013 and July 2017 in the Canadian Co-Infection Cohort. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA measured between 10 and 18 weeks post-treatment. We defined treatment failure as virologic failure, relapse, or death without achieving SVR. Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate the posterior odds ratios (ORs) associated with patient demographic, clinical, and treatment-related risk factors for treatment failure. Results. Two hundred ninety-five patients initiated DAAs; 31% were treatment-experienced, 29% cirrhotic, and 80% HCV genotype 1. Overall, 92% achieved SVR (263 of 286, 9 unknown), with the highest rates in females (97%) and lowest in cirrhotics (88%) and high-frequency injection drug users (89%). Many patients (38%) were prescribed regimens that were outside current clinical guidelines. This did not appreciably increase the risk of treatment failure-particularly in patients with genotype 1 (prior odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.38-6.0; posterior OR, 1.0; 95% CrI, 0.40-2.5). Conclusions. DAAs were more effective than anticipated in a diverse, real-world coinfected cohort, despite the use of off-label, less efficacious regimens. High-frequency injection drug use and cirrhosis were associated with an increased risk of failure. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"The potential of reducing AST testing in hospital settings","2019","Background: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is regularly ordered with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to assess liver integrity. In many situations, AST testing provides little or no added clinical value, since ALT is more specific and the both enzyme activities highly correlate. The objective of this study is to determine the potential reduction in AST testing, if not performed when ALT results are within reference intervals (RI). Methods: Results for patients >18 years of age for both AST and ALT from the same specimen were obtained for the period January 1, 2017 – December 31, 2017. We calculated frequency of AST and ALT results that had various combinations of results within and above the RI. We also investigated the clinical locations of origin for the samples. Results: In total 87,704 paired samples with both AST and ALT test results were recovered. The total of 73.2% of AST tests for males and 66.9% for females would be eliminated if we performed AST testing only when ALT was increased. However, 7.4% of elevated AST tests would be missed for males and 3.8% for females due to ALT being within limits. Specifically in the outpatient clinics, 79% male and 73% females paired enzyme results were within RI. Only 4% of males and 3% of females had paired results where ALT was within RI while AST > RI. Conclusions: The rate of test results with increased AST while ALT is within the RI is low enough to recommend limiting AST testing only to cases where ALT is above the RI. Our recommendation for AST restriction is to begin with the hospitals outpatient clinics. ? 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; enzyme assay; female; hospital; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; reference value; sex difference; aged; blood; hospital laboratory; liver function test; middle aged; organization and management; outpatient department; sex factor; standard; standards; statistics and numerical data; unnecessary procedure; young adult; Adult; Aged; Alanine Transaminase; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Female; Humans; Laboratories, Hospital; Liver Function Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Procedures and Techniques Utilization; Reference Standards; Sex Factors; Unnecessary Procedures; Young Adult"
"The future burden of cancer in Canada: Long-term cancer incidence projections 2013–2042","2019","Background: Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada and the estimated annual spending associated with cancer is approximately $7.5 billion. Projecting the future burden of cancer in Canada is essential for health planning and evaluation. We aimed to estimate the future incidence of cancer in Canada to 2042. Methods: Age-sex-region-specific cancer incidence data were obtained for the years 1983-2012 and cancer incidence was projected from 2013 to 2042 for the top five cancer sites. The modelling algorithm combined a mixture of cancer projection methods to select the best-fitted model. When the chosen model produced by the modelling algorithm resulted in estimates that were not consistent with expert opinion, an alternate model was selected that took into consideration historical changes in policy, screening and lifestyle behaviours. Incidence projections were made for Canada and its provinces. Results: Lung cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 14,866 cases in men and 19,162 in women in 2042. Colorectal cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 28,146 in men and 21,102 in women. Cases of bladder cancer are projected to rise to 10,708 and 3,364 in men and women, respectively. Breast cancer incidence is predicted to rise to 40,712 and prostate cancer incidence is projected to rise to 92,949. Conclusion: These cancer incidence projections up to 2042 can be used for planning cancer control strategies and prevention programs. Given the ongoing changes in the prevalence of risk factors and in cancer prevention policies, these estimates should be interpreted with caution. ? 2019 The Authors","adult; age distribution; aged; algorithm; Article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; Canada; cancer control; cancer incidence; cancer prevention; cancer risk; cancer screening; colorectal cancer; female; global disease burden; human; lifestyle; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; model; policy; prevalence; priority journal; prostate cancer; sex difference; very elderly; Canada; ethnic group; ethnology; forecasting; incidence; lung tumor; mass screening; neoplasm; register; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Canada; Ethnic Groups; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prevalence; Registries; Risk Factors"
"Effectiveness and Harms of Using Kidneys with Small Renal Tumors from Deceased or Living Donors as a Source of Renal Transplantation: A Systematic Review","2019","Context: Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. Incidence of small renal masses (SRMs), which most frequently are renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), is highest in patients aged >60 yr. The increasing age of donors can lead to the diagnosis of a higher number of SRMs when assessing the patient for transplantation, and so can theoretically decrease the number of kidneys suitable for transplantation. Aiming to increase the pool of kidneys suitable for transplantation, a number of studies have reported their experience using kidneys with SRMs for transplantation. Objective: To systematically review all available evidence on the effectiveness and harm of using kidneys with SRMs as a source of transplantation. Evidence acquisition: A computerized bibliographic search of the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed for all studies reporting outcomes of adult renal transplantation using kidneys with SRMs. Evidence synthesis: Nineteen studies enrolling 109 patients were included and synthesized narratively. The mean recipient age was 44.2 yr, and kidneys used were retrieved from living donors in 86% (94/109) of cases. Tumor excision was performed ex vivo in all cases except for two. The vast majority of excised tumors were RCCs (88/109 patients), and clear-cell subtype was most common. The mean tumor size was 2 cm (range 0.5–6.0 cm) and tumor grade was G1–G2 in 93% (75/81) of patients. With a mean follow-up of 39.9 mo, overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 yr were 97.7%, 95.4%, and 92%, respectively, and the mean graft survival rates 99.2%, 95%, and 95.6%, respectively. Only one local relapse occurred 9 yr after transplantation, which was managed conservatively. Functional outcomes, although infrequently reported, appear to be similar to those of conventional transplants, with 1.6% of these patients needing reoperation. Conclusions: The current literature, although with low-level evidence, suggests that kidneys with excised SRMs are an acceptable source of transplantation without compromising oncological outcomes and with similar functional outcomes to other donor kidneys. Patient summary: Renal transplantation using a kidney with a small renal mass does not appear to increase the risk of cancer recurrence and can be a good option for selected patients after appropriate counseling and allocation. ? 2018 European Association of UrologyRenal transplantation with the use of kidneys with excised low-grade small renal tumors appears to be safe in terms of overall survival, graft survival, and oncological outcomes in appropriate recipients.

"The effect of age on referral to an oncologist and receipt of chemotherapy among small cell lung cancer patients in Ontario, Canada","2019","Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)represents a significant health burden. There is a lack of information about patterns of referral and treatment for older patients over 70 years of age, in comparison to younger patients with SCLC. Materials and methods: A population-based retrospective cohort study was undertaken for patients identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry, Canada. All cases of SCLC diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2010 were eligible. Data were extracted on demographic variables, treatment and outcome. Logistic regression analyses were performed as appropriate. Results: There were 9021 cases of SCLC, with 10% of cases ?80 years and 32.8% of cases aged 70–79 years and 53% male. Older patients were less likely to be referred to a medical oncologist (OR 0.28 ? 80 years, OR 0.60 70–79 years)and less likely to receive chemotherapy (OR 0.19 ? 80 years, OR 0.52 70–79 years)compared to younger patients (age < 70). Age, higher comorbidity and prior receipt of home care services were all prognostic of a lower likelihood of referral to a medical oncologist and receipt of chemotherapy. Local health region was also prognostic for referral to and receipt of chemotherapy, indicative of significant regional variation in practice. Conclusions: Older patients with SCLC are less likely to be referred for treatment and less likely to receive treatment than younger patients. These data represent a potential gap in knowledge translation. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","antineoplastic agent; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; female; geriatric care; groups by age; home care; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oncologist; Ontario; patient referral; priority journal; retrospective study; small cell lung cancer; treatment outcome"
"Genetic influences on delayed reward discounting: A genome-wide prioritized subset approach","2019","Delayed reward discounting (DRD) is a behavioral economic measure of impulsivity that has been consistently associated with addiction. It has also been identified as a promising addiction endophenotype, linking specific sources of genetic variation to individual risk. A challenge in the studies to date is that levels of DRD are often confounded with prior drug use, and previous studies have also had limited genomic scope. The current investigation sought to address these issues by studying DRD in healthy young adults with low levels of substance use (N = 986; 62% female, 100% European ancestry) and investigating genetic variation genome-wide. The genome-wide approach used a prioritized subset design, organizing the tests into theoretically and empirically informed categories and apportioning power accordingly. Three subsets were used: (a) a priori loci implicated by previous studies; (b) high-value addiction (HVA) markers from the recently developed SmokeScreen array; and (c) an atheoretical genome-wide scan. Among a priori loci, a nominally significant association was present between DRD and rs521674 in ADRA2A. No significant HVA loci were detected. One statistically significant genome-wide association was detected (rs13395777, p = 2.8 X 10?8), albeit in an intergenic region of unknown function. These findings are generally not supportive of the previous candidate gene studies and suggest that DRD has a complex genetic architecture that will require considerably larger samples to identify genetic associations more definitively. ? 2018 American Psychological Association.","alpha 2A adrenergic receptor; psychotropic agent; ADRA2A protein, human; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor; ADRA2A gene; adult; Article; clinical decision making; controlled study; delay discounting; drug dependence; drug misuse; European; female; gene frequency; gene function; gene identification; gene structure; genetic association; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; genotype; heredity; human; human experiment; male; molecular genetics; normal human; phenotype; single nucleotide polymorphism; substance use; task performance; young adult; addiction; addiction medicine; behavioral economics; drug dependence; genetics; genome-wide association study; impulsiveness; procedures; psychology; reward; Addiction Medicine; Behavior, Addictive; Delay Discounting; Economics, Behavioral; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2; Reward; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult"
"Return to Sport After Ankle Syndesmotic Injury: A Systematic Review","2019","Context: Ankle syndesmotic injuries present a significant challenge for athletes due to prolonged disability and recovery periods. The optimal management of these injuries and rates of return to sport in athletes remains unclear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate return to sport for athletes after ankle syndesmotic injuries. Data Source: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched for relevant studies from database inception to January 15, 2017, and pertinent data were abstracted. Study Selection: Only studies reporting return-to-sport rates after ankle syndesmotic injuries were included. Study Design: Systematic review. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Data Extraction: Two reviewers extracted data from the included studies, which were stored in a standardized collection form (Microsoft Excel). Recorded data included demographics (eg, author, year of publication, study design), descriptive statistics (eg, patient age, percentage male, number of athletes, sample size), and outcomes (eg, time to return to sport, proportion of those who returned to sport, the self-reported questionnaire the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score). Results: A total of 10 studies and 312 patients with ankle syndesmotic injuries were included in this systematic review. The rate of return to preinjury or any injury level of sport after ankle syndesmotic injuries was 93.8% ± 1.2% and 97.6% ± 1.5%, respectively, for the corresponding 7 and 3 studies that reported this characteristic. The mean time to return to sport was 46.4 days (range, 15.4-70 days), with 55.2 ± 15.8 and 41.7 ± 9.8 days for operative and nonoperative management, respectively. Conclusion: This systematic review found a high rate of return to any as well as preinjury level of sport after ankle syndesmotic injury in both operative and nonoperative treatment groups. However, further high-level studies are required to compare operative and nonoperative treatment groups associated with return to sport after ankle syndesmotic injury. ? 2018 The Author(s).","ankle injury; complication; human; recurrent disease; return to sport; Ankle Injuries; Humans; Recurrence; Return to Sport"
"Prostate-Specific Antigen After Neoadjuvant Androgen Suppression in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Short-Term Androgen Suppression and External Beam Radiation Therapy: Pooled Analysis of Four NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Randomized Clinical Trials","2019","Purpose: To validate whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after neoadjuvant androgen suppression (neoAS) is associated with long-term outcome after neoAS and external beam radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent short-term androgen suppression (AS) in patients with prostate cancer. Methods and Materials: This study included 2404 patients. The patients were treated with neoAS before RT and concurrent AS (without post-RT AS) and were pooled from NRG Oncology/RTOG trials 9202, 9408, 9413, and 9910. Multivariable models were used to test associations between the prespecified dichotomized post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level (?0.1 vs >0.1 ng/mL) groupings, and clinical outcomes. Results: The median follow-up for surviving patients was 9.4 years. The median post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level was 0.3 ng/mL, with 32% of patients having levels ?0.1 ng/mL. Race, Gleason score, tumor stage, node stage, pretreatment PSA level, and duration of neoAS were associated with the groups of patients with PSA levels ?0.1 and >0.1 ng/mL. In univariate analyses, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was associated with increased risks of biochemical failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.04; P <.0001); local failure (HR, 2.51; P <.0001); distant metastases (HR, 1.73; P =.0006); cause-specific mortality (HR, 2.36; P <.0001); and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.24; P =.005). In multivariable models that also included baseline and treatment variables, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was independently associated with increased risk of biochemical failure (HR, 2.00; P <.0001); local failure (HR, 2.33; P <.0001); and cause-specific mortality (HR, 1.75; P =.03). Conclusions: Patients with a PSA level >0.1 ng/mL after neoAS and before the start of RT had less favorable clinical outcomes than patients whose PSA level was ?0.1 ng/mL. The role of post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level relative to PSA levels obtained along the continuum of medical care is not presently defined but could be tested in future clinical trials. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Antigens; Biohazards; Diseases; Oncology; Urology; Androgen suppression; Biochemical failure; External beam radiation therapy; Methods and materials; Multi-variable models; Prostate specific antigen; Radiation therapy oncology groups; Randomized clinical trials; Radiotherapy; prostate specific antigen; antiandrogen; kallikrein; kallikrein-related peptidase 3, human; prostate specific antigen; aged; all cause mortality; Article; biochemical recurrence; cancer staging; distant metastasis; external beam radiotherapy; follow up; Gleason score; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; priority journal; prostate cancer; blood; cancer grading; cause of death; controlled study; multivariate analysis; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology; procedures; prostate tumor; radiotherapy dosage; randomized controlled trial; treatment failure; Aged; Androgen Antagonists; Cause of Death; Humans; Kallikreins; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy Dosage; Treatment Failure"
"Improving reporting of meta-ethnography: The eMERGe reporting guidance [改?元人种志的?告:新??告指南]","2019","Aims: The aim of this study was to provide guidance to improve the completeness and clarity of meta-ethnography reporting. Background: Evidence-based policy and practice require robust evidence syntheses which can further understanding of people's experiences and associated social processes. Meta-ethnography is a rigorous seven-phase qualitative evidence synthesis methodology, developed by Noblit and Hare. Meta-ethnography is used widely in health research, but reporting is often poor quality and this discourages trust in and use of its findings. Meta-ethnography reporting guidance is needed to improve reporting quality. Design: The eMERGe study used a rigorous mixed-methods design and evidence-based methods to develop the novel reporting guidance and explanatory notes. Methods: The study, conducted from 2015 - 2017, comprised of: (1) a methodological systematic review of guidance for meta-ethnography conduct and reporting; (2) a review and audit of published meta-ethnographies to identify good practice principles; (3) international, multidisciplinary consensus-building processes to agree guidance content; (4) innovative development of the guidance and explanatory notes. Findings: Recommendations and good practice for all seven phases of meta-ethnography conduct and reporting were newly identified leading to 19 reporting criteria and accompanying detailed guidance. Conclusion: The bespoke eMERGe Reporting Guidance, which incorporates new methodological developments and advances the methodology, can help researchers to report the important aspects of meta-ethnography. Use of the guidance should raise reporting quality. Better reporting could make assessments of confidence in the findings more robust and increase use of meta-ethnography outputs to improve practice, policy, and service user outcomes in health and other fields. This is the first tailored reporting guideline for meta-ethnography.

"Perfecting practice: a protocol for assessing simulation-based mastery learning and deliberate practice versus self-guided practice for bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy performance","2019","Background: Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is a cornerstone for procedural skill training in residency education. Multiple studies have concluded that SBME is highly effective, superior to traditional clinical education, and translates to improved patient outcomes. Additionally it is widely accepted that mastery learning, which comprises deliberate practice, is essential for expert level performance for routine skills; however, given that highly structured practice is more time and resource-intensive, it is important to assess its value for the acquisition of rarely performed technical skills. The bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy (BAC), a rarely performed, lifesaving procedure, is an ideal skill for evaluating the utility of highly structured practice as it is relevant across many acute care specialties and rare - making it unlikely for learners to have had significant previous training or clinical experience. The purpose of this study is to compare a modified mastery learning approach with deliberate practice versus self-guided practice on technical skill performance using a bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy model. Methods: A multi-centre, randomized study will be conducted at four Canadian and one American residency programs with 160 residents assigned to either mastery learning and deliberate practice (ML + DP), or self-guided practice for BAC. Skill performance, using a global rating scale, will be assessed before, immediately after practice, and 6 months later. The two groups will be compared to assess whether the type of practice impacts performance and skill retention. Discussion: Mastery learning coupled with deliberate practice provides systematic and focused feedback during skill acquisition. However, it is resource-intensive and its efficacy is not fully defined. This multi-centre study will provide generalizable data about the utility of highly structured practice for technical skill acquisition of a rare, lifesaving procedure within postgraduate medical education. Study findings will guide educators in the selection of an optimal training strategy, addressing both short and long term performance. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Canada; clinical competence; clinical trial; computer simulation; controlled study; cricoid cartilage; curriculum; education; emergency medicine; endotracheal intubation; human; medical education; multicenter study; procedures; randomized controlled trial; standards; surgery; thyroid cartilage; tracheostomy; United States; Canada; Clinical Competence; Competency-Based Education; Computer Simulation; Cricoid Cartilage; Educational Measurement; Emergency Medicine; Humans; Internship and Residency; Intubation, Intratracheal; Thyroid Cartilage; Tracheostomy; United States"
"Elucidating the Effect of a Brief Drinking Intervention Using Neuroimaging: A Preliminary Study","2019","Background: Brief interventions have empirical support for acutely reducing alcohol use among non–treatment-seeking heavy drinkers. Neuroimaging techniques allow for the examination of the neurobiological effect of behavioral interventions, probing brain systems putatively involved in clinical response to treatment. Few studies have prospectively evaluated whether psychosocial interventions attenuate neural cue reactivity that in turn reduces drinking in the same population. This study aimed to examine the effect of a brief intervention on drinking outcomes, neural alcohol cue reactivity, and the ability of neural alcohol cue reactivity to prospectively predict drinking outcomes. Methods: Non–treatment-seeking heavy drinking participants were randomized to receive a brief interview intervention (n?=?22) or an attention-matched control (n?=?24). Immediately following the intervention or control, participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan comprised of the alcohol taste cues paradigm. Four weeks after the intervention (or control), participants completed a follow-up visit to report on their past-month drinking. Baseline and follow-up percent heavy drinking days (PHDD) were calculated for each participant. Results: There was no significant effect of the brief intervention on PHDD at follow-up or on modulating neural activation to alcohol relative to water taste cues. There was a significant association between neural response to alcohol taste cues and PHDD across groups (Z?>?2.3, p?<?0.05), such that individuals who had greater neural reactivity to alcohol taste cues in the precuneus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) had fewer PHDD at follow-up. Conclusions: This study did not find an effect of the brief intervention on alcohol use in this sample, and the intervention was not associated with differential neural alcohol cue reactivity. Nevertheless, greater activation of the precuneus and PFC during alcohol cue exposure predicted less alcohol use prospectively suggesting that these neural substrates subserve the effects of alcohol cues on drinking behavior. ? 2018 by the Research Society on Alcoholism","alcohol consumption; Article; association; clinical article; controlled study; drinking behavior; female; follow up; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; nerve potential; neuroimaging; precuneus; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; randomized controlled trial"
"General psychopathology, internalising and externalising in children and functional outcomes in late adolescence","2019","Background: Internalising and externalising problems commonly co-occur in childhood. Yet, few developmental models describing the structure of child psychopathology appropriately account for this comorbidity. We evaluate a model of childhood psychopathology that separates the unique and shared contribution of individual psychological symptoms into specific internalising, externalising and general psychopathology factors and assess how these general and specific factors predict long-term outcomes concerning criminal behaviour, academic achievement and affective symptoms in three independent cohorts. Methods: Data were drawn from independent birth cohorts (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), N?=?11,612; Generation R, N?=?7,946; Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN), N?=?408). Child psychopathology was assessed between 4 and 8?years using a range of diagnostic and questionnaire-based measures, and multiple informants. First, structural equation models were used to assess the fit of hypothesised models of shared and unique components of psychopathology in all cohorts. Once the model was chosen, linear/logistic regressions were used to investigate whether these factors were associated with important outcomes such as criminal behaviour, academic achievement and well-being from late adolescence/early adulthood. Results: The model that included specific factors for internalising/externalising and a general psychopathology factor capturing variance shared between symptoms regardless of their classification fits well for all of the cohorts. As hypothesised, general psychopathology factor scores were predictive of all outcomes of later functioning, while specific internalising factor scores predicted later internalising outcomes. Specific externalising factor scores, capturing variance not shared by any other psychological symptoms, were not predictive of later outcomes. Conclusions: Early symptoms of psychopathology carry information that is syndrome-specific as well as indicative of general vulnerability and the informant reporting on the child. The ‘general psychopathology factor' might be more relevant for long-term outcomes than specific symptoms. These findings emphasise the importance of considering the co-occurrence of common internalising and externalising problems in childhood when considering long-term impact. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The effects of probiotics on symptoms of depression: Protocol for a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial","2020","Background: A growing body of evidence has linked mental health outcomes to the gut microbiome. This has led to the investigation of the GI tract as a target for novel treatments and interventions for depression, including probiotic supplementation. Our recent pilot study provided the first evidence of probiotics improving symptoms of depression in treatment-naive depressed patients. To further support and expand upon this evidence, data from the pilot study were used to plan a 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of probiotics on depression. Here, we report the protocol for this trial. Methods: Participants diagnosed with depression will orally consume a probiotic supplement containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum or placebo once daily. Participants will undergo assessments measuring clinical outcomes using a battery of validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Sleep architecture and quality will be measured using polysomnography. Neuroimaging data will be collected using magnetic resonance imaging to examine functional and structural neurophysiological changes. Molecular data will be collected from blood, stool, and urine samples to examine cytokine levels and explore potential genes and proteins that may predict outcomes in depression. Results: We expect results to replicate and expand on our pilot data demonstrating that probiotics may be effective in alleviating symptoms of depression, and to find biomarkers that will predict these outcomes. Conclusions: The findings from this study will add to the growing body of research in this emerging field, which eventually may provide evidence for probiotics having a role in alleviating symptoms of depression. ? 2019 S.

"Factors associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentration in two cohorts of pregnant women in southern ontario, canada","2019","Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is widely reported, but whether this applies in North America is unclear since no population-based surveys of vitamin D status in pregnancy exist in Canada or the United States. The objectives were to assess (i) the intake and sources of vitamin D, (ii) vitamin D status, and (iii) factors associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentration in two cohorts of pregnant women from Southern Ontario, Canada, studied over a span of 14 years. Maternal characteristics, physical measurements, fasting blood samples and nutrient intake were obtained at enrolment in 332 pregnant women from the Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In early Life (FAMILY) study and 191 from the Be Healthy in Pregnancy (BHIP) study. Serum 25-OHD was measured by LC/MS-MS. The median (Q1, Q3) total vitamin D intake was 383 IU/day (327, 551) in the FAMILY study and 554 IU/day (437, 796) in the BHIP study. Supplemental vitamin D represented 64% of total intake in participants in FAMILY and 78% in BHIP. The mean (SD) serum 25-OHD was 76.5 (32.9) nmol/L in FAMILY and 79.7 (22.3) nmol/L in BHIP. Being of European descent and blood sampling in the summer season were significantly associated with a higher maternal serum 25-OHD concentration. In summary, health care practitioners should be aware that vitamin D status is sufficient in the majority of pregnant Canadian women of European ancestry, likely due to sun exposure. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"First report of ranavirus mortality in a common snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina","2019","An adult male snapping turtle with marked palpebral edema and multifocal skin ulceration was found alive in a marsh in southern Ontario in summer 2017. The turtle was transported to a rehabilitation facility and died 4 d after arrival. The carcass was submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative for post-mortem examination. Gross lesions included ulcerative conjunctivitis, necrotizing stomatitis, and splenomegaly. Microscopically, this corresponded to multisystemic fibrinonecrotizing vasculitis and severe fibrinous splenic necrosis. Liver tissue tested positive for frog virus 3-like ranavirus and negative for herpesvirus via polymerase chain reaction. The gross and microscopic lesions were consistent with previous reports of ranavirus infection in turtles and were severe enough to have been the cause of death in this case. This is the first report of morbidity and mortality in a common snapping turtle with a ranavirus infection, and the first reported case of ranavirus infection in a reptile in Canada. Ranaviruses are considered to be an emerging infectious disease in chelonians as they are increasing in distribution, prevalence, and host range. ?

"Decoding and modelling of time series count data using Poisson hidden Markov model and Markov ordinal logistic regression models","2019","Hidden Markov models are stochastic models in which the observations are assumed to follow a mixture distribution, but the parameters of the components are governed by a Markov chain which is unobservable. The issues related to the estimation of Poisson-hidden Markov models in which the observations are coming from mixture of Poisson distributions and the parameters of the component Poisson distributions are governed by an m-state Markov chain with an unknown transition probability matrix are explained here. These methods were applied to the data on Vibrio cholerae counts reported every month for 11-year span at Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Using Viterbi algorithm, the best estimate of the state sequence was obtained and hence the transition probability matrix. The mean passage time between the states were estimated. The 95% confidence interval for the mean passage time was estimated via Monte Carlo simulation. The three hidden states of the estimated Markov chain are labelled as ‘Low’, ‘Moderate’ and ‘High’ with the mean counts of 1.4, 6.6 and 20.2 and the estimated average duration of stay of 3, 3 and 4 months, respectively.

"Salsalate, but not metformin or canagliflozin, slows kidney cyst growth in an adult-onset mouse model of polycystic kidney disease","2019","Background: Multiple preclinical studies have highlighted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a potential therapeutic target for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Both metformin and canagliflozin indirectly activate AMPK by inhibiting mitochondrial function, while salsalate is a direct AMPK activator. Metformin, canagliflozin and salsalate (a prodrug dimer of salicylate) are approved for clinical use with excellent safety profile. Although metformin treatment had been shown to attenuate experimental cystic kidney disease, there are concerns that therapeutic AMPK activation in human kidney might require a higher oral metformin dose than can be achieved clinically. Methods: In this study, we tested metformin-based combination therapies for their additive (metformin plus canagliflozin) and synergistic (metformin plus salsalate) effects and each drug individually in an adult-onset conditional Pkd1 knock-out mouse model (n = 20 male/group) using dosages expected to yield clinically relevant drug levels. Findings: Compared to untreated mutant mice, treatment with salsalate or metformin plus salsalate improved kidney survival (i.e. blood urea nitrogen <20 mmol/L at the time of sacrifice) and reduced cystic kidney disease severity. However, the effects of metformin plus salsalate did not differ from salsalate alone; and neither metformin nor canagliflozin was effective. Protein expression and phosphorylation analyses indicated that salsalate treatment was associated with reduction in mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activity and cellular proliferation in Pkd1 mutant mouse kidneys. Global gene expression analyses suggested that these effects were linked to restoration of mitochondrial function and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis. Interpretation: Salsalate is a highly promising candidate for drug repurposing and clinical testing in ADPKD. ? 2019 The Authors","canagliflozin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; metformin; salsalate; cyclic AMP; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; metformin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; polycystic kidney disease 1 protein; polycystin; salicylic acid derivative; salsalate; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell proliferation; combination drug therapy; controlled study; drug potentiation; enzyme activation; kidney polycystic disease; kidney tissue; male; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; urea nitrogen blood level; animal; biopsy; cyst; disease model; drug monitoring; genetics; kidney polycystic disease; knockout mouse; metabolism; mutation; pathology; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Biopsy; Cyclic AMP; Cysts; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Monitoring; Metformin; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Dominant; Salicylates; TRPP Cation Channels"

"Characterization of Radioprotective, Radiomitigative and Bystander Signaling Modulating Effects of Endogenous Metabolites - Phenylacetate, Ursodeoxycholate and Tauroursodeoxycholate - On HCT116 Human Colon Carcinoma Cell Line","2019","Exposures to ionizing radiation can cause depletion in stem cell reservoirs and lead to chronic injury processes that exacerbate carcinogenic and inflammatory responses. Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type cancer cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection in vitro. These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties. ? 2019 by Radiation Research Society.","cesium 137; phenylacetic acid; protein p53; tauroursodeoxycholic acid; ursodeoxycholic acid; acetic acid; phenol derivative; phenyl acetate; radioprotective agent; taurochenodeoxycholic acid; tauroursodeoxycholic acid; ursodeoxycholic acid; Article; bystander effect; cancer stem cell; cell survival; cell viability; clonogenesis; clonogenic assay; colon carcinoma; controlled study; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; ionizing radiation; priority journal; radiation exposure; radiation injury; radiation protection; radiation response; signal transduction; bystander effect; colon tumor; drug effect; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction; Acetates; Bystander Effect; Cell Survival; Colonic Neoplasms; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Phenols; Radiation-Protective Agents; Signal Transduction; Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid; Ursodeoxycholic Acid"
"A systematic survey identified 36 criteria for assessing effect modification claims in randomized trials or meta-analyses","2019","Objective: The objective of the study was to systematically survey the methodological literature and collect suggested criteria for assessing the credibility of effect modification and associated rationales. Study Design and Setting: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and WorldCat up to March 2018 for publications providing guidance for assessing the credibility of effect modification identified in randomized trials or meta-analyses. Teams of two investigators independently identified eligible publications and extracted credibility criteria and authors’ rationale, reaching consensus through discussion. We created a taxonomy of criteria that we iteratively refined during data abstraction. Results: We identified 150 eligible publications that provided 36 criteria and associated rationales. Frequent criteria included significant test for interaction (n = 54), a priori hypothesis (n = 49), providing a causal explanation (n = 47), accounting for multiplicity (n = 45), testing a small number of effect modifiers (n = 38), and prespecification of analytic details (n = 39). For some criteria, we found more than one rationale; some criteria were connected through a common rationale. For some criteria, experts disagreed regarding their suitability (e.g., added value of stratified randomization; trustworthiness of biologic rationales). Conclusion: Methodologists have expended substantial intellectual energy providing criteria for critical appraisal of apparent effect modification. Our survey highlights popular criteria, expert agreement and disagreement, and where more work is needed, including testing criteria in practice. ? 2019","Article; checklist; human; meta analysis (topic); practice guideline; priority journal; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; taxonomy"
"Synthesis of glycopolymers with specificity for bacterial strains via bacteria-guided polymerization","2019","Identifying probiotics and pathogens is of great interest to the health of the human body. It is critical to develop microbiota-targeted therapies to have high specificity including strain specificity. In this study, we have utilized E. coli MG1655 bacteria as living templates to synthesize glycopolymers in situ with high selectivity. By this bacteria-sugar monomer-aptation-polymerization (BS-MAP) method, we have obtained glycopolymers from the surface of bacteria which can recognize template bacteria from two strains of E. coli and the specific bacteria-binding ability of glycopolymers was confirmed by both bacterial aggregation experiment and QCM-D measurements. Furthermore, the synthesized glycopolymers have shown a powerful inhibitory ability which can prevent bacteria from harming cells in both anti-infection and co-culture tests. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Escherichia coli; Probiotics; Anti-infection; Bacterial strains; Binding abilities; Co-cultures; Glycopolymers; High selectivity; High specificity; Human bodies; Polymerization"
"The Pediatric Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (pTESS): Validation of a Self-reported Functional Outcomes Tool for Children with Extremity Tumors","2019","Background The physical function of children with sarcoma after surgery has not been studied explicitly. This paucity of research is partly because of the lack of a sufficiently sensitive pediatric functional measure. The goal of this study was to establish and validate a standardized measure of physical function in pediatric patients with extremity tumors. Questions/purposes (1) What is the best format and content for new upper- and lower-extremity measures of physical function in the pediatric population? (2) Do the new measures exhibit floor and/or ceiling effects, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability? (3) Are the new measures valid?MethodsIn Phase 1, interviews with 17 consecutive children and adolescents with bone tumors were conducted to modify the format and content of draft versions of the pediatric Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (pTESS). In Phase 2, the pTESS was formally translated into French. In Phase 3, 122 participants between 7 and 17.9 years old with malignant or benign-aggressive bone tumors completed the limb-specific measure on two occasions. Older adolescents also completed the adult TESS. Floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity were evaluated. Results Feedback from interviews resulted in the removal, addition, and modification of draft items, and the pTESS-Leg and pTESS-Arm questionnaires were finalized. Both versions exhibited no floor or ceiling effects and high internal consistency (α > 0.92). The test-retest reliability was excellent for the pTESS-Leg (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97) and good for the pTESS-Arm (ICC = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.61-0.96). Known-group validity (ability to discriminate between groups) was demonstrated by lower mean pTESS-Leg scores for participants using gait aids or braces (mean = 68; SD = 21) than for those who did not (mean = 87; SD = 11; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between pTESS arm scores among respondents using a brace (n = 5; mean = 73; SD = 11) and those without (n = 22; mean = 83; SD = 19; p = 0.13). To evaluate construct validity, we tested a priori hypotheses. The duration since chemotherapy correlated moderately with higher pTESS-Leg scores (r = 0.4; p < 0.001) but not with pTESS-Arm scores (r = 0.1; p = 0.80), and the duration since tumor resection correlated moderately with higher pTESS-Leg scores (r = 0.4; p < 0.001) but not pTESS-Arm scores (r = 0.2; p = 0.4). Higher VAS scores (that is, it was harder to do things) antecorrelated with both pTESS versions (pTESS-Leg: r = -0.7; p < 0.001; pTESS-Arm: r = -0.8; p < 0.001). To assess criterion validity, we compared the pTESS with the current ""gold standard"" (adult TESS). Among adolescents, strong correlations were observed between the TESS and pTESS-Leg (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) and pTESS-Arm (r = 0.9, p = 0.007). Conclusion s:Both pTESS versions exhibited no floor or ceiling effects and had high internal consistency. The pTESS-Leg demonstrated excellent reliability and validity, and the pTESS-Arm demonstrated good reliability and reasonable validity. The pTESS is recommended for cross-sectional evaluation of self-reported physical function in pediatric patients with bone tumors.Level of EvidenceLevel II, outcome measurement development. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Parallel modulation of interhemispheric inhibition and the size of a cortical hand muscle representation during active contraction","2019","Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between motor cortexes is thought to suppress unwanted mirror movements during voluntary behaviors and can be assessed using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The magnitude of IHI may be related to the size of the cortical representation for a given muscle as a mechanism for facilitating unimanual control. To date, the relationship between IHI and cortical muscle representations remains unknown. Fifteen healthy, right-handed individuals participated in the present study. IHI was examined in the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle by delivering conditioning TMS to ipsilateral (right) primary motor cortex (M1) followed by a test TMS pulse to contralateral (left) M1. The size of the FDI representation in M1 was determined by delivering suprathreshold TMS over a 5 × 5-cm grid centered on the FDI motor hotspot of the left M1. Both IHI and cortical territory were obtained during three conditions: rest, contralateral (right) FDI contraction, and ipsilateral (left) FDI contraction. Results indicate a significant association between IHI and the size of the FDI representation only in the context of contraction and not when the FDI muscle was relaxed. Specifically, reduced IHI corresponded to larger cortical FDI representations during both contralateral and ipsilateral contraction. These data demonstrate that, for a muscle of the hand, the magnitude of IHI and the cortical territory are associated within the context of muscle contraction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provides evidence from noninvasive brain stimulation that communication between the motor cortexes of the two hemispheres plays a role in shaping the motor cortical map that outputs to a hand muscle during active contraction of that muscle. This relationship exists only when the hand muscle is contracted. The findings presented further our understanding of motor control during unilateral movement and may inform future research targeting clinical populations that exhibit impaired unilateral control. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","adult; article; brain depth stimulation; clinical article; controlled study; female; hand muscle; human; human experiment; male; modulation; motor control; muscle contractility; muscle contraction; primary motor cortex; rest; transcranial magnetic stimulation"
"Ethics in the era of big data","2019","Data science is reshaping our world in ways we never experienced before. This transformation carries an enormous potential to improve mental health care and patient assessment. However, it is not only data gathering that is increasing at a high velocity, but also relevant ethical issues derived from its ownership, analysis, and impact in our lives. In this chapter, we review potential applications of big data analytics and associated dilemmas that may arise from it. We start by discussing issues linked to data itself, involving ownership, privacy, transparency, and reliability. Then, we proceed to discuss what may happen following data processing, and the implementation of predictive models = in real scenarios, focusing on the implications for clinicians, scientists, and patients. We highlight that while it is necessary to develop more strict regulations for handling sensitive data, we must also pay attention to the problem of overregulation, which could create unnecessary obstacles for data science and slow down the potential benefits it may have in our society. ?

"Management of acute musculoskeletal pain (excluding low back pain): Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials","2019","Introduction Acute, non-low back-related musculoskeletal pain is common and associated with significant socioeconomic costs. No review has evaluated all interventional studies for acute musculoskeletal pain, which limits attempts to make inferences regarding the relative effectiveness of treatments. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials evaluating therapies for acute musculoskeletal pain (excluding low back pain). We will identify eligible, English-language, trials by a systematic search of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Medline, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to February 2018. Eligible trials will: (1) enrol patients presenting with acute, non-low back-related musculoskeletal pain (duration of pain ?4 weeks), and (2) randomise patients to alternative interventions or an intervention and a placebo/sham arm. Fractures will be considered ineligible, unless they are non-surgical and therapy is directed at pain relief. Pairs of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, screen titles and abstracts of identified citations, review the full texts of potentially eligible trials and extract information from eligible trials. We will use a modified Cochrane instrument to evaluate risk of bias. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion to achieve consensus. We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to evaluate the quality of evidence supporting treatment effects. When possible, we will conduct: (1) in direct comparisons, a random-effect meta-analysis to establish the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions on patient-important outcomes; and (2) multiple treatment comparison meta-analysis to assess the relative effects of treatments. We will use a priori hypotheses to explain heterogeneity between studies. We will use STATA V.14.2 for all analyses. Ethics and dissemination No research ethics approval is required for this systematic review, as no confidential patient data will be used. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal, conference presentations and will inform a clinical practice guideline.

"Trends in survival based on treatment modality for esophageal cancer: a population-based study","2019","OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to examine the trends in treatment modalities and the respective survival rates for esophageal cancer in the province of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: This is a population-based study of all esophageal cancer cases diagnosed in Ontario between 2007 and 2015, including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, with known disease stage. Other characteristics include sex, age, date of diagnosis, and treatment modalities. Treatment modalities were classified as no-treatment, radiation only or chemotherapy only, chemoradiation, and surgical resection. RESULTS: In total, 2572 patients were identified with esophageal cancer from 2007 to 2015, of which 2014 (78.3%) were male. The mean age at diagnosis was 66.6 (SD = 11.7) years. Survival rate increased over time in patients who underwent chemoradiation or surgical resection but remained unchanged for the radiation-only or chemotherapy-only group and decreased for the no-treatment group. Survival considerably improved (15-20%) for patients with stages I-III disease. CONCLUSIONS: The positive trends in the survival rate for esophageal patients could be due to adoption of multimodal therapy. Despite a lower proportion of advanced disease among patients over 80, they received less curative treatments compared with other age groups. Further studies are required to identify strategies to maximize survival for patients with stage IV disease, and patients 80 years and older.",""
"Implementing smoking cessation within cancer treatment centres and potential economic impacts","2019","Background: Although the health benefits of smoking cessation in newly diagnosed cancer patients are well established, systematic efforts to help cancer patients stop smoking have rarely been implemented in cancer centres. Methods: Starting in 2012, the 14 regional cancer centres overseen by Cancer Care Ontario in the province of Ontario, Canada began to screen ambulatory cancer patients for their smoking status, to provide smokers with advice on the health benefits of quitting and to offer referral to smoking cessation services. Multiple initiatives were undertaken to educate healthcare providers and patients on the health benefits of cessation. Critical to the success of the initiative was strong leadership from Cancer Care Ontario executives and regional vice presidents, advice from an advisory committee of smoking cessation experts, engagement of regional champions and support from a provincial secretariat. The quarterly review of performance metrics was an important driver of change. Results: Most cancer centres now screen in excess of 75% of ambulatory patients but rates for the acceptance of a referral to smoking cessation services remain low (less than 25%). Introduction of an opt-out referral process appears to increase referral acceptance. Economic analyses suggest that smoking cessation is cost-effective in a cancer centre environment. Conclusions: Although there are barriers to the implementation of smoking cessation in cancer centres, it is possible to change the culture to one in which smoking cessation is considered part of high-quality treatment. ?

"Peer influence, Frontostriatal connectivity, and delay discounting in African American emerging adults","2020","Prior research has demonstrated the importance of delay discounting in adverse health behaviors, such as addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, risk taking, and obesity. Nevertheless, the functional connectivity of neural circuitry associated with delay discounting and the ways in which the social environment may influence frontostriatal connectivity remain largely unknown, particularly in African Americans. Building on recent literature implicating frontostriatal connectivity during active delay discounting decision making and at rest, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the association between delay discounting and frontostriatal resting state connectivity (rsFC). We also examined the capacity of social relationships with parents and peers to longitudinally predict frontostriatal rsFC. The study cohort was composed of 91 rural African American emerging adults followed over a 6-year period. Greater (i.e., more positive) frontostriatal rsFC was associated with decreased delay discounting (i.e., less impulsive decision making). In addition, peer relationships at ages 20 and 21 significantly predicted frontostriatal rsFC at age 25 above and beyond parental influence. A significant indirect effect of peer affiliation on delay discounting through frontostriatal rsFC also emerged. These results indicate a role of frontostriatal connectivity in delay discounting decision making and highlight peers’ unique influence on decision making behaviors through frontostriatal rsFC during emerging adulthood. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; adulthood; African American; article; cohort analysis; decision making; delay discounting; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; major clinical study; male; peer group; peer pressure; rest; social interaction"
"Lactobacilli Degrade Wheat Amylase Trypsin Inhibitors to Reduce Intestinal Dysfunction Induced by Immunogenic Wheat Proteins","2019","Background &amp; Aims: Wheat-related disorders, a spectrum of conditions induced by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals, have been increasing in prevalence. Patients with celiac disease have gluten-specific immune responses, but the contribution of non-gluten proteins to symptoms in patients with celiac disease or other wheat-related disorders is controversial. Methods: C57BL/6 (control), Myd88–/–, Ticam1–/–, and Il15–/– mice were placed on diets that lacked wheat or gluten, with or without wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), for 1 week. Small intestine tissues were collected and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were measured; we also investigated gut permeability and intestinal transit. Control mice fed ATIs for 1 week were gavaged daily with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low ATI-degrading capacity. Nonobese diabetic/DQ8 mice were sensitized to gluten and fed an ATI diet, a gluten-containing diet or a diet with ATIs and gluten for 2 weeks. Mice were also treated with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low ATI-degrading capacity. Intestinal tissues were collected and IELs, gene expression, gut permeability and intestinal microbiota profiles were measured. Results: In intestinal tissues from control mice, ATIs induced an innate immune response by activation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling to MD2 and CD14, and caused barrier dysfunction in the absence of mucosal damage. Administration of ATIs to gluten-sensitized mice expressing HLA-DQ8 increased intestinal inflammation in response to gluten in the diet. We found ATIs to be degraded by Lactobacillus, which reduced the inflammatory effects of ATIs. Conclusions: ATIs mediate wheat-induced intestinal dysfunction in wild-type mice and exacerbate inflammation to gluten in susceptible mice. Microbiome-modulating strategies, such as administration of bacteria with ATI-degrading capacity, may be effective in patients with wheat-sensitive disorders. ? 2019 AGA Institute","amylase trypsin inhibitor; gluten; HLA DQ8 antigen; immunoglobulin A; interleukin 15; interleukin 6; myeloid differentiation factor 88; trypsin inhibitor; unclassified drug; amylase; gliadin; trypsin inhibitor; adjuvant therapy; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; body weight loss; celiac disease; diabetes mellitus; diet supplementation; diet therapy; digestive system function disorder; disease predisposition; enteritis; enteropathy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; eosinophil; gastrointestinal transit; gluten free diet; histology; illness behavior; immunogenicity; immunohistochemistry; immunopathology; intestine cell; intestine flora; intestine villus; intraepithelial lymphocyte; jejunum tissue; knockout mouse; Lactobacillus; metabolic capacity; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein diet; RNA analysis; signal transduction; single drug dose; small intestine tissue; spleen cell; TLR signaling; wheat; wild type; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; disease model; drug effect; human; immunology; innate immunity; intestine flora; Lactobacillus; metabolism; pathophysiology; procedures; randomization; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; wheat; Amylases; Animals; Celiac Disease; Diet, Gluten-Free; Disease Models, Animal; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gliadin; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Lactobacillus; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Random Allocation; Reference Values; Sensitivity and Specificity; Triticum; Trypsin Inhibitors"
"Autophagy: Roles in intestinal mucosal homeostasis and inflammation","2019","The intestinal mucosa is a site of multiple stressors and forms the barrier between the internal and external environment. In the intestine, a complex interplay between the microbiota, epithelial barrier and the local immune system maintains homeostasis and promotes a healthy gut. One of the major cellular catabolic processes that regulate this homeostasis is autophagy. Autophagy is required to maintain anti-microbial defense, epithelial barrier integrity and mucosal immune response. Dysregulation of the autophagy process causes disruption of several aspects of the intestinal epithelium and the immune system that can lead to an inappropriate immune response and subsequent inflammation. Genome-wide association studies have found an association between several risk loci in autophagy genes and inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of the current review is to provide an update on the role of autophagy in intestinal mucosal physiology and in the control of inappropriate inflammation. ? 2019 The Author(s).","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; autophagosome; autophagy; B lymphocyte; dendritic cell; digestive system inflammation; enteroendocrine cell; enzyme inhibition; genome-wide association study; goblet cell; homeostasis; human; immune response; immune system; immunocompetent cell; intestine epithelium; intestine epithelium cell; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; macroautophagy; nonhuman; Paneth cell; priority journal; Review; T lymphocyte; animal; autophagy; homeostasis; immunology; inflammation; intestine mucosa; mouse; pathophysiology; physiology; rat; Animals; Autophagy; Homeostasis; Humans; Inflammation; Intestinal Mucosa; Mice; Rats"

"Co-designing Services for Youth With Mental Health Issues: Novel Elicitation Approaches","2019","Experience-based co-design (EBCD) is an innovative, evidence-based approach to health and social system change based on principles of participatory action research, narrative and learning theory, and design thinking. Unique elicitation strategies such as experience mapping, trigger videos, and prototype development are used in EBCD to engage service users and service providers in a collaborative process of identifying touchpoints and solutions to system-level problems. In this article, we present findings from interviewing a purposeful sample of 18 participants (4 youth, 6 service providers, 6 family members, and 2 employers) across three co-design projects designed to address either mental health or employment services for youth (aged 16–24) with mental health issues in one urban center. Through interviewing participants, perceptions were explored relating to three elicitation techniques: creating experience maps, creating and viewing trigger videos, and co-designing visual “prototype” solutions. Analysis of participants’ comments indicated that these techniques can be powerful tools to foster mutual understanding and collaborative ideas, but they require a social, spatial, and temporal context that optimizes their value. A “safe space” is needed within which the essential elements of elicitation—building trust, finding voice, sharing perspectives, and creating a common vision—can occur. Three core, overlapping processes of co-design elicitation were identified: “building common perspectives,” “building mutual understanding,” and “building innovation.” We present a conceptual framework depicting the interplay of processes and elicitation techniques, essential to building mutual understanding and innovation during the EBCD process. ?

"GRADE approach to rate the certainty from a network meta-analysis: avoiding spurious judgments of imprecision in sparse networks","2019","When direct and indirect estimates of treatment effects are coherent, network meta-analysis (NMA) estimates should have increased precision (narrower confidence or credible intervals compared with relying on direct estimates alone), a benefit of NMA. We have, however, observed cases of sparse networks in which combining direct and indirect estimates results in marked widening of the confidence intervals. In many cases, the assumption of common between-study heterogeneity across the network seems to be responsible for this counterintuitive result. Although the assumption of common between-study heterogeneity across paired comparisons may, in many cases, not be appropriate, it is required to ensure the feasibility of estimating NMA treatment effects. This is especially the case in sparse networks, in which data are insufficient to reliably estimate different variances across the network. The result, however, may be spuriously wide confidence intervals for some of the comparisons in the network (and, in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, inappropriately low ratings of the certainty of the evidence through rating down for serious imprecision). Systematic reviewers should be aware of the problem and plan sensitivity analyses that produce intuitively sensible confidence intervals. These sensitivity analyses may include using informative priors for the between-study heterogeneity parameter in the Bayesian framework and the use of fixed effects models. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","article; controlled study; decision making; feasibility study; human; meta analysis; network meta-analysis; practice guideline; sensitivity analysis; Bayes theorem; evidence based medicine; outcome assessment; practice guideline; procedures; reproducibility; treatment outcome; Bayes Theorem; Evidence-Based Medicine; GRADE Approach; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Practice Guidelines as Topic; Reproducibility of Results; Treatment Outcome"
"Lipoprotein(a) Levels and the Risk of Myocardial Infarction Among 7 Ethnic Groups","2019","BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels predict the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in populations of European ancestry; however, few data are available for other ethnic groups. Furthermore, differences in isoform size distribution and the associated Lp(a) concentrations have not fully been characterized between ethnic groups. METHODS: We studied 6086 cases of first MI and 6857 controls from the INTERHEART study that were stratified by ethnicity and adjusted for age and sex. A total of 775 Africans, 4443 Chinese, 1352 Arabs, 1856 Europeans, 1469 Latin Americans, 1829 South Asians, and 1221 Southeast Asians were included in the study. Lp(a) concentration was measured in each participant using an assay that was insensitive to isoform size, with isoform size being assessed by Western blot in a subset of 4219 participants. RESULTS: Variations in Lp(a) concentrations and isoform size distributions were observed between populations, with Africans having the highest Lp(a) concentration (median=27.2 mg/dL) and smallest isoform size (median=24 kringle IV repeats). Chinese samples had the lowest concentration (median=7.8 mg/dL) and largest isoform sizes (median=28). Overall, high Lp(a) concentrations (>50 mg/dL) were associated with an increased risk of MI (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.32-1.67; P<0.001). The association was independent of established MI risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, smoking, high blood pressure, and apolipoprotein B and A ratio. An inverse association was observed between isoform size and Lp(a) concentration, which was consistent across ethnic groups. Larger isoforms tended to be associated with a lower risk of MI, but this relationship was not present after adjustment for concentration. Consistent with variations in Lp(a) concentration across populations, the population-attributable risk of high Lp(a) for MI varied from 0% in Africans to 9.5% in South Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Lp(a) concentration and isoform size varied markedly between ethnic groups. Higher Lp(a) concentrations were associated with an increased risk of MI and carried an especially high population burden in South Asians and Latin Americans. Isoform size was inversely associated with Lp(a) concentration, but did not significantly contribute to risk.","apolipoprotein A; apolipoprotein B; isoprotein; lipoprotein A; adult; aged; blood; blood pressure; case control study; diabetic complication; ethnic group; ethnology; female; heart infarction; human; male; middle aged; odds ratio; risk factor; smoking; Adult; Aged; Apolipoproteins A; Apolipoproteins B; Blood Pressure; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Complications; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Lipoprotein(a); Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Odds Ratio; Protein Isoforms; Risk Factors; Smoking"
"Steroids in cardiac surgery trial: a substudy of surgical site infections [Les corticost?ro?des dans une ?tude de chirurgie cardiaque?: une sous-?tude sur les infections du site chirurgical]","2019","Purpose: Postoperative infection, particularly in cardiac surgery, results in significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Identification of novel predictors of postoperative infection can target high-risk populations for prophylactic intervention. Methods: Steroids in cardiac surgery (SIRS) was a multi-centre randomized-controlled trial assessing intraoperative administration of methylprednisone during cardiac surgery, which enrolled 7,507 patients across 80 centres in 18 countries. It demonstrated that administration of steroids had no effect on mortality or major morbidity after cardiac surgery. Our primary objective was to identify risk factors for postoperative surgical site infections using SIRS participants as a cohort. We excluded patients who did not undergo surgery, died intraoperatively, or died within 48 hr of the operation. Patients were assessed for development of “surgical site infection” over the first 30 days postoperatively. Using theoretical and previously identified risk factors, we used forward stepwise entry to create a binary logistic regression model. Results: Follow-up at 30 days was complete for all patients; 7,406 were included in the cohort. Surgical site infection occurred in 180 (4.8%) and 184 (5.0%) of patients in the placebo and steroid arms respectively.

"Colorectal and Breast Cancer Screening Status for People in Ontario Provincial Correctional Facilities","2019","Introduction: Primary care represents an opportunity to improve health for people who experience imprisonment, and screening for colorectal and breast cancer indicate primary care quality. The study objectives were to examine the proportion of people released from provincial correctional facilities who were overdue for colorectal or breast cancer screening on admission to the correctional facility and who were still overdue after 3 years, and to compare findings with data for the general population. Methods: Administrative data were used to identify people eligible for colorectal and breast cancer screening who were released from provincial correctional facilities in 2010 (N=3,803 and N=249, respectively) and in the general population (N=2,757,584 and N=1,099,942, respectively) in Ontario, Canada. Chi-square tests and log binomial regression models were used to compare the proportion of individuals overdue for screening on admission or on July 1, 2010 for the general population, and still overdue after 3 years. Analyses were conducted in 2017 and 2018. Results: Compared with the general population, people in the corrections group were 1.53 times (95% CI=1.50, 1.55) more likely to be overdue for colorectal cancer screening: 77.1% (95% CI=74.3, 79.9) vs 50.5% (95% CI=50.5, 50.6), and 2.25 times (95% CI=2.06, 2.46) more likely to be overdue for breast cancer screening: 65.9% (95% CI=56.2, 76.8) vs 29.3% (95% CI=29.2, 29.4, both p<0.001). They were also more likely to still be overdue 3 years later: 62.6% (95% CI=60.1, 65.2) vs 33.6% (95% CI=33.5, 33.6) for colorectal cancer and 52.2% (95% CI=43.6, 62.0) vs 20.2% (95% CI=20.1, 20.3) for breast cancer (both p<0.001). Conclusions: People who experience imprisonment are less likely than the general population to access colorectal and breast cancer screening. This suggests the need to strengthen primary care for this population. Specifically, efforts should be made to improve access to colorectal and breast cancer screening, through health promotion, program delivery, and linkage to community services while in correctional facilities. ? 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer screening; chi square test; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; community care; controlled study; female; health care access; health care delivery; health care need; health insurance; health promotion; human; major clinical study; male; mammography; middle aged; occult blood test; patient care; primary medical care; prison; regression analysis; retrospective study"

"Cardiovascular outcomes and achieved blood pressure in patients with and without diabetes at high cardiovascular risk","2019","Aims: Studies have shown a non-linear relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and outcomes, with increased risk observed at both low and high blood pressure (BP) levels. We hypothesized that the BP-risk association is different in individuals with and without diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Methods and results: We identified patients with (N= 11 487) or without diabetes (N= 19 450), from 30 937 patients, from 133 centres in 44 countries with a median follow-up of 56months in the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND studies. Patients had a prior history of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral artery disease, or were high-risk diabetics. Patients in ONTARGET had been randomized to ramipril 10mg daily, telmisartan 80mg daily, or the combination of both. Patients in TRANSCEND were ACE intolerant and randomized to telmisartan 80mg daily or matching placebo. We analysed the association of mean achieved in-trial SBP and DBP with the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF), the components of the composite, and all-cause death. Data were analysed by Cox regression and restricted cubic splines, adjusting for risk markers including treatment allocation and accompanying cardiovascular treatments. In patients with diabetes, event rates were higher across the whole spectrum of SBP and DBP compared with those without diabetes (P < 0.0001 for the primary composite outcome, P< 0.01 for all other endpoints). Mean achieved in-trial SBP ?160mmHg was associated with increased risk for the primary outcome [diabetes/no diabetes: adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.31 (1.93-2.76)/1.66 (1.36-2.02) compared with non-diabetics with SBP 120 to <140mmHg], with similar findings for all other endpoints in patients with diabetes, and for MI and stroke in patients without diabetes. In-trial SBP <120mmHg was associated with increased risk for the combined outcome in patients with diabetes [HR 1.53 (1.27-1.85)], and for cardiovascular death and allcause death in all patients. In-trial DBP ?90mmHg was associated with increased risk for the primary outcome [diabetes/ no diabetes: HR 2.32 (1.91-2.82)/1.61 (1.35-1.93) compared with non-diabetics with DBP 70 to <80mmHg], with similar findings for all other endpoints, but not for CHF hospitalizations in patients without diabetes. In-trial DBP <70mmHg was associated with increased risk for the combined outcome in all patients [diabetes/no diabetes: HR 1.77 (1.51-2.06)/1.30 (1.16-1.46)], and also for all other endpoints except stroke. Conclusion: High on treatment BP levels (?160 or ?90 mmHg) are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes and death. Also low levels (<120 or <70 mmHg) are associated with increased cardiovascular outcomes (except stroke) and death. Patients with diabetes have consistently higher risks over the whole BP range, indicating that achieving optimal BP goals is most impactful in this group. These data favour guidelines taking lower BP boundaries into consideration, in particular in diabetes. ?

"Waterborne pharmaceutical uptake and toxicity is modified by pH and dissolved organic carbon in zebrafish","2019","Human and veterinary pharmaceuticals have been observed in natural aquatic environments around the world, and many have been shown to impact fish health. Presently, we examined the influence of pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Na+ or Ca2+ on the bioavailability and toxicity of waterborne pharmaceuticals in larval zebrafish. Drugs included sertraline (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; SSRI), fluoxetine (SSRI), diclofenac (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and ethinyl estradiol (estrogen; EE2). The 96 h-LC50s for sertraline, fluoxetine and diclofenac were influenced by pH over an environmentally relevant range (pH 5.8–8.2). Toxicity was related to the predicted concentration of non-ionized compounds, which more readily cross cell membranes than ionized compounds. For example, sertraline was 4.1-fold more toxic (as measured by 96 h-LC50s) at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8, while the predicted amount of non-ionized sertraline was also greater at pH 8.2 (based on previously reported pKa values). Experiments with radiolabelled drugs demonstrated that sertraline uptake was also 5.4-fold higher at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8. Terrigenous and autochthonous DOC samples (as low as 1 mg/L) protected against sertraline uptake and toxicity, although they were more effective at lower (environmentally relevant) drug concentrations. In contrast, the uptake of EE2, which was principally non-ionized in all water chemistries tested, was not altered by pH or DOC. There was no change in sertraline toxicity with the addition of 12 mM Na+ or 3 mM Ca2+. In conclusion, the influence of pH and DOC on drug uptake and toxicity in fish appears to be predictable based on the physicochemical properties of the drug (e.g. pKa, polar surface area). The influence of water chemistry on drug bioavailability in fish is likely relevant to all aquatic life. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","calcium ion; diclofenac; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; ethinylestradiol; fluoxetine; organic carbon; sertraline; sodium ion; unclassified drug; water; carbon; diclofenac; ethinylestradiol; serotonin uptake inhibitor; bioavailability; calcium; cyprinid; dissolved organic carbon; drug; larva; medicine; pH; sodium; toxicity; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; aquatic environment; Article; bioavailability; cell membrane; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecotoxicity; female; isotope labeling; male; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; prediction; priority journal; zebra fish; analysis; animal; bioavailability; chemistry; human; humic substance; larva; metabolism; pH; toxicity; water pollutant; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Animals; Biological Availability; Carbon; Diclofenac; Ethinyl Estradiol; Humans; Humic Substances; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Larva; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish"

"Functional neural correlates of facial affect recognition impairment following TBI","2019","Facial affect recognition deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been well documented, as has their relationship with impairment in several other cognitive domains. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying affect recognition deficits, in particular mechanisms underlying different aspects of facial affect recognition (e.g., perceptual and interpretive processes). In the current study, 33 adults with moderate-to-severe TBI and 24 demographically matched healthy comparison (HC) participants completed an fMRI facial affect recognition study. While in the scanner, participants were asked to match the affect of a target face to either (a) one of two faces differing in affect (perceptual condition) or (b) one of two written affect labels (interpretative condition). In both groups we found activations in regions typically involved in affect recognition. Our results revealed that in the perceptual condition individuals with TBI tended to activate the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex less than HCs, and within the HC group individuals with higher perceptual affect recognition scores showed higher levels of activation in the same brain region. Individuals with TBI who were specifically impaired at interpretative affect recognition showed less activation than HCs in the right fusiform gyrus. Moreover, in the labeling condition individuals with TBI tended to de-activate medial prefrontal regions less than HCs. A region of interest analysis revealed that individuals with TBI showed significantly less activation than HCs in the FFA for all the contrasts of interest. Our results suggest involvement of several brain regions in facial affect recognition impairment post TBI, and provide neurobiological support for the notion that distinct aspects of facial affect recognition can be differentially impaired following TBI. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; affect; Article; brain region; brain size; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; emotion; face disorder; facial affect recognition deficit; facial recognition; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; fusiform gyrus; human; male; middle aged; perception; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; task performance; traumatic brain injury; affect; brain; facial expression; facial recognition; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; perception disorder; physiology; procedures; psychology; recognition; traumatic brain injury; Affect; Brain; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Emotions; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Perceptual Disorders; Recognition (Psychology)"

"Towards an ecological understanding of readiness to engage with interventions for children exposed to domestic violence and abuse: Systematic review and qualitative synthesis of perspectives of children, parents and practitioners","2019","Children who grow up in homes affected by domestic violence and abuse (DVA) are at risk of poor outcomes across the lifespan, yet there is limited evidence on the acceptability and effectiveness of interventions for them. A recent review of child-focused interventions highlighted a gap in understanding the factors influencing the willingness of parents and children to engage with these programmes. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative evidence on the experiences of receiving and delivering interventions with the aim of identifying factors at different levels of the social–ecological context that may influence parent and child readiness to take up interventions. We searched literature till April 2016 and found 12 reports of eight programmes. Two authors independently screened papers for inclusion, extracted data and identified the first- and second-order constructs. The third-order constructs were derived and fitted to the ecological framework to inform a picture of readiness to engage with interventions. Three key findings emerged from this review: (a) parent and child readiness is influenced by a complex interplay of individual, relationship and organisational factors, highlighting that individual readiness to take up child-focussed interventions must be viewed in an ecological context; (b) the specific process through which women become ready to engage in or facilitate child-focussed interventions may differ from that related to uptake of safety-promoting behaviours and requires parents to be aware of the impact of DVA on children and to focus on children's needs; (c) there are distinct but interlinked processes through which parents and children reach a point of readiness to engage in an interventions aimed at improving child outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for both practice and research. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Factors Affecting Pre-Travel Health Seeking Behaviour and Adherence to Pre-Travel Health Advice: A Systematic Review","2019","BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen unprecedented growth in international travel. Travellers are at high risk for acquiring infections while abroad and potentially bringing these infections back to their home country. There are many ways to mitigate this risk by seeking pre-travel advice (PTA), including receiving recommended vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis, however many travellers do not seek or adhere to PTA. We conducted a systematic review to further understand PTA-seeking behaviour with an ultimate aim to implement interventions that improve adherence to PTA and reduce morbidity and mortality in travellers. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published medical literature selecting studies that examined reasons for not seeking PTA and non-adherence to PTA over the last ten years. 4484 articles were screened of which 56 studies met our search criteria after full text review. RESULTS: The major reason for not seeking or non-adherence to PTA was perceived low risk of infection while travelling. Side effects played a significant role for lack of adherence specific to malaria prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: These data may help clinicians and public health providers to better understand reasons for non-adherence to PTA and target interventions to improve travellers understanding of potential and modifiable risks. Additionally, we discuss specific recommendations to increase public health education that may enable travellers to seek PTA. ? International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

"Minimal important differences for improvement in shoulder condition patient-reported outcomes: A systematic review to inform a BMJ Rapid Recommendation","2019","Objectives To identify credible anchor-based minimal important differences (MIDs) for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) relevant to a BMJ Rapid Recommendations addressing subacromial decompression surgery for shoulder pain. Design Systematic review. Outcome measures Estimates of anchor-based MIDs, and their credibility, for PROMs judged by the parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendations panel as important for informing their recommendation (pain, function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)). Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to August 2018. Study selection and review methods We included original studies of any intervention for shoulder conditions reporting estimates of anchor-based MIDs for relevant PROMs. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria. Six reviewers, working in pairs, independently extracted data from eligible studies using a predesigned, standardised, pilot-tested extraction form and independently assessed the credibility of included studies using an MID credibility tool. Results We identified 22 studies involving 5562 patients that reported 74 empirically estimated anchor-based MIDs for 10 candidate instruments to assess shoulder pain, function and HRQoL. We identified MIDs of high credibility for pain and function outcomes and of low credibility for HRQoL. We offered median estimates for the systematic review team who applied these MIDs in Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence summaries and in their interpretations of results in the linked systematic review addressing the effectiveness of surgery for shoulder pain. Conclusions Our review provides anchor-based MID estimates, as well as a rating of their credibility, for PROMs for patients with shoulder conditions. The MID estimates inform the interpretation for a linked systematic review and guideline addressing subacromial decompression surgery for shoulder pain, and could also prove useful for authors addressing other interventions for shoulder problems.

"Well Enough to Work? Social Enterprise Employment and the Geographies of Mental Health Recovery","2019","This article examines the significance of paid work and workplaces for people living with mental ill health. Employment and workplaces have been largely absent in the mental health geography literature in part because of the persistent problems that people with mental ill health face in finding and retaining paid work; yet paid work and questions of productivity remain central to the very meaning of mental illness in capitalist society. To address this gap, we report on research involving social enterprises in Canada that reduce barriers to participation in paid work. Through the provision of accommodations and supports, these enterprise sites challenge the disabling division of labor characteristic of mainstream workplaces. In so doing, they provide a context in which people, understanding themselves as “well enough to work,” can enact new forms of economic subjectivity. The meaning of paid work in these alternative sites remains defined in relation to the norms of the capitalist economy, however. Thinking beyond these narrowly defined conceptions of wellness and productivity offers an important avenue for future mental health geographies. ? 2019, ? 2018 American Association of Geographers.","employment; future prospect; health geography; literature review; mental health; workplace; Canada"
"The caveolin-1 regulated protein follistatin protects against diabetic kidney disease","2019","Glomerular matrix protein accumulation, mediated largely by mesangial cells, is central to the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. Our previous studies showed that the membrane microdomains caveolae and their marker protein caveolin-1 regulate matrix protein synthesis in mesangial cells in response to diabetogenic stimuli, and that caveolin-1 knockout mice are protected against diabetic kidney disease. In a screen to identify the molecular mechanism underlying this protection, we also established that secreted antifibrotic glycoprotein follistatin is significantly upregulated by caveolin-1 deletion. Follistatin potently neutralizes activins, members of the transforming growth factor–β superfamily. A role for activins in diabetic kidney disease has not yet been established. Therefore, in vitro, we confirmed the regulation of follistatin by caveolin-1 in primary mesangial cells and showed that follistatin controls both basal and glucose-induced matrix production through activin inhibition. In vivo, we found activin A upregulation by immunohistochemistry in both mouse and human diabetic kidney disease. Importantly, administration of follistatin to type 1 diabetic Akita mice attenuated early diabetic kidney disease, characterized by albuminuria, hyperfiltration, basement membrane thickening, loss of endothelial glycocalyx and podocyte nephrin, and glomerular matrix accumulation. Thus, activin A is an important mediator of high glucose–induced profibrotic responses in mesangial cells, and follistatin may be a potential novel therapy for the prevention of diabetic kidney disease. ? 2019 International Society of Nephrology","activin; activin A; caveolin 1; follistatin; glucose; nephrin; transforming growth factor beta; Akita mouse; albuminuria; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; basement membrane; bioaccumulation; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; drug mechanism; drug megadose; extracellular matrix; glycocalyx; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; low drug dose; male; mesangium cell; mouse; nonhuman; podocyte; priority journal; protein depletion; protein family; protein function; ultrafiltration; upregulation"

Methods: The 2014 Ontario Child Health Study is a provincially representative survey of 6537 families with children aged 4 to 17 years in Ontario. DSM-IV-TR mental disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) and included mood (major depressive episode), anxiety (generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, specific phobia), and behaviour disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder).The MINI-KID was administered independently to the primary caregiver and youth aged 12 to 17 years in the family’s home. Results: Past 6-month prevalence of any mental disorder ranged from 18.2% to 21.8% depending on age and informant. Behaviour disorders were the most common among children, and anxiety disorders were the most common among youth. Among children and youth with a parent-identified mental disorder, 25.6% of children and 33.7% of youth had contact with a mental health provider. However, 60% had contact with one or more of the providers or service settings assessed, most often through schools. Conclusions: Between 18% and 22% of children and youth in Ontario met criteria for a mental disorder but less than one-third had contact with a mental health provider. These findings provide support for strengthening prevention and early intervention efforts and enhancing service capacity to meet the mental health needs of children and youth in Ontario. ?

"Non-specific chest pain and subsequent serious cardiovascular readmissions","2019","Background: The rates of readmission for serious cardiovascular events among patients admitted with a diagnosis of non-specific chest pain are unknown. Methods: A national retrospective cohort study in the United States was undertaken to evaluate the rates, trends and predictors of readmission for serious cardiovascular events (acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE) and aortic dissection (AD)) after an inpatient episode with a primary diagnosis of non-specific chest pain. Results: Among 1,172,430 patients with an index diagnosis of non-specific chest pain between 2010 and 2014, 2.4% were readmitted with an ACS, 0.4% with a PE and 0.06% with an AD within 6 months of discharge. Predictors of ACS readmissions were diabetes (OR 1.49 95% CI 1.17–1.32), coronary artery disease (OR 2.29 95% CI 2.15–2.44), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 1.65 95% CI 1.56–1.75), previous CABG (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.43–1.61) and discharge against medical advice (OR 1.94 95% CI 1.78–2.12). Female patients (OR 0.82 95% CI 0.78–0.86) and patients in whom a coronary angiogram was undertaken (OR 0.48 95% CI 0.45–0.52) were less likely to be readmitted for ACS. For PE, predictors of readmission were pulmonary circulatory disorder (OR 2.20 95% CI 1.09–4.43), anemia (OR 1.62 95% CI 1.40–1.86) and cancer (OR 4.15 95% CI 3.43–5.02). Peripheral vascular disease (OR 8.63 95% CI 5.47–13.60), renal failure (OR 2.08 95% CI 1.34–3.24) were predictors of AD. Conclusions: Non-specific chest pain may not be a benign condition as readmissions for serious cardiovascular events occur in 3% of patients within 180 days.

"Estimates of the current and future burden of cancer attributable to sedentary behavior in Canada","2019","Leisure-time sedentary behavior is an emerging modifiable risk factor for cancer. We estimated the proportion of cancers attributed to leisure-time sedentary behavior as a separate risk factor from physical activity in Canada for 2015. We projected numbers of future avoidable cancers by 2042 using various assumed levels of reduced leisure-time sedentary behavior in the population. We calculated population attributable risks (PAR)for associated cancers and all-cancers associated with leisure-time sedentary behavior. Our analysis used pooled data on leisure-time sedentary behavior from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), and incident cancer data from the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR). Survey respondents were categorized into three levels of leisure-time sedentary behavior, “<3 h/day”, “?3–<6 h/day”, and “?6 h/day”. Estimates for the future burden of leisure-time sedentary behavior were calculated using the potential impact fractions framework (PIF)and counterfactual scenarios, from 10% to 50% decreases in leisure-time sedentary behavior. The estimated prevalence of leisure-time sedentary behavior at the highest level (?6 h/day)in Canada during the 2000s was 9.9% among both sexes combined across age-groups. The total attributable burden due to leisure-time sedentary behavior was estimated to be 10.3% for associated cancers and 6.5% for all-cancers in 2015. A 50% reduction in leisure-time sedentary behavior across the Canadian population could avoid 4054 cancers by 2042. We estimated that over 3000 cancer cases in Canada were attributable to leisure-time sedentary behavior in 2015, and that that 4054 incident cancer cases could be prevented by 2042 with meaningful reductions in leisure-time sedentary behavior. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; article; attributable risk; Canada; Canadian; cancer registry; cancer risk; controlled study; female; groups by age; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; public health; risk assessment; sedentary lifestyle"
"Brachial Plexus Birth Injury in Elective Versus Emergent Caesarean Section: A Cohort Study","2019","Objective: Although Caesarean section (CS) is protective for brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI), the incidence is not zero. A trial of labour with unfavourable intrauterine positioning is hypothesized to result in excessive force on the brachial plexus. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of BPBI in emergent CS versus elective CS. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. The authors used a nationwide demographic sample of all infants born in Canada from 2004 to 2012. BPBI diagnoses, risk factors, and national incidence data were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database and Hospital Morbidity Database. The primary outcome was risk of BPBI in emergent CS versus elective CS. Results: BPBI incidence was 1.24 per 1000 live births. Known biases may have underestimated the incidence. CS (elective and emergent) was protective for BPBI as compared with vaginal delivery (odds ratio [OR] 0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13–0.18, P < 0.0001). Emergent CS was a moderately strong risk factor for BPBI versus elective CS (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.79–5.10, P = 0.0001).

"Anticoagulation therapy patterns for acute treatment of venous thromboembolism in GARFIELD-VTE patients","2019","Background: Parenteral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have constituted the cornerstone of venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment. Meanwhile, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) provide physicians with an alternative. The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD (GARFIELD)-VTE observes real-world treatment practices. Objectives: Describe initial anticoagulation (AC) treatment patterns in VTE patients who received parenteral AC, VKAs, and/or DOACs within ±30?days of diagnosis. Methods: VTE patients were categorized into parenteral AC only, parenteral AC with transition to VKA, VKA only, parenteral AC with transition to DOAC, and DOAC only. Results: A total of 9647 patients were initiated on AC treatment alone. 4781 (49.6%) patients received DOACs?±?parenteral ACs; 3187 (33.0%), VKA?±?parenteral ACs; and 1679 (17.4%) parenteral ACs alone. Rivaroxaban was the most frequently used DOAC (79.4%). DOACs were more frequently used in North America/Australia (58.1%), Europe (52.2%), and Asia (47.6%) than in Latin America (29.7%) and the Middle East/South Africa (32.5%). In patients with suspected VTE, most received parenteral AC monotherapy (67.7%). Patients with deep vein thrombosis were more likely to receive DOACs alone than those with pulmonary embolism with or without deep vein thrombosis (36.2% vs 25.9%). Active cancer patients received parenteral AC alone (58.9%), with 25.5% receiving DOAC?±?parenteral AC and 12.8% parenteral AC and VKA. A total of 46.5% of pregnant patients received parenteral AC monotherapy, 34.0% were treated with VKA?±?parenteral AC, and 19.5% received a DOAC (± parenteral AC). Conclusion: AC treatment patterns vary by patient population, geographic region and site of VTE. Guidelines for AC therapy are not always adhered to. ? 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","antivitamin K; apixaban; dabigatran; edoxaban; rivaroxaban; adult; anticoagulant therapy; Article; Asia; Australia; cancer patient; deep vein thrombosis; Europe; female; human; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Middle East; North America; pregnancy; priority journal; register; South Africa; South and Central America; venous thromboembolism"
"Monitoring methods of human body joints: State-of-the-art and research challenges","2019","The world’s population is aging: The expansion of the older adult population with multiple physical and health issues is now a huge socio-economic concern worldwide. Among these issues, the loss of mobility among older adults due to musculoskeletal disorders is especially serious as it has severe social, mental and physical consequences. Human body joint monitoring and early diagnosis of these disorders will be a strong and effective solution to this problem. A smart joint monitoring system can identify and record important musculoskeletal-related parameters. Such devices can be utilized for continuous monitoring of joint movements during the normal daily activities of older adults and the healing process of joints (hips, knees or ankles) during the post-surgery period. A viable monitoring system can be developed by combining miniaturized, durable, low-cost and compact sensors with the advanced communication technologies and data processing techniques. In this study, we have presented and compared different joint monitoring methods and sensing technologies recently reported. A discussion on sensors’ data processing, interpretation, and analysis techniques is also presented. Finally, current research focus, as well as future prospects and development challenges in joint monitoring systems are discussed. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Clinical and genomic risk to guide the use of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer","2019","The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer may be guided by clinicopathological factors and a score based on a 21-gene assay to determine the risk of recurrence. Whether the level of clinical risk of breast cancer recurrence adds prognostic information to the recurrence score is not known. METHODS We performed a prospective trial involving 9427 women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer, in whom an assay of 21 genes had been performed, and we classified the clinical risk of recurrence of breast cancer as low or high on the basis of the tumor size and histologic grade. The effect of clinical risk was evaluated by calculating hazard ratios for distant recurrence with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models. The initial endocrine therapy was tamoxifen alone in the majority of the premenopausal women who were 50 years of age or younger. RESULTS The level of clinical risk was prognostic of distant recurrence in women with an intermediate 21-gene recurrence score of 11 to 25 (on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis or a greater potential benefit from chemotherapy) who were randomly assigned to endocrine therapy (hazard ratio for the comparison of high vs. low clinical risk, 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93 to 3.87) or to chemotherapy plus endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.66 to 3.48) and in women with a high recurrence score (a score of 26 to 100), all of whom were assigned to chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.94 to 5.19). Among women who were 50 years of age or younger who had received endocrine therapy alone, the estimated (±SE) rate of distant recurrence at 9 years was less than 5% (?1.8±0.9%) with a low recurrence score (a score of 0 to 10), irrespective of clinical risk, and 4.7±1.0% with an intermediate recurrence score and low clinical risk. In this age group, the estimated distant recurrence at 9 years exceeded 10% among women with a high clinical risk and an intermediate recurrence score who received endocrine therapy alone (12.3±2.4%) and among those with a high recurrence score who received chemoendocrine therapy (15.2±3.3%). CONCLUSIONS Clinical-risk stratification provided prognostic information that, when added to the 21-gene recurrence score, could be used to identify premenopausal women who could benefit from more effective therapy.

"GRADE Guidelines: 19. Assessing the certainty of evidence in the importance of outcomes or values and preferences—Risk of bias and indirectness","2019","Objectives: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group defines patient values and preferences as the relative importance patients place on the main health outcomes. We provide GRADE guidance for assessing the risk of bias and indirectness domains for certainty of evidence about the relative importance of outcomes. Study Design and Setting: We applied the GRADE domains to rate the certainty of evidence in the importance of outcomes to several systematic reviews, iteratively reviewed draft guidance and consulted GRADE members and other stakeholders for feedback. Results: This is the first of two articles. A body of evidence addressing the importance of outcomes starts at “high certainty”; concerns with risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias lead to downgrading to moderate, low, or very low certainty. We propose subdomains of risk of bias as selection of the study population, missing data, the type of measurement instrument, and confounding; we have developed items for each subdomain. The population, intervention, comparison, and outcome elements associated with the evidence determine the degree of indirectness. Conclusion: This article provides guidance and examples for rating the risk of bias and indirectness for a body of evidence summarizing the importance of outcomes. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article; clinical assessment tool; comparative study; confounding variable; consultation; evaluation study; evidence based practice; grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation; human; measurement; outcome assessment; patient preference; place preference; practice guideline; priority journal; risk assessment; systematic review (topic); article; outcome assessment; publication bias; risk assessment; systematic review"
"Gluten immunogenic peptide excretion detects dietary transgressions in treated celiac disease patients","2019","BACKGROUND Life-long removal of gluten from the diet is currently the only way to manage celiac disease (CeD). Until now, no objective test has proven useful to objectively detect ingested gluten in clinical practice. Recently, tests that determine consumption of gluten by assessing excretion of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stool and urine have been developed. Their utility, in comparison with conventional dietary and analytical follow-up strategies, has not been fully established. AIM To assess the performance of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and point-of-care tests (PoCTs) for GIP excretion in CeD patients on gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS We conducted an observational, prospective, cross-sectional study in patients following a GFD for at least two years. Using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire, patients were classified at enrollment as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Gluten consumption was assessed twice by 3-d dietary recall and GIP excretion (by ELISA in stool and PoCTs (commercial kits for stool and urine) in two consecutive samples. These samples and dietary reports were obtained 10 day apart one from the other. Patients were encouraged to follow their usual GFD during the study period. RESULTS Forty-four patients were enrolled, of which 19 (43.2%) were symptomatic despite being on a GFD. Overall, 83 sets of stool and/or urine samples were collected. Eleven out of 44 patients (25.0%) had at least one positive GIP test. The occurrence of at least one positive test was 32% in asymptomatic patients compared with 15.8% in symptomatic patients. GIP was concordant with dietary reports in 65.9% of cases (Cohen's kappa: 0.317). PoCT detected dietary indiscretions. Both ELISA and PoCT in stool were concordant (concomitantly positive or negative) in 67 out of 74 (90.5%) samples. Excretion of GIP was detected in 7 (8.4%) stool and/or urine samples from patients considered to be strictly compliant with the GFD by dietary reports. CONCLUSION GIP detects dietary transgressions in patients on long-term GFD, irrespective of the presence of symptoms. PoCT for GIP detection constitutes a simple homebased method for self-assessment of dietary indiscretions. ?

"Once daily long-acting beta2-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists in a combined inhaler versus placebo for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","2019","Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition causing accumulation of mucus in the airways, cough, and breathlessness; the disease is progressive and is the fourth most common cause of death worldwide. Current treatment strategies for COPD are multi-modal and aim to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase patients’ quality of life by slowing disease progression and preventing exacerbations. Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) plus a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) delivered via a single inhaler are approved by regulatory authorities in the USA, Europe, and Japan for the treatment of COPD. Several LABA/LAMA FDCs are available and recent meta-analyses have clarified their utility versus their mono-components in COPD. Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of once-daily LABA/LAMA FDCs versus placebo will facilitate the comparison of different FDCs in future network meta-analyses. Objectives We assessed the evidence for once-daily LABA/LAMA combinations (delivered in a single inhaler) versus placebo on clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with stable COPD. Search methods We identified trials from Cochrane Airways’ Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR and trial registries from their inception to 3 December 2018; we imposed no restriction on language of publication. Selection criteria We included parallel-group and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-daily LABA/LAMA FDC versus placebo. We included studies reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. We excluded very short-term trials with a duration of less than 3 weeks. We included adults (? 40 years old) with a diagnosis of stable COPD. We included studies that allowed participants to continue using their ICS during the trial as long as the ICS was not part of the randomised treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results to determine included studies, extracted data on prespecified outcomes of interest, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Where possible, we used a random-effects model to meta-analyse extracted data. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in’Summary of findings’ tables. Main results We identified and included 22 RCTs randomly assigning 8641 people with COPD to either once-daily LABA/LAMA FDC (6252 participants) or placebo (3819 participants); nine studies had a cross-over design. Studies had a duration of between three and 52 weeks (median 12 weeks). The mean age of participants across the included studies ranged from 59 to 65 years and in 21 of 22 studies, participants had GOLD stage II or III COPD. Concomitant inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use was permitted in all of the included studies (where stated); across the included studies, between 28% to 58% of participants were using ICS at baseline. Six studies evaluated the once-daily combination of IND/GLY (110/50 ?g), seven studies evaluated TIO/OLO (2.5/5 or 5/5 ?g), eight studies evaluated UMEC/VI (62.5/5, 125/25 or 500/25 ?g) and one study evaluated ACD/FOR (200/6, 200/12 or 200/18 ?g); all LABA/LAMA combinations were compared with placebo. The risk of bias was generally considered to be low or unknown (insufficient detail provided), with only one study per domain considered to have a high risk of bias except for the domain’other bias’ which was determined to be at high risk of bias in four studies (in three studies, disease severity was greater at baseline in participants receiving LABA/LAMA compared with participants receiving placebo, which would be expected to shift the treatment effect in favour of placebo). Compared to the placebo, the pooled results for the primary outcomes for the once-daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: all-cause mortality, OR 1.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 4.36, low-certainty evidence); all-cause serious adverse events (SAEs), OR 1.06 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.28, high-certainty evidence); acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.78, moderate-certainty evidence); adjusted St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, MD -4.08 (95% CI -4.80 to -3.36, high-certainty evidence); proportion of SGRQ responders, OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.54 to 1.99). Compared with placebo, the pooled results for the secondary outcomes for the once-daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: adjusted trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), MD 0.20 L (95% CI 0.19 to 0.21, moderate-certainty evidence); adjusted peak FEV1, MD 0.31 L (95% CI 0.29 to 0.32, moderate-certainty evidence); and all-cause AEs, OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.04; high-certainty evidence). No studies reported data for the 6-minute walk test. The results were generally consistent across subgroups for different LABA/LAMA combinations and doses. Authors’ conclusions Compared with placebo, once-daily LABA/LAMA (either IND/GLY, UMEC/VI or TIO/OLO) via a combination inhaler is associated with a clinically significant improvement in lung function and health-related quality of life in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD; UMEC/VI appears to reduce the rate of exacerbations in this population. These conclusions are supported by moderate or high certainty evidence based on studies with an observation period of up to one year. Copyright ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

"The British Columbia Healthy Connections Project: Findings on socioeconomic disadvantage in early pregnancy","2019","Background: Maternal exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage increases the risk of child injuries and subsequent child developmental and mental health problems - particularly for young mothers. To inform early intervention planning, this research therefore aimed to describe the health and social adversities experienced by a cohort of girls and young women in early pregnancy in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Methods: Participants were recruited for the BC Healthy Connections Project (BCHCP), a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership, a home visitation program, in improving child and maternal outcomes. Baseline data were collected from 739 participants on trial entry. Participants were selected on the basis of preparing to parent for the first time and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Analyses involved descriptive statistics and age-group comparisons. Results: Most participants reported having low income (84%), having limited education (52%) and being single (91%) at trial entry. Beyond these eligibility criteria, other health and social adversities included: housing instability (52%); severe anxiety or depression (47%); other diagnosed mental disorders (22%); prenatal nicotine and cannabis use (27 and 21%); physical health problems (20%); child maltreatment when younger (56%); and intimate partner violence recently (50%). As well, few (29%) had received income assistance entitlements. More than two thirds (70%) were experiencing four or more forms of adversity. Age-group differences were observed for cognitive functioning, being single, low income, limited education, psychological distress and service use (p-value ?0.05). Conclusions: This cohort was selected on the basis of socioeconomic disadvantage. Yet all participants were experiencing substantial added adversities - at higher rates than other Canadians. Furthermore, despite Canada's public programs, these pregnant girls and young women were not being adequately reached by social services. Our study adds new data to inform early intervention planning, suggesting that unacceptably high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage exist for some young British Columbians. Therefore greater health and social supports and services are warranted for these young mothers and their children.

"Transepithelial versus epithelium-off corneal collagen cross-linking for corneal ectasia: Protocol for a systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomised controlled trials","2019","Introduction: Corneal ectasias are progressive, degenerative ocular diseases defined by abnormal structural changes in the cornea, leading to distortion of vision and substantial reduction in quality of life. Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) increases the biomechanical rigidity of the cornea and has been shown to halt ectatic processes. The established CXL protocol requires removal of the corneal epithelium. However, some surgeons have proposed transepithelial approaches to enhance patient recovery and minimise adverse events. Whether novel transepithelial approaches are as effective in arresting ectasia as the established epithelium-off protocol remains unclear. This study will systematically review the evidence on transepithelial CXL approaches and compare it to the epithelium-off protocol. Methods and analysis: We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transepithelial and epithelium-off CXL for any corneal ectasia. We will search 16 electronic databases including MEDLINE and Embase, as well as the grey literature. Two reviewers will independently screen search results to identify eligible studies, complete data abstraction and conduct quality assessment. We will assess the quality of individual RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Our primary outcome will be the change in maximal keratometry at 12 months after treatment, and we will examine 11 additional outcomes. We will summarise our analyses by measures of association (relative risk or odds ratio) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence will be rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review as it draws from previously published data. Results: of the study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication and discussed at conferences and seminars. ? 2019 Author(s).","Article; comparative effectiveness; cornea epithelium; cornea surgery; Embase; epithelium off corneal collagen cross linking; grey literature; human; information retrieval; keratoconus; Medline; meta analysis; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); sequential analysis; systematic review; transepithelial corneal collagen cross linking; treatment outcome"
"Rivaroxaban Plus Aspirin in Patients With Vascular Disease and Renal Dysfunction: From the COMPASS Trial","2019","Background: Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of both bleeding and ischemic cardiovascular events. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the balance of risks and benefits from the dual pathway antithrombotic regimen (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily [bd] plus aspirin, compared with aspirin) in vascular patients with or without moderate renal dysfunction. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the COMPASS (Cardiovascular OutcoMes for People using Anticoagulation StrategieS) trial involving 27,395 patients with chronic coronary or peripheral artery disease. Results: In COMPASS, 21,111 patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline of ?60 ml/min, 6,276 had a GRF of <60 ml/min. Both the primary efficacy outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and major bleeding were more frequent in those with renal dysfunction, and the frequency of these outcome events was inversely related to GFR. However, the primary outcome was consistently reduced with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bd plus aspirin, irrespective of GFR category (GFR ?60 ml/min, 3.5% rivaroxaban plus aspirin, 4.5% aspirin alone, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64 to 0.90; GFR <60 ml/min, 6.4% rivaroxaban plus aspirin, 8.4% aspirin alone, HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.94). Major bleeding was more frequent with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in those with GFR ?60 ml/min (2.9% rivaroxaban plus aspirin, 1.6% aspirin alone, HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.44 to 2.28) and similarly in those with GFR <60 ml/min (3.9% rivaroxaban plus aspirin, 2.7% aspirin alone, HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.07). Conclusions: The benefits of the dual pathway COMPASS regimen (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bd plus aspirin), versus aspirin alone, are preserved in patients with moderate renal dysfunction without evidence of an excess hazard of bleeding. ? 2019 The Authors","acetylsalicylic acid; placebo; rivaroxaban; aged; Article; bleeding; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; heart infarction; human; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; outcome assessment; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk benefit analysis; sinus rhythm"
"The burden of influenza in older adults: meeting the challenge","2019","Influenza is an acute respiratory infection for which vaccination is our best prevention strategy. Small seasonal changes in circulating influenza viruses (antigenic drift) result in the need for annual influenza vaccination, in which the vaccine formulation is updated to better match the predominant circulating influenza viruses that have undergone important antigenic changes. Although the burden of influenza infection and its complications is the highest in older adults, vaccine effectiveness is the lowest in this vulnerable population. This is largely due to waning of the immune response with age known as “immune senescence”, and presents an important, unmet challenge. Possible strategies to tackle this include adjuvant and high-dose vaccines, and herd immunity induced by greater vaccine uptake. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",""
"Validation of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation primary graft dysfunction instrument in heart transplantation","2019","BACKGROUND: In 2014, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) developed a classification instrument for left ventricular (LV) and isolated right ventricular (RV) primary graft dysfunction post?heart transplant. The instrument classifies LV-PGD as mild, moderate, or severe. In this study, we evaluated the predictive validity of this instrument. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 412 consecutive patients transplanted between 2004 and 2015 at the Toronto General Hospital and Ottawa Heart Institute (Canada). We classified LV-PGD as mild, moderate, or severe, using the ISHLT instrument. To assess predictive validity, we evaluated the association between LV-PGD severity and 1-year post-transplant mortality using a Cox regression model adjusted for recipient age. RESULTS: The cohort was predominantly male (71%), mean age 50 ± 13 years, mean donor age 38 ± 14 years, with 25% female donors. Mean ischemic time was 3.7 ± 1.1 hours. LV-PGD was mild in 3.6% of patients, moderate in 9.5%, and severe in 3.9%. All levels of LV-PGD were associated with increased 1-year mortality, with a gradient in the association between mild, moderate, and severe. We only observed a statistically significant association for moderate and severe forms of LV-PGD (mild: hazard ratio [HR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6 to 10.2; moderate: HR 7.0, 95% CI 3.4 to 14.6; severe: HR 15.9, 95% CI 7.2 to 35.0). CONCLUSIONS: The ISHLT LV-PGD classification convincingly identifies a substantial increase in the risk of death at 1 year, and an increased gradient of risk, in those with moderate or severe LV-PGD. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; Article; Canada; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; disease severity assessment; female; graft failure; heart muscle ischemia; heart transplantation; human; infection; International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation; lung hemorrhage; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; mortality risk; multiple organ failure; predictive validity; primary graft dysfunction; priority journal; proportional hazards model; sepsis; survival"
"Efficacy and safety of EMLA cream for pain control due to venipuncture in infants: A meta-analysis","2019","CONTEXT: The eutectic mixture of lidocaine (EMLA) cream has been used to reduce the pain during venipuncture in infants. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of EMLA in infants &lt;3 months of age requiring venipuncture in comparison with nonpharmacological interventions in terms of pain reduction, change in physiologic variables, and methemoglobinemia. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, and gray literature were searched from inception to August 2017, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: We selected randomized controlled trials in which researchers compared EMLA with nonpharmacological interventions. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently performed abstract screening and full-text review, and extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials (907 infants) were included. EMLA revealed little or no effect in reduction of pain (standardized mean difference: 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.17 to 0.45; 6 trials, n = 742; moderate-quality evidence) when EMLA was compared with sucrose, breastfeeding, or placebo. In comparison with placebo, EMLA revealed a small-to-moderate effect on increasing methemoglobin levels (mean difference: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.66; 2 trials, n = 134; low-quality evidence). There was an increased risk of blanching of the skin in the EMLA group (relative risk: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.58 to 4.38; 2 trials, n = 123; I 2 = 84%, very low-quality evidence). LIMITATIONS: Our results may not be applicable to older infants. CONCLUSIONS: EMLA reveals minimal benefits in terms of reduction of pain due to venipuncture procedure in comparison with placebo and no benefit in comparison with sucrose and/or breastfeeding. Moreover, it produced an elevation in methemoglobin levels and skin blanching.

One mutation, V1016G, confers sodium channel resistance to pyrethroids, but a different substitution in the same position V1016I alone had no effect. In pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti populations, V1016I is often linked to another mutation, F1534C, which confers sodium channel resistance only to Type I pyrethroids including permethrin (PMT), but not to Type II pyrethroids including deltamethrin (DMT). Mosquitoes carrying both V1016G and F1534C exhibited a greater level of pyrethroid resistance than those carrying F1534C alone. More recently, a new mutation T1520I co-existing with F1534C was detected in India. However, whether V1016I or T1520I enhances pyrethroid resistance of sodium channels carrying F1534C remains unknown. Methodology/Principal findings V1016I, V1016G, T1520I and F1534C substitutions were introduced alone and in various combinations into AaNav1-1, a sodium channel from Aedes aegypti. The mutant channels were then expressed in Xenopus oocytes and examined for channel properties and sensitivity to pyrethroids using the two-electrode voltage clamping technique. The results showed that V1016I or T1520I alone did not alter the AaNav1-1 sensitivity to PMT or DMT. However, the double mutant T1520I+F1534C was more resistant to PMT than F1534C, but remained sensitive to DMT. In contrast, the double mutant V1016I+F1534C was resistant to DMT and more resistant to PMT than F1534C. Furthermore, V1016I/G and F1534C channels, but not T1520I, were resistant to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Cryo-EM structures of sodium channels suggest that T1520I allosterically deforms geometry of the pyrethroid receptor site PyR1 in AaNav1-1. The small deformation does not affect binding of DDT, PMT or DMT, but in combination with F1534C it increases the channel resistance to PMT and DDT. Conclusions/Significance Our data corroborated the previously proposed sequential selection of kdr mutations in Ae. aegypti. We proposed that mutation F1534C first emerged in response to DDT/pyrethroids providing a platform for subsequent selection of mutations V1016I and T1520I that confer greater and broader spectrum of pyrethroid resistance. ? 2019 Chen et al.","bifenthrin; cyfluthrin; cypermethrin; deltamethrin; permethrin; pyrethroid; voltage gated sodium channel; chlorphenotane; insecticide; mutant protein; pyrethroid; sodium channel; chlorphenotane; sodium channel; Aedes aegypti; animal experiment; antibiotic resistance; Article; depolarization; disease carrier; electrophysiological procedures; evolution; gene expression; gene mutation; hydrogen bond; in vitro study; mathematical model; membrane potential; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; oocyte; point mutation; polymerase chain reaction; pyrethroid resistance; sequence analysis; site directed mutagenesis; sodium conductance; X ray; Xenopus laevis; Aedes; amino acid substitution; animal; cell culture; drug effect; genetics; insecticide resistance; metabolism; missense mutation; molecular evolution; mosquito vector; Xenopus; conductance; gene knockdown; mosquito control; protein expression; Aedes; Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; Cells, Cultured; DDT; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression; Insecticide Resistance; Insecticides; Mosquito Vectors; Mutant Proteins; Mutation, Missense; Pyrethrins; Sodium Channels; Xenopus"
"Predictors of NOAC versus VKA use for stroke prevention in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation: Results from GARFIELD-AF","2019","Introduction: A principal aim of the Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-Atrial Fibrillation (GARFIELD-AF) was to document changes in treatment practice for patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation during an era when non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were becoming more widely adopted. In these analyses, the key factors which determined the choice between NOACs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are explored. Methods: Logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression determined predictors of NOAC and VKA use. Data were collected from 24,137 patients who were initiated on AC ± antiplatelet (AP) therapy (NOAC [51.4%] or VKA [48.6%]) between April 2013 and August 2016. Results: The most significant predictors of AC therapy were country, enrolment year, care setting at diagnosis, AF type, concomitant AP, and kidney disease. Patients enrolled in emergency care or in the outpatient setting were more likely to receive a NOAC than those enrolled in hospital (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 1.04-1.30], OR: 1.15 [95% CI: 1.05-1.25], respectively). NOAC prescribing seemed to be favored in lower-risk groups, namely, patients with paroxysmal AF, normotensive patients, and those with moderate alcohol consumption, but also the elderly and patients with acute coronary syndrome. By contrast, VKAs were preferentially used in patients with permanent AF, moderate to severe kidney disease, heart failure, vascular disease, and diabetes and with concomitant AP. Conclusion: GARFIELD-AF data highlight marked heterogeneity in stroke prevention strategies globally. Physicians are adopting an individualized approach to stroke prevention where NOACs are favored in patients with a lower stroke risk but also in the elderly and patients with acute coronary syndrome. ? 2019 The Authors","anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; acute coronary syndrome; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; comorbidity; controlled study; disease severity; emergency care; ethnic difference; female; heart failure; high risk population; human; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; patient care; priority journal; vascular disease"
"Lorcaserin and Renal Outcomes in Obese and Overweight Patients in the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 Trial","2019","Background: Obesity is thought to increase renal hyperfiltration, thereby increasing albuminuria and the progression of renal disease. The effect of pharmacologically mediated weight loss on renal outcomes is not well-described. Lorcaserin, a selective serotonin 2C receptor agonist that promotes appetite suppression, led to sustained weight loss without any increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial (Cardiovascular and Metabolic Effects of Lorcaserin in Overweight and Obese Patients-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 61). Methods: CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 randomly assigned 12 000 overweight or obese patients with or at high risk for atherosclerotic CV disease to lorcaserin or placebo on a background of lifestyle modification. The primary renal outcome was a composite of new or worsening persistent micro- or macroalbuminuria, new or worsening chronic kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease, renal transplant, or renal death. Results: At baseline, 23.8% of patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL·min-1·1.73 m-2 and 19.0% had albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ?30 mg/g). Lorcaserin reduced the risk of the primary renal composite outcome (4.2% per year versus 4.9% per year; hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.96; P=0.0064). The benefit was consistent across subpopulations at increased baseline CV and renal risk. Lorcaserin improved both eGFR and urinary albumin:creatinune ratio within the first year after randomization. The effect of lorcaserin on weight, hemoglobin A1c, and systolic blood pressure was consistent regardless of baseline renal function. Likewise, there was no excess in cardiovascular events in patients assigned to lorcaserin in comparison with placebo, regardless of renal function. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, those with evidence of kidney disease were at increased risk of major CV events. Compared with patients with an eGFR ?90 mL·min-1·1.73 m-2, those with an eGFR 60-90 and those &lt;60 mL·min-1·1.73 m-2 had HRs of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.01, 1.56) and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.17, 1.95), respectively (P for trend 0.0015). Likewise, compared with patients with no albuminuria (&lt;30 mg/g), those microalbuminuria and those with macroalbuminuria had HRs of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.22, 1.74) and 2.10 (95% CI, 1.58, 2.80), respectively (P for trend &lt;0.0001). Conclusions: Renal dysfunction was associated with increased CV risk in overweight and obese patients. When added to diet and lifestyle, lorcaserin reduced the rate of new-onset or progressive renal impairment in comparison with placebo. ? 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.","hemoglobin A1c; lorcaserin; placebo; anorexigenic agent; benzazepine derivative; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; lorcaserin; serotonin 2 agonist; adult; albuminuria; Article; atherosclerosis; body mass; body weight loss; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; creatinine blood level; disease association; double blind procedure; end stage renal disease; glomerulus filtration rate; heart infarction; human; hypertension; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; blood; blood pressure; clinical trial; disease exacerbation; drug effect; female; food intake; kidney; kidney disease; low calorie diet; male; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; obesity; pathophysiology; psychology; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; time factor; Appetite Depressants; Appetite Regulation; Benzazepines; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Diet, Reducing; Disease Progression; Double-Blind Method; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Agonists; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss"
"Impact of Platelet Endothelial Aggregation Receptor-1 Genotypes on Platelet Reactivity and Early Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Treated With Aspirin and Clopidogrel","2019","BACKGROUND: The genetic determinants of response to clopidogrel and aspirin are incompletely characterized. Recently, PEAR1 (platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1) rs12041331 polymorphism has been shown to influence the platelet reactivity, but its impact on cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear in patients treated with antiplatelet agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective cohort study, 2439 Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease undergoing coronary stent implantation and receiving clopidogrel and aspirin were consecutively recruited. Their platelet reactivity was determined by light transmission aggregometry at 5 and 30 days after coronary intervention. Genotyping was performed using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. All patients completed a 30-day follow-up for clinical outcomes. Genotyping for PEAR1 showed 768 (38.3%) GG homozygotes, 941 (46.9%) GA heterozygotes, and 298 (14.8%) AA homozygotes. The 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke were significantly higher in AA homozygotes than in non-AA homozygotes (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.13-6.82; P=0.026), irrespective of CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function polymorphism and known outcome predictors including age, sex, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. The ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly lower in AA homozygotes than that in GG homozygotes at both time points, although no significant difference was found for the arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation among the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: About 15% of Chinese patients undergoing coronary stent implantation were AA homozygotes for PEAR1 rs12041331. These patients had ?3-fold increase in short-term major adverse cardiovascular events risk compared with non-AA homozygotes, and the adverse clinical outcome is unlikely to be mediated by suboptimal pharmacological response to aspirin or clopidogrel.

"Comparative risk of new-onset diabetes following commencement of antipsychotics in New Zealand: A population-based clustered multiple baseline time series design","2019","Objective Newer antipsychotics are increasingly prescribed off-label for non-psychotic ailments both in primary and secondary care settings, despite the purported risk of weight gain and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aims to determine any relationship between the development of clinically significant new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus and novel antipsychotic use in New Zealand using hypnotic drugs as control. Design A population-based clustered multiple baseline time series design. Setting Routinely collected data from a complete national pharmaceutical database in New Zealand between 2005 and 2011. Participants Patients aged 40-60 years in the year 2006 who were ever dispensed antipsychotics (exposure groups - first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics and antipsychotics with low, medium and high risk for weight gain) or hypnotics (control group) between 2006 and 2011. Main outcome measure First ever metformin dispensed to patients in each study group between 2006 and 2011 as proxy for development of clinically significant type 2 diabetes mellitus, no longer amendable by lifestyle modifications. Results Patients dispensed a second-generation antipsychotic had 1.49 times increased risk (95% CI 1.10 to 2.03, p=0.011) of subsequently commencing metformin. Patients dispensed an antipsychotic with high risk of weight gain also had a 2.41 times increased risk of commencing on metformin (95% CI 1.42 to 4.09, p=0.001). Conclusions Patients dispensed a second-generation antipsychotic and antipsychotics with high risk of weight gain appear to be at increased risk of being secondarily dispensed metformin. Caution should be taken with novel antipsychotic use for patients with increased baseline risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"Rivaroxaban Plus Aspirin Versus Aspirin in Relation to Vascular Risk in the COMPASS Trial","2019","Background: The COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial showed that the combination of low-dose rivaroxaban and aspirin reduced major vascular events in patients with stable vascular disease. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify subsets of patients at higher risk of recurrent vascular events, which may help focus the use of rivaroxaban and aspirin therapy. Methods: COMPASS patients with vascular disease were risk stratified using 2 methods: the REACH (REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health) atherothrombosis risk score and CART (Classification and Regression Tree) analysis. The absolute risk differences for rivaroxaban with aspirin were compared to aspirin alone over 30 months for the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute limb ischemia, or vascular amputation; for severe bleeding; and for the net clinical benefit. Results: High-risk patients using the REACH score were those with 2 or more vascular beds affected, history of heart failure (HF), or renal insufficiency, and by CART analysis were those with ?2 vascular beds affected, history of HF, or diabetes. Rivaroxaban and aspirin combination reduced the serious vascular event incidence by 25% (4.48% vs. 5.95%, hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.85), equivalent to 23 events prevented per 1,000 patients treated for 30 months, at the cost of a nonsignificant 34% increase in severe bleeding (1.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.95 to 1.88), or 2 events caused per 1,000 patients treated. Among patients with ?1 high-risk feature identified from the CART analysis, rivaroxaban and aspirin prevented 33 serious vascular events, whereas in lower-risk patients, rivaroxaban and aspirin treatment led to the avoidance of 10 events per 1,000 patients treated for 30 months. Conclusions: In patients with vascular disease, further risk stratification can identify higher-risk patients (?2 vascular beds affected, HF, renal insufficiency, or diabetes). The net clinical benefit remains favorable for most patients treated with rivaroxaban and aspirin compared with aspirin. ? 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","acetylsalicylic acid; rivaroxaban; aged; amputation; Article; bleeding; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; combination drug therapy; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; double blind procedure; female; heart failure; heart infarction; high risk patient; human; incidence; kidney failure; limb ischemia; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; multicenter study; patient risk; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; risk factor; thrombosis; vascular disease"
"A fresh approach to reform? A policy analysis of the development and implementation of Ontario’s mental health and addictions strategy","2019","Background: Open Minds, Healthy Minds, Ontario’s Comprehensive Mental Health and Addictions Strategy commits to the transformation of mental health and addictions services for all Ontarians. Objective: We analyzed the formulation and implementation of this Strategy to address the question: What are the prospects for transformative change in Ontario’s current approach to mental health and addictions? Methods: Qualitative policy analysis using interpretive description of key documents of the policy process, drawing on policy network and horizontal governance theory. Results: Three features set this policy process apart from previous reform efforts: (1) expansion of the state pluralist network to those outside of health, (2) extension of the policy network approach into the Strategy’s implementation stage and (3) the combined presence of political and policy leadership. Conclusions: There is reason for optimism that the approach of the Strategy has increased the prospects for the transformation of Ontario’s mental health and addictions system. ? 2019 Longwoods Publishing Corp..

"A multicentre controlled pre–post trial of an implementation science intervention to improve venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in critically ill patients","2019","Purpose: To test whether a multicomponent intervention would increase the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) over unfractionated heparin (UFH) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in critically ill patients and change patient outcomes and healthcare utilization. Methods: Controlled pre–post trial of 12,342 adults admitted to 11 ICUs (five intervention, six control) May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2017 with no contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis and an ICU stay longer than 24?h. Models were developed to examine temporal changes in ICU VTE prophylaxis (primary outcome), VTE, major bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), death and hospital costs. Results: The use of LMWH increased from 45.9% to 78.3% of patient days in the intervention group and from 37.9% to 53.3% in the control group, an absolute increase difference of 17.0% (32.4% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.001). Changes in the administration of UFH were inversely related to those of LMWH. There were no significant differences in the adjusted odds of VTE (ratio of odds ratios [rOR] 1.13, 95% CI 0.51–2.46) or major bleeding (rOR 1.22, 95% CI 0.97–1.54) post-implementation of the intervention (compared to pre-implementation) between the intervention group and the control group. HIT was uncommon in both groups (n = 20 patients). There were no significant changes for ICU and hospital mortality, length of stay and costs. Results were similar when stratified according to reason for ICU admission, patient weight and kidney function. Conclusions: A multicomponent intervention changed practice, but not clinical and economic outcomes. The benefit of implementing LMWH for VTE prophylaxis under real-world conditions is uncertain. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","heparin; low molecular weight heparin; anticoagulant agent; low molecular weight heparin; adult; aged; APACHE; Article; clinical decision support system; clinical outcome; comorbidity; controlled study; critically ill patient; death; feedback system; female; health care cost; health care utilization; heparin induced thrombocytopenia; hospital admission; hospital cost; hospital mortality; hospital patient; human; implementation science; intensive care unit; international normalized ratio; kidney function; length of stay; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; outcome assessment; postoperative period; practice guideline; prophylaxis; prothrombin time; venous thromboembolism; clinical practice; clinical trial; critical illness; epidemiology; evidence based practice; middle aged; odds ratio; organization and management; pre-exposure prophylaxis; procedures; register; retrospective study; statistical model; venous thromboembolism; Aged; Anticoagulants; Critical Illness; Evidence-Based Practice; Female; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Implementation Science; Intensive Care Units; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Length of Stay; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Venous Thromboembolism"
"Incidence of delayed venous thromboembolic events in patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic surgery for cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following discharge for abdominal cancer surgery is uncertain. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies evaluating the incidence of VTE at 3 months from surgery. Studies indicating use of post-hospital VTE prophylaxis were excluded. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data abstraction and risk of bias. Random-effects model was used to estimate pooled incidence, and weights were estimated using inverse variance method. Statistical heterogeneity was explored via subgroup analysis. Results: Of 4215 abstracts retrieved, 11 reported the incidence of VTE at 3 months. There were three randomized trials (n = 520), one prospective cohort study (n = 284) and seven retrospective cohort studies (n = 65 308). VTE incidence among prospective studies was 9.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9–16.4), while for retrospective studies was 2.2% (95% CI 1.4–3.0). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 92% and 81%, respectively). The incidence of symptomatic VTE was 1.3% (95% CI 0.4–2.3) for prospective studies. VTE was diagnosed by screening venography in most of the prospective studies, whereas retrospective studies did not use a screening method. Subgroup analysis based on the type of organ surgery performed explained the heterogeneity. Conclusions: VTE incidence following abdominal cancer surgery varies greatly depending on the study type, with differences largely explained by the method of assessment of VTE. The fact that VTE incidence among retrospective studies was closer to the incidence of symptomatic events (non-screen detected) in the prospective studies, suggests that the screened events were mostly asymptomatic and their clinical significance is unclear. ? 2019 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",""
"Communication, learning and assessment: Exploring the dimensions of the digital learning environment","2019","Advances in technology make it possible to supplement in-person teaching activities with digital learning, use electronic records in patient care, and communicate through social media. This relatively new “digital learning environment” has changed how medical trainees learn, participate in patient care, are assessed, and provide feedback. Communication has changed with the use of digital health records, the evolution of interdisciplinary and interprofessional communication, and the emergence of social media. Learning has evolved with the proliferation of online tools such as apps, blogs, podcasts, and wikis, and the formation of virtual communities. Assessment of learners has progressed due to the increasing amounts of data being collected and analyzed. Digital technologies have also enhanced learning in resource-poor environments by making resources and expertise more accessible. While digital technology offers benefits to learners, the teachers, and health care systems, there are concerns regarding the ownership, privacy, safety, and management of patient and learner data. We highlight selected themes in the domains of digital communication, digital learning resources, and digital assessment and close by providing practical recommendations for the integration of digital technology into education, with the aim of maximizing its benefits while reducing risks. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; article; cell proliferation; drug safety; health care system; human; learning environment; privacy; risk assessment; teacher; clinical competence; computer security; environment; information system; Internet; interpersonal communication; learning; medical education; medical information system; organization and management; social environment; social media; Clinical Competence; Communication; Computer Security; Education, Medical; Environment; Health Information Management; Humans; Information Systems; Internet; Learning; Social Environment; Social Media"
"Bucindolol for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm in a Genotype-Defined HF Population: The GENETIC-AF Trial","2019","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of bucindolol with that of metoprolol succinate for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in a genetically defined heart failure (HF) population with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background: Bucindolol is a beta-blocker whose unique pharmacologic properties provide greater benefit in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who have the beta1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) Arg389Arg genotype. Methods: A total of 267 HFrEF patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;0.50, symptomatic AF, and the ADRB1 Arg389Arg genotype were randomized 1:1 to receive bucindolol or metoprolol therapy and were up-titrated to target doses. The primary endpoint of AF or atrial flutter (AFL) or all-cause mortality (ACM) was evaluated by electrocardiogram (ECG) during a 24-week period. Results: The hazard ratio (HR) for the primary endpoint was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.42), but trends for bucindolol benefit were observed in several subgroups. Precision therapeutic phenotyping revealed that a differential response to bucindolol was associated with the interval of time from the initial diagnoses of AF and HF to randomization and with the onset of AF relative to that of the initial HF diagnosis. In a cohort whose first AF and HF diagnoses were &lt;12 years prior to randomization, in which AF onset did not precede HF by more than 2 years (n = 196), the HR was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.87; p = 0.011). Conclusions: Pharmacogenetically guided bucindolol therapy did not reduce the recurrence of AF/AFL or ACM compared to that of metoprolol therapy in HFrEF patients, but populations were identified who merited further investigation in future phase 3 trials. ? 2019","beta 1 adrenergic receptor; bucindolol; metoprolol succinate; placebo; ADRB1 gene; aged; Article; bradycardia; cardioversion; cause of death; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug safety; electrocardiography; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genotype; hazard ratio; heart atrium flutter; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart tamponade; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; New York Heart Association class; personalized medicine; phase 2 clinical trial; phase 3 clinical trial; phenotype; population research; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; respiratory failure; sinus rhythm; treatment duration; treatment response"
"Dysglycemia and the density of the coronary vasa vasorum","2019","OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to determine the relationship between dysglycemia and the coronary artery vasa vasorum density. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The left anterior descending coronary artery was removed from 57 deceased individuals during autopsy, and the capillaries in the vessel wall were identified using fluorescent immunohistochemical staining. HbA1c was determined in postmortem whole blood for each individual. The density of the vasa vasorum in the intima-media and the adventitia was manually quantified and recorded by readers unaware of the individual’s other characteristics. RESULTS The individuals with diabetes had a lower density of the coronary vasa vasorum than those without diabetes. The higher the HbA1c, the lower the density of these vessels in the adventitia and entire vessel wall.

"Autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and venous limb gangrene after aortic dissection repair: in vitro and in vivo effects of intravenous immunoglobulin","2019","BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic disorder characterized by heparin-dependent antibodies that activate platelets (PLTs) via PLT FcγIIa receptors. “Autoimmune” HIT (aHIT) indicates a HIT subset where thrombocytopenia progresses or persists despite stopping heparin; aHIT sera activate PLTs strongly even in the absence of heparin (heparin-independent PLT-activating properties). Affected patients are at risk of severe complications, including dual macro- and microvascular thrombosis leading to venous limb gangrene. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) offers an approach to interrupt heparin-independent PLT-activating effects of aHIT antibodies. CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old male who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass for aortic dissection developed aHIT, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and deep vein thrombosis; progression to venous limb gangrene occurred during partial thromboplastin time (PTT)-adjusted bivalirudin infusion (underdosing from “PTT confounding”). Thrombocytopenia recovered with high-dose IVIG, although the PLT count increase began only after the third dose of a 5-day IVIG regimen (0.4 g/kg/day × 5 days). We reviewed case reports and case series of IVIG for treating HIT, focusing on various IVIG dosing regimens used. RESULTS: Patient serum–induced PLT activation was inhibited in vitro by IVIG in a dose-dependent fashion; inhibition of PLT activation by IVIG was much more marked in the absence of heparin versus the presence of heparin (0.2 U/mL). Our literature review indicated 1 g/kg × 2 IVIG dosing as most common for treating HIT, usually associated with rapid PLT count recovery. CONCLUSION: Our clinical and laboratory observations support dose-dependent efficacy of IVIG for decreasing PLT activation and thus correcting thrombocytopenia in aHIT. Our case experience and literature review suggests dosing of 1 g/kg IVIG × 2 for patients with severe aHIT. ? 2019 AABB","bivalirudin; dalteparin; heparin; immunoglobulin; warfarin; adverse outcome; aged; aortic dissection; aortic reconstruction; Article; cardiopulmonary bypass; case report; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; computer assisted tomography; deep vein thrombosis; disease exacerbation; disseminated intravascular clotting; dose response; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug megadose; gangrene; heparin induced thrombocytopenia; human; hypoxemia; in vitro study; in vivo study; limb ischemia; male; partial thromboplastin time; platelet count; thorax pain; treatment outcome; venous limb gangrene"
"Matter beginning to matter: On posthumanist understandings of the vital emergence of health","2019","In recent years much health research across the social sciences and humanities has undergone a noticeable, albeit by no means cohesive or comprehensive, ‘turn’ towards a posthumanist theoretical orientation. This paper reviews the radical ideas about health's emergence that have accompanied this turn, noting the core processes that are understood to always be in play. In particular, while acknowledging that not all humanistic ideas have been rejected in this work, it describes how some have been reworked and extended in ‘other-than-fully conscious’ and ‘more-than-human’ terms. The paper assesses and synthesizes this diverse literature, emphasising the novel understandings of corporeality, materiality, assemblage, relationality, vitality and affect that have become distinctive features of it. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","academic research; health geography; ideology; material culture; philosophy; theoretical study; affect; Article; attitude to health; behavior assessment; health status; humanism; medical information; medical research; mental health; nonhuman; social behavior; sociology; thinking; wellbeing"
"Assessment of critical habitat for common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in an urbanized coastal wetland","2019","Critical habitats such as nesting areas and overwintering sites are specific areas used by organisms to carry out important life functions. In many urbanized centers, critical habitats of at-risk species have often become degraded and/or fragmented because of human activities. Such is the case for the population of common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in Cootes Paradise Marsh, a highly urbanized ecosystem located at the western tip of Lake Ontario. In addition to these threats, mortality from collisions with cars on a four-lane highway at the western end of the marsh has greatly reduced wildlife populations. Here, we examine long-term changes in critical habitat distribution that has accompanied urbanization of Cootes Paradise Marsh from 1934 to 2010. We delineated potential nesting habitat for snapping turtles in 7 digitized aerial photos, using literature information and 2017 nesting surveys as guides. Between 1934 and 2010, total area of potential nesting habitat decreased by almost 50%. Nesting surveys confirmed that snapping turtles were disproportionately using created nesting mounds and this suggests that availability of natural nesting habitat is limited. We also radio tracked 11 snapping turtles to identify use of overwintering habitat. Temperature loggers monitored in-situ water temperatures at each turtle’s location and other unconfirmed habitats. The snapping turtle population overwintered in a wide range of upland terrestrial habitats and we found consistent characteristics regarding water temperature across both confirmed and unconfirmed sites, therefore suggesting overwintering habitat may not be limiting within the marsh. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Sport activities and exercise as part of routine cancer care in children and adolescents","2019","The burden of morbidities affecting cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, metabolism, and psychosocial health in young patients with cancer is high. It is alarming that patients and survivors of childhood cancer are less physically active than their healthy peers, since exercise may improve many of these conditions significantly and is associated with reduction in all-cause mortality in the general population. Systematic integration of exercise programing into cancer care remains an exception, above all in children. Pediatric oncologists may contribute to a culture shift towards educating patients and stakeholders on the benefit of exercise and sports for children and adolescents with cancer. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adolescent; all cause mortality; article; cancer patient; cancer survival; cardiovascular system; child; childhood cancer survivor; exercise; human; metabolism; morbidity; musculoskeletal system; pediatric oncologist; physical activity; population; youth sport; exercise; neoplasm; physiology; self care; sport; Adolescent; Child; Exercise; Humans; Neoplasms; Self-Management; Sports"
"Soluble Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1) as a Biomarker of Vascular Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults","2019","Background: Endothelial dysfunction and subsequent inflammation contribute to the development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) is upregulated in endothelial dysfunction and promotes an inflammatory response; however, the relationship between sICAM-1 and VCI remains equivocal. Objective: To determine whether sICAM-1 contributes to the prediction of VCI. Methods: Community-dwelling older adults (n = 172) from the ""Cohort of Obesity, Sarcopenia and Frailty of Older Mexican Adults"" (COSFOMA) study were identified as VCI or controls using standard neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging. sICAM-1 was quantified using ELISA, and multivariate logistic regression determined the association between sICAM-1 and VCI. Results: A total of 31 VCI cases were identified. sICAM-1 was higher in VCI (VCI: 450.7 [241.6] ng/mL vs. controls: 296.9 [140.9] ng/mL). sICAM-1 concentrations above the 90th percentile (464.1 ng/mL) were associated with VCI group membership in all models (OR: 6.9, 95% CI: 1.1-42.2). The final saturated model explained 64% of the variance in VCI group membership. Conclusion: High concentrations of sICAM-1 are independently associated with VCI group membership. Efforts to further characterize the relationship between indices of endothelial dysfunction and pathological changes to the aging brain should be further pursued. ? 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

"Accounting for context: Social enterprises and meaningful employment for people with mental illness","2019","Background: Many people living with mental illness want paid work, but finding and maintaining mainstream employment remains challenging. In recent decades, social enterprises have emerged as one alternative site for paid employment. Existing research has examined the experiences of people with mental illness working in social enterprises, but less is known about the organizational character of these workplaces. Objective: The objective of this paper is to develop a better understanding of social enterprises as organizational contexts for workers with mental illness. Methods: The research employed a qualitative methodology, conducting semi-structured interviews with executive directors and managers at 42 organizations operating 67 social enterprises across Canada Results: While there are strong similarities in organizational mandate to create meaningful employment there are also important variations between social enterprises. These include variations in size, economic activity and organizational structure, as well as differences in hours of work, rates of pay and the nature and extent of workplace accommodation. These variations reflect both immediate organizational contexts as well as broader economic constraints that enterprises confront. Conclusions: Understanding the varied nature of social enterprises is important for thinking about future enterprise development, and the capacity of such organizations to create meaningful employment for people living with mental illness. ? 2018 IOS Press and the authors.

"A role for surgery in the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma","2019","Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has advanced over time, rendering a fatal disease now largely curable. Multiagent chemotherapy regimens, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and radiotherapy are the mainstays of care. Surgical intervention is rarely indicated other than for biopsy at diagnosis. However, for patients with recurrent relapsed HL isolated to one anatomical location, refractory to all other therapy, there may be a beneficial role for surgical excision. Herein, we report the surgical management of three relapsed patients with stage IVB HL who were refractory to multiple other therapeutic approaches, who all achieved good event-free survival after operative management. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bleomycin; carboplatin; carmustine; chlormethine; chloroethylnitrosourea; cisplatin; cytarabine; doxorubicin; etoposide; ifosfamide; melphalan; prednisone; procarbazine; vinblastine; vincristine sulfate; adjuvant radiotherapy; adolescent; adult; Article; autologous bone marrow transplantation; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; axillary lymph node; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; cancer survival; case report; case study; child; clinical article; elective surgery; event free survival; female; follow up; human; lobectomy; lung resection; lymph node metastasis; lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma; male; mediastinum lymph node; nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma; pericardial resection; postoperative period; priority journal; recurrent disease; school child; surgical approach; young adult; Hodgkin disease; pathology; procedures; prognosis; salvage therapy; tumor recurrence; Adolescent; Child; Female; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prognosis; Salvage Therapy; Surgical Procedures, Operative"
"Efficacy of pharmacological therapies in patients with IBS with diarrhoea or mixed stool pattern: systematic review and network meta-analysis","2020","Objective Over half of patients with IBS have either diarrhoea (IBS-D) or a mixed stool pattern (IBS-M). The relative efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies is unclear in the absence of head-to-head trials. We conducted a network meta-analysis to resolve this uncertainty. Design We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov through January 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies (alosetron, eluxadoline, ramosetron and rifaximin) in adults with IBS-D or IBS-M. Trials included in the analysis reported a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, and data were pooled using a random effects model. Efficacy and safety of all pharmacological therapies were reported as a pooled relative risk with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested. Treatments were ranked according to their p score. Results We identified 18 eligible RCTs (seven alosetron, five ramosetron, two rifaximin and four eluxadoline), containing 9844 patients. All were superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS-D or IBS-M at 12 weeks, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended endpoint for trials in IBS. Alosetron 1 mg twice daily was ranked first for efficacy, based on the FDA-recommended composite endpoint of improvement in both abdominal pain and stool consistency, effect on global symptoms of IBS and effect on stool consistency. Ramosetron 2.5μg once daily was ranked first for effect on abdominal pain. Total numbers of adverse events were significantly greater with alosetron 1 mg twice daily and ramosetron 2.5μg once daily, compared with placebo. Rifaximin 550 mg three times daily ranked first for safety. Constipation was significantly more common with all drugs, except rifaximin 550 mg three times daily. Conclusion In a network meta-analysis of RCTs of pharmacological therapies for IBS-D and IBS-M, we found all drugs to be superior to placebo, but alosetron and ramosetron appeared to be the most effective. ?

"Practical advice for selecting or determining trophic magnification factors for application under the European Union Water Framework Directive","2019","European Union Directive 2013/39/EU, which amended and updated the Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC) and its daughter directive (2008/105/EC), sets Environmental Quality Standards for biota (EQS biota ) for a number of bioaccumulative chemicals. These chemicals pose a threat to both aquatic wildlife and human health via the consumption of contaminated prey or the intake of contaminated food originating from the aquatic environment. EU member states will need to establish programs to monitor the concentration of 11 priority substances in biota and assess compliance against these new standards for the classification of surface water bodies. An EU-wide guidance effectively addresses the implementation of EQS biota . Flexibility is allowed in the choice of target species used for monitoring to account for both diversity of habitats and aquatic community composition across Europe. According to that guidance, the consistency and comparability of monitoring data across member states should be enhanced by adjusting the data on biota contaminant concentrations to a standard trophic level by use of the appropriate trophic magnification factor (TMF), a metric of contaminant biomagnification through the food web. In this context, the selection of a TMF value for a given substance is a critical issue, because this field-derived measure of trophic magnification can show variability related to the characteristics of ecosystems, the biology and ecology of organisms, the experimental design, and the statistical methods used for TMF calculation. This paper provides general practical advice and guidance for the selection or determination of TMFs for reliable application within the context of the WFD (i.e., adjustment of monitoring data and EQS derivation). Based on a series of quality attributes for TMFs, a decision tree is presented to help end users select a reasonable and relevant TMF. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:266–277. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Vocational experiences and career support opportunities among Canadian men with moderate and severe haemophilia","2019","Aim: The purpose of this research was to provide haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) with guidance for the potential development of appropriate and timely interventions related to employment and vocational counselling and supports. Methods: A multi-method approach was employed, where initial focus groups (n?=?13) and review of the literature were used to construct a structured survey instrument (n?=?75). Results: Focus group participants made choices about employment with keen awareness of how their bleeding disorder might limit them physically; they described the role of social networks in career choices; and they wrestled with issues of disclosure. Among survey respondents, 47% per cent of respondents reported that haemophilia had a small negative impact, 27% felt that it had a moderate negative impact and 13% indicated that it had a very large negative impact. One-third of respondents had at some point received employment-related advice from a member of their haemophilia treatment centre team. Roughly two-thirds of respondents suggested that vocational advice would be “somewhat” or “very” useful at present. Conclusion: Canadian men with haemophilia continue to experience challenges related to employment and career development. There appears to be an opportunity for HTCs to incorporate additional supports on these topics into the range of services which they currently provide. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; age; Article; awareness; Canadian; career; controlled study; disease severity; employment; hemophilia; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient attitude; patient counseling; personal experience; physical activity; priority journal; quality of working life; social network; vocation; young adult; Canada; female; hemophilia A; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Canada; Employment; Female; Hemophilia A; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Two approaches to longitudinal qualitative analyses in rehabilitation and disability research","2019","Purpose: Although relatively unknown within the field of rehabilitation, qualitative longitudinal research is ideal for rehabilitation and disability research that aims to understand health-related challenges over time. We describe the strengths and challenges of longitudinal qualitative research using two concrete examples. Materials and methods: Qualitative longitudinal research often involves in-depth interviews of participants on multiple occasions over time. Analytic approaches are complex, summarizing data both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We present two detailed analytic approaches used in research with people living with HIV in Zambia and Canada. Results: Our experiences provide three recommendations. First, development of the initial analytic coding framework should include both inductive and deductive approaches. Second, given the large quantity of data generated through longitudinal qualitative research, it is important to proactively develop strategies for data analysis and management. Third, as retention of participants is challenging over time, we recommend the use of a consistent interviewer over the duration of the study to promote a trusting relationship. Conclusions: Longitudinal qualitative research has much to offer researchers and can provide clinicians with insights on the challenges of living with chronic and episodic disability. The flexibility in analytic approaches allows for diverse strategies to best address the rehabilitation and disability research questions and allow for insights into living with disability over time. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Standards of care for hypoparathyroidism in adults: A Canadian and international consensus","2019","Purpose: To provide practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of hypoparathyroidism in adults. Methods: Key questions pertaining to the diagnosis and management of hypoparathyroidism were addressed following a literature review. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from January 2000 to March 2018 using keywords 'hypoparathyroidism, diagnosis, treatment, calcium, PTH, calcidiol, calcitriol, hydrochlorothiazide and pregnancy'. Only English language papers involving humans were included. We excluded letters, reviews and editorials. The quality of evidence was evaluated based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. These standards of care for hypoparathyroidism have been endorsed by the Canadian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Results: Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and a low or inappropriately normal serum parathyroid hormone level (PTH). The majority of cases are post-surgical (75%) with nonsurgical causes accounting for the remaining 25% of cases. A careful review is required to determine the etiology of the hypoparathyroidism in individuals with nonsurgical disea se. Hypoparathyroidism is associated with significant morbidity and poor quality of life. Treatment requires close monitoring as well as patient education. Conventional therapy with calcium supplements and active vitamin D analogs i s effective in improving serum calcium as well as in controlling the symptoms of hypocalcemia. PTH replacement is of value in lowering the doses of calcium and active vitamin D analogs required and may be of value in lowering long-term complications of hypoparathyroidism. This manuscript addresses acute and chronic management of hypoparathyroidism in adults. Main conclusions: Hypoparathyroidism requires careful evaluation and pharmacologic intervention in order to improve serum calcium and control the symptoms of hypocalcemia. Frequen t laboratory monitoring of the biochemical profile and patient education is essential to achieving optimal control of serum calcium. ? 2019 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","calcium; copper; magnesium; parathyroid hormone; vitamin D derivative; adult; Albright syndrome; amyloidosis; calcium blood level; Canada; clinical feature; Cochrane Library; consensus; diagnostic procedure; DiGeorge syndrome; disease association; disorders of mitochondrial functions; Embase; evaluation study; gene mutation; genetic variability; GNAS1 gene; health care quality; human; hyperparathyroidism; hyperphosphatemia; hypocalcemia; hypoparathyroidism; idiopathic disease; idiopathic hypoparathyroidism; information retrieval; lactation; magnesium deficiency; maternal disease; maternal inheritance; Medline; metastasis; parathyroid hormone blood level; paternal inheritance; patient education; pregnancy; priority journal; progressive osseous heteroplasia; pseudohypoparathyroidism; radiation exposure; Review; sarcoidosis; standard; substitution therapy; Wilson disease"
"Risk for Maternal Depressive Symptoms and Perceived Stress by Ethnicities in Canada: From Pregnancy Through the Preschool Years [Risque de sympt?mes d?pressifs maternels et stress per?u par les ethnies au Canada : de la grossesse aux ann?es pr?scolaires]","2019","Objective: Past cross-sectional studies have reported that mothers from ethnic minorities experience higher levels of prenatal and post-partum psychosocial distress compared with mothers from ethnic majorities. However, no studies have examined how the pattern varies longitudinally in a Canadian population of heterogeneous ethnicity. Methods: We analyzed data from 3,138 mothers participating in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, a longitudinal multi-center study incorporating 10 distinct waves of psychosocial data collection from pregnancy until the index child was aged 5 y. Maternal self-identified ethnicity was grouped as White Caucasian, First Nations, Black, Southeast Asian, East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic and mixed ethnicity. We performed a multi-level regression to determine whether mothers of specific minority ethnicities were more likely to experience higher levels of distress (i.e. depressive symptoms and perceived stress) compared to white Caucasian mothers. Results: Mothers self-identifying as Black or First Nations had consistently higher distress scores than mothers from other ethnicities across all data collection times. After adjusting for relevant variables (history of depression, education, household income, marital status, and social support), First Nations mothers had a 20% increase in the mean scores of depressive symptoms compared to White Caucasian Mothers. Conclusions: Increased levels of perinatal and post-partum distress were seen in only some ethnic minority groups. Studies should avoid collapsing all categories into ethnic minority or majority and may need to consider how ethnicity interacts with other sociodemographic factors such as poverty. ?

"Adult Mental Health Outcomes of Preterm Survivors Experiencing Suicidal Ideation in Adolescence","2019","The aim of this study was to examine the link between suicidal ideation in adolescence (age 12–16) and symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood (age 22–26) in a birth cohort of extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000g) survivors and matched normal birth weight (NBW; >2500 g) control participants. This study utilized data from a longitudinally followed cohort of 129 ELBW survivors and 116 NBW individuals born in Ontario, Canada between the years 1977 and 1982. Participants self-reported suicidal ideation via questionnaire during adolescence (age 12–16). The depression, anxiety, inattention, and antisocial behavior subscales of the Young Adult Self Report (YASR) were used to assess symptoms of psychopathology during adulthood (age 22–26). Associations were examined in each birth weight group separately prior to and after adjustment for covariates. Before and after adjustment for covariates, suicidal ideation in NBW adolescents predicted symptoms of depression, anxiety, inattention, and antisociality in adulthood. Suicidal ideation among ELBW adolescents predicted inattentive and depressive symptoms, and antisocial behavior only before adjustment. Adolescents born at NBW who endorse suicidal ideation are at elevated risk for developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, inattention, and antisocial problems in adulthood even after adjustment. Among ELBW survivors, the risks were lower and appear to be due to confounding factors. ? 2018, Copyright ? International Academy for Suicide Research.",""
"A systematic review of the risk of motor vehicle collision after stroke or transient ischemic attack","2019","Background: Returning to driving after stroke is one of the key goals in stroke rehabilitation, and fitness to drive guidelines must be informed by evidence pertaining to risk of motor vehicle collision (MVC) in this population. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are associated with an increased MVC risk. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and TRID through December 2016. Pairs of reviewers came to consensus on inclusion, based on an iterative review of abstracts and full-text manuscripts, on data extraction, and on the quality of evidence. Results: Reviewers identified 5,605 citations, and 12 articles met inclusion criteria. Only one of three case-control studies showed an association between stroke and MVC (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.9). Of five cohort reports, only one study, limited to self-report, found an increased risk of MVC associated with stroke or TIA (RR 2.71, 95% CI 1.11–6.61). Two of four cross-sectional studies using computerized driving simulators identified a more than two-fold risk of MVCs among participants with stroke compared with controls. The difference in one of the studies was restricted to those with middle cerebral artery stroke. Conclusions: The evidence does not support a robust increase in risk of MVCs. While stroke clearly prevents some patients from driving at all and impairs driving performance in others, individualized assessment and clinical judgment must continue to be used in assessing and advising those stroke patients who return to driving about their MVC risk. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","case control study; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; human; middle cerebral artery; Review; risk; self report; systematic review; traffic accident; transient ischemic attack; car driving; psychology; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Stroke"
"Industrial innovation and infrastructure as drivers of change in the Canadian boreal zone1","2019","Much of Canada's industrial sector is driven by natural resources and relies heavily on provisioning services supplied by the boreal zone. However, the sometimes intensive processes used by resource-based industries and their associated infrastructure have significantly altered the region, creating concerns over the future socio-ecological health of the boreal zone. Addressing these concerns will require industries reliant on natural resources from the boreal zone to innovate their processes, management, and infrastructure to improve extraction efficiency while contributing to society's increasing expectations related to sustainability. Here, we explore past, current, and future trends in industrial innovation and infrastructure in the boreal zone for forestry, mining, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and renewable sources of power generation. We assess the role of innovation on the future socio-ecological state of the boreal zone by considering interactions between innovation in industry and infrastructure and other key drivers of change in the boreal, such as atmospheric changes, changing demands for nonprovisioning and provisioning ecosystem services, governance, and demographics and social values. We present future scenarios highlighting three divergent trajectories of change in boreal ecosystems based on past and current states of innovation in industry and infrastructure. We suggest that minimizing impacts of natural resource extraction activities in the boreal zone will only be possible through innovation directly focused on reducing the human footprint on the landscape. Innovation in the information technology sector related to process, management, and end products within these industries and placing greater emphasis on cross-sectoral collaboration will be key to achieving this goal. ? 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.","Extraction; Industry; Natural resources management; Atmospheric changes; Ecosystem services; Extraction efficiencies; Industrial innovation; Information technology sector; Infrastructure; Resource development; Resource extraction; Ecosystems; Ecosystems; Extraction; Innovation; Management; Natural Resources; Processes; Services; Trajectories"
"Climate warming will not decrease perceived low-temperature extremes in China","2019","Temperature-related health metrics are often determined not only by temperatures but also by multiple climate variables. Temperatures compounded by other climate variables are of significant concern in the assessment of climate change impacts on public health. Temperatures, wind speeds and their combined effects are investigated here for a comprehensive study of how measured temperatures, perceived temperature, and their related extremes will change in China under climate change conditions. Future projections of combined temperatures and wind speeds over China are generated through the PRECIS regional climate modeling system. Results indicate that temperatures can increase nearly 6?°C over China by the end of the twenty-first century from the baseline period (1976–2005) without considering the wind speed changes. However, by considering the combined effect of temperature and wind speed, the perceived temperatures over China are projected to decrease by 4.8?°C relative to the observed values in the baseline period. This unexpected drop in the future perceived temperatures suggests the projected warming is likely to be offset to a large extent by a potential increase in wind speed. This may be related to the RCM’s high-resolution making the thermal contrast distribute at finer scales. The mechanism behind this result needs to be further investigated to help understand the related physical processes and the associated uncertainties at regional scales. As for low-temperature extremes, China is projected to experience an apparent decrease in the frequency and duration of extreme cold events in the future compared to the baseline period without considering the combined wind chill effect. Considering the wind chill effect, an opposite trend for extreme cold events is detected, with an increase by 21% in the frequency of temperatures below ? 20?°C. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","atmospheric dynamics; climate effect; climate modeling; downscaling; extreme event; future prospect; low temperature; warming; weather forecasting; wind velocity; China"
"Surgical attitudes toward preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging in women with early-stage breast cancer","2019","Background Preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is commonly requested by surgeons in the initial workup of women with breast cancer; however, its use is controversial. We performed a survey of breast cancer surgeons across Canada to investigate current knowledge about, attitudes to, and self-reported use of preoperative breast mri in a publicly funded health care system in light of the limited evidence to support it. Methods All identified general surgeons in Canada were mailed a survey instrument designed to probe current practice and knowledge of published trials. Results Of 403 responding surgeons, 233 (58%) indicated that they performed breast cancer surgery. Of those 233, 218 (94%) had access to breast mri and completed the entire survey. Overall, 54.6% of responding surgeons felt that breast mri was useful in surgical planning, and more than half (58.3%) indicated that their frequency of use was likely to increase over the next 5 years. Surgeons found preoperative mri most useful in detecting mammographically occult disease (71.5% of respondents) and in planning for breast-conserving surgery (57.3%). The main limitations reported were timely access to mri (51%) and false positives (36.7%). Responses suggest a knowledge gap in awareness of published trials in breast mri. Conclusions Our study found that, in early-stage breast cancer, self-reported use of mri by breast cancer surgeons in Canada varied widely. Reported indications did not align with published data, and significant gaps in self-reported knowledge of the data were evident. Our results would support the development and dissemination of guidelines to optimize use of mri.

"Outcomes of bedaquiline treatment in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis","2019","Bedaquiline is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). We pooled data from 5 cohorts of patients treated with bedaquiline in France, Georgia, Armenia, and South Africa and in a multicountry study. The rate of culture conversion to negative at 6 months (by the end of 6 months of treatment) was 78% (95% CI 73.5%–81.9%), and the treatment success rate was 65.8% (95% CI 59.9%–71.3%). Death rate was 11.7% (95% CI 7.0%–19.1%). Up to 91.1% (95% CI 82.2%–95.8%) of the patients experienced >1 adverse event, and 11.2% (95% CI 5.0%–23.2%) experienced a serious adverse event. Lung cavitations were consistently associated with unfavorable outcomes.

"Closed Limb Fractures With Compromised Vascularization: A Narrative Review","2019","Vascular compromised fractures typically result in a high rate of healing complications, such as avascular necrosis, nonunion, delayed union, and arthritis, which severely affect a patient’s function and quality of life. The purpose of this review was to identify and describe the epidemiology and available treatment options for the most well-known vascular compromised closed fractures. The injuries discussed in detail in this review were scaphoid, lunate, femoral neck, and talar fractures. Current evidence suggests that optimal treatment for vascular compromised fractures is dependent on the degree of fracture displacement and comminution, and the patient’s post-injury functional demands, age, and bone quality. Conservative efforts generally include casting or splinting with a period of immobilization. Surgery is indicated for substantially displaced fractures, patients who require higher functional demands and an earlier return to activity, or if complications occur following nonoperative treatment; however, operative intervention is typically performed for femoral neck fractures regardless of the amount of displacement. Various surgical techniques exist, though internal fixation with screws is a common procedure among these injuries and can be used in combination with other implants, such as plating or Kirschner wires (k-wires), when needed. Severe fracture comminution, poor bone quality, or arthritis can contraindicate the use of screws and more invasive intervention will be required. Bone grafting is done in some cases to enhance vascularity. Salvage procedures exist for patients who develop severe complications, but these will permanently alter the anatomy of the injured area and should be considered a last resort. ?

"Probabilistic Framework for Lifetime Bridge-Bearing Demands","2019","The life expectancy of bridge bearings is not well understood or predicted, and bearing replacement is primarily determined through field inspection and engineering judgement. An improved estimate of the time line for bearing replacement would aid in maintenance scheduling and budgets. As a first step in determining the age for replacement, the annual and lifetime cyclic demands must be estimated. The bearing displacements are largely caused by temperature fluctuation, seismic events, and traffic cycles. In this study, a probabilistic framework is presented to quantify the annual cyclic displacement demands on a bearing from these diverse loadings using an idealized archetypal continuous concrete girder bridge. The likelihood of an occurrence per annum of cycles of increasing amplitudes is presented. In addition, the mean and cycle periods, which are related to the loading scenario, and cycle amplitude are discussed, and a suggested loading protocol is presented. Three locations across Canada are considered (Quebec City, Toronto, and Vancouver) to investigate the influence of location on the bearing demands. The annual expected demands can be used for future work on fatigue testing of bearings to better relate to replacement schedule projections for bridge bearings. ? 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Budget control; Fatigue testing; Bearing displacements; Cyclic displacements; Engineering judgement; Life expectancies; Loading protocols; Maintenance scheduling; Probabilistic framework; Temperature fluctuation; Bridge bearings"
"Associations Between Drinking and Cortical Thickness in Younger Adult Drinkers: Findings From the Human Connectome Project","2019","Background: Previous neuroimaging studies examining relations between alcohol misuse and cortical thickness have revealed that increased drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems are associated with thinner cortex. Although conflicting regional effects are often observed, associations are generally localized to frontal regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC], inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], and anterior cingulate cortex). Inconsistent findings may be attributed to methodological differences, modest sample sizes, and limited consideration of sex differences. Methods: This study examined neuroanatomical correlates of drinking quantity and heavy episodic drinking in a large sample of younger adults (N?=?706; Mage?=?28.8; 51% female) using magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project. Exploratory analyses examined neuroanatomical correlates of executive function (flanker task) and working memory (list sorting). Results: Hierarchical linear regression models (controlling for age, sex, education, income, smoking, drug use, twin status, and intracranial volume) revealed significant inverse associations between drinks in past week and frequency of heavy drinking and cortical thickness in a majority of regions examined. The largest effect sizes were found for frontal regions (DLPFC, IFG, and the precentral gyrus). Follow-up regression models revealed that the left DLPFC was uniquely associated with both drinking variables. Sex differences were also observed, with significant effects largely specific to men. Conclusions: This study adds to the understanding of brain correlates of alcohol use in a large, gender-balanced sample of younger adults. Although the cross-sectional methodology precludes causal inferences, these findings provide a foundation for rigorous hypothesis testing in future longitudinal investigations. ? 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism","adult; alcohol consumption; alcoholic beverage; anterior cingulate; anterior insula; Article; binge drinking; connectome; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; drug use; educational status; executive function; female; follow up; heavy drinking; human; income; inferior frontal gyrus; intracranial pressure; male; neuroimaging; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; orbital cortex; postcentral gyrus; posterior cingulate; precuneus; primary motor cortex; priority journal; sex difference; smoking; superior temporal gyrus; task performance; temporal cortex; working memory"
"Canadian medical students' perceived motivation, confidence and frequency recommending physical activity","2019","Despite the evidence supporting the benefits of physical activity in the prevention and treatment of most medical conditions, physical activity remains under-prescribed by physicians. Medical students will form habits during training that they are likely to maintain as future physicians. The overall purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism(s)contributing to frequency in recommending physical activity, to provide insight into how we can increase physical activity recommendations in future practice as physicians. First to fourth year medical students at three Canadian universities responded to an online survey (N = 221; 12% response rate)between November 2017 and January 2018. Results revealed that engaging in strenuous physical activity was a strong predictor for frequency in recommending physical activity to patients (p <.001). Confidence in recommending physical activity mediated the relationship between strenuous physical activity and frequency recommending physical activity (p =.005); motivation did not mediate this relationship. Students were more motivated, than they were confident, to assess, advise, counsel, prescribe and refer patients regarding physical activity (p <.05). While 70% of students stated they are aware of the Canadian physical activity guidelines, only 52% accurately recalled them. Findings suggest that increased training related to physical activity should be included in the medical school curriculum to increase students' confidence to recommend physical activity. Another way to increase confidence and frequency in recommending physical activity is to help students engage in more strenuous physical activity themselves, which will ultimately benefit both medical students and their future patients. ? 2019","adult; article; curriculum; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical school; medical student; motivation; physical activity; physician; practice guideline; prescription; preventive medicine"

Perioperative management of patients on buprenorphine/naloxone is inconsistent and remains a controversial topic with mismanagement posing a significant risk to the long-term health of these patients. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search involving Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, Web of Science (Clarivate), Scopus (Elsevier), CINAHL (EbscoHosst), and PubMed (NLM). Results: Eighteen studies were included in the final sample, including one controlled study and four observational studies. Neither the controlled study nor the observational studies assessed addiction treatment retention, harm reduction, or long-term mortality rates as primary or secondary outcomes. Of the observational studies, authors showed equivalent peri- and postoperative pain control among buprenorphine continued patients. All but one authors described adequate analgesia among the case reports in which buprenorphine ? 16 mg sublingually (SL) daily was continued during the perioperative period. Long-term harm reduction was not reported with only three case reports including any long-term abstinence or relapse rates. Conclusions: The current understanding of the risks and benefits of continuing or stopping buprenorphine perioperatively is limited by a lack of high-quality evidence. Observational studies and case reports indicate no evidence against continuing buprenorphine perioperatively, especially when the dose is < 16 mg SL daily. In patients with significant potential for relapse, such as those with a recent history of OUD, the discontinuation of buprenorphine should have a strong rationale supported by patient and surgical preferences. Future studies require standardized reporting of median doses, details on the route of delivery, dosing schedules and any dosing changes, and rates of addiction relapse, including long-term morbidity and mortality where possible. ? 2018, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.","belbucca; buprenorphine; buprenorphine plus naloxone; abstinence; analgesia; clinical outcome; evidence based medicine; harm reduction; human; long term care; mortality rate; narcotic dependence; perioperative period; postoperative care; postoperative pain; priority journal; relapse; Review; risk benefit analysis; systematic review"
"Recommendations for the conduct of economic evaluations in osteoporosis: outcomes of an experts’ consensus meeting organized by the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) and the US branch of the International Osteoporosis Foundation","2019","Summary: Economic evaluations are increasingly used to assess the value of health interventions, but variable quality and heterogeneity limit the use of these evaluations by decision-makers. These recommendations provide guidance for the design, conduct, and reporting of economic evaluations in osteoporosis to improve their transparency, comparability, and methodologic standards. Introduction: This paper aims to provide recommendations for the conduct of economic evaluations in osteoporosis in order to improve their transparency, comparability, and methodologic standards. Methods: A working group was convened by the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis to make recommendations for the design, conduct, and reporting of economic evaluations in osteoporosis, to define an osteoporosis-specific reference case to serve a minimum standard for all economic analyses in osteoporosis, to discuss methodologic challenges and initiate a call for research. A literature review, a face-to-face meeting in New York City (including 11 experts), and a review/approval by a larger group of experts worldwide (including 23 experts in total) were conducted. Results: Recommendations on the type of economic evaluation, methods for economic evaluation, modeling aspects, base-case analysis and population, excess mortality, fracture costs and disutility, treatment characteristics, and model validation were provided. Recommendations for reporting economic evaluations in osteoporosis were also made and an osteoporosis-specific checklist was designed that includes items to report when performing an economic evaluation in osteoporosis. Further, 12 minimum criteria for economic evaluations in osteoporosis were identified and 12 methodologic challenges and need for further research were discussed. Conclusion: While the working group acknowledges challenges and the need for further research, these recommendations are intended to supplement general and national guidelines for economic evaluations, improve transparency, quality, and comparability of economic evaluations in osteoporosis, and maintain methodologic standards to increase their use by decision-makers. ? 2018, The Author(s).","economic evaluation; European; fracture; health care cost; human; medical society; methodology; mortality; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; priority journal; Review; consensus development; cost benefit analysis; economics; fragility fracture; osteoporosis; quality adjusted life year; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Care Costs; Humans; Models, Econometric; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Research Design"
"Faculty development in the age of competency-based medical education: A needs assessment of Canadian emergency medicine faculty and senior trainees","2019","Objectives The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) emergency medicine (EM) programs transitioned to the Competence by Design training framework in July 2018. Prior to this transition, a nation-wide survey was conducted to gain a better understanding of EM faculty and senior resident attitudes towards the implementation of this new program of assessment.Methods A multi-site, cross-sectional needs assessment survey was conducted. We aimed to document perceptions about competency-based medical education, attitudes towards implementation, perceived/prompted/unperceived faculty development needs. EM faculty and senior residents were nominated by program directors across RCPSC EM programs. Simple descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data.Results Between February and April 2018, 47 participants completed the survey (58.8% response rate). Most respondents (89.4%) thought learners should receive feedback during every shift; 55.3% felt that they provided adequate feedback. Many respondents (78.7%) felt that the ED would allow for direct observation, and most (91.5%) participants were confident that they could incorporate workplace-based assessments (WBAs). Although a fair number of respondents (44.7%) felt that Competence by Design would not impact patient care, some (17.0%) were worried that it may negatively impact it. Perceived faculty development priorities included feedback delivery, completing WBAs, and resident promotion decisions.Conclusions RCPSC EM faculty have positive attitudes towards competency-based medical education-relevant concepts such as feedback and opportunities for direct observation via WBAs. Perceived threats to Competence by Design implementation included concerns that patient care and trainee education might be negatively impacted. Faculty development should concentrate on further developing supervisors' teaching skills, focusing on feedback using WBAs. ?

"The Canadian longitudinal study on aging as a platform for exploring cognition in an aging population","2020","Objective: We present descriptive information on the cognitive measures used in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) Comprehensive Cohort, relate this to information on these measures in the extant literature, and identify key considerations for their use in research and clinical practice. Method: The CLSA Comprehensive Cohort is composed of 30,097 participants aged 45–85years at baseline who provided a broad range of sociodemographic, physical, social, and psychological health information via questionnaire and took part in detailed physical and cognitive assessments. Cognitive measures included: the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test–immediate and 5-min delayed recall, Animal Fluency, Mental Alternation Test (MAT), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Stroop Test–Victoria Version, Miami Prospective Memory Test (MPMT), and a Choice Reaction Time (CRT) task. Results: CLSA Comprehensive Cohort sample sizes were far larger than previous studies, and performances on the cognitive measures were similar to comparable groups. Within the CLSA Comprehensive Cohort, main effects of age were observed for all cognitive measures, and main effects of language were observed for all measures except the CRT. Interaction effects (language × age) were observed for the MAT, MPMT Event-based score, all time scores on the Stroop Test, and most COWAT scores. Main effects of education were observed for all measures except for the MPMT Time score in the French sample, and interaction effects (age × education) were observed for the RAVLT (immediate and delayed) for the English sample and the Stroop Dot time for the French sample. Conclusion: This examination of the cognitive measures used in the CLSA Comprehensive Cohort lends support to their use in large studies of health and aging. We propose further exploration of the cognitive measures within the CLSA to make this information relevant to and available for clinical practice. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; aged; aging; article; choice reaction time; clinical practice; cohort analysis; controlled oral word association test; controlled study; education; female; human; human experiment; language; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prospective memory; psychological well-being; questionnaire; recall; Rey auditory verbal learning test; sample size; Stroop test"
"Development and pilot of an interprofessional pediatric resuscitation program for non-acute care inpatient providers","2019","Multiprofessional ward healthcare providers are generally unprepared to assemble and engage in the initial resuscitation of pediatric inpatients. This is important as the performance of these first-responders, in the several minutes prior to the arrival of acute care support, may have significant effects on overall patient outcome. Accordingly, we aimed to develop and pilot a training program intended for non-acute care inpatient providers, relevant to their working context. Using the latest theory and evidence in medical education, we created an interprofessional, entirely in-situ, simulation-based small-group activity. The activity was then piloted for four months with the goals of assessing perceived usefulness, as well as implementation factors such as participant accessibility and overall resource requirements. A total of 37 interprofessional (physician and nursing) staff were trained in 16 small group sessions over four months. Post-participation questionnaires revealed that the activity was perceived to be highly useful for their practice; especially the rapid cycle deliberate practice instructional method, and the increased focus on crisis resource management. Resource requirements were comparable to, and perhaps less than, existing acute care training programs. This project describes the preliminary steps taken in creating a curriculum intended to improve interprofessional resuscitation performance across an institution. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Truncating Mutations in UBAP1 Cause Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia","2019","The diagnostic gap for rare neurodegenerative diseases is still considerable, despite continuous advances in gene identification. Many novel Mendelian genes have only been identified in a few families worldwide. Here we report the identification of an autosomal-dominant gene for hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in 10 families that are of diverse geographic origin and whose affected members all carry unique truncating changes in a circumscript region of UBAP1 (ubiquitin-associated protein 1). HSP is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive lower-limb spasticity and weakness, as well as frequent bladder dysfunction. At least 40% of affected persons are currently undiagnosed after exome sequencing. We identified pathological truncating variants in UBAP1 in affected persons from Iran, USA, Germany, Canada, Spain, and Bulgarian Roma. The genetic support ranges from linkage in the largest family (LOD = 8.3) to three confirmed de novo mutations. We show that mRNA in the fibroblasts of affected individuals escapes nonsense-mediated decay and thus leads to the expression of truncated proteins; in addition, concentrations of the full-length protein are reduced in comparison to those in controls. This suggests either a dominant-negative effect or haploinsufficiency. UBAP1 links endosomal trafficking to the ubiquitination machinery pathways that have been previously implicated in HSPs, and UBAP1 provides a bridge toward a more unified pathophysiology. ? 2019","messenger RNA; ubiquitin; ubiquitin associated protein 1; unclassified drug; carrier protein; isoprotein; UBAP1 protein, human; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; bladder dysfunction; Bulgarian (people); Canadian; cerebellum; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; embryo; European; exome; fibroblast; gait disorder; gene expression; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic identification; genetic linkage; genetic variability; Germanic people; haploinsufficiency; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; human; immunochemistry; in vivo study; Iranian people; limb weakness; limit of detection; mutational analysis; nonhuman; nonsense mediated mRNA decay; onset age; pathophysiology; phenotypic variation; prediction; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; pyramidal tract; signal transduction; Spaniard; spastic paraplegia; UBAP1 gene; ubiquitination; urinary urgency; zebra fish; adolescent; adult; aged; animal; child; disease model; dominant gene; endosome; factual database; family health; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; genomics; HEK293 cell line; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; male; metabolism; middle aged; mutation; pedigree; preschool child; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Child; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Disease Models, Animal; Endosomes; Family Health; Female; Fibroblasts; Genes, Dominant; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genomics; Haploinsufficiency; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Pedigree; Protein Isoforms; Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary; Young Adult; Zebrafish"

This phase I study assessed safety and toxicity of temsirolimus in combination with vinblastine in children. Procedure: Patients???1 and???18 years with recurrent/refractory solid or CNS tumors were eligible. Vinblastine (4?mg/m 2 ) and temsirolimus (15?mg/m 2 ) were administered i.v. weekly, with planned dose escalation of vinblastine using a rolling six phase I design. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were collected. Results: Seven patients with median age 12 years (range, 8–18 years) were enrolled; all were evaluable for toxicity and six for response. At dose level 1, four of six patients developed grade 3 mucositis, of which one met duration criteria for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Four patients required dose omissions for grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, including one prolonged neutropenia DLT. A subsequent patient was enrolled on dose level ?2 (temsirolimus 10?mg/m 2 , vinblastine 4?mg/m 2 ) with no protocol-related toxicity?&gt;?grade 1, except grade 2 neutropenia. Two serious adverse events (SAE) occurred—an allergic reaction to temsirolimus (grade 2) and an intracranial hemorrhage in a CNS tumor patient (grade 3)—unlikely related to study therapy. Soluble VEGFR2 was reduced at cycle 1, day 36 in keeping with inhibition of angiogenesis. Four patients achieved prolonged stable disease for a median of 5.0 months (range, 3.1–8.3 months).

"Application of high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to identify fecal contamination sources and to complement the detection of fecal indicator bacteria in rural groundwater","2019","Residents in rural communities across Canada collect potable water from aquifers. Fecal contaminants from sewage and agricultural runoffs can penetrate aquifers, posing a public health risk. Standard methods for detecting fecal contamination test for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), but the presence of these do not identify sources of contamination. In contrast, DNA-based diagnostic tools can achieve this important objective. We employed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and high-throughput DNA sequencing to trace fecal contamination sources in Wainfleet, a rural Ontario township that has been under the longest active boil water advisory in Canada due to FIB contamination in groundwater wells. Using traditional methods, we identified FIBs indicating persistent fecal pollution in well waters. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to profile groundwater microbial communities and identified Campylobacteraceae as a fecal contamination DNA marker in septic tank effluents (STEs). We also identified Turicibacter and Gallicola as a potential cow and chicken fecal contamination marker, respectively. Using human specific Bacteroidales markers, we identified leaking septic tanks as the likely primary fecal contamination source in some of Wainfleet's groundwater. Overall, the results support the use of sequencing-based methods to augment traditional water quality testing methods and help end-users assess fecal contamination levels and identify point and non-point pollution sources. ? 2019 IWA Publishing.

"The POCUS Pulse Check: A Case Series on a Novel Method for Determining the Presence of a Pulse Using Point-of-Care Ultrasound","2019","Background: During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pulse checks must be rapid and accurate. Despite the importance placed on the detection of a pulse, several studies have shown that health care providers have poor accuracy for detection of central pulses by palpation. To date, the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in cardiac arrest has focused on the presence of cardiac standstill and diagnosing reversible causes of the arrest. Objective: This case series highlights a simple, novel approach to determine whether pulses are present or absent by using POCUS compression of the central arteries. Discussion: Using this technique, we found that a POCUS pulse check can be consistently performed in < 5 s and is clearly determinate, even when palpation yields indeterminate results. Conclusions: In this case series, the POCUS pulse check was a valuable adjunct that helped to change management for critically ill patients. Future prospective studies are required to determine the accuracy of this technique and the impact on patient outcomes in a larger cohort. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","dopamine; epinephrine; flecainide; noradrenalin; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; bradycardia; cardiopulmonary insufficiency; cardioversion; carotid artery; case report; clinical article; compression; confusion; coronary artery atherosclerosis; critically ill patient; dizziness; echography; electroencephalogram; endotracheal intubation; faintness; female; femoral artery; heart arrest; heart palpitation; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; hypotension; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; lethargy; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pallor; palpation; point of care testing; priority journal; pulse rate; pulse wave; respiratory failure; resuscitation; very elderly; young adult"
"Effect of choice of functional units on comparative life cycle assessment of concrete mix designs","2019","The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects that the choice of functional unit has on the results of comparative life cycle assessments (LCA) for concrete. Three functional units were considered: volume, binder intensity with compressive strength as a performance indicator (BI-CS), and binder intensity with time to first repair (TFR) as the performance indicator (BI-TFR).To consider the effect of cement replacement, four mix designs with varying levels of cement replacement by fly ash (0%, 25%, 35%, and 50%) were compared using a cradle to grave comparative LCA analysis. A number of key outcomes were identified in the analysis. Firstly, when volume is used as the functional unit, the LCA results depend on the level of cement replacement and the cement content of the mix such that the higher the level of replacement, the lower the LCA results. Secondly, the LCA results were influenced by the level of cement replacement when BI-CS is used as the functional unit in that the higher the level of replacement, the lower the LCA results except for ecotoxicity and human toxicity non-cancer impact categories due to the increase in transportation flows. Finally the LCA results were influenced by the TFR of the concrete mix when BI-TFR was used as the functional unit revealing that the higher the TFR, the lower the LCA results. The choice of functional units can influence the results of a comparative LCA to the point that it changes the order of preference of concrete mix designs. ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Benchmarking; Binders; Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete mixers; Concretes; Ecodesign; Fly ash; Binder intensities; Cement content; Cement replacement; Comparative life cycle assessment; Concrete mix design; Functional units; Performance indicators; Transportation flow; Life cycle"
"Safety of Proton Pump Inhibitors Based on a Large, Multi-Year, Randomized Trial of Patients Receiving Rivaroxaban or Aspirin","2019","Background & Aims: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are effective at treating acid-related disorders. These drugs are well tolerated in the short term, but long-term treatment was associated with adverse events in observational studies. We aimed to confirm these findings in an adequately powered randomized trial. Methods: We performed a 3 × 2 partial factorial double-blind trial of 17,598 participants with stable cardiovascular disease and peripheral artery disease randomly assigned to groups given pantoprazole (40 mg daily, n = 8791) or placebo (n = 8807). Participants were also randomly assigned to groups that received rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with aspirin (100 mg once daily), rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily), or aspirin (100 mg) alone. We collected data on development of pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, other enteric infections, fractures, gastric atrophy, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality every 6 months. Patients were followed up for a median of 3.01 years, with 53,152 patient-years of follow-up. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the pantoprazole and placebo groups in safety events except for enteric infections (1.4% vs 1.0% in the placebo group; odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.75). For all other safety outcomes, proportions were similar between groups except for C difficile infection, which was approximately twice as common in the pantoprazole vs the placebo group, although there were only 13 events, so this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: In a large placebo-controlled randomized trial, we found that pantoprazole is not associated with any adverse event when used for 3 years, with the possible exception of an increased risk of enteric infections.

"The impact of pediatric emergency department crowding on patient and health care system outcomes: A multicentre cohort study","2019","BACKGROUND: Emergency department overcrowding has been associated with increased odds of hospital admission and mortality after discharge from the emergency department in predominantly adult cohorts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between crowding and the odds of several adverse outcomes among children seen at a pediatric emergency department. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving all children visiting 8 Canadian pediatric emergency departments across 4 provinces between 2010 and 2014. We analyzed the association between mean departmental length of stay for each index visit and hospital admission within 7 days or death within 14 days of emergency department discharge, as well as hospital admission at index visit and return visits within 7 days, using mixed-effects logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: A total of 1931465 index visits occurred across study sites over the 5-year period, with little variation in index visit hospital admission or median length of stay. Hospital admission within 7 days of discharge and 14-day mortality were low across provinces (0.8%-1.5% and <10 per 100000 visits, respectively), and their association with mean departmental length of stay varied by triage categories and across sites but was not significant. There were increased odds of hospital admission at the index visit with increasing departmental crowding among visits triaged to Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) score 1-2 (odds ratios [ORs] ranged from 1.01 to 1.08) and return visits among patients with a CTAS score of 4-5 discharged at the index visit at some sites (ORs ranged from 1.00 to 1.06). INTERPRETATION: Emergency department crowding was not significantly associated with hospital admission within 7 days of the emergency department visit or mortality in children. However, it was associated with increased hospital admission at the index visit for the sickest children, and with return visits to the emergency department for those less sick. ? 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors","adverse outcome; article; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; crowding (area); death; disease simulation; emergency health service; emergency ward; female; health care system; hospital admission; human; length of stay; male; mortality; multicenter study; retrospective study"
"Is Access to Care Associated With Stage at Presentation and Survival for Melanoma Patients?","2019","Background: Melanoma incidence increases with socioeconomic status but the effect of rurality and access to primary care or dermatology on patient outcomes is unclear. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine whether access to care, rurality, or socioeconomic status are associated with melanoma stage at presentation and prognosis. Methods: Linked administrative databases from Ontario, Canada, were retrospectively analyzed to identify a population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with melanoma between 2004 and 2012. Rurality was assessed using the rural index of Ontario (RIO) score, and the number of visits to dermatology and primary care was used to evaluate access to care. Results: We identified 18 776 melanoma patients, of whom 9591 had completed pathological staging. Patients with higher RIO scores, living further from a cancer center or in a rural community, were less likely to see a dermatologist in the year prior to diagnosis (P <.001 for all). Patients seen by a dermatologist within 365 days prior to diagnosis were less likely to present with stage III or IV disease (odds ratio 0.63, P <.001) and had improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.77, P <.001). There was a nonlinear association between number of family physician visits and melanoma prognosis, with patients who had 3 to 5 visits per year having the best overall survival (HR 0.88, P =.003). Conclusion: Our findings strengthen the known association between access to dermatology and melanoma outcomes by linking individual patients’ prediagnosis access to care to pathological stage at diagnosis and overall survival. ?

"Spatial and temporal trends of mercury in the aquatic food web of the lower Penobscot River, Maine, USA, affected by a chlor-alkali plant","2019","Mercury (Hg) concentrations in aquatic biota, including fish and shellfish, were measured over the period 2006–2012 in the lower Penobscot River and upper estuary (Maine, USA). The Penobscot is a system contaminated with Hg by a chlor-alkali plant that operated from 1967 to 2000, discharging 6–12 tons of mercury into the river. Mercury levels in aquatic biota were highest at sites downstream of the chlor-alkali plant and spatial trends were similar to those of sediments. Mean total Hg concentrations in fish muscle (adjusted for size or age) in the most affected areas were 521 (480, 566; 95% CI) ng/g ww in American eels, 321 (261,395) in mummichog, 121 (104, 140) in rainbow smelt, 155 (142,169) in tomcod, 55.2 (42.7,71.4) in winter flounder, and 328 (259,413) in American lobster tail and 522 (488,557) ng/g dw in blue mussel. Levels exceeded the 50 ng/g ww considered protective for piscivorous predators and were of concern for human health, with American eels and American lobster exceeding Maine's mercury action level of 200 ng/g ww. Calculations of trophic position (using nitrogen isotopes) suggested that the spatial patterns observed in total Hg concentrations were not due to changes in feeding habits of the species. Fish feeding in benthic food webs, as defined by stomach content and stable carbon isotope analyses, showed no change in Hg concentrations over time. In contrast, declining trends in Hg were found in two species dependent on pelagic food webs. The absence of declines in Hg concentrations in the benthically-based food webs, despite the fact that most Hg was discharged into the system >40 years ago, is consistent with the long recovery predicted from dated sediment cores and from similar studies elsewhere. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Chemical contamination; Fish; Isotopes; Meats; Mercury (metal); Molluscs; Rivers; Shellfish; American eel (Anguilla rostrata); American lobster (Homarus americanus); Mummichogs; Mytilus edulis; Rainbow smelt; Stable isotopes; Tomcod (Microgadus tomcod); Winter flounder; River pollution; alkali; chlorine; mercury; methylmercury; mercury; methylmercury derivative; aquatic ecosystem; bioaccumulation; bivalve; food web; lobster; mercury (element); spatiotemporal analysis; stable isotope; teleost; trend analysis; Anguilla rostrata; animal experiment; animal tissue; aquatic species; Article; benthos; concentration (parameters); controlled study; Crangon; fish; food web; Fundulus heteroclitus; geographic distribution; isotope analysis; Littorina; lobster; Microgadus tomcod; mussel; nonhuman; Osmerus mordax; Pleuronectes; Pleuronectes americanus; priority journal; residue analysis; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; stomach content; trend study; trophic level; United States; water contamination; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; estuary; food chain; industrial waste; Maine; metabolism; river; spatiotemporal analysis; water pollutant; Maine; Penobscot River; United States; Anguilla rostrata; Fundulus heteroclitus; Homarus americanus; Microgadus tomcod; Mytilus edulis; Osmerus; Osmerus mordax; Pseudopleuronectes americanus; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Food Chain; Industrial Waste; Maine; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Rivers; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"Moderate Renal Impairment and Toxic Metabolites Produced by the Intestinal Microbiome: Dietary Implications","2019","Objective: Toxic metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiome from animal proteins, carnitine (mainly from red meat), or phosphatidylcholine (mainly from egg yolk), have important adverse effects on cardiovascular disease. These are renally eliminated and may be termed gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUT). We hypothesized that even moderate renal impairment and intake of nutrient precursors would raise plasma levels of GDUT. Design: A cohort study. Setting: Academic medical center. Subjects: Patients attending stroke prevention clinics at a university medical center were recruited. Main Outcome Measure: Nutrient intake was assessed by the 131-item Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was caculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (EPI) equations. Plasma levels of trimethylamine n-oxide, p-cresyl sulfate, hippuric acid, p-cresyl glucuronide, pheny acetyl glutamine, and phenyl sulfate were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results: Among 316 patients recruited, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 66.74 (10.42) years; 59.7% were men. Mean eGFR was 76.03 ± 20.01; 57 (18%) had eGFR&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma levels of all GDUT were significantly higher even with moderate reduction of eGFR. Nutrient intake affected plasma levels of some GDUT; the effects differed by eGFR above and below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma levels were obtained fasting, so we probably underestimated the effect of nutrient intake. Conclusions: Even moderate impairment of renal function was associated with higher plasma levels of GDUT. This has dietary implications for patients at risk of atherosclerosis, particularly in those with impaired renal function (including the elderly): they should limit intake of animal protein, red meat, and egg yolk. It also points the way to novel approaches to vascular prevention, including more intensive dialysis, renal transplantation, and modification of the intestinal microbiome with probiotics or fecal transplantation. ? 2018 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.",""
"Canadian neurosurgeons' views on medical assistance in dying (MAID): A cross-sectional survey of Canadian Neurosurgical Society (CNSS) members","2019","Background The Supreme Court of Canada removed the prohibition on physicians assisting in patients dying on 6 February 2015. Bill C-14, legalising medical assistance in dying (MAID) in Canada, was subsequently passed by the House of Commons and the Senate on 17 June 2016. As this remains a divisive issue for physicians, the Canadian Neurosurgical Society (CNSS) has recently published a position statement on MAID. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey to understand the views and perceptions among CNSS members regarding MAID to inform its position statement on the issue. Data was collected from May to June 2016. Results Of the 300 active membes of the CNSS who recevied the survey, 89 respondents completed the survey, 71% of whom were attending neurosurgeons and 29% were neurosurgery residents. Most respondents,74.2%, supported the right of physicians to participate in MAID with 7.8% opposing. 37% had current patients in their practice fitting the criteria for MAID. 23.6% had been asked by patients to assist with MAID, but only 11% would consider personally providing it. 84% of neurosurgeons surveyed supported the physicians' right to conscientious objection to MAID while 21% thought attending surgeons should be removed from the inquiry and decision-making process. 43.8% agreed that the requirment to refer a patient to a MAID service should be mandatory. Glioblastoma multiforme (65%), quadriplegia/quadriparesis secondary to spinal tumour/trauma (54%) and Parkinson's disease (24%) were the most common suggested potential indications for MAID among the neurosurgical population. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that most neurosurgeons in Canada are generally supportive of MAID in select patients. However, they also strongly support the physicians' right to conscientious objection. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.",""
"Recognising the importance of informal communication events in improving collaborative care","2019","Background While the concept of collaboration is highly touted in the literature, most descriptions of effective collaboration highlight formal collaborative events; largely ignored are the informal collaborative events and none focusing on the frequent, seemingly' by chance communication events that arise and their role in supporting patient safety and quality care. Objective To identify the types of informal communication events that exist in the inpatient setting and better understand the barriers contributing to their necessity. Methods We undertook a constructivist grounded theory study in an inpatient internal medicine teaching unit in Ontario, Canada. Interview and observational data were collected across two phases; in total, 56 participants were consented for the study. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively; themes were identified using constant comparison methods. Results Several types of informal communication events were identified and appeared valuable in three ways: (1) providing a better sense of a patient's baseline function in comparison to their current function; (2) gaining a more holistic understanding of the patient's needs; and (3) generating better insight into a patient's wishes and goals of care. Participants identified a number of organisational and communication challenges leading to the need for informal communication events. These included: scheduling, competing demands and the spatial and temporal organisation of the ward. As a result, nursing staff, allied health professionals and caregivers had to develop strategies for interacting with the physician team. Conclusion We highlight the importance of informal communication in supporting patient care and the gaps in the system contributing to their necessity. Changes at the system level are needed to ensure we are not leaving important collaborative opportunities to chance alone. ? 2019 Article Author(s).","adult; article; caregiver; controlled study; female; grounded theory; hospital medicine; human; intermethod comparison; internal medicine; interview; major clinical study; male; nursing staff; Ontario; patient care; qualitative research; teaching; teamwork"
"Cost-of-illness study for non-small-cell lung cancer using real-world data","2019","Background With recent advances in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) and current fiscal constraints within publicly funded health care systems, understanding the real-world economic effect of lung cancer management has become important. The objective of the present study was to determine the costs and resources used in the management of nsclc cohorts in Ontario. Methods Patients diagnosed between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2015 were identified in the Ontario Cancer Registry and linked to provincial administrative databases, capturing resources such as hospitalizations, cancer clinic visits, physician services, and systemic therapies or radiotherapy. A cost-of-illness analysis using a bottom-up approach and the GETCOST macro available at ices determined the overall total and mean costs in 2017 Canadian dollars. Resource utilization results were analyzed according to the total number of encounters per resource, the number of patients using each resource, and the number of encounters per patient. A separate cost-and-resource analysis was conducted for radiotherapy. Results The 24,729 nsclc patients identified included 4542 with stage iii unresectable disease and 10,103 with stage iv nonsquamous disease. The overall total cost for all nsclc patients was $1.9 billion, with inpatient hospitalizations ($635.2 million), cancer clinic visits ($323.7 million), and physician services ($301.4 million) being the top cost contributors. The mean cost per patient was $76,816. The total cost of radiotherapy was $38.5 million. Conclusions Real-world costs for the management of nsclc during the 5-year period examined were substantial, despite the fact that median survival was poor and treatment information was limited. ? 2019 Multimed Inc.","afatinib; erlotinib; gefitinib; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer staging; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; cost of illness; female; health care cost; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; lung cancer; lung surgery; major clinical study; male; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; Ontario; overall survival"
"Trigeminocardiac Reflex: Case Report and Literature Review of Intraoperative Asystole in Response to Manipulation of the Temporalis Muscle","2019","Background: The trigeminocardiac reflex is a sudden onset of bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, or gastric hypermotility in response to stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. Case Description: A 60-year-old female underwent a left orbitozygomatic craniotomy to debulk a large skull base epidermoid cyst compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves. Intraoperatively, retraction of the temporalis muscle consistently produced asystole. Cessation of retraction resulted in prompt return of sinus rhythm. Conclusions: Our report describes an unusual and extreme example of the trigeminocardiac reflex and explores possible etiologies. This is the third reported surgical case in which manipulation of the temporalis muscle alone was sufficient to elicit bradycardia and asystole, and the first such case within the context of neurosurgery. We emphasize the importance of surgical teams to be cognizant of such extreme examples of this reflex. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","narcotic analgesic agent; propofol; remifentanil; sufentanil; abducens nerve paralysis; adult; Article; bradycardia; case report; clinical article; craniotomy; cytoreductive surgery; epidermoid cyst; female; heart arrest; human; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; sinus rhythm; skull base; surgical infection; temporalis muscle; trigeminocardiac reflex; bone disease; heart arrest; pathophysiology; peroperative complication; physiology; Bone Diseases; Epidermal Cyst; Female; Heart Arrest; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Middle Aged; Reflex, Trigeminocardiac; Skull Base; Temporal Muscle"
"Exercise training impacts skeletal muscle gene expression related to the kynurenine pathway","2019","Exercise positively im-pacts mood and symptoms of depression; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. Recent evidence highlights a potential role for skeletal muscle-derived transcription factors to influence tryptophan metabolism, along the kynurenine pathway, which has important implications in depression. This has important consequences for older adults, whose age-related muscle deterioration may influence this pathway and may increase their risk for depression. Although exercise training has been shown to improve skeletal muscle mass in older adults, whether this also translates into improvements in transcription factors and metabolites related to the kynurenine pathway has yet to be examined. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of a 12-wk exercise program on skeletal muscle gene expression of transcription factors, kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) gene expression, and plasma concentrations of tryptophan metabolites (kynurenines) in healthy older men over 65 yr of age. Exercise training significantly increased skeletal muscle gene expression of transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ: 1.77, 1.99, 2.18-fold increases, respectively, P < 0.01] and KAT isoforms 1– 4 (6.5, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6-fold increases, respectively, P ? 0.01). Concentrations of plasma kynurenines were not altered. These results demonstrate that 12 wk of exercise training significantly altered skeletal muscle gene expression of transcription factors and gene expression related to the kynurenine pathway, but not circulating kynurenine metabolites in older men. These findings warrant future research to determine whether distinct exercise modalities or varying intensities could induce a shift in the kynurenine pathway in depressed older adults. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","kynurenine; kynurenine aminotransferase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; tryptophan; isoprotein; kynurenine; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; transcription factor; aged; aging; amino acid blood level; Article; controlled study; exercise intensity; gene; gene expression; health program; human; human tissue; KAT gene; male; muscle tissue; PGC1alpha gene; physical activity; PPAR gene; PPARdelta gene; priority journal; resistance training; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; tryptophan metabolism; clinical trial; exercise; gene expression; metabolism; physiology; randomized controlled trial; skeletal muscle; Aged; Exercise; Gene Expression; Humans; Kynurenine; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; PPAR alpha; Protein Isoforms; Transcription Factors"
"Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms in childhood and adolescent suicide-related thoughts and attempts: Mediation by child psychiatric symptoms","2019","AimsThe nature of the association between child psychiatric symptoms and adolescent suicide-related thoughts (SRT) and attempts (SA) remains unclear. Our objective was to assess whether child psychiatric symptoms from 6 to 10 years of age mediate the association between exposure to maternal depressive symptoms in childhood and offspring SRT and SA in adolescence.MethodsA population-based cohort study was constructed by linking all eight cycles from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a nationally representative Canadian panel survey conducted from 1994 to 2009. Self-reported maternal depressive symptoms were measured when offspring were between 0 and 5 years. Maternal-reported child psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric comorbid symptoms were measured from 6 to 10 years, and offspring self-reported SRT and SA were measured between 11 and 19 years. Indirect effects, the effect proportion mediated and their corresponding bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.ResultsHyperactivity and inattention significantly mediated the association between maternal depressive symptoms in childhood and risk of both SRT and SA from 11 to 19 years, where approximately 60% (SRT 95% CI 23-94%; SA 95% CI 27-95%) of this association was explained by hyperactivity and inattention. Psychiatric comorbid symptoms also significantly mediated this relationship and accounted for 50% (95% CI 18-81%) of this association with SA.ConclusionsTargeting hyperactivity and inattention, and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms in offspring of depressed mothers could reduce risk of SRT, eventual SA and halt progression towards suicide. However, further understanding of comorbid psychiatric symptoms in childhood that most strongly predict adolescent SA is needed. ? 2019 Cambridge University Press.",""
"Quantitative risk of positive family history in developing colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis","2019","BACKGROUND Positive family history is a risk factor for development of colorectal cancer. Despite numerous studies on the topic, the absolute risk in patients with a positive family history remains unclear and therefore studies are lacking to validate non-invasive screening methods in individuals with positive family history. AIM To quantify the risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a positive family history. METHODS A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed using PubMed from January 1955 until November 2017, EMBASE from 1947 until 2018, and Cochrane Library without date restrictions. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. A meta-analysis of Mantel- Haenzel relative risks was performed using the random effects model. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to score the quality of selected papers. Funnel plot and Egger's regression test was performed to detect publication bias. Subgroup analysis was performed comparing Asian and non-Asian studies. Sensitivity analyses were performed to rule out the effect of the timing of the study, overall quality, the main outcome and the effect of each individual study in overall result. RESULTS Forty-six out of 3390 studies, including 906981 patients were included in the final analysis. 41 of the included studies were case-control and 5 were cohort. A positive family history of colorectal cancer in first-degree relatives was associated with significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer with a relative risk of 1.87 (95%CI: 1.68-2.09; P < 0.00001). Cochrane Q test was significant (P < 0.00001, I2 = 90%). Egger's regression test showed asymmetry in the funnel plot and therefore the Trim and Fill method was used which confirmed the validity of the results. There was no difference between Asian versus non-Asian studies. Results remained robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION Individuals with a positive family history of colorectal cancer are 1.87 times more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Screening guidelines should pay specific attention to individuals with positive family history and further studies need to be done on validating current screening methods or developing new modalities in this high-risk population. ?

"Clinical outcomes in hemophilia A patients undergoing tailoring of prophylaxis based on population-based pharmacokinetic dosing","2019","Introduction: Standard prophylaxis dosing based on bodyweight may result in over- or under-dosing due to interpatient variability. Adopting individual pharmacokinetic (PK) based tailoring may improve adherence to treatment guideline, and consequently clinical outcomes. Here we report clinical observations performed across the adoption of individual PK based tailoring in a single center in Japan. Methods: An individual PK study on sparse samples was modeled on myPKFiT or WAPPS-Hemo, depending on concentrate, and used to optimize treatment regimens. Adherence to prophylaxis and bleeding rate were calculated from patient diaries. Radiological joint scores were used to assess arthropathy, and SPSS to perform all the analyses. Results: Thirty-nine patients underwent PK profiling, and 20 required and accepted a modification of their treatment (8 increases in dose, 5 reductions in frequency, 5 switches to extended half-life (EHL)). Adherence to prophylaxis remained the same in those increasing the dose, whilst increased in all the other groups. Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and annualized joint bleeding rate (AjBR) decreased in all the groups but reached statistical significance only in those switched to EHL and showed a larger reduction in those patients without baseline arthropathy. Longer time spent above a 1% or 5% threshold was associated with a decrease in the ABR/AjBR. Conclusions: Our study results suggest that PopPK based tailoring supported changing treatment regimen in nearly half of the patients, and may have contributed to an improvement in the adherence and a reduction in the ABR/AjBR. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","recombinant blood clotting factor 8; blood clotting factor 8; adolescent; adult; aged; arthropathy; Article; bleeding; child; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; drug cost; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug half life; female; hemarthrosis; hemophilia A; human; Japan; joint radiography; male; middle aged; patient compliance; pharmacokinetics; preschool child; priority journal; prophylaxis; radiological joint score; school child; scoring system; young adult; bleeding; complication; hemarthrosis; hemophilia A; personalized medicine; procedures; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Factor VIII; Female; Hemarthrosis; Hemophilia A; Hemorrhage; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Precision Medicine; Treatment Adherence and Compliance; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Aneurysmal bone cyst of the spine: Report of four cases and review of the literature","2019","Purpose: We report four cases of spinal Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) that were managed surgically at King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. This report aims to describe the clinical features and the need for surgical excision preceded by embolization in spinal ABC. Method: A retrospective review of the OR list and tumor board records between 2013 and 2016 yielded a total of 4 cases of spinal ABC who were surgically treated at KFSH-D. Their clinical presentations, radiological and pathological features are reviewed along with the surgical intervention utilized and its outcome. Results: Total of 4 cases were identified, all of them were female (100%). The age ranged from 13 to 25 years old (mean age = 17.75). Two cases (50%) were located in the thoracic spine, one (25%) cervical and one (25%) in the lumbar spine. Back pain, unsteady gait, and progressive limb weakness were the most common presenting symptoms. All the cases underwent embolization followed by surgical excision and fixation with a variable degree of improvement postoperatively. Conclusion: Spinal ABC is a benign tumor that can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms. Pre-operative embolization can be helpful to reduce bleeding during surgery. Surgical decompression can lead to significant improvement even in case of severe neurological deficit. Radiation therapy can be used as an adjunct treatment in selected cases. ? 2018","adolescent; adult; aneurysmal bone cyst; arterial embolization; Article; backache; cancer radiotherapy; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; female; follow up; human; limb weakness; lumbar spine; male; priority journal; radiculopathy; retrospective study; spastic paraplegia; spinal aneurysmal bone cyst; spine disease; thoracic spine; treatment outcome; unsteady gait"
"Improved survival in overweight and obese patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy for curative intent","2019","The association between obesity and survival in non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unclear. Using the Ontario Cancer Registry we conducted a retrospective analysis of incident cases of aggressive-histology B-cell lymphoma treated with a rituximab-containing regimen with curative intent between 2008–2016. 6246 patients were included. On multivariable analysis the rate of all-cause mortality was lower for the overweight body mass index (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2) (HR 0.85; 95%CI 0.77–0.95) and obese BMI (?30 kg/m2) (HR 0.75; 95%CI 0.67–0.85) groups compared to the normal weight group (18.5–24.9 kg/m2). Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed a lower odds ratio (OR) of admission to hospital during treatment in the overweight (OR 0.84; 95%CI 0.75–0.95) compared to normal weight BMI group. In the largest cohort to date of aggressive-histology B-cell lymphoma patients treated with rituximab, increased BMI is associated with a survival advantage, and the magnitude of this effect increases from overweight to obese BMI. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antineoplastic agent; rituximab; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; B cell lymphoma; body mass; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; histology; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obese patient; priority journal; retrospective study; young adult"

Methods: Brain-injured ICU patients were observed using a 40-item behavioral checklist before and during soft touch (i.e., nonnociceptive procedure), turning, and other care procedures (nociceptive) by pairs of trained raters. When possible, patients self-reported their pain on a 0–10 visual thermometer. Patients were classified into unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale, 3<GCS?8), altered consciousness (9?GCS?12), or conscious (13?GCS?15). Results: A sample of 147 patients participated (65 conscious, 56 altered consciousness, and 26 unconscious). Active behaviors (e.g., face expressions and body movements) were more frequent in conscious patients. High-percentage interrater agreement (80%–98%) was obtained for most behaviors. The total number of active behaviors was significantly higher during turning and other nociceptive procedures compared with rest (Wilcoxon = 9.873, P < 0.001) and soft touch (Wilcoxon = 9.486, P < 0.001) regardless of levels of consciousness. The strongest predictors of pain intensity (n = 33) were grimace, mouth opening, orbit tightening, eye weeping, and eyes tightly closed; these behaviors were moderately correlated with self-reported pain intensity (Spearman rho = 0.47). Conclusion: These findings may guide the revision of existing pain scales to make their content more suited for this population. ? 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","adult; Article; behavior assessment; body movement; brain injury; checklist; cohort analysis; comparative study; consciousness level; criterion related validity; crying; eyelid closure; facial expression; female; Glasgow coma scale; human; intensive care unit; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth; nociceptive pain; observational study; orbit; pain; pain assessment; pain intensity; rank sum test; self report"
"Gut Microbiota in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome—A Systematic Review","2019","Background & Aims: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common but difficult to treat. Altering the gut microbiota has been proposed as a strategy for treatment of IBS, but the association between the gut microbiome and IBS symptoms has not been well established. We performed a systematic review to explore evidence for this association. Methods: We searched databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CDSR, and CENTRAL, through April 2, 2018 for case–control studies comparing the fecal or colon microbiomes of adult or pediatric patients with IBS with microbiomes of healthy individuals (controls). The primary outcome was differences in specific gut microbes between patients with IBS and controls. Results: The search identified 2631 citations; 24 studies from 22 articles were included. Most studies evaluated adults presenting with various IBS subtypes. Family Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria), family Lactobacillaceae, and genus Bacteroides were increased in patients with IBS compared with controls, whereas uncultured Clostridiales I, genus Faecalibacterium (including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), and genus Bifidobacterium were decreased in patients with IBS. The diversity of the microbiota was either decreased or not different in IBS patients compared with controls. More than 40% of included studies did not state whether cases and controls were comparable (did not describe sex and/or age characteristics). Conclusions: In a systematic review, we identified specific bacteria associated with microbiomes of patients with IBS vs controls. Studies are needed to determine whether these microbes are a product or cause of IBS. ? 2019 AGA Institute","RNA 16S; Article; Bacteroides; Bifidobacterium; Clostridiales; constipation; diarrhea; DNA sequence; Enterobacteriaceae; Faecalibacterium; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; human; intestine flora; irritable colon; Lactobacillaceae; microbial diversity; priority journal; restriction fragment length polymorphism; systematic review; irritable colon; microbiology; Bacteroides; Bifidobacterium; Clostridiales; Enterobacteriaceae; Faecalibacterium; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Lactobacillaceae"
"Stability, activity, and application of topical doxycycline formulations in a diabetic wound case study","2019","Introduction. Tetracycline molecules comprise a group of broad-spectrum antibiotics whose primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of protein synthesis through the binding of the bacterial ribosome. In addition, tetracyclines inhibit matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent proteases that contribute to tissue remodeling, inflammation, and angiogenesis and are overexpressed in certain pathophysiologies such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Objective. This study aims to develop a liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) doxycycline quantification methodology to facilitate the development of a stable topical doxycycline hyclate (DOXY) formulation as well as evaluate the topical DOXY formulation for the efficacy in MMP-9 inhibition in vitro and in a clinical application of diabetic lower extremity wounds. Materials and Methods. A simple quantification method utilizing LC-MS/MS was used to develop a topical DOXY formulation, a sample of which was analyzed in stability testing. The formulation was evaluated in vitro for MMP-9 activity using a commercial assay and compared with internal kit controls as well as in a clinical setting for wound healing. Results. Two formulations of 2% (w/w) DOXY demonstrated acceptable stability (±10% target concentration) for 70 days when stored at 4°C. Using an in vitro assay of MMP-9 enzyme activity, the 2% DOXY formulation imparted a ~30% decrease in MMP-9 inhibitory potential as compared with the control drug alone (IC50 values 62.92 ?M and 48.27 ?M, respectively). This topical product was evaluated for clinical utility in a patient with a DFU, and preliminary data suggest this intervention may promote wound healing. Conclusions. In summary, novel DOXY formulations may be stable and biologically active tools amenable to complex wound care. ? 2019 HMP Communications.

"The burden of cancer attributable to modifiable risk factors in Canada: Methods overview","2019","Up-to-date estimates of current and projected future cancer burden attributable to various exposures are essential for planning and implementing cancer prevention initiatives. The Canadian Population Attributable Risk of Cancer (ComPARe)study was conducted to: i)estimate the number and proportion of cancers diagnosed among adults in Canada in 2015 that are attributable to modifiable risk factors and ii)project the future avoidable cancers by 2042 under various intervention targets. We estimated the population attributable risk (with 95% confidence intervals)and the potential impact fraction of cancers associated with selected lifestyle, environmental, and infectious factors. Exposure-specific sensitivity analyses were also completed where appropriate. Several exposures of interest included active and passive smoking, obesity and abdominal adiposity, leisure-time physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, red and processed meat consumption, air pollution (PM2.5, NO 2 ), indoor radon gas, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), hepatitis B and C virus, Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomavirus, human herpesvirus type 8 and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. We used the 2015 cancer incidence data for 35 cancer sites from the Canadian Cancer Registry and projected cancer incidence to 2042 using historical data from 1983 to 2012. Here, we provide an overview of the data sources and methods used in estimating the current and future cancer burden in Canada.

"Active Surveillance Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study (ASIST): Results of a Randomized Multicenter Prospective Trial","2019","Background and objective: This study aimed to determine, in men recently diagnosed with grade group 1 (GG1) prostate cancer, if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with targeted biopsy could identify a greater proportion of men with GG ?2 cancer on their confirmatory biopsy compared with systematic biopsies. The study was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01354171). Design, setting, and participants: This study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label trial. Eligible patients were men diagnosed with GG1 cancer within 1 yr prior to study entry in whom a confirmatory biopsy was indicated. Patients were randomized to 12-core systematic biopsy or MRI with systematic and targeted biopsy using the Artemis fusion targeting system. The primary end point was the proportion upgraded to GG ?2 in each arm. Results and limitations: In total, 296 men were registered and 273 randomized. Of the MRI group, 64% had a region of interest. No difference was observed in the rate of GG ?2 upgrading (the intent-to-treat population, p = 0.7, and per-protocol [PP] population, p = 0.4), GG ?2 upgrading within each stratum separately, or GG ?3. After central pathology review, upgrading was observed in 36/132 (27%) men in the systematic biopsy arm and 42/127 (33%) men in the MRI arm (p = 0.3). Upgrading was seen in 19/137 (14%) patients in the MRI arm on targeted biopsy alone (median, 2 cores) compared with 31/136 (23%) in the systematic biopsy arm (median, 12 cores; p = 0.09). In the MRI arm, 8/127 (6.5%) patients had GG ?2 disease identified on targeted biopsy, but ?GG1 on the systematic biopsy, and 10/127 (7.9%) patients had GG ?2 disease identified by systematic biopsy but ?GG1 on targeted biopsy. Significant differences in upgrading on targeted biopsies were seen between sites, likely reflecting different levels of expertise with the targeted biopsy technique. Conclusions: The addition of MRI with targeted biopsies to systematic biopsies did not significantly increase the upgrading rate compared with systematic biopsy alone. Furthermore, 2-core targeted biopsies alone resulted in a nonsignificant trend to less upgrading than 12-core systematic biopsy (p = 0.09). In men on active surveillance, targeted biopsies identify most, but not all, clinically significant cancers. ? 2018 European Association of UrologyThis is the first report of a randomized, multicenter, prospective study in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer having their confirmatory biopsy. The study sought to compare the rate of upgrading to clinically significant cancer (Grade group ?2), of systematic 12-core biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with targeted biopsy. Systematic biopsies were also performed in the MRI group. The findings were that targeted biopsy using two cores per target in addition to systematic biopsies did not identify more significant cancers than systematic biopsies alone. Targeted biopsies identified the majority, but not all significant cancers compared with 12-core systematic biopsies. Systematic biopsies also missed some significant cancers. We conclude that, in men on active surveillance, targeted biopsies identify most, but not all, clinically significant cancers. ? 2018 European Association of Urology","prostate specific antigen; kallikrein; kallikrein-related peptidase 3, human; prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; biopsy technique; cancer grading; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; digital rectal examination; hematuria; hemospermia; human; image guided biopsy; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; open study; priority journal; progression free survival; prospective study; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial; rectum hemorrhage; transrectal ultrasonography; urinary tract infection; blood; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; image guided biopsy; interventional magnetic resonance imaging; interventional ultrasonography; large core needle biopsy; pathology; predictive value; procedures; prostate tumor; reproducibility; watchful waiting; Aged; Biopsy, Large-Core Needle; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; Image-Guided Biopsy; Kallikreins; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Watchful Waiting"

"Lipoprotein(a): An underrecognized genetic risk factor for malignant coronary artery disease in young Indians","2019","Malignant coronary artery disease (CAD) refers to a severe and extensive atherosclerotic process involving multiple coronary arteries in young individuals (aged <45 years in men and <50 years in women) with a low or no burden of established risk factors. Indians, in general, develop acute myocardial infarction (AMI) about 10 years earlier; AMI rates are threefold to fivefold higher in young Indians than in other populations. Although established CAD risk factors have a predictive value, they do not fully account for the excessive burden of CAD in young Indians. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is increasingly recognized as the strongest known genetic risk factor for premature CAD, with high levels observed in Indians with malignant CAD. High Lp(a) levels confer a twofold to threefold risk of CAD—a risk similar to that of established risk factors, including diabetes. South Asians have the second highest Lp(a) levels and the highest risk of AMI from the elevated levels, more than double the risk observed in people of European descent. Approximately 25% of Indians and other South Asians have elevated Lp(a) levels (?50 mg/dl), rendering Lp(a) a risk factor of great importance, similar to or surpassing diabetes. Lp(a) measurement is ready for clinical use and should be an essential part of all CAD research in Indians. ? 2019 Cardiological Society of India","lipoprotein A; acute coronary syndrome; acute heart infarction; atherosclerotic plaque; attributable risk; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; coronary angiography; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; disease burden; disease severity; epidemic; ethnic difference; family history; fat intake; genetic risk; high risk population; human; incidence; Indian; insulin resistance; mortality rate; predictive value; prevalence; Review; risk factor; South Asian"
"The effects of two early parenting interventions on child aggression and risk for violence in Brazil (The PI? Trial): Protocol for a randomised controlled trial","2019","Background: Children in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are at high risk for exposure to violence and later violent behaviour. The World Health Organization has declared an urgent need for the evaluation and implementation of low-cost parenting interventions in LMICs to prevent violence. Two areas of significant early risk are harsh parenting and poor child cognitive and socio-emotional development. Parenting interventions suitable for LMIC contexts have been developed targeting these risk factors and have been shown to have promising effects. However, their impact on child aggression, a key precursor of violence, has yet to be determined. The Pelotas Trial of Parenting Interventions for Aggression (PI?) has been designed to address this issue. Methods: We are conducting a randomised controlled trial to evaluate two early parenting interventions for mothers of children aged between 30 and 42 months in a Brazilian city. The first of these, dialogic book-sharing (DBS), aims to promote child cognitive and socio-emotional development; and the second, the ACT Raising Safe Kids Program (ACT), is designed to reduce harsh parenting. These interventions are being compared with a control group receiving neither intervention. Three hundred and sixty-nine families in a birth cohort are being randomly allocated to one of the three groups (DBS, ACT, Control). Facilitators deliver the interventions to groups of five to 10 mothers at weekly sessions for 8 weeks in DBS and 9 weeks in ACT. Independent assessments of parenting and child development are being made before the interventions, shortly afterwards, and at follow-up 6 months later. The primary outcome is child aggression, and the two main secondary outcomes are: (1) child cognitive and socio-emotional development and (2) harsh parenting. Longer-term outcomes will be investigated as the birth cohort is followed into late childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Discussion: The Pelotas Trial of Parenting Interventions for Aggression (PI?) aims to evaluate the impact of two early parenting interventions on child aggression and several other key risk factors for the development of violence, including aspects of parenting and child cognition and socio-emotional functioning. The study is being carried out in a LMIC context where violence constitutes a major social and health burden. Since the two interventions are brief and, with modest levels of training, readily deliverable in LMIC settings, a demonstration that they benefit parenting and reduce risk factors for violence would be of major significance.

"“Primary care is primary care”: Use of Normalization Process Theory to explore the implementation of primary care services for transgender individuals in Ontario","2019","Background In Ontario, Canada, healthcare for transgender individuals is accessed through primary care; however, there are a limited number of practitioners providing transgender care, and patients are often on waiting lists and/or traveling great distances to receive care. Understanding how primary care is implemented and delivered to transgender individuals is key to improving access and eliminating healthcare barriers. The purpose of this study is to understand how the implementation of primary care services for transgender individuals compares across various models of primary care delivery in Ontario. Methods A qualitative, exploratory, multiple-case study guided by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) was used to compare transgender care delivery and implementation across three primary care models. Three cases known to provide transgender primary care and represent different primary care models in Ontario, Canada (i.e., family health team, community health centre, fee-for service physician) were explored. The NoMAD survey, a tool to measure implementation processes, and qualitative interviews with primary care practitioners and allied healthcare staff were administered. Results Using the NPT framework to guide analysis, key themes emerged about successful implementation of primary care services for transgender individuals. These themes include creating a safe space for patients, identifying gaps in services, understanding practitioners’ roles, and the need for more training and education in transgender care for practitioners. Conclusions Primary care services for transgender individuals can and should be delivered in all models of primary care. Training and awareness for healthcare practitioners are needed to develop capacity in providing primary care to transgender individuals. A greater number of practitioners and organizations are needed to take on this work, embedding and normalizing transgender care into routine practice to address barriers to access and improve quality of care for transgender individuals. ? 2019 Ziegler et al.

"Anti-NT5C1A autoantibodies as biomarkers in inclusion body myositis","2019","Objective: Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM) is an inflammatory myopathy (IIM) without a specific diagnostic biomarker until autoantibodies to the cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A (NT5c1A/Mup44) were reported. The objectives of our study were to determine the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NT5c1A for sIBM, demonstrate demographic, clinical and serological predictors for anti-NT5c1A positivity and determine if anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) staining on HEp-2 cells is a reliable screening method for anti-NT5c1A. Methods: Sera from sIBM patients and controls were stored at ?80?C until required for analysis. IgG antibodies to NT5c1A were detected by an addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) using a full-length human recombinant protein. Autoantibodies to other autoimmune myopathy antigens (Jo-1, OJ, TIF1y, PL-12, SAE, EJ, MDA5, PL7, SRP, NXP2, MI-2) were detected by line immunoassay (LIA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ANA detected by IIF on HEp-2 substrate. Demographic, clinical and serological data were obtained by chart review. Results: Forty-three patients with sIBM, 537 disease control patients with other autoimmune, degenerative and neuromuscular diseases, and 78 healthy controls were included. 48.8% (21/43) of sIBM patients were positive for anti-NT5c1A. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of anti-NT5c1A for sIBM were 0.49, 0.92, 0.29, and 0.96, respectively. Compared to sIBM, the frequency of anti-NT5c1A was lower in both the disease control group (8.8%, OR 0.10 [95%CI: 0.05-0.20], p &lt; 0.0001) and in the apparently healthy control group (5.1%, OR 0.06 [95%CI: 0.02-0.18], p &lt; 0.0001). In the univariable analysis, sIBM patients with more severe muscle weakness were more likely to be anti-NT5c1A positive (OR 4.10 [95% CI: 1.17, 14.33], p = 0.027), although this was not statistically significant (adjusted OR 4.30 [95% CI: 0.89, 20.76], p = 0.069) in the multivariable analysis. The ANA of sIBM sera did not demonstrate a consistent IIF pattern associated with anti-NT5c1A. Conclusions: Anti-NT5c1A has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for sIBM using ALBIA. The presence of anti-NT5c1A antibodies may be associated with muscle weakness. Anti-NT5c1A antibodies were not associated with a specific IIF staining pattern, hence screening using HEp-2 substrate is unlikely to be a useful predictor for presence of these autoantibodies.

"Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America","2019","Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB. ?

"Validation of the Early Development Instrument for children with special health needs","2019","Aim: Population-level data on the development of children with special health needs attending primary school can assist special education, health and service delivery strategies. This study aims to determine whether results of the Early Development Instrument (EDI) can be interpreted and used with the same confidence for children with special health needs as for those who are typically developing. Psychometric properties of the EDI for kindergarteners with identified special health needs are examined. Methods: Data for children with a special health need designation come from a database of all Canadian provincial implementations of the EDI between 2004 and 2014. Item and domain characteristics (distributions of scores and measures of internal consistency) of the EDI were examined. Construct validation was assessed by correlating EDI scores with gender and age. The fit of the original factor structure of the EDI was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Data for 29 692 children (69.8% male) were analysed. The performance of items and domains was similar to that of typically developing children. As expected, boys scored lower on all EDI domains (Cohen's d: 0.03–0.46) and a general, but non-significant, positive trend was observed between age and EDI scores. The factor structure of the EDI in this population yielded similar goodness-of-fit statistics as those reported in studies with typically developing children. Conclusion: Results of this investigation support the validity of the EDI in children with special health needs, paving the way for a more extensive use of EDI data for this vulnerable, yet often neglected, population. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","article; child; confirmatory factor analysis; female; gender; health care delivery; human; human experiment; internal consistency; kindergarten; major clinical study; male; primary school; special education; statistics; validation process; validity"
"An international survey to assess use of oral and rectal contrast in CT protocols for penetrating torso trauma","2019","Purpose: There is controversy regarding the administration of oral and rectal contrast for CT performed to detect bowel injury in the context of penetrating torso trauma. Given the lack of published societal guidelines, our goal was to survey radiologists from the American Society of Emergency Radiology membership database to determine consensus on CT protocols for penetrating trauma. Methods: With ethics board approval, an anonymous ten-question online survey was distributed via email to 589 radiologists in the American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) member database. The survey was open for a 4-week period in February 2018. A commercially available website that allows subscribers to create and analyze survey results was used for analysis. Results: We received 124 responses (21% response rate) with a majority from U.S. institutions (82%). Seventy-four percent of respondents indicated they do not routinely administer oral contrast in penetrating trauma, 68% do not administer rectal contrast, and 90% do not use commercially available software to assess penetrating injury trajectory. Results from U.S. and non-U.S. practices were comparable. The decision to administer intraluminal contrast is made by the referring physician at 52% of institutions. There is in-house attending level radiology coverage at 54% of institutions and when asked if trauma scans are reviewed before removing the patient from the table, 41% of respondents answered “No.” Conclusion: Enteric contrast is used in a minority of respondents’ centers for penetrating trauma cases, which is likely driven by a perceived lack of added benefit and delays in patient care. ? 2018, American Society of Emergency Radiology.","contrast medium; contrast medium; Article; Asia; Australia and New Zealand; Canada; clinical protocol; computer assisted tomography; digestive system injury; Europe; health care survey; human; intraluminal drug administration; penetrating trauma; physician; priority journal; radiologist; research ethics; software; United States; abdominal injury; clinical practice; diagnostic imaging; international cooperation; oral drug administration; penetrating trauma; procedures; questionnaire; rectum; statistics and numerical data; x-ray computed tomography; Abdominal Injuries; Administration, Oral; Contrast Media; Humans; Internationality; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Rectum; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Wounds, Penetrating"

We surveyed 268 cardiac surgeons from 80 centres in 18 countries. The response rate was 76% (n = 204/276), 49% from North America, 39% Europe, and 12% other regions. Respondents performed a median 10 [interquartile range (IQR) 4-30] AF ablation procedures/year, with marked variation in proportions of patients with AF considered for ablation (median 25%, IQR 10-61). 94% and 80% of surgeons respectively, thought symptomatic and asymptomatic patients benefit from ablation. Surgeons estimated the added major complication rate of concomitant AF ablation at 16% [median (IQR) 7-25]. Of participating surgeons, 61% believed that evidence supported surgical AF ablation reducing the incidence of thrombo-embolic complications, and 46% modified anticoagulation decision-making based on whether they performed AF ablation. During coronary artery bypass grafting, isolated pulmonary vein isolation was the most commonly performed lesion set (70%), whereas complete left atrial ablation (46%) and biatrial ablation (44%) were favoured with valve surgery. Conclusion In a multinational group of academic surgeons, surgical AF ablation utilization appears variable, and average case volumes are low. Despite no evidence to that effect, the majority believe that ablation reduces AF-related thrombo-embolic risk of patients. Reported practice patterns suggest clinical equipoise; a definitive trial appears feasible based on respondent willingness to participate. ? Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

"Testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin and risk of cardiovascular events: A report from the Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention trial","2019","Aims: Testosterone and its binding protein sex hormone-binding globulin have been associated with cardiovascular disease and dysglycaemia. However, information on the prognostic implication in patients at high cardiovascular risk with dysglycaemia is inconsistent. The study objective was to determine whether testosterone and/or sex hormone-binding globulin predict cardiovascular events or death in dysglycaemic patients. Methods: Dysglycaemic males at high cardiovascular risk (n = 5553) who participated in the Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial and provided baseline blood samples were studied. Testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured at baseline and used to estimate free testosterone. Low levels of total and free testosterone were defined as ?300 ng/dl and ?7 ng/dl, respectively. Patients were followed for six years for cardiovascular events (defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) and all-cause mortality. Results: The mean total and free testosterone levels were 416.6 ng/dl and 8.4 ng/dl, and low levels were present in 13% and 37% of the patients. The median sex hormone-binding globulin level was 35 nmol/l. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, previous diseases and pharmacological treatment, neither total nor free testosterone predicted cardiovascular events. However, a one-standard-deviation increase in sex hormone-binding globulin predicted both cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1.07; 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.14; p = 0.03) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.21; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Sex hormone-binding globulin, but not total testosterone, predicts cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in dysglycaemic males at high cardiovascular risk. ?

"High-throughput screening for inhibitors of wall teichoic acid biosynthesis in staphylococcus aureus","2019","The world is heading toward a dangerous post-antibiotic era where antibiotics fail to treat infections. Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections worldwide, and an ever-increasing percentage of them are methicillin-resistant (MRSA). New strategies are urgently needed to combat this pathogen. Wall teichoic acids (WTA) in S. aureus are polyribitol phosphate polymers that play important roles in virulence and resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Here, we describe a high-throughput whole-cell screening platform for inhibitors targeting WTA biosynthesis. This platform takes advantage of the unique dispensability patterns of genes encoding WTA biosynthesis. We further describe follow-up dose-response assays to identify WTA inhibitors among the primary bioactives. WTA inhibitors offer an exciting opportunity for the development of novel antibacterial leads of unique mechanism in the fight against drug-resistant staphylococcal infections. ?

"Public, health professional and legislator perspectives on the concept of psychiatric disease: A population-based survey","2019","Objective To assess which mental health-related states of being are perceived as diseases by psychiatrists, non-psychiatric physicians, nurses, parliament members and laypeople. Design and setting A population-based, mailed survey in Finland. Participants Respondents from a random sample of 3000 laypeople, 1500 physicians, 1500 nurses and all 200 members of the parliament (MPs) of Finland. Primary outcome measures Respondents' perspectives on 20 mental health-related states of being as diseases, measuring the extent of agreement with the claim: '[This state of being] is a disease'. Results Of the 6200 people approached, we received 3259 eligible responses (53%). Two conditions (schizophrenia and autism) were considered to be diseases by at least 75% and two states (grief and homosexuality) were considered not to be diseases by at least 75% in each group. A majority (at least 50% in each group) considered seven states as diseases (anorexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bulimia, depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and personality disorder) and three not to be diseases (absence of sexual desire, premature ejaculation and transsexualism). In six states, there was a wide divergence of opinion (alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling addiction, insomnia, social anxiety disorder and work exhaustion). Psychiatrists were significantly more inclined to considering states of being as diseases relative to other groups, followed by non-psychiatric physicians, nurses, MPs and laypeople. Conclusions Respondents agreed that some conditions, such as schizophrenia and autism, are diseases and other states, such as grief and homosexuality, are not; for others, there was considerable disagreement. Psychiatrists are more inclined to consider mental health-related states of being as diseases compared with other physicians, who, in turn, are more inclined than other constituencies. Understanding notions of disease may underlie important debates in public policy and practice in areas of mental health and behaviour, and have implications for resource allocation and stigma. ?

"2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation Guideline for the Treatment of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Therapeutic Approaches for Non-Systemic Polyarthritis, Sacroiliitis, and Enthesitis","2019","Objective: To develop treatment recommendations for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis manifesting as non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, or enthesitis. Methods: The Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions were developed and refined by members of the guideline development teams. A systematic review was conducted to compile evidence for the benefits and harms associated with treatments for these conditions. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. A group consensus process was conducted among the Voting Panel to generate the final recommendations and grade their strength. A Parent and Patient Panel used a similar consensus approach to provide patient/caregiver preferences for key questions. Results: Thirty-nine recommendations were developed (8 strong and 31 conditional). The quality of supporting evidence was very low or low for 90% of the recommendations. Recommendations are provided for the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologics, and intraarticular and oral glucocorticoids. Recommendations for the use of physical and occupational therapy are also provided. Specific recommendations for polyarthritis address general medication use, initial and subsequent treatment, and adjunctive therapies. Good disease control, with therapeutic escalation to achieve low disease activity, was recommended. The sacroiliitis and enthesitis recommendations primarily address initial therapy and adjunctive therapies. Conclusion: This guideline provides direction for clinicians, caregivers, and patients making treatment decisions. Clinicians, caregivers, and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients’ values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies. ? 2019, American College of Rheumatology","abatacept; adalimumab; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; glucocorticoid; golimumab; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; leflunomide; methotrexate; methylprednisolone acetate; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; rituximab; salazosulfapyridine; tocilizumab; triamcinolone acetonide; triamcinolone hexacetonide; adjuvant therapy; Article; disease activity; disease classification; disease control; drug efficacy; enthesitis; gastrointestinal disease; human; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; low drug dose; occupational therapy; physiotherapy; polyarthritis; practice guideline; risk factor; sacroiliitis; shared decision making; systematic review; treatment outcome"
"Rapidly progressive therapy-related myeloid neoplasm in a patient treated for Burkitt lymphoma: A case report","2019","Therapy related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) occurs as a late complication of cytotoxic agent chemotherapy for a prior malignancy. In the literature so far, only rare cases of a t-MN following Burkitt lymphoma (BL) chemotherapy have been reported. We present a case of a 44-year-old female who initially presented with Stage 4b, EBV-negative BL with classic morphological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features. The patient was treated with standard CODOX-M/IVAC chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Methotrexate, Leucovorin, Ifosfamide, Etoposide, Cytarabine) plus Rituximab and achieved complete remission. She subsequently presented 2 years later with a t-MN which progressed to acute myeloid leukemia within 4 months. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies (FISH) and cytogenetic studies post chemotherapy showed an abnormal mosaic female karyotype with ring chromosome 20 along with a structurally abnormal chromosome 21 including additional material of unknown origin added at band q22. KMT2A rearrangement was excluded by FISH.

"Examining the Association between Life-Space Mobility and Cognitive Function in Older Adults: A Systematic Review","2019","Purpose. The purpose of this review is to investigate the relationship between life-space mobility and cognition in older adults. Methods. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched through December 2018 for studies containing measures of life-space mobility and cognitive function. Two independent reviewers screened studies. Eligible studies were combined using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2. Results. Thirty-five articles were identified for review. A moderate and statistically significant association (pooled r = 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.40.) was observed between life-space mobility and cognition among nine studies. Life-space mobility demonstrated small-to-moderate associations with domain-specific cognitive functioning, particularly executive function, learning, memory, and processing speed. Furthermore, individuals who had restricted life-space mobility (Life-Space Assessment ? 40) experienced a steeper decline in cognition (β = 0.56 and p = 0.0471) compared to those who did not (Life-Space Assessment ? 41). Conclusion. This review examined the association between life-space mobility and cognitive function in older adults. The results suggest that a moderate relationship between life-space mobility and cognition exists, whether adjusted or unadjusted for covariates such as sociodemographics, mental health, functional capacity, and comorbidities. ? 2019 Nileththi A.

"Spatial Resolution Evaluation of a Microwave System for Breast Cancer Screening","2019","The ability of microwave breast imaging to achieve sub-centimeter spatial resolution has been proven before in simulation and simple experimental studies. However, detecting sub-centimeter tumours depends not only on the theoretical spatial resolution limit, but also on the level of background clutter and measurement uncertainty. Therefore, estimating the actual limit of the smallest detectable object in a specific measurement setup is critical before the setup can be deployed in a clinical scenario. Here, we present a method of such evaluation on a planar microwave imaging setup for breast cancer imaging. The method utilizes the measurement of a small scattering probe of known size and permittivity in a uniform embedding medium. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the generated point spread function can then be evaluated to determine the system-specific spatial resolution. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in an experimental study of a compressed-breast phantom. This method can be applied to evaluate the limit of the size of detectable objects for other acquisitions systems, e.g. hemispherical or cylindrical antenna configurations. ? 2019 European Association on Antennas and Propagation.","Calibration; Cylindrical antennas; Diagnosis; Diseases; Function evaluation; Image resolution; Imaging systems; Microwaves; Object detection; Optical transfer function; Signal to noise ratio; Uncertainty analysis; Antenna configurations; Breast Cancer; Breast cancer screening; Centimeter spatial resolution; Contrast to noise ratio; Measurement uncertainty; Microwave breast imaging; Microwave imaging; Medical imaging"
"Modulation of CRTh2 expression on allergen-specific T cells following peptide immunotherapy","2019","Background: Allergen immunotherapy using synthetic peptide T-cell epitopes (Cat-PAD) from the major cat allergen Fel d 1 has been shown, in allergen exposure studies, to significantly reduce symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in cat-allergic subjects. However, the immunological mechanisms underlying clinical benefit remain only partially understood. Since previous studies of whole allergen immunotherapy demonstrated a reduction in the frequency of allergen-specific (MHC II tetramer+) CD4+ T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CRTh2, we assessed the impact of Cat-PAD on the frequency and functional phenotype of Fel d 1-specific CD4+ T cells. Methods: Using before and after treatment samples from subjects enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Cat-PAD, we employed Fel d 1 MHC II tetramers and flow cytometry to analyze the expression of chemokine receptors CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, and CRTh2, together with markers of memory phenotype (CD27 and CCR7) on Fel d 1-specific CD4+ T cells. Results: No statistically significant change in the frequency of Fel d 1-specific CD4+ T cells, nor in their expression of chemokine receptors or memory phenotype, was observed. However, a significant reduction in cell surface expression of CRTh2 was observed between the placebo and active groups (P?=?0.047). Conclusions: Peptide immunotherapy with Cat-PAD does not significantly alter the frequency or phenotype of Fel d 1-CD4+ T cells, but may decrease their expression of CRTh2. ? 2019 The Authors.

"What Emergency Medicine Rewards: Is There Implicit Gender Bias in National Awards?","2019","Study objective: Multiple studies have demonstrated a gender gap in the percentage of women recognized in national awards, but to our knowledge this gap has not been studied within emergency medicine. This study is designed to evaluate the presence of a gender gap in female representation in awards from national emergency medicine organizations in the United States and Canada. Methods: The awards from 5 national organizations during the past 5 years were reviewed. We developed a data extraction tool to identify and categorize the awards and recipients. Data were grouped according to gender distribution and assessed with respect to emergency medicine organization, year of award, category of award, and career phase specified by award. Results: The overall percentage of female awardees across all 5 organizations from 2014 to 2018 was 28%. Only 16% of all named awards were named after women, and female awardees were more likely to be recognized early in their career for advocacy and work pertaining to the advancement of women, whereas men were favored for awards recognizing mentorship and organizational contributions. Conclusion: Emergency medicine is unique among other specialties in that the percentage of women represented in national awards (28%) closely mirrors the overall representation of women in emergency medicine (27.6% in the United States, 31% in Canada). This is in contrast to the documented leadership gap in academic medicine and emergency medicine, which may reflect a lag time between receiving national awards and earning academic and professional promotion. Although some organizations had significantly lower representation of female awardees, the overall trends indicate that women have closed the gender gap in award representation. This may signal a forthcoming change in other domains with established gaps in emergency medicine; specifically, in leadership and pay. ? 2019 American College of Emergency Physicians","adult; article; awards and prizes; Canada; career; data extraction; emergency medicine; female; gender bias; human; leadership; male; mentor; organization; recipient; reward"

"Multicentre pilot randomised clinical trial of early in-bed cycle ergometry with ventilated patients","2019","Introduction Acute rehabilitation in critically ill patients can improve post-intensive care unit (post-ICU) physical function. In-bed cycling early in a patient's ICU stay is a promising intervention. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of recruitment, intervention delivery and retention in a multi centre randomised clinical trial (RCT) of early in-bed cycling with mechanically ventilated (MV) patients. Methods We conducted a pilot RCT conducted in seven Canadian medical-surgical ICUs. We enrolled adults who could ambulate independently before ICU admission, within the first 4 days of invasive MV and first 7 days of ICU admission. Following informed consent, patients underwent concealed randomisation to either 30 min/day of in-bed cycling and routine physiotherapy (Cycling) or routine physiotherapy alone (Routine) for 5 days/week, until ICU discharge. Our feasibility outcome targets included: Accrual of 1-2 patients/month/site; >80% cycling protocol delivery; >80% outcomes measured and >80% blinded outcome measures at hospital discharge. We report ascertainment rates for our primary outcome for the main trial (Physical Function ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s) at hospital discharge). Results Between 3/2015 and 6/2016, we randomised 66 patients (36 Cycling, 30 Routine). Our consent rate was 84.6 % (66/78). Patient accrual was (mean (SD)) 1.1 (0.3) patients/month/site. Cycling occurred in 79.3% (146/184) of eligible sessions, with a median (IQR) session duration of 30.5 (30.0, 30.7) min. We recorded 43 (97.7%) PFIT-s scores at hospital discharge and 37 (86.0%) of these assessments were blinded.

"Individual Treatment Effect Estimation of 2 Doses of Dabigatran on Stroke and Major Bleeding in Atrial Fibrillation: Results from the RE-LY Trial","2019","Background: We aimed to estimate absolute benefit and harm from treatment with dabigatran in individual patients with atrial fibrillation, and to select the optimal dose for each individual. Methods: We derived and validated a prediction model for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation from the 3 treatment arms of the RE-LY trial (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy With Dabigatran Etexilate) (n=11 955 in derivation cohort, n=6158 in validation cohort). Readily available patient characteristics were included in Fine and Gray competing risk models (sex, age, smoking, antiplatelet drugs, previous vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hemoglobin). Five-year risks for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding were estimated without anticoagulation therapy, and compared with high- and low-dose dabigatran. Results: Model calibration was good, and discrimination was adequate with a c-statistic of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62-0.70) for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.66-0.71) for major bleeding. The 5-year absolute risk reduction for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily ranged from <10% in 20% of patients to >25% in 14% of patients, and the 5-year absolute risk increase for major bleeding ranged from <5% in 53% of patients to 15% to 20% in 1% of patients. Comparing high-dose to low-dose dabigatran, the net benefit (absolute risk reduction minus absolute risk increase) was positive for 46% of patients. Conclusions: The absolute treatment benefits and harms of dabigatran in atrial fibrillation can be estimated based on readily available patient characteristics. Such treatment effect estimations can be used for shared decision making before starting dabigatran treatment and to determine the optimal dose. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","antithrombocytic agent; dabigatran; warfarin; aged; anticoagulant therapy; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; embolism; female; human; international normalized ratio; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; optimal drug dose; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk reduction"
"Differentiation of Brain Tumor Initiating Cells","2019","Differentiation is a central key capability of stem cells. Their ability to be multipotent and undergo self-renewal are key identifying features of stem cells. A differentiation assay allows for study of one of the essential features of stem cells, the ability to differentiate into all of the cell types of its lineage, in order to ensure that the cells cultured and utilized in key experiments indeed have stem cell properties. Neural stem cells when plated in differentiation media, differentiate into all three neural lineages: Neurons, Astrocytes, and Oligodendrocytes. Brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) are cells present in brain tumors that possess stem cell properties and are able to self-renew and differentiate into neural lineages.

"Diabetes and kidney cancer survival in patients undergoing nephrectomy: A Canadian multi-center, propensity score analysis","2019","Introduction: Diabetes has been associated with worse survival outcomes in various malignancies; however, there are conflicting data in kidney cancer. Determining whether diabetes is associated with survival in kidney cancer may help guide treatment in a comorbid patient population. Methods: We used the Canadian Kidney Cancer information system database to identify patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy between 1989 and 2017 for localized renal cell carcinoma at 16 institutions across Canada. We derived inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) from a propensity score model based on various clinical, surgical, and pathological characteristics. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the association between diabetes and cancer-specific and overall survival, in the sample weighted by the IPTW. Results: 4828 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 948 (19.6%) were diabetic. Median follow-up in those without death was 26.6 months (interquartile range 9.7–53.8). Among the entire cohort, 901 deaths were from any cause, and 299 deaths from kidney cancer. Before propensity score methods, diabetics were older, more likely to have comorbidities and clear cell histopathology. After propensity score adjustment, all characteristics were balanced between groups (standardized difference <0.10). IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated no significant association between diabetes and cancer-specific (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.78–1.62), or overall survival (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.94–1.38). Conclusions: Our multi-centre study found that diabetes and nondiabetics have similar survival following nephrectomy for kidney cancer. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nephrectomy; overall survival; partial nephrectomy; priority journal; radical nephrectomy; renal cell carcinoma; retrospective study"
"Antibody-based ticagrelor reversal agent in healthy volunteers","2019","BACKGROUND Ticagrelor is an oral P2Y12 inhibitor that is used with aspirin to reduce the risk of ischemic events among patients with acute coronary syndromes or previous myocardial infarction. Spontaneous major bleeding and bleeding associated with urgent invasive procedures are concerns with ticagrelor, as with other antiplatelet drugs. The antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor cannot be reversed with platelet transfusion. A rapid-acting reversal agent would be useful. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial, we evaluated intravenous PB2452, a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds ticagrelor with high affinity, as a ticagrelor reversal agent. We assessed platelet function in healthy volunteers before and after 48 hours of ticagrelor pretreatment and again after the administration of PB2452 or placebo. Platelet function was assessed with the use of light transmission aggregometry, a point-of-care P2Y12 platelet-reactivity test, and a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assay. RESULTS Of the 64 volunteers who underwent randomization, 48 were assigned to receive PB2452 and 16 to receive placebo. After 48 hours of ticagrelor pretreatment, platelet aggregation was suppressed by approximately 80%. PB2452 administered as an initial intravenous bolus followed by a prolonged infusion (8, 12, or 16 hours) was associated with a significantly greater increase in platelet function than placebo, as measured by multiple assays. Ticagrelor reversal occurred within 5 minutes after the initiation of PB2452 and was sustained for more than 20 hours (P<0.001 after Bonferroni adjustment across all time points for all assays). There was no evidence of a rebound in platelet activity after drug cessation. Adverse events related to the trial drug were limited mainly to issues involving the infusion site. CONCLUSIONS In healthy volunteers, the administration of PB2452, a specific reversal agent for ticagrelor, provided immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor, as measured by multiple assays. ? 2019 Massachusetts Medical Society.","drug antibody; monoclonal antibody; pb 2452; placebo; ticagrelor; unclassified drug; antithrombocytic agent; coagulating agent; neutralizing antibody; PB2452; ticagrelor; abdominal pain; acute respiratory failure; adult; alcohol intoxication; area under the curve; arm fracture; Article; aspiration pneumonia; conjunctivitis; controlled study; dizziness; double blind procedure; drug clearance; drug dose increase; drug efficacy; drug safety; elimination half-life; female; gastroenteritis; hematuria; human; human experiment; infusion related reaction; injection site contusion; injection site extravasation; light transmission aggregometry; loading drug dose; male; normal human; oropharynx pain; phase 1 clinical trial; platelet aggregation assay; platelet reactivity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; skin abrasion; streptococcal pharyngitis; thrombocyte aggregation inhibition; vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein assay; antagonists and inhibitors; clinical trial; dose response; drug effect; intravenous drug administration; physiology; thrombocyte; Adult; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Blood Platelets; Coagulants; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Male; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Ticagrelor"
"Priority setting for disease outbreaks in Uganda: A case study evaluating the process","2019","Priority setting (PS) and resource allocation during health emergencies are key factors influencing an effective response. However, there is limited understanding of how priorities and resource allocation during disease outbreaks occur and the extent to which these processes are successful. This paper, based on 23 in-depth interviews with policy makers and a review of policy and emergency preparedness documents, used a PS evaluation framework to evaluate PS for disease outbreaks in Uganda. With regard to PS for disease outbreaks in Uganda, we identified a conducive socio-political-economical context, credible institutions, formal participatory prioritisation processes, evidence informed the processes, demonstrated implementation capacity, institutional strengthening and positive health outcomes. Factors that compromised the success of PS included limited resources–especially in between disease outbreaks and unfair processes. Investment in sustaining the established prioritisation infrastructure to oversee preparedness activities between the outbreaks would strengthen the prioritisation process. This should be supported with health system strengthening. The framework enabled us to evaluate some aspects of PS during disease outbreaks. The framework’s inability to evaluate all aspects, and reported as opposed to actual PS calls for the integration of evaluation throughout the planning and implementation process to ensure validity and continuous implementation of improvement strategies. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article; case study; climate change; disaster; emergency; epidemic; health care policy; human; interview; jurisprudence; mass medium; priority journal; resource allocation; stakeholder engagement; Uganda; communicable disease control; health care planning; management; organization and management; qualitative research; Communicable Disease Control; Disease Outbreaks; Health Policy; Health Priorities; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Policy Making; Qualitative Research; Resource Allocation; Uganda"
"Understanding by General Providers of the Echocardiogram Report","2019","Echocardiograms are the second most frequently utilized cardiac test after electrocardiograms and are most commonly ordered by noncardiology providers. Echocardiogram reports are designed to communicate a comprehensive interpretation of cardiac function; however, it is not known how well these reports are understood by ordering providers. In order to identify gaps in understanding and target potential areas for improvement, we developed a questionnaire testing various topics reported on a standard transthoracic echocardiogram report. This questionnaire was administered to general medicine and cardiology trainees and attending physicians at 2 large academic institutions. Questionnaire response rate was 81%. There were several topics that were not well understood by general providers; these included viability of an akinetic region, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, left ventricular filling pressure, recognition of abnormal structures, and method of identifying of intracardiac thrombus. In conclusion, strategies such as improved communication techniques and adjustment of reporting format should be implemented to increase the clinical value of the echocardiogram. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article; comprehension; echocardiography; general practice; health care personnel; heart left ventricle filling pressure; hospital physician; human; medical information; priority journal; pulmonary artery; questionnaire; student; systolic blood pressure; thrombus"
"Canadian Urological Association Best Practice Report: Diagnosis and management of radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis","2019","Background Hemorrhagic cystitis refers to a collection of symptoms and signs defined by hematuria, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and cystoscopic findings indicative of underlying urothelial damage. It can have a number underlying causative factors: Treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (such as cyclophosphamide and concurrent therapies); post-transplant patients; infection-mediated; treatment with radiation therapy. RHC is often an adverse event in patients with previous radiation to the pelvis for urological or gynecological malignancy and will be the focus of this BPR. RHC is generally considered a separate pathologial process from acute radiation effects, with early signs of urothelial effects occurring at three months and pathological changes occurring 6-12 months after radiation.1 New-onset symptoms have been recorded up to 20 years after radiation treatment.2 The estimates for prevalence of RHC after radiation treatment varies widely depending on the diagnostic definitions used, but different studies have quoted them as 9-21% following treatment of prostate cancer, 3-6.7% for cervical cancer, and 2-47% for bladder cancer.3 The use of modern treatment techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy, have reduced the radiation dose to the bladder. Randomized studies have shown that the use of higher doses in the management of prostate cancer have resulted improved prostatespecific antigen (PSA) control using these modern treatment techniques, but with the same incidence of late complications. There has also been a trend to using hypofractionation radiotherapy regimens (higher dose per fraction given over a shorter timeframe). To minimize late bladder effects, emphasis needs to be paid to ensuring doses received by radiovulnerable structures, such as bowel and bladder, are kept within acceptable limits. The exact mechanism by which radiation causes damage to the bladder is not entirely understood, but believed to be multifactorial. While direct damage to DNA is believed to be rare, it is hypothesized that indirect damage occurs through the creation of free radicals.4 Histological studies have demonstrated increased proliferation of the urothelium in the months following radiation. Damage to tight cellular junctions and the loss of the normal polysaccharide layer allow for increased permeability of urine bacteria and metabolites causing increased damage to the underlying tissue.1 This altered permeability of the urothelial cell layer has been demonstrated to be involved in late-stage radiation changes in rat models5 and is hypothesized to play a large role in the development of post-radiation urinary symptoms.6 Diffuse mucosal edema is noted in biopsies taken immediately post-radiation. This is followed by development of vascular telangiectasia, submucosal hemorrhage, and interstitial fibrosis. Subendothelial proliferation, edema, and medial thickening may progressively deplete the blood supply to urothelium, resulting in endarteritis obliterans causing acute and chronic ischemia.3 These ischemic and necrotic changes are proposed to give rise to subsequent development of revascularization with superficial, fragile vessels that are responsible for bleeding in radiation cystitis.4 Hospitalizations for RHC can be lengthy and costly. A recent retrospective study assessing 1111 patients admitted for RHC in 2013 showed the median cost associated with each admission to be $7157 USD. This number rose to $11 100 for those with hematuria severe enough to merit endoscopic evaluation/treatment.7 Multiple studies have demonstrated the significant effect its protracted and recurrent nature can have on patient-rated quality of life scales.8 There exists little consensus of how to best treat RHC, and previous surveys of practicing urologist have shown a lack of awareness of treatment options available.9 terminology has led to the development of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events as a uniform lexicon for description of cancer-related adverse effects. ? 2019 Canadian Urological Association.","aluminum potassium sulfate; aminocaproic acid; formaldehyde; hyaluronic acid; pentosan polysulfate; Article; artificial embolization; clinical decision making; cystectomy; cystoscopy; early diagnosis; hemorrhagic cystitis; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; practice guideline; prostate cancer; radiation injury; radiation response; systematic review; telangiectasia; uterine cervix cancer; volumetric modulated arc therapy"
"Regulation of the proline regulatory axis and autophagy modulates stemness in TP73/p73 deficient cancer stem-like cells","2019","Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) reside as a small population within tumors, which mostly contain a larger population of differentiated cells. With their unique self-renewing abilities, CSLCs remain refractory to various therapeutic interventions, which otherwise kill differentiated cancer cells, and thus are a major culprit behind cancer treatment failures and cancer relapse. Recently, the process of macroautophagy/autophagy has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for eliminating CSLCs, as autophagic homeostasis has been discovered to play an important role in the growth of cancer and normal stem cells, and is required for the maintenance of the non-differentiated state of CSLCs. Our current work now shows that the so-called ‘tumor suppressor’ TP73/p73 plays an unconventional role in CSLC biology, and positively regulates the growth and stemness of CSLCs through the modulation of autophagy. Our data show that TP73/p73 deficiency, promotes autophagy in CSLCs by activating the autophagy machinery involving AMPK-TSC-MTOR signaling. Mechanistically, TP73/p73 deficiency-induced autophagy occurs as a result of reduced ATP levels resulting from the metabolic perturbations within the proline regulatory axis. Collectively, these findings unveil novel therapeutically-relevant implications for autophagy in the TP73/p73-dependent regulation of stemness within CSLCs. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adenosine triphosphate; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; proline; tumor protein p73; autophagy; cancer stem cell; homeostasis; human; macroautophagy; nonhuman; Note; regulatory mechanism; stem cell self-renewal"
"Comparing the attitudes of four groups of stakeholders from Quebec, Canada, toward extending medical aid in dying to incompetent patients with dementia","2019","Objective: The Canadian province of Quebec has recently legalized medical aid in dying (MAID) for competent patients who satisfy strictly defined criteria. The province is considering extending the practice to incompetent patients. We compared the attitudes of four groups of stakeholders toward extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia. Methods: We conducted a province-wide postal survey in random samples of older adults, informal caregivers of persons with dementia, nurses, and physicians caring for patients with dementia. Clinical vignettes featuring a patient with Alzheimer's disease were used to measure the acceptability of extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia. Vignettes varied according to the stage of the disease (advanced or terminal) and type of request (written or oral only). We used the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach to compare attitudes across groups and vignettes. Results: Response rates ranged from 25% for physicians to 69% for informal caregivers. In all four groups, the proportion of respondents who felt it was acceptable to extend MAID to an incompetent patient with dementia was highest when the patient was at the terminal stage, showed signs of distress, and had written a MAID request prior to losing capacity. In those circumstances, this proportion ranged from 71% among physicians to 91% among informal caregivers. Conclusion: We found high support in Quebec for extending the current MAID legislation to incompetent patients with dementia who have reached the terminal stage, appear to be suffering, and had requested MAID in writing while still competent. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; caregiver; comparative study; controlled study; decision making; dementia; disease severity; dying; euthanasia; female; geriatric patient; health personnel attitude; human; male; nurse attitude; physician attitude; postal mail; Quebec; questionnaire; random sample; rural area; terminal disease; very elderly; assisted suicide; caregiver; mental capacity; procedures; psychology; terminal care; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude of Health Personnel; Caregivers; Dementia; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Competency; Quebec; Suicide, Assisted; Surveys and Questionnaires; Terminal Care"

"Evaluating user experiences of a clearing house for health policy and systems","2019","Background: Timely access to evidence increases the prospects for evidence informed decision making. We evaluated user experiences of a Clearing House for Health Policy with the aim of increasing access to evidence about the Uganda health system and interventions. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 potential users including policymakers, health policy advisors, health managers and researchers to provide evidence on their experience with the clearinghouse. On average participants took 20?minutes to first navigate the site and 45?minutes to perform search tasks and complete the interview. Results: Most respondents successfully searched for information with accuracy and completeness in a short time. Participants commended the performance and expressed high regard for the credibility of the clearinghouse. The majority felt that using the resource was worth their effort. The clearinghouse provided appropriate functionalities for information searching. Navigating and finding information from the site was achievable. However, inadequate background information about the site and lack of current information were widely reported. Conclusion: Our paper provides insights on the issues that can be addressed to improve online resources for health policy and system information in a limited resource setting. Users’ experience of such resources can be improved by regularly appraising and appropriately indexing the contents, and optimising the capacity to customise information. ? 2019 Health Libraries Group","adult; article; female; health care policy; human; human experiment; interview; male; manager; scientist; Uganda; evidence based medicine; health care delivery; health care policy; management; medical information system; procedures; Uganda; Adult; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Health Information Exchange; Health Policy; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Policy Making; Uganda"
"Clinical differences between patients with pediatric bipolar disorder with and without a parental history of bipolar disorder","2019","Pediatric Bipolar Disorder (PBD) is a highly heritable condition responsible for 18% of all pediatric mental health hospitalizations. Despite the heritability of this disorder, few studies have assessed potential differences in the clinical manifestation of PBD among patients with a clear parental history of BD. Additionally, while recent studies suggest that attentional deficits are a potential endophenotypic marker of PBD, it is unclear whether heritability is a relevant contributor to these symptoms. In order to address this gap, the present study assessed 61 youth with PBD (6–17 years old), corresponding to 27 offspring of BD patients, and 31 PBD patients without a parental history of the disorder. All standardized assessments, including the K-SADS-PL-W were performed by trained child and adolescent psychiatrists. We performed a logistic multivariate model using the variables of ADHD, rapid cycling, and lifetime psychosis. Rates of ADHD comorbidity were significantly higher among PBD patients who had a parent with BD. Furthermore, PBD patients who had a parent with BD showed a trend toward significance of earlier symptom onset. PBD offspring did not show increased rates of suicide attempts, rapid cycling, or psychosis. Given these findings, it appears that PBD patients who have a parent with BD may represent a distinct endophenotype of the disorder. Future longitudinal and larger studies are required to confirm our findings. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adolescent; Article; attention deficit disorder; bipolar disorder; child; clinical feature; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; family history; female; heritability; human; major clinical study; male; pediatric bipolar disorder; phenotype; priority journal; progeny; psychiatrist; psychologic assessment; psychosis; rapid cycling bipolar disorder; suicide attempt; trend study"

"Estimation of the benefit and harms of including clinical breast examination in an organized breast screening program","2019","Background: There is controversy about the value of clinical breast examination (CBE) in addition to mammography for breast screening. The study investigates the associations between risk factors such as mammographic density, hormone therapy use and family history and the effectiveness of screening mammography with or without CBE. Methods: The cohort consists of women 50–69 years old screened at the Ontario Breast Screening Program. The associations of the risk factors were investigated using a joint logistic regression model that accommodates the partially unobserved disease status, clustered data structures, individual risk factors, and the dependence between true and false detection. Results: Having high mammographic density, a first degree relative with breast cancer and using hormone therapy generally increased a woman's probability of being referred correctly. For low risk group (defined as without dense breasts, family history, and not currently using hormone therapy), the average loss of specificity ranged from 3.6% to 5.7% and the gain of sensitivity was between 10.6% and 21.2% with the addition of CBE. Conclusions: The addition of CBE to mammography would increase the overall sensitivity and decrease the specificity. CBE can be targeted to those women in which it has the highest net benefit. ? 2018","adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; breast examination; cancer screening; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; false negative result; family history; female; first-degree relative; health program; hormonal therapy; human; low risk patient; major clinical study; mammography; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; breast density; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; estrogen therapy; middle aged; patient referral; physical examination; procedures; risk assessment; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Breast Density; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Mammography; Middle Aged; Physical Examination; Referral and Consultation; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity"

"Phospholamban cardiomyopathy: a?Canadian perspective on a?unique population","2019","Introduction: Phospholamban cardiomyopathy is an inherited cardiomyopathy, characterised by a?defect in regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, often presenting with malignant arrhythmias and progressive cardiac dysfunction occurring at a?young age. Methods: Phospholamban R14del mutation carriers and family members were identified from inherited arrhythmia clinics at 13?sites across Canada. Cardiac investigations, including electrocardiograms, Holter monitoring (premature ventricular complexes, PVCs), and imaging results were summarised. Results: Fifty patients (10?families) were identified (median age 30?years, range 3–71, 46% female). Mutation carriers were more likely to be older, have low-voltage QRS, T?wave inversion, frequent PVCs, and cardiac dysfunction, compared to unaffected relatives. Increasing age, low-voltage QRS, T?wave inversion, late potentials, and frequent PVCs were predictors of cardiac dysfunction (p?&lt; 0.05 for all). Older carriers (age ?45?years) were more likely to have disease manifestations than were their younger counterparts, with disease onset occurring at an older age in Canadian patients and their Dutch counterparts. Discussion: Among Canadian patients with phospholamban cardiomyopathy, clinical manifestations resembled those of their Dutch counterparts, with increasing age a?major predictor of disease manifestation. Older mutation carriers were more likely to have electrical and structural abnormalities, and may represent variable expressivity, age-dependent penetrance, or genetic heterogeneity among Canadian patients. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); phospholamban; adult; Article; Canadian; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; deletion mutant; ECG abnormality; echocardiography; female; genetic disorder; genetic regulation; heart disease; heart left ventricle failure; heart ventricle extrasystole; heart ventricle tachycardia; Holter monitoring; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; QRS complex; QRS interval; retrospective study; senescence; signal averaged electrocardiography; T wave inversion; treadmill exercise"

"What Does Death Preparedness Mean for Family Caregivers of Persons With Dementia?","2019","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to clarify the concept of death preparedness for family caregivers in dementia. Conceptualization was required to support the assessment, promotion, and operationalization (ie, measurement) of death preparedness through palliative care interventions such as advance care planning. Methods: Rodgers evolutionary method of concept analysis was selected to guide this study because of the dynamic nature of death preparedness influenced by context, setting, and time. A comprehensive literature search was conducted. Authors performed constant comparative analysis to identify and interpret surrogate/related concepts, attributes, antecedents, and consequences of death preparedness. Results: Most importantly attributes included (1) knowing and recognizing the symptoms of decline in dementia and what dying looks like; (2) understanding emotions and grief responses; (3) accessing and appraising supports needed to manage and care for dying; (4) organizing affairs and completing tasks in advance; (5) accepting that losses are inevitable and imminent; (6) reflecting on caregiving and finding meaning, “a silver-lining”; and (7) closing, reconciling, and renewing relationship bonds and completing the family member’s life. Discussion: This study contributed a full definition of death preparedness in dementia. Findings aligned with/expanded upon Hebert et al Theoretical Framework of Preparedness for End-of-Life. The use of problem- and emotion-based coping strategies by caregivers with support from health-care providers to promote feelings of death preparedness (including self-efficacy and control) and minimize uncertainty was the implication of this study. Development of a holistic preparedness instrument is underway. ?

"Traditional knowledge-based lifestyle interventions in the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Indigenous children in Canada: A systematic review protocol","2019","Background: Approximately 50% of all youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Canada occurs in Indigenous children. In adults, cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in First Nations communities, and diabetes is a significant contributor to the risk of developing this disorder. The early onset of diabetes may predispose these children to premature cardiovascular disease and influence their longevity and quality of life. As a result, the implementation of culturally tailored obesity and T2DM primary prevention programs is vital. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of existing traditional knowledge-based lifestyle intervention programs on preventing obesity and T2DM in Indigenous children in Canada. Methods: We will conduct database searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials. We will also conduct grey literature searches of central repository of trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), ProQuest Dissertations, Theses A&I, and Indigenous studies portal research tools. Reviewers will independently review titles, abstracts, and full-text articles retrieved from databases to assess potentially eligible studies, and relevant articles will be assessed for risk of bias and quality. The primary outcomes include the change in body mass index z-scores or a diagnosis of diabetes. The secondary outcomes include the change in measures of adiposity as well as lifestyle and metabolic profiles. A meta-analysis will be performed if two or more studies have used similar study designs, comparable intervention techniques, similar populations and measured similar outcomes. Discussion: This review will provide a summary of current interventions to prevent obesity and T2DM in Indigenous children in Canada and help determine the gaps in the literature so that interventions can be developed to control the surge in pediatric T2DM in Indigenous communities.

"Albumin-Modified Cationic Nanocarriers to Potentially Create a New Platform for Drug Delivery Systems","2019","Cationic nanocarriers have emerged as promising nanoparticle systems for the effective delivery of nucleic acid and anticancer drugs to cancer cells. A positive charge is desirable for promoting cell internalization, whereas it also causes some adverse effects, such as toxicity and rapid clearance by mononuclear phagocytic systems. Herein, a new strategy of modifying cationic polymer micelles with albumin forming a protein corona to improve the surface physiochemical properties is reported. The corona with a monolayer or a multilayer was constructed depending on the albumin concentration, and the proteins would denature in different degrees due to the interaction with the surface of cationic micelles. It is demonstrated that multilayer albumin corona is beneficial to prevent macrophage uptake, increase accumulation in tumor tissues, and reduce toxic side effects to normal tissues. Our work provides a promising method to modify the cationic nanoplatform by optimizing the biosecurity and bioavailability for potential application in drug delivery. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Biochemistry; Drug interactions; Histology; Micelles; Multilayers; Nucleic acids; Proteins; Targeted drug delivery; Tissue; albumin; biosafety; Cationic micelles; Cell internalization; denature; Drug delivery system; Nanoparticle systems; Physio-chemical properties; Controlled drug delivery; albuminoid; antineoplastic agent; cation; nanoparticle; polymer; animal; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug effect; human; micelle; mouse; neoplasm; particle size; RAW 264.7 cell line; surface property; Albumins; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cations; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Mice; Micelles; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Polymers; RAW 264.7 Cells; Surface Properties"
"Deep vein thrombosis: update on diagnosis and management","2019","Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires a multifaceted approach that includes clinical assessment, evaluation of pre-test probability, and objective diagnostic testing. Common symptoms and signs of DVT are pain, swelling, erythema and dilated veins in the affected limb. The pre-test probability of DVT can be assessed using a clinical decision rule that stratifies DVT into “unlikely” or “likely”. If DVT is “unlikely”, refer for D-dimer test. If the D-dimer level is normal, DVT can be excluded; if the D-dimer level is increased, refer for compression ultrasound. If DVT is “likely”, refer for compression ultrasound. When DVT is confirmed, anticoagulation is indicated to control symptoms, prevent progression and reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation may consist of a parenteral anticoagulant overlapped by warfarin or followed by a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (dabigatran or edoxaban), or of a DOAC (apixaban or rivaroxaban) without initial parenteral therapy. DOACs are the preferred treatment for DVT because they are at least as effective, safer and more convenient than warfarin. DOACs may require dose reduction or avoidance in patients with renal dysfunction, and should be avoided in pregnancy. Recent evidence shows that DVT in patients with cancer may be treated with edoxaban (after discontinuation of 5 days of initial heparin or low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) or rivaroxaban if patients prefer not to have daily injections of LMWH, but the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is higher with DOACs than with LMWH in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. ? 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; apixaban; D dimer; dabigatran; dalteparin; edoxaban; enoxaparin; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; nadroparin; rivaroxaban; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; low molecular weight heparin; anticoagulant therapy; antiphospholipid syndrome; bleeding; brain hemorrhage; cancer patient; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; deep vein thrombosis; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test; digestive system cancer; disease exacerbation; drug contraindication; drug dose reduction; dyspepsia; erythema; evidence based medicine; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; human; injection; kidney failure; limb; lung embolism; medical decision making; pain; patient preference; patient referral; postthrombosis syndrome; pregnancy; probability; protein blood level; recurrent disease; Review; risk reduction; secondary prevention; swelling; symptom; treatment duration; vein dilatation; blood; complication; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; lung embolism; neoplasm; oral drug administration; vein thrombosis; Administration, Oral; Anticoagulants; Disease Progression; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Neoplasms; Pulmonary Embolism; Venous Thrombosis"
"Environmental and clinical antibiotic resistomes, same only different","2019","The history of antibiotic use in the clinic is one of initial efficacy followed inevitably by the emergence of resistance. Often this resistance is the result of the capture and mobilization of genes that have their origins in environmental reservoirs. Both antibiotic production and resistance are ancient and widely distributed among microbes in the environment. This deep reservoir of resistance offers the opportunity for gene flow into susceptible disease-causing bacteria. Not all resistance genes are equally successfully mobilized, and some dominate in the clinic. The differences and similarities in resistance mechanisms and associated genes among environments reveal a complex interplay between gene capture and mobilization that requires study of gene diversity and gene product function to fully understand the breadth and depth of resistance and the risk to human health. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","antibiotic agent; beta lactam antibiotic; rifamycin; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistome; environmental factor; gene product; genetic similarity; genetic variability; genotype environment interaction; human; nonhuman; Review"
"Tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use among indigenous youth attending off-reserve schools in Canada: Cross-sectional results from the Canadian student tobacco, alcohol and drugs survey","2019","Introduction: Ongoing surveillance of youth substance use is essential to quantify harms and to identify populations at higher risk. In the Canadian context, historical and structural injustices make monitoring excess risk among Indigenous youth particularly important. This study updated national prevalence rates of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use among Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. Methods: Differences in tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use were examined, using logistic regression, among 1700 Indigenous and 22 800 non-Indigenous youth in Grades 9–12 who participated in the 2014/15 Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey. Differences by sex were also examined. Mean age of first alcohol and marijuana use was compared in the two populations using OLS regression. Results were compared to 2008/09 data. Results: While smoking, alcohol, and marijuana rates have decreased compared to 2008/09 in both populations, the gap between the populations has mostly not. In 2014/15, Indigenous youth had higher odds of smoking (odds ratio [OR]: 5.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.54–7.81) and past-year drinking (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.16– 1.76) than non-Indigenous youth. More Indigenous than non-Indigenous youth attempted quitting smoking. Non-Indigenous males were less likely to have had at least one drink in the past-year compared to non-Indigenous females. Indigenous males and females had higher odds of past-year marijuana use than non-Indigenous males (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.32–2.56) and females (OR: 2.87; 95% CI: 2.15–3.84). Indigenous youth, especially males, drank alcohol and used marijuana at younger ages. Conclusion: Additional policies and programs are required to help Indigenous youth be successful in their attempts to quit smoking, and to address high rates of alcohol and marijuana use. ? 2019, Public Health Agency of Canada.

"The Cumulative Incidence of Self-Reported Suicide-Related Thoughts and Attempts in Young Canadians [L'incidence cumulative des id?es suicidaires et des tentatives de suicide auto-d?clar?es chez les jeunes canadiens]","2019","Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence of self-reported suicide-related thoughts (SRTs) and suicide attempts (SAs) in males and females from 11 to 25 years of age in Canada. Methods: A cohort study was conducted by linking cycles 2 to 8 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a representative survey of Canadians aged 11 to 25 years conducted from 1996 to 2009. The 11- to 25-year cumulative incidence of self-reported SRTs and SAs (with suicidal intent) was estimated in males and females using a novel application of a counting process approach to account for discontinuous risk intervals between survey cycles. Results: The risk of SRTs was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26% to 31%) in females and 19% (95% CI, 16% to 23%) in males. The risk of SAs was 16% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) in females and 7% (95% CI, 6% to 8%) in males. Over 70% of SRTs and SAs first occur between 11 and 16 years of age and 30% between 11 and 13 years of age, respectively. Conclusions: The risk of SRTs and SAs is high in young Canadians, with most events first occurring in early to mid-adolescence and possibly earlier. Females are at a higher risk compared to males. This research underscores the need for better longitudinal surveillance of SRTs and SAs in the population. A counting process framework could be useful for future research using existing longitudinal surveys suffering from design limitations relating to gaps in respondent follow-up. Furthermore, these findings have implications for younger SRT and SA risk management by clinicians and earlier implementation of suicide prevention programs. ?

"Recommendations for ototoxicity surveillance for childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors: a report from the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group in collaboration with the PanCare Consortium","2019","Childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors treated with platinum-based drugs, head or brain radiotherapy, or both have an increased risk of ototoxicity (hearing loss, tinnitus, or both). To ensure optimal care and reduce consequent problems—such as speech and language, social–emotional development, and learning difficulties—for these CAYA cancer survivors, clinical practice guidelines for monitoring ototoxicity are essential. The implementation of surveillance across clinical settings is hindered by differences in definitions of hearing loss, recommendations for surveillance modalities, and remediation. To address these deficiencies, the International Guideline Harmonization Group organised an international multidisciplinary panel, including 32 experts from ten countries, to evaluate the quality of evidence for ototoxicity following platinum-based chemotherapy and head or brain radiotherapy, and formulate and harmonise ototoxicity surveillance recommendations for CAYA cancer survivors. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","amifostine; carboplatin; cisplatin; oxaliplatin; adolescent; adult; brain radiation; cancer chemotherapy; cancer survivor; child; consensus; disease surveillance; evidence based medicine; hearing impairment; human; language therapy; medical history; medical specialist; ototoxicity; patient referral; practice guideline; priority journal; pure tone audiometry; radiation dose; Review; risk factor; speech therapy; tinnitus; tympanometry; young adult"
"Effect of Perioperative Nutritional Supplementation on Postoperative Complications—Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","Background: Perioperative carbohydrate loading, increased protein intake, and immunonutrition may decrease postoperative complications. Studies on the topic have led to controversial results. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up to August 2018 for randomized trials comparing the effect of perioperative nutritional supplements (intervention) versus control on postoperative complications in patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Secondary outcomes included infectious complications and length of hospital stay (LOS). Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled risk ratio (RR) of treatment effects. Pooled mean difference (MD) was used to compare LOS. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analysis by nutritional supplementation protocol, type of surgery, and type of nutritional supplement. Risk of bias and quality of the evidence were assessed. Results: Of 3951 articles, we identified 56 trials (n = 6370). Perioperative nutrition was associated with a lower risk of postoperative complications (RR 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69–0.80); postoperative infections (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64–0.79, n = 4582); and postoperative non-infectious complications (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71–0.87, n = 4883). There were no significant heterogeneity outcomes analyzed (I2?= 14%, 1%, and 7%, respectively). LOS was shorter for the intervention group, MD ? 1.58?days; 95% CI ? 1.83 to ? 1.32; I2?= 89%). Subgroup analysis did not identify sources of heterogeneity. The quality of evidence for postoperative complications was high and for LOS was moderate. Conclusion: Perioperative nutritional optimization decreases the risk of postoperative infectious and non-infectious complications. It also decreases LOS in patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery, but these findings should be taken with caution given the high heterogeneity. ? 2019, The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.",""

"Improving access to community-based pulmonary rehabilitation: 3R protocol for real-world settings with cost-benefit analysis","2019","Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has demonstrated patients' physiological and psychosocial improvements, symptoms reduction and health-economic benefits whilst enhances the ability of the whole family to adjust to illness. However, PR remains highly inaccessible due to lack of awareness of its benefits, poor referral and availability mostly in hospitals. Novel models of PR delivery are needed to enhance its implementation while maintaining cost-efficiency. We aim to implement an innovative community-based PR programme and assess its cost-benefit. Methods: A 12-week community-based PR will be implemented in primary healthcare centres where programmes are not available. Healthcare professionals will be trained. 73 patients with CRD and their caregivers (dyads patient-caregivers) will compose the experimental group. The control group will include dyads age- and disease-matched willing to collaborate in data collection but not in PR. Patients/family-centred outcomes will be dyspnoea (modified Medical Research Council Questionnaire), fatigue (Checklist of individual strength and Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy - fatigue), cough and sputum (Leicester cough questionnaire and Cough and sputum assessment questionnaire), impact of the disease (COPD Assessment Test), emotional state (The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), number of exacerbations, healthcare utilisation, health-related quality of life and family adaptability/cohesion (Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale). Other clinical outcomes will be peripheral (biceps and quadriceps-hand held dynamometer, 1 or 10 repetition-maximum) and respiratory (maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures) muscle strength, muscle thickness and cross sectional area (biceps brachialis, rectus femoris and diaphragm-ultrasound imaging), exercise capacity (six-minute walk test and one-minute sit to stand test), balance (brief-balance evaluation systems test) and physical activity (accelerometer). Data will be collected at baseline, at 12 weeks, at 3- and 6-months post-PR. Changes in the outcome measures will be compared between groups, after multivariate adjustment for possible confounders, and effect sizes will be calculated. A cost-benefit analysis will be conducted. Discussion: This study will enhance patients access to PR, by training healthcare professionals in the local primary healthcare centres to conduct such programmes and actively involving caregivers. The cost-benefit analysis of this intervention will provide an evidence-based insight into the economic benefit of community-based PR in chronic respiratory diseases.

"Exploring the factors associated with non-urgent emergency department utilisation for mental health care","2019","Background: Emergency department visits for mental health care are on the rise across North America. Patients with mental illness are at an increased risk for frequent and non-urgent emergency department visitation. Aims: The purpose of this study was to examine the independent predictors of non-urgent emergency department use for mental health care. Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted with archived data provided by the Erie St. Clair Local Health Integration Network in Ontario. Results: A total of 13,114 mental health-related emergency department visits were analysed using logistic regression with generalised estimating equations modelling. The findings suggest the following characteristics are predictive of non-urgent emergency department use for mental health care: age, season, time of day, access to primary health care, mode of arrival, hospital type, referral source and patient diagnosis. Conclusions: The findings of this study can be utilised to assist clinicians and policy makers in identifying and managing patients using the emergency department for non-urgent mental health care. ?

"The contribution of multiparametric pelvic and whole-body MRI to interpretation of 18F-fluoromethylcholine or 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy","2019","Our purpose was to assess whether the addition of data from multiparametric pelvic MRI (mpMR) and whole-body MRI (wbMR) to the interpretation of 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FCH) or 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA) PET/CT (5PET) improves the detection of local tumor recurrence or of nodal and distant metastases in patients after radical prostatectomy with biochemical failure. Methods: The current analysis was performed as part of a prospective, multicenter trial on 18F-FCH or 68Ga-PSMA PET, mpMR, and wbMR. Eligible men had an elevated level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (.0.2 ng/mL) and high-risk features (Gleason score . 7, PSA doubling time, 10 mo, or PSA . 1.0 ng/mL) with negative or equivocal conventional imaging results. PET was interpreted with mpMR and wbMR in consensus by 2 radiologists and compared with prospective interpretation of PET or MRI alone. Performance measures of each modality (PET, MRI, and PET/mpMR-wbMR) were compared for each radiotracer and each individual patient (for 18F-FCH, or 68Ga-PSMA for patients who had 68Ga-PSMA PET) and to a composite reference standard. Results: There were 86 patients with PET (18F-FCH [n 5 76] and/or 68Ga-PSMA [n 5 26]) who had mpMR and wbMR. Local tumor recurrence was detected in 20 of 76 (26.3%) on 18F-FCH PET/ mpMR, versus 11 of 76 (14.5%) on 18F-FCH PET (P 5 0.039), and in 11 of 26 (42.3%) on 68Ga-PSMA PET/mpMR, versus 6 of 26 (23.1%) on 68Ga-PSMA PET (P 5 0.074). Per patient, PET/ mpMR was more often positive for local tumor recurrence than PET (P 5 0.039) or mpMR (P 5 0.019). There were 20 of 86 patients (23.3%) with regional nodal metastases on both PET/wbMR and PET (P 5 1.0) but only 12 of 86 (14%) on wbMR (P 5 0.061). Similarly, there were more nonregional metastases detected on PET/wbMR than on PET (P 5 0.683) or wbMR (P 5 0.074), but these differences did not reach significance. Compared with the composite reference standard for the detection of disease beyond the prostatic fossa, PET/wbMR, PET, and wbMR had sensitivity of 50%, 50%, and 8.3%, respectively, and specificity of 97.1%, 97.1%, and 94.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Interpretation of PET/mpMR resulted in a higher detection rate for local tumor recurrence in the prostatic bed in men with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy. However, the addition of wbMR to 18F-FCH or 68Ga-PSMA PET did not improve detection of regional or distant metastases.

"Impact of a structured, group-based running programme on clinical, cognitive and social function in youth and adults with complex mood disorders: A 12-week pilot study","2019","Background Individuals with mood disorders often report lingering health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and social and cognitive impairments even after mood symptoms have improved. Exercise programmes improve mood symptoms in patients, but whether exercise improves functional outcomes in patients with difficult-to-treat mood disorders remains unknown. Design We evaluated the impact of a 12-week structured running programme on cognitive, social and quality-of-life outcomes in participants with difficult-to-treat mood disorders. Methods In a prospective, open-label study, patients referred to the St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton Team Unbreakable running programme for youth and adults with mood disorders completed a comprehensive assessment battery before and after the 12-week exercise intervention. Results We collected preintervention and postintervention data from 18 participants who improved on the general health, vitality, role of emotions, social functioning and mental health (all p?0.01) HRQOL subscales. Performance improved on cognitive tests that assessed working memory and processing speed (p?0.04); there were no improvements in complex executive functioning tasks. Regression analyses indicated that younger age, shorter illness duration and reduced bodily pain predicted social and cognitive outcomes.

"Synergy of Dual Pathway Inhibition in Chronic Cardiovascular Disease","2019","Although acetylsalicylic acid is of proven benefit for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease, the risk of recurrent ischemic events remains high. Intensification of antithrombotic therapy with more potent antiplatelet drugs, dual antiplatelet therapy, or vitamin K antagonists further reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with acetylsalicylic acid alone but increases the risk of bleeding without reducing mortality. In patients with prior coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial revealed that compared with acetylsalicylic acid alone, dual pathway inhibition with low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice-daily), an oral factor Xa inhibitor, plus acetylsalicylic acid reduced major adverse cardiovascular event by 24%, major adverse limb events by 47%, and mortality by 18%. Major bleeding was increased by 70%, but there was no increase in fatal or intracranial bleeding. This article (1) reviews the results of the COMPASS trial, (2) explains why dual pathway inhibition is superior to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy alone, (3) compares the results with rivaroxaban plus aspirin with those with other antithrombotic regimens, and (4) provides insight into how best to apply the COMPASS results into practice.","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; fibrinolytic agent; rivaroxaban; aged; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; chronic disease; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; complication; controlled study; coronary artery disease; female; heart infarction; human; male; methodology; middle aged; peripheral occlusive artery disease; phase 3 clinical trial; procedures; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; secondary prevention; Aged; Anticoagulants; Aspirin; Atrial Fibrillation; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chronic Disease; Coronary Artery Disease; Drug Therapy, Combination; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Recurrence; Research Design; Rivaroxaban; Secondary Prevention; Stroke"
"Knowledge gap of peripheral artery disease starts in medical school","2019","Objective: Previous data suggest that physicians have suboptimal knowledge about peripheral artery disease (PAD). Our aim was to evaluate Canadian medical students' knowledge of PAD to determine if this knowledge gap exists early in medical training. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, interview-based study of graduating medical students at the University of Toronto. We used a standardized questionnaire to evaluate students' knowledge of PAD and coronary artery disease (CAD) in the following domains: clinical presentation, risk factors, preventative measures, treatment, and complications. We calculated mean (standard deviation [SD]) scores for each CAD and PAD knowledge domain and examined for differences in PAD vs CAD scores. Results: Seventy-two graduating medical students participated in this study, of which females accounted for 58%. Nearly all participants reported being exposed to PAD (89%) and CAD (92%) through their medical school curriculum. Overall, medical students scored better in identifying CAD characteristics (mean [SD] score, 16.4 [2.7]) compared with PAD (mean [SD] score, 14.6 [3.2]) (P < .0001). This difference was driven by the inferior performance of students in identifying risk factors (P < .0001), preventative measures (P = .049), and complications (P < .0001) of PAD compared with CAD. Out-of-class exposure (eg, clinical rotation, research experience) had a positive impact on students knowledge of both PAD and CAD. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate suboptimal knowledge of medical graduates of both CAD and PAD. Although they share common atherosclerotic risk factors and cardiovascular complications, medical students were less likely to associate these with PAD than CAD. We recommend a comprehensive module that incorporates all presentations of atherosclerotic disorders to enhance students' understanding of these pathologies in medical schools. ? 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery","acetylsalicylic acid; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; Article; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; coronary artery disease; cross-sectional study; diabetes control; diaphoresis; dyspnea; faintness; fatigue; female; heart failure; heart infarction; human; hypertension; interview; jaw pain; knowledge; lifestyle modification; male; medical education; medical school; medical student; nausea and vomiting; neck pain; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; smoking cessation; thorax pain; attitude to health; comparative study; coronary artery disease; curriculum; education; educational status; Ontario; pathophysiology; peripheral occlusive artery disease; psychology; university; Coronary Artery Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Ontario; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Students, Medical; Universities"
"The selection of comparators for randomized controlled trials of health-related behavioral interventions: recommendations of an NIH expert panel","2019","Objectives: To provide recommendations for the selection of comparators for randomized controlled trials of health-related behavioral interventions. Study Design and Setting: The National Institutes of Health Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research convened an expert panel to critically review the literature on control or comparison groups for behavioral trials and to develop strategies for improving comparator choices and for resolving controversies and disagreements about comparators. Results: The panel developed a Pragmatic Model for Comparator Selection in Health-Related Behavioral Trials. The model indicates that the optimal comparator is the one that best serves the primary purpose of the trial but that the optimal comparator's limitations and barriers to its use must also be taken into account. Conclusion: We developed best practice recommendations for the selection of comparators for health-related behavioral trials. Use of the Pragmatic Model for Comparator Selection in Health-Related Behavioral Trials can improve the comparator selection process and help resolve disagreements about comparator choices. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","behavioral research; controlled study; health behavior; human; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial; review"
"Organisational best practices towards gender equality in science and medicine","2019","In August 2018, the president of the World Bank noted that “‘Human capital’—the potential of individuals—is going to be the most important long-term investment any country can make for its people's future prosperity and quality of life”. Nevertheless, leaders and practitioners in academic science and medicine continue to be unaware of and poorly educated about the nature, extent, and impact of barriers to full participation of women and minorities in science and medicine around the world. This lack of awareness and education results in failures to fully mobilise the human capital of half the population and limits global technological and medical advancements. The chronic lack of recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in science and medicine is due to systemic, structural, organisational, institutional, cultural, and societal barriers to equity and inclusion. These barriers must be identified and removed through increased awareness of the challenges combined with evidence-based, data-driven approaches leading to measurable targets and outcomes. In this Review, we discuss these issues and highlight actions that could achieve gender equality in science and medicine. We survey approaches and insights that have helped to identify and remove systemic bias and barriers in science and medicine, and propose tools that will help organisational change toward gender equality. We describe tools that include formal legislation and mandated quotas at national or large-scale levels (eg, gender parity), techniques that increase fairness (eg, gender equity) through facilitated organisational cultural change at institutional levels, and professional development of core competencies at individual levels. This Review is not intended to be an extensive analysis of all the literature currently available on achieving gender equality in academic medicine and science, but rather, a reflection on finding multifactorial solutions. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; awareness; female; gender; human; human experiment; law; male; parity; professional development; review; career mobility; decision making; leadership; medicine; organization; prevention and control; science; sexism; women's rights; Career Choice; Career Mobility; Female; Humans; Leadership; Medicine; Organizational Innovation; Organizational Objectives; Science; Sexism; Women's Rights"
"ACR Appropriateness Criteria ? Clinically Suspected Adnexal Mass, No Acute Symptoms","2019","There are approximately 9.1 pelvic surgeries performed for every histologically confirmed adnexal malignancy in the United States, compared to 2.3 surgeries per malignancy (in oncology centers) and 5.9 surgeries per malignancy (in other centers) in Europe. An important prognostic factor in the long-term survival in patients with ovarian malignancy is the initial management by a gynecological oncologist. With high accuracy of imaging for adnexal mass characterization and consequent appropriate triage to subspecialty referral, the better use of gynecologic oncology can improve treatment outcomes. Ultrasound, including transabdominal, transvaginal, and duplex ultrasound, combined with MRI with contrast can diagnose adnexal masses as benign with specific features (ie, functional masses, dermoid, endometrioma, fibroma, pedunculated fibroid, hydrosalpinx, peritoneal inclusion cyst, Tarlov cyst), malignant, or indeterminate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment. ? 2019 American College of Radiology","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adnexa disease; Article; color Doppler flowmetry; contrast-enhanced ultrasound; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; symptom; transvaginal echography"
"Factors Influencing Resident Satisfaction and Fellowship Selection in Orthopaedic Training Programs: An American Orthopaedic Association North American Traveling Fellowship Project","2019","Background:There is limited literature available about educational satisfaction and fellowship selection among orthopaedic surgery residents. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence resident subspecialty career choice, fellowship selection, and satisfaction with orthopaedic training programs.Methods:A self-report survey was electronically administered to orthopaedic surgery residents at 44 academic centers in the United States and Canada. Basic demographic information and level of satisfaction with a number of factors (surgical independence, mentorship opportunities, etc.) were evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ""excellent"" to ""poor."" Summary statistics and group differences for discrete variables were compared with use of a chi-square test.Results:Of the 283 respondents, 77% rated residency program satisfaction as ""very good"" or ""excellent,"" and 93% said they would choose the same training program again. Decreased surgical independence (p < 0.01), poor faculty reputation (p < 0.01), reduced volume and variety of cases (p < 0.01), inadequate mentorship (p < 0.01), and reduced educational opportunities (p < 0.01) were associated with low satisfaction. Surgical variety and job opportunities were the top 2 factors contributing to subspecialty choice. Sports medicine and joints were the most popular career choices; case volume, surgical variety, and program reputation were the top factors contributing to fellowship program selection.Conclusions:In order to achieve resident satisfaction, orthopaedic training programs should strive to improve resident surgical independence, surgical case variety, mentorship programs, faculty reputation, and educational opportunities. Important factors for fellowship program selection include case volume, surgical variety, and overall program reputation. ? 2019 BY THE JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY, INCORPORATED.","adult; article; Canada; controlled study; decision making; female; human; human experiment; joint; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; mentor; multicenter study; orthopedic surgery; resident; satisfaction; self report; sports medicine; training; travel; United States; decision making; education; medical education; orthopedics; Adult; Canada; Career Choice; Fellowships and Scholarships; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Orthopedics; Personal Satisfaction; Self Report; United States"

Ten countries and 12 universities were represented. Transcripts from semi-structured interviews were analysed for themes using a descriptive approach. There was unanimous support for the need for faculty development tools and resources, particularly in teaching skills. Most programmes lacked formal structure or funding. A consistently identified concept was how to teach specialist faculty the FM context, as was the importance of FM perspective to inform government policies. The need for faculty development of FM in LMICs is strong. FM faculty development resources can be expanded and shared through global health networks. Further expansion of faculty development workshops and toolkits is recommended.

"Diagnosis of possible' mitochondrial disease: An existential crisis","2019","Primary genetic mitochondrial diseases are often difficult to diagnose, and the term possible' mitochondrial disease is used frequently by clinicians when such a diagnosis is suspected. There are now many known phenocopies of mitochondrial disease. Advances in genomic testing have shown that some patients with a clinical phenotype and biochemical abnormalities suggesting mitochondrial disease may have other genetic disorders. In instances when a genetic diagnosis cannot be confirmed, a diagnosis of possible' mitochondrial disease may result in harm to patients and their families, creating anxiety, delaying appropriate diagnosis and leading to inappropriate management or care. A categorisation of diagnosis uncertain', together with a specific description of the metabolic or genetic abnormalities identified, is preferred when a mitochondrial disease cannot be genetically confirmed. ?

"A mobility-focused knowledge translation randomized controlled trial to improve physical activity: Process evaluation of the MoVe4Age study","2019","Background: Maintaining physical activity and physical function is important for healthy aging. We recently completed a randomized controlled trial of a targeted knowledge translation (KT) intervention delivered through the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal with the goal to increase physical activity and physical mobility in middle-aged and older adults, with results reported elsewhere. Objective: The purpose of this process evaluation study is to explore which KT strategies were used by both intervention and control group participants, as well as the intervention groups’ engagement, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the targeted KT intervention. Methods: Data on engagement with the intervention materials were gathered quantitatively through Google Analytics and Hootsuite throughout the intervention. Qualitative data were collected through a combination of open-ended surveys and qualitative interviews with a subset of participants at the end of the study to further understand engagement, satisfaction, and usefulness of the KT strategies. Results: Throughout the intervention period, engagement with content delivered through weekly emails was highest, and participants rated email content most favorably in both surveys and interviews. Participants were generally satisfied with the intervention, noting the ease of participating and the distillation of information in an easy-to-access format being beneficial features. Participants who did not find the intervention useful were those with already high levels of baseline physical activity or physical function and those who were looking for more specific or individualized content. Conclusions: This process evaluation provides insight into our randomized controlled trial findings and provides information that can be used to improve future online KT interventions. ?Sarah E Neil-Sztramko, Jenna Smith-Turchyn, Julie Richardson, Maureen Dobbins.","aged; article; controlled study; distillation; e-mail; evaluation study; female; human; interview; male; medical information; physical activity; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial; satisfaction"
"Reporting quality of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa: A systematic analysis","2019","The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic analysis of the reporting quality of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa from 2014–2018 using the Modified STROBE statement. We included studies on the 2014 EVD outbreak alone, limited to those on human patients in Africa. We searched the following databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science) for outbreak reports published between 2014–2018. We assessed factors potentially associated with the quality of reporting. A total of 69 of 131 (53%) articles within the full-text review fulfilled our eligibility criteria and underwent the Modified STROBE assessment for analyzing the quality of reporting. The Modified STROBE scores of the included studies ranged from 11–26 points and the mean was found to be 19.54 out of 30 with a standard deviation (SD) of ± 4.30. The top three reported Modified STROBE components were descriptive characteristics of study participants, scientific background and evidence rational, and clinical significance of observations. More than 75% of the studies met a majority of the criteria in the Modified STROBE assessment tool. Information that was commonly missing included addressing potential source of bias, sensitivity analysis, further results/analysis such as risk estimates and odds ratios, presence of a flowchart, and addressing missing data. In multivariable analysis, peer-reviewed publication was the only predictor that remained significantly associated with a higher Modified STROBE score. In conclusion, the large range of Modified STROBE scores observed indicates variability in the quality of outbreak reports for EVD. The review identified strong reporting in some areas, whereas other areas are in need of improvement, in particular providing an important description of the outbreak setting and identifying any external elements (potential biases and confounding factors) that could hinder the credibility of the findings. ? 2019 Huynh et al.

"Toward a Centralized, Systematic Approach to the Identification, Appraisal, and Use of Health State Utility Values for Reimbursement Decision Making: Introducing the Health Utility Book (HUB)","2019","Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is a widely recommended form of health economic evaluation worldwide. The outcome measure in CUA is quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which are calculated using health state utility values (HSUVs) and corresponding life-years. Therefore, HSUVs play a significant role in determining cost-effectiveness. Formal adoption and endorsement of CUAs by reimbursement authorities motivates methodological advancement in HSUV measurement and application. A large body of evidence exploring various methods in measuring HSUVs has accumulated, imposing challenges for investigators in identifying and applying HSUVs to CUAs. First, large variations in HSUVs between studies are often reported, and these may lead to different cost-effectiveness conclusions. Second, issues concerning the quality of studies that generate HSUVs are increasingly highlighted in the literature. This issue is compounded by the limited published guidance and methodological standards for assessing the quality of these studies. Third, reimbursement decision making is a context-specific process. Therefore, while an HSUV study may be of high quality, it is not necessarily appropriate for use in all reimbursement jurisdictions. To address these issues, by promoting a systematic approach to study identification, critical appraisal, and appropriate use, we are developing the Health Utility Book (HUB). The HUB consists of an HSUV registry, a quality assessment tool for health utility studies, and a checklist for interpreting their use in CUAs. We anticipate that the HUB will make a timely and important contribution to the rigorous conduct and proper use of health utility studies for reimbursement decision making. In this way, health care resource allocation informed by HSUVs may reflect the preferences of the public, improve health outcomes of patients, and maintain the efficiency of health care systems. ?

"""Maybe if i stop the drugs, then maybe they'd care?"" - Hospital care experiences of people who use drugs","2019","Background: Drug use is associated with increased morbidity and mortality but people who use drugs experience significant barriers to care. Data are needed about the care experiences of people who use drugs to inform interventions and quality improvement initiatives. The objective of this study is to describe and characterize the experience of acute care for people who use drugs. Methods: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study. We recruited people with a history of active drug use at the time of an admission to an acute care hospital, who were living with HIV or hepatitis C, in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. Data were collected in 2014 and 2015 through semi-structured interviews, audio-recorded and transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Results: Twenty-four adults (18 men, 6 women) participated. Participants predominantly recounted experiences of stigma and challenges accessing care. We present the identified themes in two overarching domains of interest: perceived effect of drug use on hospital care and impact of care experiences on future healthcare interactions. Participants described significant barriers to pain management, often resulting in inconsistent and inadequate pain management. They described various strategies to navigate access and receipt of healthcare from being ""an easy patient"" to self-advocacy. Negative experiences influenced their willingness to seek care, often resulting in delayed care seeking and targeting of certain hospitals. Conclusion: Drug use was experienced as a barrier at all stages of hospital care. Interventions to decrease stigma and improve our consistency and approach to pain management are necessary to improve the quality of care and care experiences of those who use drugs. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; analgesia; Article; Canada; clinical article; drug abuse; emergency care; female; health care access; help seeking behavior; hepatitis C; hospital care; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; patient advocacy; patient attitude; people who use drug; qualitative research; social discrimination; social stigma"
"Predictors of imminent non-vertebral fracture in elderly women with osteoporosis, low bone mass, or a history of fracture, based on data from the population-based Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos)","2019","Summary: Using data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, several risk factors predictive of imminent (2-year) risk of low-trauma non-vertebral fracture among high-risk women were identified, including history of falls, history of low-trauma fracture, poorer physical function, and lower T score. Careful consideration should be given to targeting this population for therapy. Purpose: Fracture risk assessment has focused on a long-term horizon and populations with a broad risk range. For elderly women with osteoporosis or low bone mass, or a history of fragility fractures (“high-risk women”), risk prediction over a shorter horizon may have greater clinical relevance. Methods: A repeated-observations design and data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study were employed. Study population comprised women aged ? 65?years with T score (total hip, femoral neck, spine) ? ? 1.0 or prior fracture. Hazard ratios (HR) for predictors of low-trauma non-vertebral fracture during 2-year follow-up were estimated using multivariable shared frailty model. Results: The study population included 3228 women who contributed 5004 observations; 4.8% experienced low-trauma non-vertebral fracture during the 2-year follow-up. In bivariate analyses, important risk factors included age, back pain, history of falls, history of low-trauma fracture, physical function, health status, and total hip T score. In multivariable analyses, only four independent predictors were identified: falls in past 12?months (? 2 falls: HR = 1.9; 1 fall: HR = 1.5), low-trauma fracture in past 12?months (? 1 fracture: HR = 1.7), SF-36 physical component summary score (? 42.0: HR = 1.6), and total hip T score (? ? 3.5: HR = 3.7; > ? 3.5 to ? ? 2.5: HR = 2.5; > ? 2.5 to ? ? 1: HR = 1.3). Conclusions: Imminent risk of low-trauma non-vertebral fracture is elevated among high-risk women with a history of falls or low-trauma fracture, poorer physical function, and lower T score. Careful consideration should be given to identifying and targeting this population for therapy. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","age; aged; Article; backache; bone mass; Canada; falling; female; femoral neck; forearm fracture; fracture; fragility fracture; geriatric patient; high risk population; hip fracture; human; humerus fracture; major clinical study; medical history; osteoporosis; physical inactivity; population research; priority journal; retrospective study; rib fracture; risk assessment; risk factor; Short Form 36; spine fracture; very elderly; wrist fracture"
"Predictors of Recurrent Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Embolic Strokes of Undetermined Source and Effects of Rivaroxaban Versus Aspirin According to Risk Status: The NAVIGATE ESUS Trial","2019","Background: Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) identifies patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke presumed due to embolism from several unidentified sources. Among patients with recent ESUS, we sought to determine independent predictors of recurrent ischemic stroke during treatment with aspirin or rivaroxaban and to assess the relative effects of these treatments according to risk. Methods: Exploratory analyses of 7213 participants in the NAVIGATE ESUS international trial who were randomized to aspirin 100 mg/day or rivaroxaban 15 mg/day and followed for a median of 11 months, during which time there were 309 first recurrent ischemic strokes (4.6% per year). Baseline features were correlated with recurrent stroke by multivariate analysis. Results: The 7 independent predictors of recurrent stroke were stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) prior to the qualifying stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03 95% confidence internal [CI] 1.58-2.60), current tobacco user (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.12), age (HR 1.02 per year increase, 95%CI 1.01-1.03), diabetes (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.64), multiple acute infarcts on neuroimaging (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09-2.02), aspirin use prior to qualifying stroke (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02-1.70), and time from qualifying stroke to randomization (HR .98, 95% CI .97-.99). The rate of recurrent stroke rate was 2.6% per year for participants without any of these risk factors, and increased by an average of 45% for each independent predictor (P < .001). There were no significant interactions between treatment effects and independent stroke predictors or stroke risk status. Conclusions: In this large cohort of ESUS patients, several features including prior stroke or TIA, advanced age, current tobacco user, multiple acute infarcts on neuroimaging, and diabetes independently identified those with an increased risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. The relative effects of rivaroxaban and aspirin were similar across the spectrum of independent stroke predictors and recurrent stroke risk status. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","acetylsalicylic acid; rivaroxaban; acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; rivaroxaban; aged; algorithm; aortic valve disease; artery occlusion; Article; autopsy; body mass; brain infarction; brain ischemia; Canada; cerebrovascular accident; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug effect; East Asian; Eastern Europe; embolic strokes of undetermined source; embolic strokes of undetermined source; Europe; exploratory factor analysis; female; follow up; human; hypertension; life history trait; major clinical study; male; mitral valve disease; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neuroimaging; North America; patent foramen ovale; phase 3 clinical trial; prediction; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; risk factor; South and Central America; stroke patient; systolic blood pressure; tobacco; transesophageal echocardiography; transient ischemic attack; United States; Western Europe; brain embolism; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; comparative study; middle aged; multicenter study; recurrent disease; risk assessment; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Anticoagulants; Aspirin; Brain Ischemia; Double-Blind Method; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Intracranial Embolism; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Rivaroxaban; Stroke; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccine in patients with heart failure to reduce adverse vascular events (IVVE): Rationale and design","2019","Background: Influenza is associated with an increase in the risk of cardiac and other vascular events. Observational data and small randomized trials suggest that influenza vaccination may reduce such adverse vascular events. Research Design and Methods: In a randomized controlled trial patients with heart failure are randomized to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine or placebo annually for 3 years. Patients aged ?18 years with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure and NYHA functional class II, III and IV are eligible. Five thousand patients from 10 countries where influenza vaccination is not common (Asia, the Middle East, and Africa) have been enrolled. The primary outcome is a composite of the following: cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and hospitalizations for heart failure using standardized criteria. Analyses will be based on comparing event rates between influenza vaccine and control groups and will include time to event, rate comparisons using Poisson methods, and logistic regression. The analysis will be conducted by intention to treat i.e. patients will be analyzed in the group in which they were assigned. Multivariable secondary analyses to assess whether variables such as age, sex, seasonality modify the benefits of vaccination are also planned for the primary outcome. Conclusion: This is the largest randomized trial to test if influenza vaccine compared to control reduces adverse vascular events in high risk individuals.

"Improvement in staff behavior during surgical procedures to prevent post-operative complications (ARIBO2): Study protocol for a cluster randomised trial","2019","Background: Inappropriate staff behaviour during surgical procedures may disrupt the surgical performance and compromise patient safety. We developed an innovative monitoring and feedback system combined with an adaptive approach to optimise staff behaviour intraoperatively and prevent post-operative complications (POC) in orthopaedic surgery. Methods/design: This protocol describes a parallel-group, cluster randomised, controlled trial with orthopaedic centre as the unit of randomisation. The intervention period will last 6 months and will be based on the monitoring of two surrogates of staff behaviour: the frequency of doors opening and the level of noise. Both will be collected from incision to wound closure, using wireless sensors and sonometers, and recorded and analysed on a dedicated platform (Livepulse?). Staff from centres randomised to the intervention arm will be informed in real time on their own data through an interactive dashboard available in each operating room (OR), and a posteriori for hip and knee replacement POC. Aggregated data from all centres will also be displayed for benchmarking. A lean method will be applied in each centre by a local multidisciplinary team to analyse baseline situations, determine the target condition, analyse the root cause(s), and take countermeasures. The education and awareness of participants on the impact of their behaviour on patient safety will assist the quality improvement process. The control centres will be blinded to monitoring data and quality improvement approaches. The primary outcome will be any POC occurring during the 30 days post operation. We will evaluate this outcome using local and national routinely collected data from hospital discharge and disease databases. Thirty orthopaedic centres will be randomised for a total of 9945 hip and knee replacement surgical procedures. Discussion: The field of human factors and behaviour in the OR seems to offer potential room for improvement. An intervention providing goal-setting, monitoring, feedback and action planning may reduce the traffic flow and interruptions/distractions of the surgical team during procedures, preventing subsequent POCs. The results of this trial will provide important data on the impact of OR staff behaviour on patient safety, and promote best practice during surgical procedures.

"Degree of Conjugate Gaze Deviation on CT Predicts Proximal Vessel Occlusion and May Expedite Endovascular Therapy","2019","Purpose: Recent trials have demonstrated superior outcomes with combination IV-tPA and endovascular therapy (EVT) within 6 hours of symptom onset in patients with proximal vessel occlusion (ICA, M1, or proximal M1/M2) compared to IV-tPA alone. The current standard of diagnosis for consideration of EVT is CT angiogram (CTA). Unfortunately, not all hospitals are equipped with CTA, and the decision to transfer to tertiary centers is often based on nonenhanced CT. Ipsilateral conjugate gaze deviation (CGD) is associated with worse outcomes and larger infarcts in acute ischemic stroke. We predicted that the more proximal the occlusion, the higher the degree of CGD. Materials and Methods: Over a period of 12 months, 182 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke treated at our institution were prospectively analyzed. Stroke locations were categorized based on CTA. Average degree of CGD was measured. Patient demographics, ASPECTS, collateral score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale, TICI score, length-of-stay, and mortality were collected. The median follow-up was 30 days. Results: Out of ninety one of 182 patients with (+) CGD, 82 (90%) patients had ICA or middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarcts. The median was 25.0° in those with proximal occlusion and 13.7° in those with distal MCA occlusion (P <.001). A higher degree of CGD is positively correlated with proximity of vessel occlusion (correlation coefficient 0.2; P <.05). A cut-off greater than 20.25° (area under the curve =.76) showed a sensitivity of 64.0% and specificity 84.2%. Conclusions: Measuring degree of CGD may help in early identification of proximal vessel occlusions and expedite transfer for clot retrieval. ? 2018","tissue plasminogen activator; acute disease; adult; aged; artery occlusion; Article; brain ischemia; cerebral artery disease; clinical feature; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; follow up; gaze; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; posterior cerebral artery; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; proximal vessel occlusion; Rankin scale; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; brain angiography; brain circulation; carotid artery obstruction; cerebral artery disease; diagnostic imaging; disability; early diagnosis; endovascular surgery; eye fixation; eye movement disorder; internal carotid artery; middle aged; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; risk factor; time to treatment; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carotid Artery, Internal; Carotid Stenosis; Cerebral Angiography; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Computed Tomography Angiography; Disability Evaluation; Early Diagnosis; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery; Male; Middle Aged; Ocular Motility Disorders; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time-to-Treatment"
"Health geographies II: The posthuman turn","2019","This report, the second of three, discusses the nature of a recent turn in health geography towards a posthuman theoretical orientation. This is an ontological turn that challenges basic categories leading to the understanding that health is not solely a human condition, but one created within assemblages of multiple human and nonhuman actors and forces. This is a turn concerned with the immediate and processual emergence of health, hence one that recognises the critical roles of pre-personal and more-than-representational events and forces. These facets are explored along with the extent to which the new ‘posthuman geography of health’ is a departure, and the forms of enquiry and ethics it brings forth. ?

"Exposure to caring parenting and adult mental health in extremely low birthweight survivors","2019","Aim: Individuals born at extremely low birthweight (ELBW; <1000 g) are exposed to early adversities that increase the risk of mental health problems in later life. Caring parenting has been shown to offset the negative effects of early adversity in general population samples. However, the long-term impact of caring parenting on the mental health of preterm survivors in adulthood is not known. Methods: Using data from the world's oldest longitudinally followed cohort of ELBW survivors (n = 179) and matched normal birthweight (NBW) control participants (n = 145), we examined if caring parenting moderated the link between preterm birth and mental health at 30–35 years of age. Participants reported on the parenting they received from their mothers using the parental bonding instrument. Self-esteem and internalising problems (i.e. depression, anxiety) were self-reported at 30–35 years of age using the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Young Adult Self-Report questionnaire, respectively. Results: A statistically significant interaction was found between birthweight status and caring maternal parenting on self-esteem and internalising psychopathology in adulthood. Stratified analyses demonstrated that caring parenting was associated with better self-esteem (P < 0.001) and lower levels of internalising symptoms (P = 0.001), but in NBW participants only. Conclusions: While the receipt of caring maternal parenting promoted mental health in adults born at NBW, it did not have the same protective effect on ELBW survivors. More research is needed to elucidate the aspects of parenting and the family environment that promote the long-term mental health of preterm survivors. ? 2019 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","adult; anxiety; Article; Canada; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; extremely low birth weight; female; human; long term care; longitudinal study; maternal behavior; maternal care; maternal exposure; mental health; parental behavior; population research; prematurity; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; school child; self esteem; self-concept assessment; Self-Esteem Inventory; Young Adult Self Report questionnaire"
"Investigation of the gut microbiome in patients with schizophrenia and clozapine-induced weight gain: Protocol and clinical characteristics of first patient cohorts","2020","Background: Emerging evidence suggests an important role of the human gut microbiome in psychiatry and neurodevelopmental disorders. An increasing body of literature based on animal studies has reported that the gut microbiome influences brain development and behavior by interacting with the gut-brain axis. Furthermore, as the gut microbiome has an important role in metabolism and is known to interact with pharmaceuticals, recent evidence suggests a role for the microbiome in antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects in animals and humans. Purpose: Here we present the protocol for a two-phase study investigating the gut microbiome in healthy controls and in patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics. Methods: Phase I of our study involves humans exclusively. We recruit 25 patients who are chronically treated with clozapine and compare them with 25 healthy controls matched for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status. A second cohort consists of 25 patients newly starting on clozapine, and a third cohort includes 25 antipsychotic-naive patients. The patients in the second cohort and third cohort are prospectively assessed for up to 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Phase II of this study will incorporate microbiota humanized mouse models to examine the influence of human fecal transplant on metabolic parameters and the gut-brain axis. Progress and Future Directions: We are underway with the first participants enrolled in all phase I treatment cohorts. This study will contribute to elucidating the role of the gut microbiome in schizophrenia and metabolic side effects. In addition, its results may help to explore potential therapeutic targets for antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. ? 2019 S.

"Cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture as an independent predictor of incident fracture risk in older women and men in the Bone Microarchitecture International Consortium (BoMIC): a prospective study","2019","Background: Although areal bone mineral density (aBMD) assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for determining fracture risk, most older adults who sustain a fracture have T scores greater than ?2·5 and thus do not meet the clinical criteria for osteoporosis. Importantly, bone fragility is due to low BMD and deterioration in bone structure. We assessed whether indices of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) were associated with fracture risk independently of femoral neck aBMD and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score. Methods: We assessed participants in eight cohorts from the USA (Framingham, Mayo Clinic), France (QUALYOR, STRAMBO, OFELY), Switzerland (GERICO), Canada (CaMos), and Sweden (MrOS). We used Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) to estimate the association between HR-pQCT bone indices (per 1 SD of deficit) and incident fracture, adjusting for age, sex, height, weight, and cohort, and then additionally for femoral neck DXA aBMD or FRAX. Findings: 7254 individuals (66% women and 34% men) were assessed. Mean baseline age was 69 years (SD 9, range 40–96). Over a mean follow-up of 4·63 years (SD 2·41) years, 765 (11%) participants had incident fractures, of whom 633 (86%) had femoral neck T scores greater than ?2·5. After adjustment for age, sex, cohort, height, and weight, peripheral skeleton failure load had the greatest association with risk of fracture: tibia HR 2·40 (95% CI 1·98–2·91) and radius 2·13 (1·77–2·56) per 1 SD decrease. HRs for other bone indices ranged from 1·12 (95% CI 1·03–1·23) per 1 SD increase in tibia cortical porosity to 1·58 (1·45–1·72) per 1 SD decrease in radius trabecular volumetric bone density. After further adjustment for femoral neck aBMD or FRAX score, the associations were reduced but remained significant for most bone parameters. A model including cortical volumetric bone density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness at the distal radius and a model including these indices plus cortical area at the tibia were the best predictors of fracture. Interpretation: HR-pQCT indices and failure load improved prediction of fracture beyond femoral neck aBMD or FRAX scores alone. Our findings from a large international cohort of men and women support previous reports that deficits in trabecular and cortical bone density and structure independently contribute to fracture risk. These measurements and morphological assessment of the peripheral skeleton might improve identification of people at the highest risk of fracture.

"Development of the summary of findings table for network meta-analysis","2019","Objectives: The aim of the study was to develop a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) summary of findings (SoF) table format that displays the critical information from a network meta-analysis (NMA). Study Design and Setting: We applied a user experience model for data analysis based on four rounds of semistructured interviews. Results: We interviewed 32 stakeholders who conduct or use MA. Four rounds of interviews produced six candidate NMA-SoF tables. Users found a final NMA-SoF table that included the following components highly acceptable: (1) details of the clinical question (PICO), (2) a plot depicting network geometry, (3) relative and absolute effect estimates, (4) certainty of evidence, (5) ranking of treatments, and (6) interpretation of findings. Conclusion: Using stakeholder feedback, we developed a new GRADE NMA-SoF table that includes the relevant components that facilitate understanding NMA findings and health decision-making. ? 2019","article; data analysis; decision making; geometry; human; meta analysis; network meta-analysis; semi structured interview"
"Cost-effectiveness analysis of secukinumab in ankylosing spondylitis from the Canadian perspective","2019","Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor secukinumab vs the currently licensed biologic therapies in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients from a Canadian healthcare system perspective. Methods: A decision analytic model (semi-Markov) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in a biologic-na?ve population, over 60 years of time horizon (lifetime). The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI 50) response rate was used to assess treatment response at week 12. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic therapy were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (short-term and long-term changes in BASDAI and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI], withdrawal rates, adverse events, costs, resource use, utilities, and disutilities) were obtained from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and benefits were discounted with an annual discount rate of 1.5% for all treatments. Results: In the biologic-na?ve population, secukinumab 150 mg dominated all comparators, as patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg achieved the highest QALYs (16.46) at the lowest cost (CAD 533,010) over a lifetime horizon vs comparators. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, results were most sensitive to changes in baseline BASFI non-responders, BASDAI 50 at 3 months and discount rates. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that secukinumab 150 mg demonstrated higher probability of achieving maximum net monetary benefit vs all comparators at various cost thresholds. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates that secukinumab 150 mg is the most cost-effective treatment option for biologic-na?ve AS patients compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar for a lifetime horizon in Canada.

"Crusted scabies in a renal transplant recipient treated with daily ivermectin: A case report and literature review","2019","Crusted scabies is a rare disease variant associated with T-cell dysregulation. Transplant patients are at risk of developing crusted scabies as a consequence of their immunosuppressive regimens. We report a case of crusted scabies presenting with recurrent septicemia in a 65-year-old renal transplant recipient, treated with daily ivermectin for 7?days after initial failure of weekly ivermectin dosing. A literature review of crusted scabies in transplant recipients consisting of 19 cases reports was summarized. Pruritus was common, and initial misdiagnosis was frequent. Most were treated with topical therapy, with one-third receiving ivermectin. Three of seven cases presenting with a concomitant infection died. Crusted scabies is commonly misdiagnosed in transplant recipients owing to its rarity, varied appearance, and different skin distributions. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of transplant recipients presenting with rash and pruritus, given its association with secondary infection and subsequent mortality. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"AGA Technical Review on the Evaluation of Functional Diarrhea and Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Adults (IBS-D)","2019","Background &amp; Aims: The evaluation of patients with chronic watery diarrhea represents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians because organic causes, including inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic colitis, and chronic infection, must be differentiated from functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the usefulness of diagnostic tests in such patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, from 1978 until April 2017. We included diagnostic test accuracy studies reporting on the use of fecal and blood tests for the evaluation of adult patients with functional diarrhea, including irritable bowel syndrome. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies II, and the certainty in the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity, and the proportion of patients with true and false positive and negative results. We evaluated the following tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fecal lactoferrin, fecal calprotectin, serologic tests for celiac disease, tests for bile acid diarrhea, the commercially available version of anti–cytolethal distending toxin B and anti-vinculin antibodies, and tests for Giardia infection. We did not evaluate breath tests for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as they are not part of a standard diarrhea workup. Results: Thirty-eight studies proved eligible to evaluate 1 or more of these tests. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were similar at discriminating organic from functional disease, with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 0.54–0.78 and 0.46–0.95 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 0.73 and 0.78 for C-reactive protein. Among fecal tests, fecal calprotectin in a range of 50–60 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.86; pooled specificity 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.92) and fecal lactoferrin in a range of 4.0–7.25 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73–0.84; pooled specificity 0.93; 95%CI 0.63–0.99) presented the lowest proportion of false-negative results (low certainty in the evidence). Among tests for celiac disease, IgA tissue transglutaminase presented the best diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity range, 0.79–0.99; specificity range, 0.90–0.99) with moderate certainty in the evidence. Among tests for bile acid diarrhea, the 75selenium homotaurocholic acid test performed better than serum fibroblast growth factor 19 and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, but is not available in the United States. There was insufficient evidence to recommend serologic tests for irritable bowel syndrome at this time. There are several good diagnostic tests for Giardia infection. Conclusions: Moderate to low certainty in the evidence indicates that available fecal and blood tests may play a role in the diagnostic workup of adult patients with functional diarrhea. At the moment, no tests are available to reliably rule in irritable bowel syndrome. ? 2019 AGA Institute","bile acid; C reactive protein; calgranulin; cytolethal distending toxin; gliadin; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; lactoferrin; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase; Article; celiac disease; cohort analysis; diarrhea; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; false negative result; false positive result; functional disease; giardiasis; human; infection; irritable colon; microscopic colitis; priority journal; Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies; sensitivity and specificity; serology; systematic review; chronic disease; complication; diarrhea; differential diagnosis; digestive system examination; evidence based medicine; gastroenterology; irritable colon; medical society; pathophysiology; practice guideline; predictive value; reproducibility; time factor; Chronic Disease; Diagnosis, Differential; Diagnostic Techniques, Digestive System; Diarrhea; Evidence-Based Medicine; Gastroenterology; Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Societies, Medical; Time Factors"
"How I manage anticoagulant therapy in older individuals with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism","2019","Anticoagulant therapy is the most effective strategy to prevent arterial and venous thromboembolism, but treating older individuals is challenging, because increasing age, comorbidities, and polypharmacy increase the risk of both thrombosis and bleeding. Warfarin and non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are underused and often underdosed in the prevention of stroke in older patients with atrial fibrillation because of concerns about the risk of bleeding. Poor adherence to anticoagulant therapy is also an issue for older patients with atrial fibrillation and those at risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism. In this review, we present 5 clinical cases to illustrate common challenges with anticoagulant use in older patients and discuss our approach to institute safe and effective antithrombotic therapy. ? 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; apixaban; atorvastatin; creatinine; dabigatran; edoxaban; hemoglobin; hydrochlorothiazide; metformin; ramipril; rivaroxaban; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; warfarin; African American; aged; all cause mortality; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; Article; atrial fibrillation; awareness; blood pressure; brain hemorrhage; bypass surgery; case report; cerebrovascular accident; CHA2DS2-VASc score; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; creatinine clearance; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; dual antiplatelet therapy; dysphasia; dyspnea; female; follow up; health care personnel; health care system; hemiparesis; human; hypertension; international normalized ratio; kidney disease; kidney function; leg thrombosis; lung angiography; macular degeneration; male; medication compliance; middle cerebral artery; mild cognitive impairment; New York Heart Association class; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; osteoarthritis; priority journal; prostate hypertrophy; pulse rate; risk assessment; risk factor; social isolation; stable angina pectoris; thorax pain; treatment refusal; urine retention; vascular disease; venous thromboembolism; very elderly; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; complication; oral drug administration; pathology; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; Administration, Oral; Aged; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Stroke; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism; Warfarin"
"Medical-surgical nurses’ documentation of client teaching and discharge planning at a Jamaican hospital","2019","Aim: This study sought to review documentation of client teaching and discharge planning performed on the medical wards of an urban Jamaican hospital. Background: Amid a chronic disease epidemic in Jamaica, adequate discharge planning and client education among hospitalized clients are essential to ensure optimal health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Method: A total of 131 records from six medical wards were audited. The audit instrument was developed based on the Ministry of Health, Jamaica guidelines, and appraised the completeness of assessment, use of the nursing process, client teaching and discharge planning. Quota sampling facilitated the selection of medical records which met the inclusion criteria. The SPSS? version 22 for Windows? facilitated data analysis. Results: Eighty-eight adult (67.2%) and 43 (32.8%) paediatric records were audited; 89.3% indicated the clients were diagnosed with at least one non-communicable disease. Fourteen percent of records reflected documented evidence of client teaching within the first 72?h of admission. On the day of discharge, only 18.3% reflected client teaching. Nurses seldom began discharge planning within the first 24?h of admission as only 6.9% records had documented evidence. These trends were common to adult and paediatric units. Discussion and Conclusion: The requisite client teaching and discharge planning appeared to be lacking in the records reviewed and may be contributory to deficiencies noted in self-care management. Research is needed to determine factors which could facilitate improved client teaching and discharge planning in the local context. Failure to address this gap in nursing care can significantly affect the country's ability to the reduce the economic burden associated with chronic diseases. Implications for nursing and health policy: This study highlighted an opportunity for advocacy among nurses and requires nursing leadership to collaboratively develop policies and guidelines to address discharge planning and client education among hospitalized clients. Given the significant health costs associated with non-communicable diseases this should be made a priority in the National Strategic and Action Plan for the Prevention and Control Non-communicable Diseases in Jamaica with clear articulations. ? 2019 International Council of Nurses","adult; child; hospital discharge; human; Jamaica; medical record; nursing audit; nursing practice; nursing staff; organization and management; patient education; Adult; Child; Humans; Jamaica; Nursing Audit; Nursing Records; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Patient Discharge; Patient Education as Topic; Practice Patterns, Nurses'"
"Comparison of the age-adjusted and clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism in the ED","2019","Background: Diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) can be challenging because its signs and symptoms are non-specific. Objective: We compared the efficacy and safety of using age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation, clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer interpretation and standard D-dimer approach to exclude PE in ED patients. Design/methods: We performed a health records review at two emergency departments over a two-year period. We reviewed all cases where patients had a D-dimer ordered to test for PE or underwent CT or VQ scanning for PE. PE was considered to be present during the emergency department visit if PE was diagnosed on CT or VQ (subsegmental level or above), or if the patient was subsequently found to have PE or deep vein thrombosis during the next 30 days. We applied the three D-dimer approaches to the low and moderate probability patients. The primary outcome was exclusion of PE with each rule. Secondary objective was to estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) for each rule. Results: 1163 emergency patients were tested for PE and 1075 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. PE was excluded in 70.4% (95% CI 67.6–73.0%), 80.3% (95% CI 77.9–82.6%) and 68.9%; (95% CI 65.7–71.3%) with the age-adjusted, clinical probability-adjusted and standard D-dimer approach. The NPVs were 99.7% (95% CI 99.0–99.9%), 99.1% (95% CI 98.3–99.5%) and 100% (95% CI 99.4–100.0%) respectively. Conclusion: The clinical probability-adjusted rule appears to exclude PE in a greater proportion of patients, with a very small reduction in the negative predictive value. ? 2018","D dimer; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; adult; age; aged; Article; comparative effectiveness; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; emergency ward; female; human; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; probability; protein blood level; retrospective study; safety; ventilation-perfusion scan; young adult; clinical trial; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; hospital emergency service; lung embolism; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Computed Tomography Angiography; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Embolism; Retrospective Studies; Ventilation-Perfusion Scan"
"United States Valuation of EQ-5D-5L Health States Using an International Protocol","2019","Objective: To derive a US-based value set for the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire using an international, standardized protocol developed by the EuroQol Group. Methods: Respondents from the US adult population were quota-sampled on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, and race. Trained interviewers guided participants in completing composite time trade-off (cTTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) tasks using the EuroQol Valuation Technology software and routine quality control measures. Data were modeled using a Tobit model for cTTO data, a mixed logit model for DCE data, and a hybrid model that combined cTTO and DCE data. Model performance was compared on the basis of logical ordering of coefficients, statistical significance, parsimony, and theoretical considerations. Results: Of 1134 respondents, 1062, 1099, and 1102 respondents provided useable cTTO, DCE, and cTTO or DCE responses, respectively, on the basis of quality control criteria and interviewer judgment. Respondent demographic characteristics and health status were similar to the 2015 US Census. The Tobit model was selected as the preferred model to generate the value set. Values ranged from ?0.573 (55 555) to 1 (11 111), with 20% of all predicted health states scores less than 0 (ie, worse than dead). Conclusions: A societal value set for the EQ-5D-5L was developed that can be used for economic evaluations and decision making in US health systems. The internationally established, standardized protocol used to develop this US-based value set was recommended by the EuroQol Group and can facilitate cross-country comparisons. ? 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research","adult; article; controlled study; cost utility analysis; decision making; ethnicity; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire; female; health status; human; human experiment; human tissue; major clinical study; male; quality adjusted life year; quality control; race; software; statistical significance; theoretical study; time trade-off method; United States"

"Active thrombin produced by the intestinal epithelium controls mucosal biofilms","2019","Proteolytic homeostasis is important at mucosal surfaces, but its actors and their precise role in physiology are poorly understood. Here we report that healthy human and mouse colon epithelia are a major source of active thrombin. We show that mucosal thrombin is directly regulated by the presence of commensal microbiota. Specific inhibition of luminal thrombin activity causes macroscopic and microscopic damage as well as transcriptomic alterations of genes involved in host-microbiota interactions. Further, luminal thrombin inhibition impairs the spatial segregation of microbiota biofilms, allowing bacteria to invade the mucus layer and to translocate across the epithelium. Thrombin cleaves the biofilm matrix of reconstituted mucosa-associated human microbiota. Our results indicate that thrombin constrains biofilms at the intestinal mucosa. Further work is needed to test whether thrombin plays similar roles in other mucosal surfaces, given that lung, bladder and skin epithelia also express thrombin. ? 2019, The Author(s).","thrombin; thrombin; biofilm; homeostasis; hormone; inhibition; microorganism; mucus; physiology; protein; animal tissue; Article; biofilm; bladder; colon epithelium; commensal; descending colon; homeostasis; host microbe interaction; human; human cell; human tissue; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; lung; mouse; nonhuman; skin; animal; animal model; bacterium; C57BL mouse; cell line; colon; colon tumor; epithelium; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; Animals; Bacteria; Biofilms; Cell Line; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; Epithelium; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Homeostasis; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Models, Animal; Skin; Thrombin; Urinary Bladder"

"Treatment with apolipoprotein a1 protects mice against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in a scavenger receptor class b, type I-dependent manner","2019","Treatment with apolipoprotein A1 protects mice against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in a scavenger receptor class B, type I-dependent manner. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 316: H1447–H1457, 2019. First published April 19, 2019; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00432. 2018.—Doxorubicin, an agent used to treat a variety of cancers, is cardiotoxic by triggering cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We previously showed that treating cultured cardiomyocytes with human high-density lipoprotein in vitro or transgenic overexpression of human apolipoprotein A1, its main structural protein, protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a manner dependent on the scavenger receptor class B type I [Durham KK, Chathely KM, Mak KC, Momen A, Thomas CT, Zhao YY, MacDonald ME, Curtis JM, Husain M, Trigatti BL. HDL protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in a scavenger receptor class B type 1-, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, and Akt-dependent manner. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 314: H31–H44, 2018]. This was due to high-density lipoprotein-induced activation of Akt signaling in cardiomyocytes. We now demonstrate that mice lacking the scavenger receptor class B, type I exhibit increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo. Cardiomyocytes expressing scavenger receptor class B, type I are protected from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by preincubation with high-density lipoprotein isolated from wild-type mice, whereas high-density lipoprotein from scavenger receptor class B, type 1 knockout mice is less effective. Cardiomyocytes from scavenger receptor class B, type I knockout mice, however, are not protected by high-density lipoprotein in vitro, and hearts from knockout mice are more sensitive to doxorubicin in vivo. Pharmacological administration of purified apolipoprotein A1 dramatically protected wild-type mice from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and left ventricular dysfunction, whereas this protection was lost in scavenger receptor class B, type I-deficient mice. This demonstrates, at least in mice, that high-density lipoprotein therapy can confer protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a manner mediated by the scavenger receptor class B, type I. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-B1) mediates HDL-dependent protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and that this is a property of SR-B1 in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in hearts in vivo. We also demonstrate that pharmacological treatment with apolipoprotein A1, the major HDL structural protein, protects mice against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and left ventricular dysfunction in an SR-B1-dependent manner. This suggests that HDL-targeted pharmacological therapy may hold promise for protecting against the deleterious, cardiotoxic side effects of this commonly used chemo-therapeutic drug. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","apolipoprotein A1; doxorubicin; high density lipoprotein; scavenger receptor BI; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; controlled study; drug activity; drug mechanism; heart left ventricle failure; heart protection; in vivo study; knockout mouse; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; wild type mouse"
"Creating GridlockED: A Serious Game for Teaching about Multipatient Environments","2019","Problem As patient volumes increase, it is becoming increasingly important to find novel ways to teach junior medical learners about the intricacies of managing multiple patients simultaneously and about working in a resource-limited environment. Approach Serious games (i.e., games not intended purely for fun) are a teaching modality that have been gaining momentum as teaching tools in medical education. From May 2016 to August 2017, the authors designed and tested a serious game, called GridlockED, to provide a focused educational experience for medical trainees to learn about multipatient care and patient flow. The game allows as many as six people to play it at once. Gameplay relies on the players working collaboratively (as simulated members of a medical team) to triage, treat, and disposition ""patients"" in a manner that simulates true emergency department operations. After researching serious games, the authors developed the game through an iterative design process. Next, the game underwent preliminary peer review by experienced gamers and practicing clinicians, whose feedback the authors used to adjust the game. Attending physicians, nurses, and residents have tested GridlockED for usability, fidelity, acceptability, and applicability. Outcomes On the basis of initial testing, clinicians suggest that this game will be useful and has fidelity for teaching patient-flow concepts. Next Steps Further play testing will be needed to fully examine learning opportunities for various populations of trainees and for various media. GridlockED may also serve as a model for developing other games to teach about processes in other environments or specialties. ? 2018 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.","adult; curriculum; education; emergency medicine; female; human; male; medical education; procedures; video game; young adult; Adult; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Emergency Medicine; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Video Games; Young Adult"

"Multicriteria decision analysis process to develop new classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus","2019","European League Against Rheumatism and are jointly supporting multiphase development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria based on weighted criteria and a continuous probability scale. Prior steps included item generation, item reduction and hierarchical organisation of candidate criteria using an evidence-based approach. Our objectives were to determine relative weights using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and to set a provisional threshold score for SLE classification. An SLE Expert Panel (8 European, 9 North American) submitted 164 real, unique cases with a wide range of SLE probability in a standardised format. Using the candidate criteria, experts scored and rank-ordered 20 representative cases. At an in-person meeting, experts reviewed inter-rater reliability of scoring, further refined criteria definitions and participated in an MCDA exercise. Based on expert consensus decisions on pairwise comparisons of criteria, 1000minds software calculated criteria weights and rank-ordered the remaining 144 cases based on their additive scores. The score of the lowest-ranked case for which complete expert consensus was achieved defined the provisional threshold classification score. Inter-rater reliability of scoring cases with the candidate criteria was good. MCDA involved 74 pairwise decisions and was repeated for the arthritis and mucocutaneous domains when the initial ranking of some cases did not match expert opinion. After criteria weights and additive scores were recalculated once, experts reached consensus for SLE classification for all cases scoring>83. Using an iterative process, the candidate criteria definitions were refined, preliminary weights were calculated and a provisional threshold score for SLE classification was determined. ?

"Engaging older adults in discharge planning: case studies illuminating approaches adopted by family members that promote relational autonomy","2019","Background: Discharge decisions have significant implications for older adults and their involved family members. Evidence of older adult and family members’ engagement in discharge decision-making, however, varies widely. Some recent work shows assumed associations between ageing, diminished participation in healthcare decision-making and increased reliance on family members. Other research suggests that family members adopt strategies to promote older adults’ participation in decision-making. Relational autonomy theory suggests that individuals have differing levels of autonomy and that individuals’ agency can be supported (or marginalized) by others. Purpose: Using three case studies, we examine traditional and relational conceptions of autonomy and explore how relational approaches could inform healthcare practice. Methods: Taking a critical feminist bioethics perspective, we present a secondary analysis of three microethnographic case studies focused on discharge planning with older adults in one Canadian inpatient rehabilitation setting. The data consist of observations of discharge planning family conferences and semi-structured interviews with older adults and family members. Results: Tensions between older adults’ wishes to return home and their diminished participation in discharge decisions, and family members’ assumption of a primary role in discharge decision-making and their wish for the older adult to move to a supported setting were apparent. To reconcile these tensions, the older adults’ family members in these cases employed strategies to promote older adults’ participation in decision-making that were consistent with relational autonomy theory. Conclusion and implications for practice: The analysis suggests that older adults’ participation in discharge decision-making processes could be better promoted through relational approaches.Implications for rehabilitation ???Adopting an approach guided by relational autonomy might better enable patients to participate in decision-making than would an approach guided by traditional conceptions of autonomy. ???Rehabilitation professionals could seek assistance from family members and guide them toward collaborative partnerships. ???A range of strategies may be employed to customize relational approaches to enhance autonomy: ?? ??having several different conversations with patients to enable multiple chances to contribute knowledge and views; ?? ??involving family members or taking the time to explain information several different times and in diverse manners; ?? ??showing patients videos or photos of discharge locations; ?? ??exploring a breadth of potential discharge options; ?? ??accompanying patients to visit different options in person; and ?? ??getting patients in touch with individuals who have made similar choices. ???It is recognized that taking a relational approach might be time-consuming and that practice contexts may not be conducive to such practice. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aged; article; bioethics; conception; conversation; decision making; feminism; health care practice; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; rehabilitation; secondary analysis; semi structured interview; tension; touch; videorecording"
"Overview of pharmacological interventions after traumatic brain injuries: impact on selected outcomes","2019","The purpose of this study was to conduct an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) to appraise the published evidence related to pharmacological interventions after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Searches were conducted with Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed. 780 retrieved SRs underwent a two-level screening to determine inclusion. Data extracted included participant characteristics, TBI severity, study design, pharmacological interventions, and outcomes. SRs were assessed for methodological quality by using the AMSTAR measurement tool. After removing duplicates, 166/780 SRs published between 1990-2017 were reviewed, 62 of which met inclusion criteria. More than 90 drugs and 22 substance-classes were extracted. Most medications were administered during the acute stage. Mild TBI was included in 3% of the SRs. Physiological outcomes comprised 45% of the SRs, primarily mortality. Activities of daily living (ADLs) outcomes constituted 22% of the SRs followed by cognition (13%) and psychological/behavioral outcomes (13%). Only 7% of the SRs assessed adverse events. Inconsistencies in definitions, methods, and heterogeneity of instruments used to measure treatment response were noted. Only a third of the SRs had high methodological quality. Most SRs had heterogeneous TBI samples, outcomes, or methodologies making it difficult to synthesize findings into recommended guidelines. This study demonstrated a need for adequately powered and rigorous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide generalizable evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions for TBI.

"Clinical significance of the LacdiNAc-glycosylated prostate-specific antigen assay for prostate cancer detection","2019","To reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies (Pbx), better discrimination is needed. To identify clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPC) we determined the performance of LacdiNAc-glycosylated prostate-specific antigen (LDN-PSA) and LDN-PSA normalized by prostate volume (LDN-PSAD). We retrospectively measured LDN-PSA, total PSA (tPSA), and free PSA/tPSA (F/T PSA) values in 718 men who underwent a Pbx in 3 academic urology clinics in Japan and Canada (Pbx cohort) and in 174 PC patients who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy in Australia (preop-PSA cohort). The assays were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses to discriminate CSPC. In the Pbx cohort, LDN-PSAD (AUC 0.860) provided significantly better clinical performance for discriminating CSPC compared with LDN-PSA (AUC 0.827, P?=?0.0024), PSAD (AUC 0.809, P?<?0.0001), tPSA (AUC 0.712, P?<?0.0001), and F/T PSA (AUC 0.661, P?<?0.0001). The decision curve analysis showed that using a risk threshold of 20% and adding LDN-PSA and LDN-PSAD to the base model (age, digital rectal examination status, tPSA, and F/T PSA) permitted avoidance of even more biopsies without missing CSPC (9.89% and 18.11%, respectively vs 2.23% [base model]). In the preop-PSA cohort, LDN-PSA values positively correlated with tumor volume and tPSA and were significantly higher in pT3, pathological Gleason score???7. Limitations include limited sample size, retrospective nature, and no family history information prior to biopsy. LacdiNAc-glycosylated PSA is significantly better than the conventional PSA test in identifying patients with CSPC.

"Incidence and predictors of atrial fibrillation progression: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: More sustained forms of atrial fibrillation (AF) are less amenable to treatment and associated with worse outcomes, but the incidence and predictors of AF progression are not well defined. Objective: The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the incidence and predictors of AF progression. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to August 2017. AF progression was defined as progression from paroxysmal to persistent/permanent AF or as progression from persistent to permanent AF. Random effect models were used to calculate pooled cumulative incidence rates. Predictors related to between-study variability were assessed using meta-regression analyses. Results: We identified 47 studies with 27,266 patients who were followed for 105,912 patient-years. The pooled incidence of AF progression was 8.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.1–9.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up; I 2 = 98%; P &lt;.0001). The incidence was 7.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI 6.2–8.0 per 100 patient-years of follow-up; across 42 studies) for progression from paroxysmal to non–paroxysmal AF as compared with 18.6 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI 8.9–28.3 per 100 patient-years of follow-up; across 5 studies) for progression from persistent to permanent AF. Higher age (β = 5.4; 95% CI 1.4–9.4; P =.01; R 2 = 14.3%) and the prevalence of hypertension (β = 5.2; 95% CI 1.0–9.4; P =.02; R 2 = 18.0%) were associated with a higher AF progression rate. Follow-up duration (β = ?4.5; 95% CI ?5.8 to ?3.3; P &lt;.0001; R 2 = 68.0%) and the prevalence of paroxysmal AF (β = ?9.5; 95% CI ?18.7 to ?0.3; P =.04; R 2 = 4.4%) were inversely associated with AF progression. Together these variables explained 73.8% of the observed between-study heterogeneity. Conclusion: The incidence of AF progression appears to be relatively low, and the incidence seems to decrease with longer follow-up duration. Age, hypertension, baseline AF type, and follow-up duration explained a high percentage of the observed between-study heterogeneity. ? 2018 Heart Rhythm Society","age; Article; atrial fibrillation; disease exacerbation; follow up; human; hypertension; incidence; meta analysis (topic); non paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; prevalence; priority journal; systematic review"
"A Chinese practice guideline of the assisted reproductive technology strategies for women with advanced age","2019","More women postpone childbearing nowadays while female fertility begins to decline with advancing age. Furthermore, with the rolling out of the two-child policy, there is a huge demand for a second child for Chinese aged women. There are various assisted reproductive technology (ART) strategies applied for age-related infertility without solid evidence. On behalf of the Society of Reproductive Medicine, Chinese Medical Association, we would like to develop a Chinese guideline of ART strategies for age-related infertility. This guideline was produced following the recommendations for standard guidelines described in the 2012 WHO Handbook for guideline development. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was also followed. A protocol was formulated and a Guideline Development Group was formed with specialists of reproductive medicine, methodologists from Chinese GRADE working group, and patient representative. Questions regarding the ART strategies for aged infertility were formulated and 8 most important ones were chosen to be structured in PICO format (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes). Comprehensive search and review of the literature were performed and the quality of the evidence was assessed and rated based on certain criteria and be categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low. Twenty-five recommendations were formulated among members of the Guidelines Development Group (Delphi method) basing on the overall quality of the evidence, in addition to the balance between benefits and harms, values and preferences, and resource implications. The final recommendations were agreed on by consensus during face-to-face meetings. This is the first Chinese practice guideline in reproductive medicine developed following the standard and scientific method. ? 2019 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adult; article; Chinese medicine; Delphi study; female; human; infertility therapy; maternal age; practice guideline; systematic review; China; female infertility; infertility therapy; practice guideline; China; Female; Humans; Infertility, Female; Maternal Age; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted"
"Antithrombotics in stable peripheral artery disease","2019","Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are at high risk for ischemic cardiovascular complications. While single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), predominantly aspirin, has long been the standard antithrombotic treatment in stable PAD, there have now been greater than 40,000 PAD patients randomized to varying antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant regimens. In this review, we provide a summary of the current evidence for antithrombotics in stable PAD, focusing on the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE), and major bleeding. SAPT has a limited role in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD, particularly in the absence of concomitant coronary artery disease. In symptomatic PAD, SAPT is effective in preventing MACE, though treatment with a thienopyridine appears marginally superior to aspirin. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) suggests benefit over SAPT in reducing MACE and MALE, though studies to date are not conclusive and/or are associated with excess major bleeding. Combining moderate to high intensity vitamin K antagonists with antiplatelet therapy does not reduce MACE or MALE and increases life-threatening bleeding. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID in addition to aspirin reduces the incidence of both MACE and MALE as compared to aspirin alone, without increasing life-threatening bleeding. This regimen is associated with a reduced severity of MALE when it does occur. Comparisons across antithrombotic trials in PAD are challenging given the heterogeneity of patient populations and the differing assessment of outcomes. The vascular medicine practitioner can reduce ischemic cardiac and limb events, as well as minimize life-threatening bleeding, by choosing the optimal antithrombotic regimen in their PAD patients. ?

"Mechanisms by which gut microorganisms influence food sensitivities","2019","Finely tuned mechanisms enable the gastrointestinal tract to break down dietary components into nutrients without mounting, in the majority of cases, a dysregulated immune or functional host response. However, adverse reactions to food have been steadily increasing, and evidence suggests that this process is environmental. Adverse food reactions can be divided according to their underlying pathophysiology into food intolerances, when, for instance, there is deficiency of a host enzyme required to digest the food component, and food sensitivities, when immune mechanisms are involved. In this Review, we discuss the clinical and experimental evidence for enteric infections and/or alterations in the gut microbiota in inciting food sensitivity. We focus on mechanisms by which microorganisms might provide direct pro-inflammatory signals to the host promoting breakdown of oral tolerance to food antigens or indirect pathways that involve the metabolism of protein antigens and other dietary components by gut microorganisms. Better understanding of these mechanisms will help in the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for food sensitivities. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","drug metabolite; food antigen; interleukin 15; celiac disease; food allergy; food sensitivity; human; immunogenicity; immunomodulation; inflammation; innate immunity; intestine flora; nonhuman; nutritional intolerance; pathogenesis; priority journal; Reoviridae; Review; signal transduction; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; animal; immunology; intestine flora; Lactobacillus; Animals; Celiac Disease; Food Hypersensitivity; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Lactobacillus"
"Health services use among children diagnosed with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency through newborn screening: A cohort study in Ontario, Canada","2019","Background: We describe early health services utilization for children diagnosed with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency through newborn screening in Ontario, Canada, relative to a screen negative comparison cohort. Methods: Eligible children were identified via newborn screening between April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010. Age-stratified rates of physician encounters, emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient hospitalizations to March 31, 2012 were compared using incidence rate ratios (IRR) and incidence rate differences (IRD). We used negative binomial regression to adjust IRRs for sex, gestational age, birth weight, socioeconomic status and rural/urban residence. Results: Throughout the first few years of life, children with MCAD deficiency (n = 40) experienced statistically significantly higher rates of physician encounters, ED visits, and hospital stays compared with the screen negative cohort. The highest rates of ED visits and hospitalizations in the MCAD deficiency cohort occurred from 6 months to 2 years of age (ED use: 2.1-2.5 visits per child per year; hospitalization: 0.5-0.6 visits per child per year), after which rates gradually declined. Conclusions: This study confirms that young children with MCAD deficiency use health services more frequently than the general population throughout the first few years of life. Rates of service use in this population gradually diminish after 24 months of age. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; birth weight; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; doctor patient relationship; emergency care; female; gestational age; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; incidence; incidence rate difference; incidence rate ratio; major clinical study; male; medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency; newborn screening; rural area; sex; social status; urban area; demography; disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism; health service; hospital emergency service; infant; newborn; newborn screening; Ontario; preschool child; socioeconomics; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase; Birth Weight; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Gestational Age; Health Services Misuse; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Male; Neonatal Screening; Ontario; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors"
"Evaluation of unmet clinical needs in prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism in high-risk patient groups: Cancer and critically ill","2019","Background: Clinical practice shows that venous thromboembolism (VTE) presents a substantial burden in medical patients, and awareness and advocacy for its primary and secondary prevention remains inadequate. Specific patient populations, such as those with cancer and the critically ill, show elevated risk for VTE, bleeding or both, and significant gaps in VTE prophylaxis and treatment exist in these groups. Objective: To present novel insights and consolidated evidence collected from experts, clinical practice guidelines and original studies on the unmet needs in thromboprophylaxis, and on the treatment of VTE in two high-risk patient groups: patients with cancer and the critically ill. Methodology: To identify specific unmet needs in the management of VTE, a methodology was designed and implemented that assessed gaps in prophylaxis and treatment of VTE through interviews with 44 experts in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, and through a review of current guidelines and seminal studies to substantiate the insights provided by the experts. The research findings were then analysed, discussed and consolidated by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Results: The gap analysis methodology identified shortcomings in the VTE risk assessment tools, patient stratification approaches for prophylaxis, and the suboptimal use of anticoagulants for primary prophylaxis and treatment. Conclusions: Specifically, patients with cancer need better VTE risk assessment tools to tailor primary thromboprophylaxis to tumour types and disease stages, and the potential for drug-drug interactions needs to be considered. In critically ill patients, unfractionated heparin is not advised as a first-line treatment option, and the strength of evidence is increasing for direct oral anticoagulants as a treatment option over low-molecular-weight heparins. ? 2019 The Author(s).","anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; enoxaparin; fondaparinux; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; rivaroxaban; clinical practice; critically ill patient; drug efficacy; evidence based medicine; health care need; hemostasis; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; interview; malignant neoplasm; medical expert; practice guideline; prediction; primary prevention; Review; risk assessment; secondary prevention; venous thromboembolism"
"Translating the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease concept to improve the nutritional environment for our next generations: A call for a reflexive, positive, multi-level approach","2019","Evidence supporting the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis indicates that improving early life environments can reduce non-communicable disease risks and improve health over the lifecourse. A widespread understanding of this evidence may help to reshape structures, guidelines and individual behaviors to better the developmental conditions for the next generations. Yet, few efforts have yet been made to translate the DOHaD concept beyond the research community. To understand why, and to identify priorities for DOHaD Knowledge Translation (KT) programs, we review here a portion of published descriptions of DOHaD KT efforts and critiques thereof. We focus on KT targeting people equipped to apply DOHaD knowledge to their everyday home or work lives. We identified 17 reports of direct-to-public DOHaD KT that met our inclusion criteria. Relevant KT programs have been or are being initiated in nine countries, most focusing on secondary school students or care-workers-in-training; few target parents-to-be. Early indicators suggest that such programs can empower participants. Main critiques of DOHaD KT suggest it may overburden mothers with responsibility for children's health and health environments, minimizing the roles of other people and institutions. Simultaneously, though, many mothers-to-be seek reliable guidance on prenatal health and nutrition, and would likely benefit from engagement with DOHaD KT. We thus recommend emphasizing solidarity, and bringing together people likely to one day become parents (youth), people planning pregnancies, expecting couples, care workers and policymakers into empowering conversation about DOHaD and about the importance and complexity of early life environments. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.",""
"Integrating primary care providers through the seasons of survivorship","2019","Traditionally, the role of primary care providers (pcps) across the cancer care trajectory has focused on prevention and early detection. In combination with screening initiatives, new and evolving treatment approaches have contributed to significant improvements in survival in a number of cancer types. For Canadian cancer survivors, the 5-year survival rate is now better than it was a decade ago, and the survivor population is expected to reach 2 million by 2031. Notwithstanding those improvements, many cancer survivors experience late and long-term effects, and comorbid conditions have been noted to be increasing in prevalence for this vulnerable population. In view of those observations, and considering the anticipated shortage of oncology providers, increasing reliance is being placed on the primary care workforce for the provision of survivorship care. Despite the willingness of pcps to engage in that role, further substantial efforts to elucidate the landscape of high-quality, sustainable, and comprehensive survivorship care delivery within primary care are required. The present article offers an overview of the integration of pcps into survivorship care provision. More specifically, it outlines known barriers and potential solutions in five categories: ■■ Survivorship care coordination ■■ Knowledge of survivorship ■■ pcp-led clinical environments ■■ Models of survivorship care ■■ Health policy and organizational advocacy. ? 2019 Multimed Inc.","adult; article; cancer survival; cancer survivor; coordination; education; health care policy; human; landscape; oncology; prevalence; prevention; primary medical care; season; survival rate; survivorship; vulnerable population; workforce"
"Effects of basal insulin glargine and omega-3 on lower limb arterial disease outcome in patients with dysglycaemia: An analysis of the Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine INtervention (ORIGIN) trial","2019","The impact of insulin or omega-3 supplements on the incidence and progression of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients with dysglycaemia has not been well studied. The Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine INtervention (ORIGIN) trial randomized participants with dysglycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors to titrated insulin glargine vs standard care, and to either 1 g of omega-3 per day or placebo. We assessed incident PAD, defined as the composite of either asymptomatic or symptomatic PAD according to the randomized interventions in the 11 119 ORIGIN participants whose baseline ankle-brachial index (ABI) was >0.9 (no PAD), and PAD progression in the 971 ORIGIN participants whose baseline ABI was ?0.9. Hazard ratios (HR) were adjusted for confounders. During a 6.2-year follow-up period, allocation to insulin glargine vs standard care had a neutral effect on the composite of PAD incidence (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86-1.15) and progression (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63-1.22). Similar findings were noted for allocation to omega-3 vs placebo for PAD incidence (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89-1.18) and progression (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.28).

"Outcomes indicators and processes in transitional care in adolescents with haemophilia: A Delphi survey of Canadian haemophilia care providers","2019","Introduction: It is unclear which outcome indicators should be used to measure the success of haemophilia transition programs, and what are key elements of a haemophilia transition program to ensure success. Aim: To establish by expert consensus a list of important and feasible outcome indicators of successful haemophilia transition, and a list of key elements of transition planning. Methods: A modified two-stage Delphi survey was developed and disseminated among a panel of Canadian interdisciplinary haemophilia care providers. Participants were asked to rate the importance and feasibility of outcome indicators of effective haemophilia transition and elements of haemophilia transition program. In the second round, participants were asked to choose the top five outcomes suitable for inclusion in a core outcome set of transition effectiveness, and the top five elements that are important and feasible for implementation within the next 5?years. Results: In total, 34/73 (47%) of participants completed the first round and 33 completed the second round, representing a variety of disciplines. Top outcome indicators recommended for a core outcome set include measurement of adherence, change in bleeding rate, self-efficacy skills, haemophilia knowledge, patient and caregiver satisfaction, time gap between last paediatric and first adult clinic, and number of emergency room or hospital admissions. Fourteen elements of transition achieved consensus in importance ratings, while eight were felt to be feasible for implementation within next 5?years. Conclusions: Results will contribute towards the development of a haemophilia transition outcome instrument and provide guidance for future studies of the effectiveness of transition programs. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adolescent; adult; Article; attitude to health; bleeding; Canadian; caregiver; child; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; consensus; controlled study; Delphi study; disease course; emergency ward; feasibility study; health care personnel; health care planning; hemophilia; hospital admission; human; patient compliance; patient satisfaction; pediatric hospital; pilot study; priority journal; self concept; transitional care; treatment outcome; Canada; exercise; health care delivery; hemophilia A; hemophilia B; pathology; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; self care; Adolescent; Canada; Delivery of Health Care; Delphi Technique; Exercise; Health Personnel; Hemophilia A; Hemophilia B; Humans; Quality of Life; Self Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transitional Care"
"Inappropriateness of health care in Canada: A systematic review protocol","2019","Background: There is increasing recognition in Canada and globally that a substantial proportion of health care delivered is inappropriate as evidenced by (1) harmful and/or ineffective practices being overused, (2) effective clinical practices being underused, and (3) other clinical practices being misused. Inappropriate health care leads to negative patient experiences, poor health outcomes, and inefficient use of scarce health care resources. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of inappropriate health care in Canada. Our specific objectives are to (1) systematically search and critically review published and grey literature for studies on inappropriate health care in Canada; (2) estimate the nature and magnitude of inappropriate health care in Canada and its provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Methods: We will include all quantitative study designs reporting objective or subjective measurements of inappropriate health care in Canada over the last 10 years. We will search the following online databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EconLit, and ISI-Web of Knowledge, which contains Web of Science Core Collection-Citation Indexes, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science & Humanities. We will also search grey literature sources to identify provincial and national audits of inappropriate health care. Two authors will independently screen, assess data quality, and extract data for synthesis. Study findings will be synthesized narratively. We will organize our data into three care categorizations: preventive care, acute care, and chronic care. We will provide a compendium of inappropriate health care for each care category for Canada and each Canadian province and territory, where sufficient data exists, by calculating (1) overall medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse of clinical practices and (2) the range of medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse for each clinical practice investigated. Discussion: This review will result in the first-ever evidence-based compendium of inappropriate health care in Canada. We will also develop detailed reports of inappropriate health care for each Canadian province and territory.

"History of childhood abuse in populations incarcerated in Canada: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background. Ahistory of childhood abusemay affect people's health and criminal justice system involvement. Understanding the prevalence of childhood abuse among individuals in prison is important to inform effective and appropriate correctional services. Objectives. To review and summarize data on the prevalence of childhood abuse among people experiencing imprisonment in Canada. Search Methods. We searched for studies in bibliographic indexes, reference lists, and gray literature, and we consulted experts. Selection Criteria. We included studies published since 1987 that reported data on prevalence of a history of abuse before the age of 18 years among people in Canadian prisons, including any abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Data Collection and Analysis. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts for eligibility and reviewed full texts for eligibility. Analyses included summary estimates and meta-regression with random effects. Main Results. The search identified 1429 records.Weincluded 34 unique studies in our review and 29 nonoverlapping studies in our meta-analysis. The summary prevalence for any type of childhood abuse was 65.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 52.6, 77.7; range = 56.2% to 75.0%) among women; only one study reported the prevalence among men (35.5%). The summary prevalence of sexual abuse was 50.4% (95% CI = 33.5, 67.2; range = 9.9% to 77.3%) among women and 21.9% (95% CI = 15.7, 28.8; range = 8.3% to 55.6%) among men.The prevalence of neglect was 51.5% (95% CI = 43.1, 59.7; range = 45.5% to 65.1%) among women and 42.0% (95% CI = 12.7, 74.6; range = 6.8% to 99.0%) among men. The prevalence of physical abuse was 47.7% (95% CI = 41.3, 54.0; range = 16.3% to 83.0%), and the prevalence of emotional abuse was 51.5% (95% CI = 34.8, 67.9; range = 8.7% to 96.0%); we did not find differences according to gender.

"Big data and machine learning meet the health sciences","2019","Big data and machine learning are gaining traction in health sciences research. They might provide predictive models for both clinical practice and public health systems. Big data is a broad term used to denote volumes of large and complex measurements. Beyond genomics and other “omic” fields, big data includes administrative, molecular, clinical, environmental, sociodemographic, and even social media information. Machine learning, also known as pattern recognition, represents a range of techniques used to analyze big data by identifying patterns of interaction among features. Compared with traditional statistical methods that provide primarily average group-level results, machine learning algorithms allow predictions and stratification of clinical outcomes at the level of an individual subject. In the present chapter, we provide a concise historical perspective of some important events in health sciences and the analytical methods used to find causes and treatment of illnesses. The overall aim is to understand why big data and machine learning have recently become promising methods to define, predict, and treat illnesses, and how they can transform the way we conceptualize care in health sciences. ?

"Fibrocytes and fibroblasts—Where are we now","2019","Fibroblasts are considered major contributors to the process of fibrogenesis and the progression of matrix deposition and tissue distortion in fibrotic diseases such as Pulmonary Fibrosis. Recent discovery of the fibrocyte, a circulating possible precursor cell to the tissue fibroblast in fibrosis, has raised issues regarding the characterization of fibrocytes with respect to their morphology, growth characteristics in vitro, their biological role in vivo and their potential utility as a biomarker and/ or treatment target in various human diseases. Characterization studies of the fibrocyte continue as does emerging conflicting data concerning the relationship to or with the lung fibroblast. The source of signals that direct the traffic of these cells, as well as their response to therapeutic intervention with newly available drugs, bring new insights to the understanding of this cell type. The identification of exosomes from fibrocytes that can affect resident fibroblast activities suggest mechanisms of their influence on pathogenesis. Moreover, interesting comparisons with other pathologies are emerging involving the influence of circulating mesenchymal precursor cells on tissue responses. ? 2019","Article; cancer associated fibroblast; cell function; connective tissue cell; exosome; fibroblast; fibrocyte; fibrosing alveolitis; human; nonhuman; pathogenesis"
"Single pivotal trials with few corroborating characteristics were used for FDA approval of cancer therapies","2019","Background and objective: Novel cancer therapies are often approved with evidence from a single pivotal trial alone. There are concerns about the credibility of this evidence. Higher validity may be indicated by five methodological and statistical characteristics of pivotal trial evidence that were described by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which may corroborate the reliance on a single trial alone for approval decisions. Study design: We did a metaepidemiologic evaluation of all single pivotal trials supporting FDA approval of novel drugs and therapeutic biologicals for cancers between 2000 and 2016. For each trial, we determined the presence of these five characteristics, which we operationalized as (1) large and multicenter trial (?200 patients; more than one center); consistent treatment benefits across (2) multiple patient subgroups (in view of FDA reviewers), (3) multiple endpoints (including overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, health related quality of life), and (4) multiple treatment comparisons (e.g., multi-arm studies); and (5) “statistically very persuasive” results (P-values <0.00125). Results: Thirty-five of 100 approvals were based on evidence from a single pivotal trial without any further supporting evidence on beneficial effects (20 randomized controlled trials and 15 single-arm trials). The number increased substantially from one approval before 2006 to 23 after 2011. Sixty-six percent (23/35) of the trials were large multicenter trials (median 301 patients and 63 centers). Consistent effects were demonstrated across subgroups in 66% (23/35), across endpoints in 43% (15/35), and across multiple comparisons in 3% (1/35). Very low P-values for the primary endpoint were seen in 34% (12/35). At least one of the corroborating characteristics was present in 94% (33/35) of all approvals, two or more were present in 54% (19/35), and none had all characteristics. Conclusions: Single pivotal trials typically have some of the corroborating characteristics, but often only one or two. These characteristics need to be better operationalized, defined, and reported and whether single trials with such characteristics provide similar evidence about benefits and harms of novel treatments as multiple trials would do needs to be shown. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","antineoplastic agent; biological product; orphan drug; Article; clinical trial (topic); drug approval; drug marketing; Food and Drug Administration; human; multicenter study (topic); overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment response; validity"
"BIOPHOTONS IN RADIOBIOLOGY: INHIBITORS, COMMUNICATORS AND REACTORS","2019","Radiation-induced bystander effects refer to the production of signals from irradiated cells which induce responses in unirradiated, or bystander, cells. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in low-energy photon biology. This is due to concerns about health effects, increased use of biophoton imaging techniques, and the fact that biophotons can act as a bystander signal. This review discusses the history of light signaling in biology and potential mechanisms involved in the generation and transduction of signaling mechanisms. The role of photons in signaling in the animal and plant kingdoms is also reviewed.

"Clostridium difficile intervention timelines for diagnosis, isolation, and treatment","2019","Background: Developing timelines of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is critical to improving control and preventive measures. The objective of this study was to provide data-driven estimates of CDI timelines of diagnosis, isolation, and treatment in a hospital setting. Methods: We obtained data for all CDI inpatients with symptoms onset occurring between January 1, 2013, and December 30, 2017, from St Joseph's Healthcare in Hamilton, Canada. We analyzed full empirical distributions of timelines associated with the diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of CDI. Results: A total of 683 inpatients with CDI symptoms were recorded, of which 243 cases were identified as health care–associated infection (HAI). The mean time intervals between the onset of CDI symptoms after admission and the release of laboratory results were 1.2 days and 1.9 days for the HAI and community-associated infection (CAI) patient groups, respectively. The mean time intervals from symptoms onset to the start of isolation were 1.5 days and 2.6 days for the corresponding patient groups. The initiation of treatment within 2 days of symptoms onset reduced the duration of first isolation (P value < .0001); however, the type of initial antibiotic used for CDI treatment was not associated with the duration of isolation. Conclusions: Estimated timelines did not differ (P values > .6) between HAI and CAI patient groups with symptoms onset after admission. These estimates are useful for evaluating the effectiveness of CDI interventions. ? 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.","metronidazole; vancomycin; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; Canada; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; Clostridium difficile infection; controlled study; disease association; disease duration; feces analysis; female; health care facility; healthcare associated infection; hospital admission; human; incidence; infection control; isolation; major clinical study; male; practice guideline; recurrent disease; symptom; treatment duration"
"Metabolic Signatures of Cystic Fibrosis Identified in Dried Blood Spots for Newborn Screening Without Carrier Identification","2019","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex multiorgan disorder that is among the most common fatal genetic diseases benefiting from therapeutic interventions early in life. Newborn screening (NBS) for presymptomatic detection of CF currently relies on a two-stage immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation panel algorithm that is sensitive but not specific for identifying affected neonates with a low positive predictive value. For the first time, we report the discovery of a panel of CF-specific metabolites from a single 3.2 mm diameter dried blood spot (DBS) punch when using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MS) as a high-throughput platform for nontargeted metabolite profiling from volume-restricted/biobanked specimens with quality control. This retrospective case-control study design identified 32 metabolites, including a series of N-glycated amino acids, oxidized glutathione disulfide, and nicotinamide that were differentially expressed in normal birth weight CF neonates without meconium ileus (n = 36) as compared to gestational age/sex-matched screen-negative controls (n = 44) after a false discovery rate adjustment (q &lt; 0.05). Also, 16 metabolites from DBS extracts allowed for discrimination of true CF cases from presumptive screen-positive carriers with one identified CFTR mutation and transient neonatal hypertrypsinogenemic neonates (n = 72), who were later confirmed as unaffected due to a low sweat chloride (&lt;29 mM) test result. Importantly, six CF-specific biomarker candidates satisfying a Bonferroni adjustment (p &lt; 7.25 × 10 -5 ) from three independent batches of DBS specimens included several amino acids depleted in circulation (Tyr, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly) likely reflecting protein maldigestion/malabsorption. Additionally, CF neonates had lower ophthalmic acid as an indicator of oxidative stress due to impaired glutathione efflux from exocrine/epithelial tissue and elevation of an unknown trivalent peptide that was directly correlated with IRT (? = 0.332, p = 4.55 × 10 -4 ). Structural elucidation of unknown metabolites was performed by high-resolution MS/MS, whereas biomarker validation was realized when comparing a subset of metabolites from matching neonatal DBS specimens independently analyzed by direct infusion-MS/MS at an accredited NBS facility. This work sheds new light into the metabolic phenotype of CF early in life, which is required for better functional understanding of CFTR mutations of unknown clinical consequence and the development of more accurate yet cost-effective strategies for CF screening.

"Hip and Groin Injuries in Professional Basketball Players: Impact on Playing Career and Quality of Life After Retirement","2019","Background: Professional basketball players are at increased risk of hip and groin pain. Epidemiologic data exist on the prevalence of hip and groin issues among players in the National Basketball Association (NBA), but little is known about how these injuries affect athletes after retirement. Hypothesis: A high proportion of retired NBA athletes would have hip and/or groin pain. Study Design: Cross-sectional survey. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: A survey was developed through an interdisciplinary focus group. The survey was developed to capture data regarding demographics, collegiate and professional athletic injuries, and current quality of life and musculoskeletal health. The questionnaire was electronically distributed to all members of the National Basketball Players Association using SurveyMonkey (N = 900). Results: A total of 108 (12%) retired NBA players completed the survey. More than one-third (36.3%) of athletes report currently experiencing hip and/or groin pain, and 17.6% had received injections for hip or groin conditions since retiring from the NBA. Since retiring, 14.7% of respondents had undergone total hip arthroplasty. The median Tegner activity level scale was 3 out of 10. Nearly one-third (32.4%) of athletes report moderate to severe problems with mobility, and close to half (48%) had moderate to extreme pain/discomfort. Conclusion: Hip and groin injuries are common among NBA athletes, affecting players throughout their careers and into retirement. A subset of athletes may exist in whom intra-articular hip pathology is not appropriately identified and treated while playing in the NBA. Clinical Relevance: Retired NBA athletes are at high risk of hip and groin pain after retirement and are more likely to require total hip arthroplasty compared with the general population. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; basketball; cross-sectional study; hip injury; human; inguinal region; injuries; middle aged; occupational accident; quality of life; retirement; sport injury; Adult; Athletic Injuries; Basketball; Cross-Sectional Studies; Groin; Hip Injuries; Humans; Middle Aged; Occupational Injuries; Quality of Life; Retirement"
"Erythropoietin in perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Erythropoietin (EPO) appears to confer neuroprotection to the injured brain. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated its safety in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); however, the evidence is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the role of EPO in perinatal HIE by a systematic review and meta-analysis. Database search included Embase, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). RCTs reporting a death, neurodevelopmental outcomes or brain injury were included. Two authors extracted the data independently from included studies and assessed the level of evidence (LOE). Six RCTs (EPO=5 and darbepoetin α=1) involving 454 neonates were included. A trend toward a lower risk of death was identified in infants treated with EPO [EPO with or without hypothermia: five RCTs, 368 participants, relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-1.19, LOE-low; EPO without hypothermia: four RCTs, 318 participants, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49-1.32, LOE-low]. EPO treatment without hypothermia compared to placebo resulted in a reduced risk of cerebral palsy (two RCTs, 230 participants, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.80, LOE-moderate) and moderate to severe cognitive impairment (two RCTs, 226 participants, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.85, LOE-moderate). A reduced risk of brain injury was identified in EPO treated infants (EPO with or without hypothermia, two RCTs, 148 participants, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.92, LOE-moderate). EPO administration in neonates with perinatal HIE reduces the risk of brain injury, cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment. The evidence is limited to suggest its role as an adjuvant to hypothermia. Larger powered trials are underway to overcome this limitation. ? 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","erythropoietin; placebo; recombinant erythropoietin; erythropoietin; Article; brain injury; cerebral palsy; child death; cognitive defect; disease severity; human; hypothermia; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; infant; major clinical study; meta analysis; mortality risk; nervous system development; newborn; newborn disease; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk reduction; systematic review; brain injury; complication; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; mental disease; mortality; prematurity; Brain Injuries; Erythropoietin; Humans; Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Neurodevelopmental Disorders"
"A commentary on the medicinal use of marijuana","2019","Background: Lately, the number of people using marijuana in the USA has dramatically increased. In 2018, many states have legalized marijuana use for both medical and recreational purposes, thus exploring the evidence behind medical marijuana use became essential. Muslim majority countries enforce rigorous rules as marijuana has been a long-debated issue due to the stigma associated with its use as a treatment. Marijuana has a high beneficial effect in managing chronic pain in adults and relieving spasticity symptoms in multiple sclerosis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and fibromyalgia. As well as, used as pain management, and as anti-emetic in treatment of chemotherapy-induced vomiting and nausea. Marijuana is requested from more than one-third of posttraumatic stress disorder patients due to its significant clinical improvement in nightmares and subsidence disorder symptoms. Marijuana adversely affects the body's resistance to many infections, compromising their immune response. Its recreational use has led to an increasing trend in the occurrence of major acute cardiovascular events as stroke, epilepsy, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia. Conclusion: Many countries started to allow medicinal use of marijuana due to its beneficial effect in managing chronic pain, spasticity symptoms in multiple sclerosis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, fibromyalgia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. But literature lacks benefit-harm analysis for marijuana usage in medicine. Therefore, evidence-based report of short- and long-term health effects of marijuana use - both harmful and beneficial effects - is crucial for further marijuana prescription in healthcare settings. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cannabis; medical cannabis; recreational drug; acute heart infarction; cannabis use; cerebrovascular accident; chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; chronic pain; congestive heart failure; epilepsy; fibromyalgia; heart arrhythmia; human; immune response; infection resistance; major adverse cardiac event; multiple sclerosis; nightmare; posttraumatic stress disorder; Review; sleep disordered breathing; spasticity; symptomatology"

"Parents' attendance, participation and engagement in children’s developmental rehabilitation services: Part 1. Contextualizing the journey to child health and happiness","2019","Purpose: A family-centered approach to developmental rehabilitation services emphasizes that children grow and develop in their family environment, and that parents are an integral part of therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop a theory of how parents attend, participate and engage in their child’s developmental rehabilitation services. Methods: A constructivist grounded theory study was conducted. Recruitment was done at a single children’s treatment center in Ontario, Canada and data collection included parent and clinician interviews, policy collection and child-health record review. Grounded theory methods of constant comparison and theoretical sampling were applied. Credibility was enhanced through reflexivity, triangulation, and peer debriefing. Results and conclusions: The results show that in order to understand how parents engage in therapy, we must understand the conditions related to family health and service complexity that affect parent engagement. This contextual understanding may increase service providers’ sensitivity to the conditions that affect engagement as they join families on their journey towards child health and happiness.Implications for rehabilitation Service providers can understand the ease or difficulty that parents may experience in attending, participating and engaging in their child’s therapy if they ask about (i) who is a part of the family, (ii) the health of all family members, and (iii) the number of services and professionals that are involved with the family Asking parents about their own mental health and ensuring they are connected with appropriate resources may help them to attend, participate and engage in their child’s rehabilitation service. When families are involved with multiple services and professionals, they may benefit from support with service navigation and a collaborative interprofessional approach to care. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","article; child; child health; clinician; controlled study; family health; female; grounded theory; happiness; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; interview; male; medical record review; mental health; Ontario; rehabilitation center; theoretical study"
"Depression and prostate cancer: A focused review for the clinician","2019","Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men. Given its prevalence and relatively low mortality rates, several biopsychosocial survivorship issues have garnered recent attention. This article reviews the literature on the association between depression and prostate cancer, emphasizing key practice points relevant for clinicians. Depression is prevalent among men with prostate cancer, with approximately 1 in 6 patients experiencing clinical depression. Suicidal ideation is also not uncommon in this population and does not always present in those with other depressive symptoms. While choice of definitive cancer treatment (radiation or surgery) does not seem to affect depressive symptoms, receipt of androgen deprivation therapy appears to have a negative effect. Not only are patients at increased risk for depression following a prostate cancer diagnosis, but depression itself seems to adversely affect oncologic outcomes. We were not able to identify any clinical trials examining the efficacy of antidepressant medications for depressive symptoms in these patients, however population-based studies suggest antidepressant prescriptions are commonly utilized. Taken together, the literature on the intersection between urologic oncology and psychology/psychiatry affirms the importance of depression among men with prostate cancer. Clinicians should consider assessment of this symptom domain and treat or refer judiciously. Clinical trials represent a priority for future research. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","cancer diagnosis; clinical outcome; depression; human; male; Medline; priority journal; prostate cancer; Review; suicide; systematic review; depression; prostate tumor; psychology; quality of life; Depression; Humans; Male; Prostatic Neoplasms; Quality of Life"
"Exploring the physical activity and screen-viewing-related knowledge, training, and self-efficacy of early childhood education candidates","2019","Background: Early childhood educators greatly influence young children's physical activity and screen-viewing behaviours in childcare. However, educators have requested additional training in physical activity programming, and one logical place to provide this education is during their pre-service schooling. This study explored the physical activity and screen-viewing-related knowledge, training, and self-efficacy of early childhood education (ECE) candidates across Canada, to determine their confidence and ability to facilitate physical activity opportunities and limit screen-viewing among young children in childcare. Methods: Key program personnel at 61 (of 110) Canadian colleges/universities offering an ECE program agreed to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online survey (112 items; 9 domains), developed by experts using the Tailored Design Method, was administered via Qualtrics? to a sample of 1292 ECE candidates. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and chi-square tests were used to report participant demographics and physical activity and screen-viewing-related knowledge (i.e., of physical activity and screen-viewing concepts), training (i.e., physical activity and screen-viewing courses/content received), and self-efficacy (i.e., to facilitate physical activity and limit screen-viewing in childcare) of candidates. Results: ECE candidates exhibited the least amount of knowledge regarding the impact of screen-viewing on physiological outcomes (i.e., blood pressure) in young children. Further, only 32.2 and 26.7% of candidates reported completing physical activity or screen-viewing courses during their post-secondary training, respectively. Candidates who completed one or more physical activity or screen-viewing courses exhibited significantly greater (p <.05) self-efficacy than those without such training related to ensuring children were engaging in adequate moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Confidence to limit screen time did not differ. Candidates reporting meeting national physical activity recommendations (i.e., 150+ minutes of MVPA/week) exhibited significantly greater (p <.05) physical activity-related self-efficacy than those not meeting these guidelines. Conclusions: Findings from this work highlight both the need for and the potential of supplementary physical activity and screen-viewing content in post-secondary ECE programs to benefit candidates' knowledge and self-efficacy in these areas. Introducing this content at the post-secondary level will ensure that all early childhood educators are appropriately trained regarding physical activity and screen-viewing before entering a childcare-based profession, where they can positively influence young children's health behaviours. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; blood pressure; Canada; chi square test; child; child care; child health; childhood; controlled study; cross-sectional study; education; education program; female; human; human experiment; infant; male; occupation; physical activity; practice guideline; rank sum test; screen time; statistics"
"Neural network and logistic regression diagnostic prediction models for giant cell arteritis: Development and validation","2019","Purpose: To develop and validate neural network (NN) vs logistic regression (LR) diagnostic prediction models in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). Design: Multicenter retrospective chart review. Methods: An audit of consecutive patients undergoing temporal artery biopsy (TABx) for suspected GCA was conducted at 14 international medical centers. The outcome variable was biopsy-proven GCA. The predictor variables were age, gender, headache, clinical temporal artery abnormality, jaw claudication, vision loss, diplopia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and platelet level. The data were divided into three groups to train, validate, and test the models. The NN model with the lowest false-negative rate was chosen. Internal and external validations were performed. Results: Of 1,833 patients who underwent TABx, there was complete information on 1,201 patients, 300 (25%) of whom had a positive TABx. On multivariable LR age, platelets, jaw claudication, vision loss, log C-reactive protein, log erythrocyte sedimentation rate, headache, and clinical temporal artery abnormality were statistically significant predictors of a positive TABx (P?0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve/Hosmer-Lemeshow P for LR was 0.867 (95% CI, 0.794, 0.917)/0.119 vs NN 0.860 (95% CI, 0.786, 0.911)/0.805, with no statistically significant difference of the area under the curves (P=0.316). The misclassification rate/false-negative rate of LR was 20.6%/47.5% vs 18.1%/30.5% for NN. Missing data analysis did not change the results. Conclusion: Statistical models can aid in the triage of patients with suspected GCA. Misclassification remains a concern, but cutoff values for 95% and 99% sensitivities are provided (https://goo.gl/THCnuU). ? 2019 Ing et al.","C reactive protein; age; aged; artery malformation; Article; artificial neural network; blood vessel biopsy; claudication; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diplopia; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; false negative result; female; giant cell arteritis; headache; human; jaw disease; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; medical record review; model; platelet count; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sex factor; temporal artery; validation study; visual impairment"

"Endocytosis of commensal antigens by intestinal epithelial cells regulates mucosal T cell homeostasis","2019","Commensal bacteria influence host physiology, without invading host tissues. We show that proteins from segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are transferred into intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) through adhesion-directed endocytosis that is distinct from the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of invasive pathogens. This process transfers microbial cell wall–associated proteins, including an antigen that stimulates mucosal T helper 17 (T H 17) cell differentiation, into the cytosol of IECs in a cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42)–dependent manner. Removal of CDC42 activity in vivo led to disruption of endocytosis induced by SFB and decreased epithelial antigen acquisition, with consequent loss of mucosal T H 17 cells. Our findings demonstrate direct communication between a resident gut microbe and the host and show that under physiological conditions, IECs acquire antigens from commensal bacteria for generation of T cell responses to the resident microbiota. 2017 ?

Design Analysis of an existing population-based cohort study. Setting Manitoba. Participants Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older. Main outcome measures Age, sex, education, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) scores were recorded for each patient. Multimorbidity was measured using a simple tally of self-reported diseases. Function was measured using the Older Americans Resources and Services scale in 1991 to 1992 and again 5 years later. Good or excellent level of function was compared with level of disability (mild or moderate or higher). Cross-sectional and prospective analyses were conducted. Results In a cross-sectional analysis, multimorbidity predicted disability. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) for disability was 1.45 (1.39 to 1.52) for each additional chronic illness. In models adjusting for age, sex, education, and MMSE and CES-D scores, the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 1.35 (1.29 to 1.42) for each additional chronic illness. Multimorbidity also predicted disability 5 years later. The unadjusted OR (95% CI) was 1.31 (1.24 to 1.38). In models adjusting for age, sex, education, and MMSE and CES-D scores in addition to baseline functional status, the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 1.15 (1.09 to 1.24).

"Lung cancer associated with cystic airspaces: Characteristic morphological features on CT in a series of 11 cases","2019","Purpose: To familiarize the reader with the entity ‘lung cancer associated with cystic airspaces’ (LC-CAS) and create an awareness about the potential for slow progressive development of cancer within these nonaggressive appearing cystic airspaces (CAS) encountered in routine radiology practice. Material and methods: Morphological appearances of (n = 11) LC-CAS detected during routine radiological reporting of chest CT scans were studied. Patient demographics, clinical history, characteristics of LC-CAS including location, size, wall thickening, diffuse nodularity, eccentric nodule, ground glass change, emphysema and pathology results were collected from the hospital's internal database. Results: Patients with LC-CAS (9F/2M) were between 49 and 77 years (mean 63.18 years). All patients (n = 11) had a history of smoking. LC-CAS had a characteristic multicystic bubbly appearance. Average size of CAS at initial detection of LC was 2.52 cm (range 1.3–4 cm). Lesions were located in the RLL (n = 4), RML (n = 2), RUL (n = 1), LLL (n = 1) and LUL (n = 3) with no lobar predilection and were more commonly peripheral (n = 7) than central (n = 4). Ground glass change (n = 2), extrinsic nodules (n = 4), diffuse wall nodularity (n = 3) and intrinsic nodules (n = 2) were observed and prompted biopsy. Lesions ranged between T1a to T4. Most cancers were T1a N0 (n = 5). Adenocarcinomas formed the majority of cases (n = 9). Conclusion: LC-CAS present as new development of diffuse nodularity, eccentric nodules or ground glass change associated with CAS. These are more commonly adenocarcinomas on histology. Recognition of CAS and appropriate malignancy workup when suspicious features are observed is essential to enable early detection of lung cancer. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Biological organs; Diseases; Glass; Morphology; Polyethylene terephthalates; Adenocarcinoma; Average size; Chest CT scans; Clinical history; Cystic airspace; Lung Cancer; Morphological features; Wall thickening; Computerized tomography; adult; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer localization; cancer staging; clinical article; clinical protocol; cystic airspace; demography; disease association; early diagnosis; female; follow up; histopathology; human; human tissue; image analysis; lung adenocarcinoma; lung biopsy; lung cancer; lung cyst; lung parenchyma; male; medical history; positron emission tomography; priority journal; radiation dose distribution; radiological parameters; retrospective study; thorax radiography; x-ray computed tomography; cyst; diagnostic imaging; lung; lung tumor; middle aged; pathology; procedures; x-ray computed tomography; air; Aged; Air; Cysts; Female; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"Structure of antimicrobial stewardship programs in leading US hospitals: Findings of a nationwide survey","2019","Background. To examine antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) structure among high-performing hospitals and determine which components of the 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/Society for Hospital Epidemiology of America (SHEA) ASP guidelines are implemented at each site. Methods. A survey of the highest-ranking hospitals, compiled from the 2015-2016 US News and World Report's Best Hospital Rankings, was conducted from August to December 2016. This corresponded to 138 adult and 62 pediatric unique hospitals. We inquired as to which components of the 2016 IDSA/SHEA ASP guidelines were implemented at each site. Appropriate persons at each hospital were emailed surveys after telephone or email conversations confirmed that they belonged to that hospital's ASP. Results. Overall, 101 of 200 hospitals responded (51%). Of these, 82% (n = 83/101) had an active ASP, and 59% (n = 47/80) were active for more than 5 years. Most report to a committee rather than to an individual (n = 68/80, 85%), do not have their own budget (n = 42/80, 53%), and selectively implement IDSA/SHEA recommendations. Additionally, the majority of ASPs in top hospitals follow aspects of The Joint Commission Standards for Antimicrobial Stewardship, which were released after the survey was administered. Conclusions. Of leading US hospitals responding to our survey, >80% had an ASP, and most implemented the majority of commitments, interventions, and optimization strategies suggested by IDSA/SHEA. Understanding the structure of ASPs in these hospitals will assist other hospitals in program implementation. ?

"Validity of a streamlined version of the Focus on the Outcomes of Communication Under Six: Process and outcome","2019","Background: The Focus on the Outcomes of Communication Under Six (FOCUS) is a 50-item outcome measure based on the framework and concepts of World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning. The FOCUS has been shown to capture participation-level changes associated with speech and language therapy in children 18 to 72?months old and has established validity and reliability. However, there were reasons to try to reduce the measure without losing any of its proven value as a change-detecting instrument. Methods: Using data from 18,931 preschool children, we used item response models and a test of redundancy to reduce the original 50-item FOCUS to 34 items. We then assessed the correlations between FOCUS-50 and FOCUS-34 scores on these children. Results: Findings show that a shortened (34-item) version of FOCUS can be treated as equivalent to the full 50-item version. Conclusion: The correlation between change scores on the two versions is.98. We suggest that in situations where only a total score is of interest, the FOCUS-34 can be used in place of the full FOCUS. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","article; child; female; human; human experiment; infant; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; validity"
"The value of surgical experience: excess costs associated with the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass learning curve","2019","Background: Gastric bypass has a steep learning curve that is associated with increased adverse outcomes and these adverse outcomes are associated with increases in cost. This study sought to quantify the effect of cumulative procedure volume on inpatient cost and characterize the excess cost associated with a surgeon’s learning curve. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 29 high-volume surgeons during the first 6?years of performing gastric bypass in a regionalized center of excellence system. Cumulative volume was determined using the procedure date and analyzed in blocks of 25 cases. The main outcomes of interest were inpatient cost for the initial hospital stay in 2014 Canadian dollars as well as prolonged length of stay (? 3?days). Results: Overall, 11,684 cases were identified from April 2009 to March 2015. After a surgeon’s 50th case, the adjusted inpatient cost decreased by $2775 (95% CI $? 4352 to $? 1204 p = 0.001) compared to the first 25 cases. Cost savings were maintained through a surgeon’s 400th case. The average cost savings after the 50th case was $2082 (95% CI $? 3194 to $? 962 p < 0.001) and the excess cost attributable to the first 50 cases was $104,077 (95%?CI?48,104 to 159,682) per surgeon. Surgeon experience was also associated with a decrease odds of prolonged length of stay. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the influence of surgeon experience on improved cost efficiencies. We also characterized that the average excess cost per surgeon of implementing gastric bypass was approximately $104,000. This is relevant to future health system planning as well as providing an economic incentive for impactful training interventions. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; bariatric surgery; controlled study; cost control; female; high volume surgeon; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; learning curve; length of stay; major clinical study; male; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; surgery"
"""Getting to the table"": Changing ideas about public and patient involvement in Canadian drug assessment","2019","Context: Involving patients and the public in health policy may contribute to legitimacy and accountability. However, tensions may arise between paradigms of scientific-evidence-based decision making and new ideas valuing inclusivity and patient experience when evaluating and allocating health resources. This article asks whether 10 years of experience with public and patient involvement in Canadian drug assessment has affected participants' ideas about how it works. Methods: The author surveyed the ideas of participants in the drug assessment process (members of expert committees, officials, and patient groups) as described in reports and hearings in 2005, 2007, and 2012 and conducted interviews in 2014 and 2016. Findings: The author found some consensus across groups of participants regarding the broad goals of health technology assessment (HTA) and the validity of some formof public and patient involvement.Therewere also important areas of disagreement and uncertainty about howpublic and patient involvement should be used in drug assessment and howmuch impact it has on deliberations and recommendations. Overall, uncertainly about the specific role for public and patient involvement in HTA limits the potential for ideational change among participants. Conclusions: These findings have implications for evaluation of public and patient involvement, the way we understand ideational change, and practical questions of communicating health resource decisions. ? 2019 by Duke University Press.",""
"Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Scores Improve After Prolapse Surgery Regardless of Surgical Approach but Not After Observation Alone","2019","Objective: To evaluate the effect of different surgical procedures on Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) scores in women with pelvic organ prolapse. Materials and Methods: Women with prolapse were enrolled from 2008 to 2014. Baseline data and outcomes at 1 year were collected including subscales of the PFDI. Patients who had surgery (SGY) within the first year were compared to those who did not (N-SGY). Subanalyses of SGY included vaginal vs abdominal, with or without concurrent hysterectomy (HYST, N-HYST), placement of mesh (MESH, N-MESH), and concurrent posterior repair/perineorrhaphy (POST, N-POST). Results: A total of 233/239 patients underwent surgery in the first year. For SGY vs N-SGY, SGY had significant improvements in PFDI and all subscale scores at 1 year while N-SGY did not. When comparing vaginal to abdominal approach, MESH to N-MESH and HYST to N-HYST, there were no differences between any scores at baseline or 1 year between the groups. However, all within group symptom scores improved from baseline to 1 year (P <.0001 for all). In comparing POST to N-POST, there were no differences between groups at 1 year in PFDI and Urogenital Distress Inventory and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory subscale scores. Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory scores were significantly higher at baseline for POST (P <.0001) but not at 1 year (P = 0.37). All within group scores statistically significant improved at 1 year. Conclusion: Women who underwent surgical repair for prolapse had significantly improved overall PFDI and subscale scores regardless of surgical approach and concurrent procedures. ? 2018","abdominal surgery; adult; Article; Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory Score; female; genital system disease assessment; gynecologic surgery; human; hysterectomy; major clinical study; outcome assessment; Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Score; pelvic organ prolapse; priority journal; scoring system; surgical approach; treatment indication; treatment outcome; treatment response; Urogenital Distress Inventory; aged; comparative study; middle aged; pathophysiology; pelvic organ prolapse; pelvis floor; procedures; prospective study; urologic surgery; watchful waiting; Aged; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pelvic Floor; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Watchful Waiting"
"Cardiotoxicities of Modern Treatments in Breast Cancer","2019","Purpose of review: This paper will focus on novel breast cancer therapies used in clinical practice today, as well as review our understanding of standard therapies and their potential impact on cardiovascular health. Recent findings: Established and novel treatments such as anthracyclines, HER2-targeted agents, and immunotherapy have contributed to improvements in breast cancer outcomes; however, these treatments may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular injury. The number of available breast cancer treatments continues to expand, as does the need for health care providers to understand the potential impact of these treatments on cardiovascular health. Summary: Collaborative approaches in the development of risk stratification, prevention, and surveillance strategies for patients exposed to established and novel breast cancer treatments will facilitate improvements in patient outcomes without compromising their cardiovascular health. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase 6; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; immunological antineoplastic agent; breast cancer; cancer hormone therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; cardiotoxicity; clinical outcome; clinical practice; drug efficacy; human; molecularly targeted therapy; primary prevention; Review; triple negative breast cancer"
"Barriers and facilitators to adopting high value practices and de-adopting low value practices in Canadian intensive care units: A multimethod study","2019","Objective: To compare and contrast illustrative examples of the adoption of high value practices and the de-adoption of low value practices. Design: (1) Retrospective, population-based audit of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis (high value practice) and albumin for fluid resuscitation (low value practice) and (2) cross-sectional survey of healthcare providers. Setting: Data were collected from nine adult medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) in two large Canadian cities. Patients are managed in these ICUs by a group of multiprofessional and multidisciplinary healthcare providers. Participants: Participants included 6946 ICU admissions and 309 healthcare providers from the same ICUs. Main outcome measures: (1) The use of LMWH for VTE prophylaxis (per cent ICU days) and albumin for fluid resuscitation (per cent of patients); and (2) provider knowledge of evidence underpinning these practices, and barriers and facilitators to adopt and de-adopt these practices. Results: LMWH was administered on 38.7% of ICU days, and 20.0% of patients received albumin. Most participants had knowledge of evidence underpinning VTE prophylaxis and fluid resuscitation (59.1% and 84.2%, respectively). Providers perceived these practices to be followed. The most commonly reported barrier to adoption was insufficient knowledge/understanding (32.8%), and to de-adoption was clinical leader preferences (33.2%). On-site education was the most commonly identified facilitator for adoption and de-adoption (67.8% and 68.6%, respectively). Conclusions: Despite knowledge of and self-reported adherence to best practices, the audit demonstrated opportunity to improve. Provider-reported barriers and facilitators to adoption and de-adoption are broadly similar. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","albumin; low molecular weight heparin; adoption; APACHE; Article; Canadian; clinical audit; clinical practice; content validity; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; face validity; female; fluid resuscitation; health care personnel; human; intensive care unit; international normalized ratio; major clinical study; male; nurse practitioner; observational study; partial thromboplastin time; physician; plasma exchange; questionnaire; retrospective study; test retest reliability; venous thromboembolism"
"Neutrophil and Monocyte Counts in Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia","2019","Background Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies activate platelets, monocytes and neutrophils. Despite these findings, it is unknown whether white blood cell (WBC) counts, including neutrophils and monocytes, are altered during HIT. Materials and Methods We evaluated changes in total WBC counts (including WBC subsets), in 50 post-cardiac surgery patients with serologically confirmed HIT (30 patients with HIT-associated thrombosis). Daily leukocyte counts were compared with those measured one day prior to HIT onset; WBC increases were classified as mild (20.0-49.9%), moderate (50.0-99.9%) or major (? 100% increase). We also compared changes in WBC counts in HIT patients with and without HIT-associated thrombosis, and non-HIT patients with thrombosis. Results Most (34/50 [68.0%]) patients with HIT developed WBC count increases (mild, 35.3%; moderate, 44.1%; major, 20.6%). The peak WBC count occurred on day 4 (median) of HIT, which corresponded to day 10 (median) post-surgery. Absolute neutrophil counts increased in most patients (38/50 [76.0%]); whereas absolute monocyte counts rose in some patients, the overall tendency was for the monocyte count to decrease during HIT. Unexpectedly, we found that the increase in total WBC counts, as well as in neutrophils, was seen mainly in patients who developed HIT-associated or non-HIT-associated thrombosis; in contrast, no difference in monocyte levels was seen in patients with or without thrombosis. Conclusion Leukocytosis and neutrophilia are commonly observed in patients with HIT, particularly in patients with HIT-associated thrombosis, as well as non-HIT patients with thrombosis. Thus, leukocytosis/neutrophilia should not infer automatically a diagnosis of infection or inflammation, when evaluating thrombocytopenia in heparin-exposed patients. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","corticosteroid; heparin; immunoglobulin G; anticoagulant agent; activated partial thromboplastin time; artery thrombosis; Article; bronchoscopy; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; clinical trial (topic); controlled study; enzyme immunoassay; heart surgery; hemodilution; heparin induced thrombocytopenia; hospitalization; human; human cell; kidney infarction; leukocyte differential count; leukocytosis; lymphocyte count; mediastinitis; monocyte count; neutrophil count; neutrophilia; platelet count; pneumonia; priority journal; release assay; retrospective study; thrombocyte activation; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; wound infection; adverse drug reaction; immunology; leukocyte count; metabolism; monocyte; neutropenia; neutrophil; thrombocytopenia; Anticoagulants; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Heparin; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Leukocytosis; Monocytes; Neutropenia; Neutrophils; Retrospective Studies; Thrombocytopenia; Thrombosis"
"Blended face-to-face and online/computer-based education approaches in chronic disease self-management: A critical interpretive synthesis","2019","Objective: To review the literature on chronic disease self-management programs that blend face-to-face and online/computer-based education design and delivery. Methods: A critical interpretive synthesis was conducted. Studies that described blended chronic disease self-management programs were reviewed. Two reviewers performed independent database searches, eligibility screening, and data extraction. Findings were synthesized using a conceptual mapping process. Results: Twelve articles were included in the final review. Studies focused on patients with diagnoses of diabetes, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Factors influencing the design and delivery of programs focused on patient characteristics (such as disease prognosis, time since diagnosis, social determinants of health, health literacy, and proficiency with online/computer-based technologies). Conclusions: Blended learning self-management programs should consider the suitability of programs in light of health conditions and patient characteristics. Individual patient needs can be identified through clinician-driven assessments, including collaborative goal setting and the selection of pertinent educational tools. Practice Implications: When considering the design and delivery of chronic disease self-management education programs, healthcare providers should consider three factors: 1) patient characteristics, 2) learning perspectives, and 3) design technology options that best meet patient abilities, clinician expertise, and administrative capacity. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","asthma; blended learning; chronic disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; diabetes mellitus; face to face support group; health literacy; health personnel attitude; human; online system; patient education; priority journal; prognosis; Review; self care; social determinants of health; technology"
"Establishing an Evidence Synthesis Capability for Psychological Health Topics in the Military Health System","2019","Background:To promote evidence-based health care, clinical providers and decision makers rely on scientific evidence to inform best practices.

"Tisagenlecleucel in adult relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","2019","Background: Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that is refractory to primary and secondline therapies or that has relapsed after stem-cell transplantation have a poor prognosis. The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel targets and eliminates CD19-expressing B cells and showed efficacy against B-cell lymphomas in a single-center, phase 2a study. Methods: We conducted an international, phase 2, pivotal study of centrally manufactured tisagenlecleucel involving adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were ineligible for or had disease progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary end point was the best overall response rate (i.e., the percentage of patients who had a complete or partial response), as judged by an independent review committee. Results: A total of 93 patients received an infusion and were included in the evaluation of efficacy. The median time from infusion to data cutoff was 14 months (range, 0.1 to 26). The best overall response rate was 52% (95% confidence interval, 41 to 62); 40% of the patients had complete responses, and 12% had partial responses. Response rates were consistent across prognostic subgroups. At 12 months after the initial response, the rate of relapse-free survival was estimated to be 65% (79% among patients with a complete response). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events of special interest included cytokine release syndrome (22%), neurologic events (12%), cytopenias lasting more than 28 days (32%), infections (20%), and febrile neutropenia (14%). Three patients died from disease progression within 30 days after infusion. No deaths were attributed to tisagenlecleucel, cytokine release syndrome, or cerebral edema. No differences between response groups in tumor expression of CD19 or immune checkpoint- related proteins were found. Conclusions: In this international study of CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults, high rates of durable responses were produced with the use of tisagenlecleucel.

"Clinical diagnosis of endometriosis: a call to action","2019","Endometriosis can have a profound impact on women's lives, including associated pain, infertility, decreased quality of life, and interference with daily life, relationships, and livelihood. The first step in alleviating these adverse sequelae is to diagnose the underlying condition. For many women, the journey to endometriosis diagnosis is long and fraught with barriers and misdiagnoses. Inherent challenges include a gold standard based on an invasive surgical procedure (laparoscopy) and diverse symptomatology, contributing to the well-established delay of 4–11 years from first symptom onset to surgical diagnosis. We believe that remedying the diagnostic delay requires increased patient education and timely referral to a women's healthcare provider and a shift in physician approach to the disorder. Endometriosis should be approached as a chronic, systemic, inflammatory, and heterogeneous disease that presents with symptoms of pelvic pain and/or infertility, rather than focusing primarily on surgical findings and pelvic lesions. Using this approach, symptoms, signs, and clinical findings of endometriosis are anticipated to become the main drivers of clinical diagnosis and earlier intervention. Combining these factors into a practical algorithm is expected to simplify endometriosis diagnosis and make the process accessible to more clinicians and patients, culminating in earlier effective management. The time has come to bridge disparities and to minimize delays in endometriosis diagnosis and treatment for the benefit of women worldwide. ? 2019 The Author(s)","algorithm; Article; clinical feature; delayed diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; endometriosis; family history; human; medical history; menstrual cycle; patient assessment; physical examination; predictive value; priority journal; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; chronic pain; complication; dysmenorrhea; dyspareunia; echography; endometriosis; female; female infertility; laparoscopy; pathophysiology; pelvic pain; time to treatment; Chronic Pain; Delayed Diagnosis; Dysmenorrhea; Dyspareunia; Endometriosis; Female; Humans; Infertility, Female; Laparoscopy; Pelvic Pain; Sensitivity and Specificity; Time-to-Treatment; Ultrasonography"
"Impact of blood pressure lowering, cholesterol lowering and their combination in Asians and non-Asians in those without cardiovascular disease: an analysis of the HOPE 3 study","2019","Background and design: There are limited data on the effects of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering in Asians at intermediate risk and no cardiovascular disease. We report an analysis of the effects of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering in Asians enrolled in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 3 (HOPE 3) trial. Methods: We randomly assigned 6241 Asians and 6464 non-Asians at intermediate risk without cardiovascular disease to candesartan 16 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or placebo and rosuvastatin 10 mg or placebo. The first co-primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular disease death, myocardial infarction and stroke. The second co-primary outcome additionally included heart failure, cardiac arrest and revascularisation. Median follow-up was 5.6 years. Results: Reduction in systolic blood pressure was less among Asians (4.3 vs. 7.7 mmHg for non-Asians, P &lt; 0.0001) mainly due to a lesser effect in Chinese (2.1 mmHg) than in other Asians (7.3 mmHg), reduction in the latter being similar to non-Asians. The effect on the composite outcomes was similar, with no significant benefits from blood pressure lowering for either Asians (Chinese or non-Chinese) or non-Asians. Rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a lesser degree in Asians (0.49 mmol/L (–19.1 mg/dL) compared with non-Asians 0.95 mmol/L (?36.7 mg/dL), P interaction &lt; 0.0004). Yet both groups had similar reductions in the two co-primary outcomes. There was no increase in permanent medication discontinuation due to muscle-related symptoms in either group. There was an excess in new diabetes in non-Asians (4.70% rosuvastatin, 3.52% placebo, P = 0.025) but not in Asians (3.02% rosuvastatin, 4.04% placebo, P = 0.0342), P interaction = 0021. Conclusions: Candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide had fewer effects in reducing blood pressure in Chinese and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a lesser extent in Asians compared with non-Asians. There was no overall reduction in clinical events with lowering blood pressure in either Asians or non-Asians, whereas there were clear and consistent benefits with lipid lowering in both. Despite extensive analyses, we have no obvious explanation for the observed findings. Future studies need to include larger numbers of individuals from different regions of the world to ensure that the results of trials are applicable globally. ?

"Associations between lung and endothelial function in early middle age","2020","Background and objective: Chronic lung disease is associated with impaired endothelial function and this may be a risk factor for poor cardiovascular health. It is unknown if there is an association between lung and endothelial function in the general population. We investigated associations between lung and endothelial function in a population-based cohort of 38-year-old men and women. Methods: Systemic endothelial function was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry to calculate the Framingham reactive hyperaemia index. Lung function was assessed using spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, airway conductance and gas transfer. Associations between lung and endothelial function were assessed with and without adjustment for potential confounding factors using regression analyses. Results: Sex modified the association between lung and endothelial function. Among women, lower values of pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, total lung capacity and functional residual capacity (FRC) were associated with worse endothelial function (P &lt; 0.05). These associations persisted after adjustment for smoking, asthma diagnoses, fitness and body mass index. Associations were weaker among men: only FRC, airway conductance and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratios were associated with endothelial function. Endothelial function was not associated with gas transfer in either sex. Conclusion: Lower lung volumes and airflow obstruction are associated with endothelial dysfunction among women. There is weaker evidence for an association between airway and endothelial function in men. These findings may partly explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease among people with poor lung function, but suggest that there are sex differences in this association. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology","bronchodilating agent; respiratory tract agent; adult; airway conductance; airway obstruction; Article; asthma; body mass; clinical assessment tool; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; endothelial dysfunction; female; fitness; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; Framingham reactive hyperaemia index; functional assessment; functional residual capacity; human; hyperemia; lung diffusion; lung disease; lung volume; major clinical study; male; middle aged; peripheral arterial tonometry; plethysmography; population research; priority journal; smoking; spirometry; total lung capacity; vascular endothelium"
"Cesarean Delivery and Healthcare Utilization and Costs in the Offspring: A Retrospective Cohort Study","2019","Objective: To examine the association between cesarean delivery and healthcare utilization and costs in offspring from birth until age 7 years. Study design: A retrospective cohort study of singleton term births in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia between 2003 and 2007 followed until age 7 years was conducted using data from the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database and administrative health data. The main exposure was mode of delivery (cesarean delivery vs vaginal birth); the outcome was healthcare utilization and costs during the first 7 years of life. Associations were modeled using multiple regression adjusting for maternal prepregnancy weight and sociodemographic factors. Results: In total, 32 464 births were included in the analysis. Compared with children born by vaginal birth, children born by cesarean delivery had more physician visits (incidence rate ratio 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.08) and longer hospital stays (incidence rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21) and were more likely to be high utilizers of physician visits (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.37). Physician and hospital costs were $775 higher for children born by cesarean delivery compared with vaginal birth. Conclusions: Cesarean delivery compared with vaginal birth is associated with small but statistically significant increases in healthcare utilization and costs during the first 7 years of life. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","article; cesarean section; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; health care utilization; hospital cost; hospitalization; human; incidence; multiple regression; Nova Scotia; obstetrics; physician; progeny; retrospective study; term birth; vaginal delivery"
"Use of Minimally Invasive Tubular Retractors for Foramen Magnum Decompression of Chiari Malformation: A Technical Note and Case Series","2019","Background: An intraoperative technique for foramen magnum decompression of Chiari malformation is presented. The technique uses minimal exposure tubular retractors attached to a flexible arm to keep the retractor in a fixed position, while allowing flexible angulation under fluoroscopic guidance. Methods: Operations were performed between 2009 and 2018 on 22 patients with cerebellar tonsillar descent below the foramen magnum and a diagnosis of type I Chiari malformation. A linear durotomy was necessary, but only the outer layer of the dura was opened for some patients, which is less invasive than the traditional procedure where a durotomy is performed for both the inner and outer layers, and then a duraplasty is performed. Results: The approach allowed access to a wide working area, minimized soft tissue exposure, and optimized extent of decompression. The postoperative imaging demonstrated satisfactory bony removal, and magnetic resonance imaging of the area with cerebrospinal (CSF) flow study showed good CSF flow across the foramen magnum. There was a low incidence of postoperative complications, and the average length of hospital stay was 1 day. For 19 of 22 cases, the symptoms completely resolved or markedly improved, and each of the patients who attended the last follow-up demonstrated syrinx resolution. Conclusions: Based on our experience with this technique, when used to assist in foramen magnum decompression of Chiari malformation I, the minimally invasive tubular retractor is a useful tool, providing the surgeon with enhanced visualization of the operative field, while reducing potential damage to tissue and optimizing surgical outcomes. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; airway obstruction; Arnold Chiari malformation; Article; ataxia; ataxic gait; brain decompression; case report; central sleep apnea syndrome; cerebrospinal fluid flow; clinical article; conservative treatment; dizziness; dysarthria; dysphagia; endotracheal intubation; face pain; faintness; female; follow up; foramen magnum; general anesthesia; hand paresthesia; headache; hernia; hospitalization; human; hyperalgesia; hyperreflexia; male; medical history; middle aged; minimally invasive surgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; palliative therapy; physical examination; physiotherapy; postoperative pain; proprioception; soft tissue; spinous process; Valsalva maneuver; vibration disease; aged; Arnold Chiari malformation; ataxia; complication; decompression surgery; devices; diagnostic imaging; dizziness; dura mater; dysarthria; face pain; foramen magnum; headache; length of stay; minimally invasive surgery; neurosurgery; pathological reflex; procedures; traction therapy; young adult; Adult; Aged; Arnold-Chiari Malformation; Ataxia; Decompression, Surgical; Dizziness; Dura Mater; Dysarthria; Facial Pain; Female; Foramen Magnum; Headache; Humans; Length of Stay; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Neurosurgical Procedures; Reflex, Abnormal; Traction; Young Adult"
"Body mass index and mortality in subjects with ards: Post-hoc analysis of the OSCILLATE trial","2019","BACKGROUND: Studies on the association of obesity with mortality in subjects with ARDS have yielded inconsistent results. METHODS: In a sub-analysis of the Oscillation for ARDS Treated Early (OSCILLATE) randomized controlled trial, 451 subjects were divided into 5 strata based on their body mass index (BMI) using the World Health Organization definitions: underweight &lt; 18.5 kg/m2; normal weight 18.5–24.99 kg/m2; overweight 25–29.99 kg/m2; obese 30–39.99 kg/m2; severely obese &gt; 40 kg/m2. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality across BMI strata for all subjects and for the 2 study arms (high-frequency oscillatory ventilation [HFOV] vs conventional ventilation) separately using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Hospital mortality was not different across the BMI strata for all subjects (P = .86), for the HFOV arm (P = .94) or for the conventional ventilation arm (P = .59). After risk adjustment, BMI was not associated with increased risk for hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.97–1.04, P = .67), whereas HFOV was independently associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.11– 2.72, P = .02) with no effect modification by BMI strata (for this interaction, P = .56). Although there was no difference in the use of rescue therapies or in the number of days on sedation or analgesia, higher daily doses of fentanyl and midazolam were administered as BMI increased. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in adjusted hospital mortality across BMI strata in subjects with moderate to severe ARDS. Processes of care were not different across BMI strata except for higher daily doses of fentanyl as BMI increased. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT0150640). ? 2019 Daedalus Enterprises.",""
"cTAZ: a safeguard factor of antiviral response","2019","The antiviral response is a tightly regulated process that follows specific patterns of timing and duration. The type I interferon-induced antiviral pathway is driven by JAK-STAT signalling. This is characterized by the dimerization of the receptor upon ligand binding, inducing cytoplasmic protein–protein interactions between phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2, dimerization and nuclear translocation, which leads to the formation of a trimeric transcriptional competent complex, followed by INF-inducible gene expression. Aberrant activation and timing of JAK-STAT signalling might result in autoimmune disease. This implies that the strict regulation of this signalling pathway is essential to prevent pathological consequences. In this issue of EMBO Reports, Fang et?al [1] describe an alternative variant of TAZ, called cTAZ, which fine-tunes JAK-STAT signalling, thereby contributing to the tight control of antiviral responses. ? 2019 The Authors","ctaz protein; cytoplasm protein; interferon; lead; protein; receptor; STAT1 protein; STAT2 protein; transcription factor; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; adaptive immunity; antiviral activity; apoptosis; autoimmune disease; cancer associated fibroblast; cell density; cell metabolism; cell migration; cell proliferation; dimerization; disease exacerbation; disease resistance; gene expression; hippo signaling; human; innate immunity; JAK-STAT signaling; ligand binding; Note; organ size; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein structure; signal transduction; Th17 cell; cellular, subcellular and molecular biological phenomena and functions; Antiviral Agents; Biological Phenomena; Signal Transduction"
"Fine-mapping of 98 obesity loci in Mexican children","2019","Background/objectives: Mexico has one of the highest prevalence of childhood obesity in the world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obesity have identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in populations of European, East Asian, and African descent. The contribution of these loci to obesity in Mexican children is unclear. We assessed the transferability of 98 obesity loci in Mexican children and fine-mapped the association signals. Subjects/methods: The study included 405 and 390 Mexican children with normal weight and obesity. Participants were genotyped with a genome-wide dense SNP array designed for Latino populations, allowing for the analysis of GWAS index SNPs as well as fine-mapping SNPs, totaling 750 SNPs covering 98 loci. Two genetic risk scores (GRS) were constructed: a “discovery GRS” and a “best-associated GRS”, representing the number of effect alleles at the GWAS index SNPs and at the best-associated SNPs after fine-mapping for each subject. Results: Seventeen obesity loci were significantly associated with obesity, and five had fine-mapping SNPs significantly better associated with obesity than their corresponding GWAS index SNPs in Mexican children. Six obesity-associated SNPs significantly departed from additive to dominant (N = 5) or recessive (N = 1) models, and a significant interaction was found between rs274609 (TNNI3K) and rs1010553 (ITIH4) on childhood obesity risk. The best-associated GRS was significantly more associated with childhood obesity (OR = 1.21 per additional risk allele [95%CI:1.17–1.25], P = 4.8 × 10 ?25 ) than the discovery GRS (OR = 1.05 per additional risk allele [95%CI:1.02–1.08], P = 8.0 × 10 ?4 ), and was also associated with waist-to-hip ratio, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and triglyceride levels, the association being mediated by obesity. An overall depletion of obesity risk alleles was observed in Mexican children with normal weight when compared to GWAS discovery populations. Conclusions: Our study indicates a partial transferability of GWAS obesity loci in Mexican children, and supports the pertinence of post-GWAS fine-mapping experiments in the admixed Mexican population. ? 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.","cholesterol; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; allele; Article; body mass; body weight; child; childhood obesity; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; female; gene frequency; gene interaction; genetic risk; genome-wide association study; genotype; heterozygosity; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; hip circumference; human; inheritance; insulin blood level; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; major clinical study; male; Mexican; prevalence; priority journal; quality control; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; triacylglycerol blood level; triacylglycerol level; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; adolescent; blood; diet restriction; gene locus; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; lifestyle; Mexico; obesity; single nucleotide polymorphism; socioeconomics; Adolescent; Child; Fasting; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Life Style; Male; Mexico; Obesity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Socioeconomic Factors"
"Mixed exercise training for adults with fibromyalgia","2019","Background Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review is one of a series of reviews about exercise training for fibromyalgia that will replace the review titled ""Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome"", which was first published in 2002. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of mixed exercise training protocols that include two or more types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, flexibility) for adults with fibromyalgia against control (treatment as usual, wait list control), non exercise (e.g. biofeedback), or other exercise (e.g. mixed versus flexibility) interventions. Specific comparisons involvingmixed exercise versus other exercises (e.g. resistance, aquatic, aerobic, flexibility, andwhole body vibration exercises) were not assessed. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thesis and Dissertations Abstracts, the Allied and ComplementaryMedicine Database (AMED), the Physiotherapy Evidence Databese (PEDro), Current Controlled Trials (to 2013), WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to December 2017, unrestricted by language, to identify all potentially relevant trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia that compared mixed exercise interventions with other or no exercise interventions. Major outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQL), pain, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 29 RCTs (2088 participants; 98% female; average age 51 years) that compared mixed exercise interventions (including at least two of the following: aerobic or cardiorespiratory, resistance or muscle strengthening exercise, and flexibility exercise) versus control (e.g. wait list), non-exercise (e.g. biofeedback), and other exercise interventions. Design flaws across studies led to selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting biases. We prioritised the findings of mixed exercise compared to control and present them fully here. Twenty-one trials (1253 participants) provided moderate-quality evidence for all major outcomes but stiffness (low quality). With the exception of withdrawals and adverse events, major outcome measures were self-reported and expressed on a 0 to 100 scale (lower values are best, negative mean differences (MDs) indicate improvement; we used a clinically important difference between groups of 15% relative difference). Results for mixed exercise versus control show that mean HRQL was 56 and 49 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (13 studies; 610 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (3% better to 11% better) and relative improvement of 12%(6%better to 18%better).Mean pain was 58.6 and 53 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (15 studies; 832 participants) with absolute improvement of 5% (1% better to 9% better) and relative improvement of 9% (3% better to 15% better). Mean fatigue was 72 and 59 points in the control and exercise groups, respectively (1 study; 493 participants) with absolute improvement of 13% (8% better to 18% better) and relative improvement of 18% (11% better to 24% better). Mean stiffness was 68 and 61 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (5 studies; 261 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (1% better to 12% better) and relative improvement of 9% (1% better to 17% better). Mean physical function was 49 and 38 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (9 studies; 477 participants) with absolute improvement of 11% (7% better to 15% better) and relative improvement of 22% (14% better to 30% better). Pooled analysis resulted in a moderate-quality risk ratio for all-cause withdrawals with similar rates across groups (11 per 100 and 12 per 100 in the control and intervention groups, respectively) (19 studies; 1065 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.51) with an absolute change of 1% (3% fewer to 5% more) and a relative change of 11% (28% fewer to 47% more). Across all 21 studies, no injuries or other adverse events were reported; however some participants experienced increased fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, soreness, or tiredness) during or after exercise.However due to low event rates, we are uncertain of the precise risks with exercise. Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and physical function and may decrease pain and fatigue; allcause withdrawal was similar across groups, and mixed exercises may slightly reduce stiffness. For fatigue, physical function, HRQL, and stiffness, we cannot rule in or out a clinically relevant change, as the confidence intervals include both clinically important and unimportant effects. We found very low-quality evidence on long-term effects. In eight trials, HRQL, fatigue, and physical function improvement persisted at 6 to 52 or more weeks post intervention but improvements in stiffness and pain did not persist. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. It is uncertain whethermixed versus other non-exercise or other exercise interventions improveHRQL and physical function or decrease symptoms because the quality of evidence was very low. The interventions were heterogeneous, and results were often based on small single studies. Adverse events with these interventions were not measured, and thus uncertainty surrounds the risk of adverse events. Authors' conclusions Compared to control,moderate-quality evidence indicates thatmixed exercise probably improvesHRQL, physical function, and fatigue, but this improvement may be small and clinically unimportant for some participants; physical function shows improvement in all participants. Withdrawal was similar across groups. Low-quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. Very low-quality evidence indicates that we are 'uncertain' whether the long-term effects of mixed exercise are maintained for all outcomes; all-cause withdrawals and adverse events were notmeasured. Compared to other exercise or non-exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise because we found only very low-quality evidence obtained from small, very heterogeneous trials. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar withdrawal rates across groups), evidence on adverse events is scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety.We downgraded the evidence from these trials due to imprecision (small trials), selection bias (e.g. allocation), blinding of participants and care providers or outcome assessors, and selective reporting. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

"Association of estimated sleep duration and naps with mortality and cardiovascular events: A study of 116 632 people from 21 countries","2019","Aims To investigate the association of estimated total daily sleep duration and daytime nap duration with deaths and major cardiovascular events. Methods We estimated the durations of total daily sleep and daytime naps based on the amount of time in bed and self- and results reported napping time and examined the associations between them and the composite outcome of deaths and major cardiovascular events in 116 632 participants from seven regions. After a median follow-up of 7.8 years, we recorded 4381 deaths and 4365 major cardiovascular events. It showed both shorter (&lt;_6 h/day) and longer (&gt;8 h/day) estimated total sleep durations were associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome when adjusted for age and sex. After adjustment for demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviours and health status, a J-shaped association was observed. Compared with sleeping 6–8 h/day, those who slept &lt;_6 h/day had a non-significant trend for increased risk of the composite outcome [hazard ratio (HR), 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–1.20]. As estimated sleep duration increased, we also noticed a significant trend for a greater risk of the composite outcome [HR of 1.05 (0.99–1.12), 1.17 (1.09–1.25), and 1.41 (1.30–1.53) for 8–9 h/day, 9–10 h/day, and &gt;10 h/day, Ptrend &lt; 0.0001, respectively]. The results were similar for each of all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events. Daytime nap duration was associated with an increased risk of the composite events in those with over 6 h of nocturnal sleep duration, but not in shorter nocturnal sleepers (&lt;_6 h). Conclusion Estimated total sleep duration of 6–8 h per day is associated with the lowest risk of deaths and major cardiovascular events. Daytime napping is associated with increased risks of major cardiovascular events and deaths in those with &gt;6 h of nighttime sleep but not in those sleeping &lt;_6 h/night. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"Mental health in elite athletes: International Olympic Committee consensus statement (2019)","2019","Mental health symptoms and disorders are common among elite athletes, may have sport related manifestations within this population and impair performance. Mental health cannot be separated from physical health, as evidenced by mental health symptoms and disorders increasing the risk of physical injury and delaying subsequent recovery. There are no evidence or consensus based guidelines for diagnosis and management of mental health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes. Diagnosis must differentiate character traits particular to elite athletes from psychosocial maladaptations. Management strategies should address all contributors to mental health symptoms and consider biopsychosocial factors relevant to athletes to maximise benefit and minimise harm. Management must involve both treatment of affected individual athletes and optimising environments in which all elite athletes train and compete. To advance a more standardised, evidence based approach to mental health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes, an International Olympic Committee Consensus Work Group critically evaluated the current state of science and provided recommendations. ?

"Antiplatelet therapy and coronary artery bypass grafting: Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis","2019","INTRODUCTION: Saphenous vein graft (SVG) is the most common conduit used for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Unfortunately, SVG are associated with poor long-term patency rates; a significant predictor of re-operation rates and survival. As such, medical therapy to prevent SVG narrowing or occlusion is of paramount importance. Aspirin (ASA) monotherapy is the standard of care after CABG, to improve long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and graft patency. Benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) have not been well established in all CABG patients. We present a protocol for a network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the effects of various antiplatelet therapy regimens on SVG patency, mortality, and bleeding among adult patients following CABG. METHODS: We will search CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL ACPJC, and grey literature sources (AHA, ACC, ESC, and CCC conference proceedings, ISRCTN Register, and WHO ICTRP) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiplatelet regimens at least 3-months after CABG and have any of SVG patency, mortality, MACE, and major bleeding as outcomes will be selected. We will perform title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction independently and in duplicate. Two independent reviewers will also assess risk of bias (ROB) for each study, as well as evaluate quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. We will use R to perform the NMA and use low-dose ASA as reference within our network. We will report results as odds ratios with confidence intervals for direct comparisons, and credible intervals for indirect or mixed comparisons. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to estimate the ranking of interventions. DISCUSSION: Given the limited direct comparison of various antiplatelet regimens, a network approach is ideal to clarify the optimum antiplatelet therapy after CABG. We hope that our NMA will be the largest quantitative synthesis evaluating antiplatelet regimens among patients requiring CABG. It should inform clinicians and guideline developers in selecting the most effective and safest antiplatelet regimen.Systematic Review registration: International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)-CRD42019127695.","antithrombocytic agent; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; human; mortality; network meta-analysis; procedures; saphenous vein; transplantation; treatment outcome; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Saphenous Vein; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Treatment Outcome"
"Introduction to Brain Tumor Stem Cells","2019","From stem cells, to the cancer stem cell hypothesis and intratumoral heterogeneity, the following introductory chapter on brain tumor stem cells explores the history of normal and cancerous stem cells, and their implication in the current model of brain tumor development. The origins of stem cells date back to the 1960s, when they were first described as cells capable of self-renewal, extensive proliferation, and differentiation. Since then, many advances have been made and adult stem cells are now known to be present in a very wide variety of tissues. Neural stem cells were subsequently discovered 30 years later, which was shortly followed by the discovery of cancer stem cells in leukemia and in brain tumors over the next decade, effectively enabling a new understanding of cancer. Since then, many markers including CD133, brain cancer stem cells have been implicated in a variety of phenomena including intratumoral heterogeneity on the genomic, cellular, and functional levels, tumor initiation, chemotherapy-resistance, radiation-resistance, and are believed to be ultimately responsible for tumor relapse. Understanding this small and rare population of cells could be the key to solving the great enigma that is cancer. ?

"Downregulation of CYB5D2 is associated with breast cancer progression","2019","We report here that CYB5D2 is associated with tumor suppression function in breast cancer (BC). CYB5D2 expression was significantly reduced in tamoxifen resistant MCF7 cells and in MCF7 cell-derived xenografts treated with TAM. CYB5D2 overexpression induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells; CYB5D2 knockdown enhanced MCF7 cell proliferation. Using the TCGA and Curtis datasets within the Oncomine database, CYB5D2 mRNA expression was downregulated in primary BCs vs breast tissues and HER2-positive or triple negative BCs vs estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BCs. Using the TCGA and Metabric datasets (n = 817 and n = 2509) within cBioPortal, 660 and 4891 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in relation to CYB5D2 were identified. These DEGs were enriched in pathways governing cell cycle progression, progesterone-derived oocyte maturation, oocyte-meiosis, estrogen-mediated S-phase entry, and DNA metabolism. CYB5D2 downregulation decreased overall survival (OS, p = 0.0408). A CYB5D2-derived 21-gene signature was constructed and robustly correlated with OS shortening (p = 5.72e-12), and independently predicted BC deaths (HR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.08–1.52; p = 0.004) once adjusting for known clinical factors. CYB5D2 reductions displayed relationship with mutations in PIK3CA, GATA3, MAP3K1, CDH1, TP53 and RB1. Impressively, 85% (560/659) of TP53 mutations occurred in the 21-gene signature-positive BC. Collectively, we provide the first evidence that CYB5D2 is a candidate tumor suppressor of BC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The Impact of Excluding Patients with End-Stage Knee Disease in Intra-Articular Hyaluronic Acid Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","Introduction: The Kellgren–Lawrence (K–L) grade is the most commonly used measure of radiographic disease severity in knee osteoarthritis (OA). Studies suggest that intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IA-HA) should only be considered in cases of early stage knee OA. The purpose of this review was to determine if trials administering IA-HA in early-moderate knee OA patients demonstrated greater pain relief than studies that also included patients with end-stage disease. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing IA-HA with saline injections and that diagnosed disease severity using the K–L grade criteria. The primary outcome was mean change in pain from baseline at 4–13?weeks and 22–27?weeks. Safety was evaluated on the total number of participants experiencing a treatment-related adverse event (AE). Results: Twenty RCTs were included. In the early-moderate OA subgroup, the mean change in pain scores was statistically significant favoring IA-HA from baseline to 4–13?weeks [SMD = ??0.30, 95% CI ??0.44 to ??0.15, p < 0.0001] and within 22–27?weeks [SMD = ??0.27, 95% CI ??0.39 to ??0.16, p < 0.00001]. No significant differences were observed in the late OA subgroup. IA-HA was associated with a significantly greater risk of treatment-related AEs relative to saline in the late OA subgroup [RR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.16–2.67, p = 0.008]. Conclusion: IA-HA provides significant pain relief compared to saline for patients with early-moderate knee OA, compared to cohorts including patients with end-stage OA (KL grade 4), with no increase in the risk of treatment-related AEs, up to 6?months. Patients with end-stage disease had lower levels of pain relief and may be diluting study results if included in the treatment cohort.

"Strengthening Noncommunicable Disease Research Capacity and Chronic Disease Outcomes in Low- and Middle-Income Countries in South Asia: Implementation and Evaluation of the ASCEND Program","2019","This article describes the design, outcomes, challenges, and lessons learned from the ASian Collaboration for Excellence in Non-Communicable Disease (ASCEND) program, implemented between 2011 and 2015 in India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. The program involved a blended-delivery model, incorporating online and face-to-face training, mentoring, and supervision of trainees’ research projects. Evaluation data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Intended outcomes, lessons, and challenges were summarized using a logic model. During the program period, 48 participants were trained over 2 cohorts in June 2011 and 2012. The trainees published 83 peer-reviewed articles between 2011 and 2015. Additionally, 154 presentations were given by trainees at national and international conferences. Underutilization of the online learning management system was an important challenge. Utilizing a combination of intensive face-to-face and online learning and mentoring of early career researchers in low- and middle-income countries has great potential to enhance the research capacity, performance, and outputs. ? 2019 APJPH.",""
"Cortical thickness correlates of cognitive performance in cognitively-matched individuals with and without schizophrenia","2019","Schizophrenia is characterized by psychosis and, in most cases, cognitive impairment. It is unclear, however, whether these elements of the disorder represent distinct or related disease processes. Accordingly, this study investigated 3-way interactions between group, cognition and cortical thickness in cognitively-matched patients with schizophrenia and healthy control groups. Patients and healthy controls were group-matched on demographics and a broadly-based index of cognitive performance. T1-weighted images were processed using Freesurfer. Variable selection techniques were applied to determine which regions best predicted 3-way interaction effects. Independent variables included age, sex, IQ, and 87 regional cortical thickness values strongly associated with group or cognition. Antipsychotic treatment effects were also investigated. Twenty regions were selected by the best fitting model. The top 6 regions included the left pre- and post-central, left superior frontal and temporal and right rostral and caudal middle frontal cortices. No antipsychotic treatment effects were seen. Cortical thinning in schizophrenia exists even in the absence of cognitive impairment. Our findings support the separation of psychosis and cognitive impairment as independent disease processes, with distinct relations with cortical thickness in prefrontal cortical areas. Parsing out these two disease processes will increase understanding of heterogeneity in schizophrenia and may modify treatment targets. ? 2019","neuroleptic agent; neuroleptic agent; adult; Article; brain region; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; correlational study; cortical thickness (brain); disease association; drug effect; female; frontal cortex; human; intelligence quotient; male; mental performance; neuroimaging; priority journal; schizophrenia; temporal cortex; brain cortex; case control study; cognition; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; prefrontal cortex; procedures; schizophrenia; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Prefrontal Cortex; Schizophrenia"

"Physical activity and trajectories of cardiovascular health indicators during early childhood","2019","OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease prevention should begin in childhood. However, the influence of physical activity on cardiovascular health in early childhood is unknown. Our purpose in this study was to determine the effect of physical activity on trajectories of cardiovascular health indicators during early childhood. METHODS: This prospective, observational cohort study (Health Outcomes and Physical Activity in Preschoolers) enrolled 418 3- to 5-year-olds with annual assessments for 3 years. Total physical activity (TPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were measured over 7 days via accelerometry. Cardiovascular health indicators included cardiovascular fitness (exercise time on a maximal treadmill test [treadmill time] and 1-minute heart rate recovery), resting arterial stiffness (whole-body pulse wave velocity and carotid b stiffness index), and seated systolic blood pressure. Data were analyzed by using linear mixed-effects modeling; effects are reported as unstandardized estimates (Est). RESULTS: There were main effects of TPA and MVPA on treadmill time (Est = 0.004 [P = .005] and 0.008 [P = .001], respectively) and heart rate recovery (Est = 0.05 [P < .001] and 0.08 [P < .001], respectively). There was a main effect of TPA on pulse wave velocity (Est = -0.001; P = .02) and an MVPA × time interaction (Est = -0.002; P = .01). For carotid β stiffness index, the effect of a TPA × time interaction was not significant (Est = -0.002; P = .051); however, there was a significant MVPA × time interaction (Est = -0.003; P = .03). MVPA was associated with a slower rate of change in systolic blood pressure for girls (Est = 0.06; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: Children who engage in higher levels of physical activity during early childhood have better cardiovascular health indicators, with more intense physical activity (ie, MVPA) attenuating the stiffening of arteries. ? 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.","accelerometry; anthropometry; arterial stiffness; Article; Canada; cardiovascular disease; child; child health care; diastolic blood pressure; female; heart rate; heart rate recovery; human; male; moderate to vigorous physical activity; multicenter study; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; pulse wave; systolic blood pressure; total physical activity; treadmill exercise; blood pressure; brachial artery; cardiorespiratory fitness; carotid artery; exercise; exercise test; physiology; preschool child; Accelerometry; Blood Pressure; Brachial Artery; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Carotid Arteries; Child, Preschool; Exercise; Exercise Test; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Pulse Wave Analysis; Vascular Stiffness"
"Potential Benefit of Lymph Node Dissection During Radical Nephroureterectomy for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Systematic Review by the European Association of Urology Guidelines Panel on Non–muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer","2019","Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) represents an infrequent malignancy that carries a poor prognosis, with a high risk of lymphatic spread and subsequent disease progression. Template-based, complete lymph node dissection (LND) improves cancer-specific survival in patients with high-stage (?pT2) UTUC and reduces the risk of local recurrence. LND improves survival in patients with high-stage disease of the renal pelvis if it is performed according to an anatomical template-based approach. ? 2017 European Association of UrologyContext: The oncological efficacy of routine lymphadenectomy (lymph node dissection [LND]) at the time of radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) remains controversial. Objective: To systematically review the available literature assessing the impact of LND in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients. Evidence acquisition: Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases were searched for all studies comparing outcomes of patients undergoing RNU without LND versus any form of LND. We identified nine retrospective studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. We took cancer-specific survival (CSS) as the primary end point, and performed a narrative review and risk of bias assessment. Evidence synthesis: Six studies compared outcomes of no LND versus LND. Three studies compared complete LND versus incomplete LND versus no LND. The incidence of pN+ in patients with high-stage (?pT2) tumours ranged from 14.3% to 40%. Pre- and postoperative characteristics differed among the study groups, potentially biasing the results, as demonstrated by the risk of bias assessment, potentially favouring the LND group. Oncological outcomes such as cancer-specific, overall, recurrence-free, and metastasis-free survival were reviewed, demonstrating a survival benefit with LND in high-stage disease of the renal pelvis. Conclusions: Template-based and complete LND improves CSS in patients with high-stage (?pT2) UTUC and reduces the risk of local recurrence. The impact of LND in ureteral tumours remains uncertain. Patient summary: Studies comparing radical nephroureterectomy with or without the removal of nodes (lymph node dissection [LND]) were analysed. LND improves survival in patients with high-stage disease of the renal pelvis, if it is performed according to an anatomical template-based approach. ? 2017 European Association of Urology","cancer prognosis; cancer specific survival; cancer survival; clinical practice; clinical protocol; human; lymph node dissection; nephroureterectomy; non muscle invasive bladder cancer; outcome assessment; overall survival; postoperative period; practice guideline; preoperative period; progression free survival; radical nephroureterectomy; Review; systematic review; transitional cell carcinoma; adult; adverse event; aged; bladder tumor; cancer staging; comparative study; disease free survival; epidemiology; Europe; female; kidney pelvis; lymph node; lymph node dissection; male; middle aged; nephroureterectomy; organization and management; pathology; procedures; retrospective study; statistical bias; transitional cell carcinoma; ureter tumor; urology; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bias; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Disease-Free Survival; Europe; Female; Humans; Kidney Pelvis; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Nephroureterectomy; Retrospective Studies; Ureteral Neoplasms; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Urology"
"Current perspectives on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma: Challenges and opportunities","2019","Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is on the rise due to the prevalence of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Although there are surgical and chemotherapy treatment avenues the mortality rate of HCC remains high. Immunotherapy is currently the new frontier of cancer treatment and the immunobiology of HCC is emerging as an area for further exploration. The tumor microenvironment coexists and interacts with various immune cells to sustain the growth of HCC. Thus, immunosuppressive cells play an important role in the anti-tumor immune response. This review will discuss the current concepts of immunosuppressive cells, including tumor-associated macrophages, marrow-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated neutrophils, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and regulatory T cell interactions to actively promote tumorigenesis.

"Efficacy and Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Risk of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism","2019","Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for preventing primary and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to summarize the most up-to-date evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our primary outcomes included the benefit outcome (VTE) and safety outcome (major bleeding). A random-effects model was used to pool the relative risks (RRs) for data syntheses. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool was used to evaluate the quality of the entire body of evidence across studies. We included 11 RCTs with a total of 3741 patients with cancer for analyses. The DOACs were significantly related with a reduced risk of VTE when compared with non-DOACs: RR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.99, P = .04. Nonsignificant trend towards a higher risk of major bleeding was found in DOACs: RR = 1.28 95% CI: 0.81-2.02, P = .29. The quality of the entire body of evidence was graded as moderate for risk of VTE, and low for risk of major bleeding. To summarize, DOACs were found to have a favorable effect on risk of VTE but a nonsignificant higher risk of major bleeding compared with non-DOACs in patients with cancer. The safety effect of DOACs in patients with cancer requires further evaluation in adequately powered and designed studies.","anticoagulant agent; bleeding; comparative study; complication; human; neoplasm; oral drug administration; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; venous thromboembolism; Administration, Oral; Anticoagulants; Hemorrhage; Humans; Neoplasms; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Venous Thromboembolism"
"Developing a coordinated Canadian post-secondary surveillance system: A Delphi survey to identify measurement priorities for the Canadian Campus Wellbeing Survey (CCWS)","2019","Background: Interventions that promote health and wellbeing among young adults are needed. Such interventions, however, require measurement tools that support intervention planning, monitoring and evaluation. The primary purpose of this study is to describe the process in developing a framework for a Canadian post-secondary health surveillance tool known as the Canadian Campus Wellbeing Survey (CCWS). Methods: Nineteen health service providers or mental health experts from 5 Canadian provinces participated in a 3-round Delphi survey by email and an in-person roundtable meeting to identify wellbeing and health behavior measurement priorities and indicators for the CCWS. Results: The final CCWS framework consisted of 9 core sections: mental health assets, student experience, mental health deficits, health service utilization/help seeking, physical health/health behaviors, academic achievement, substance use, nutrition, and sexual health behavior. Panelists generally agreed on a set of indicators, and reached consensus for at least one indicator per core section. Conclusion: This CCWS framework is the first step in developing a common surveillance mechanism tailored to the Canadian postsecondary context. Future work will include online consultation with health service providers from a broader range of post-secondary institutions, an in-person meeting with research and measurement experts to finalize survey items, and formative testing. The CCWS will play a valuable role in developing population health initiatives targeting the increasing number of young Canadians attending postsecondary institutions. ? 2019 The Author(s).","academic achievement; adult; article; Canadian; college; consultation; Delphi study; e-mail; female; health behavior; health care utilization; human; human experiment; male; mental health; nutrition; population health; sexual health; student; substance use; wellbeing; Canada; Delphi study; health survey; psychology; questionnaire; student; university; young adult; Canada; Delphi Technique; Health Behavior; Humans; Mental Health; Population Surveillance; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult"
"Depression, antidepressants and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: A systematic review","2019","Background: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia are conditions that cause significant perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Objective: This is a systematic review of the current evidence examining the relationship between both depression and antidepressants on pregnancy-related hypertensive conditions. Methods: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, six databases were searched for articles published between January 1990 and December 2017 (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE and Clini-calTrials.gov). Randomized control trials, cohort studies and case-control studies were included in this review. Studies that measured the following exposures were included: Antidepressant exposure or diagnosis of depression. Studies that measured the following outcomes were included: Gestational hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia. A combination of keywords, as well as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) index terms, was used for three general categories: antidepressants, depression and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. A total of 743 studies were identified and 711 were excluded based on relevance to the research question. Twenty studies were included in the final systematic review. Results: Of the twenty relevant studies, ten specifically examined the relationship between depression and hypertension in pregnancy. Only two of these did not find a significant association. Of the ten studies that concentrated on antidepressant medications, all except one found an association with hypertension in pregnancy to varying degrees. Conclusion: Review of the literature suggests a possible association between depression and antihyperten-sive medications with pregnancy-related hypertension, but further studies are needed. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","antidepressant agent; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; antidepressant agent; depression; disease association; eclampsia; human; maternal hypertension; maternal morbidity; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnant woman; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; Review; systematic review; time to treatment; treatment duration; case control study; cohort analysis; depression; female; maternal hypertension; meta analysis; preeclampsia; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); Antidepressive Agents; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
"Growth hormone supplementation and psychosocial functioning to adult height in Turner syndrome: A questionnaire study of participants in the Canadian randomized trial","2019","Despite the long-held belief that growth hormone supplementation provides psychosocial benefits to patients with Turner syndrome (TS), this assumption has never been rigorously tested in a randomized control trial. As a sub-study of the Canadian growth-hormone trial, parent-, and patient-completed standardized questionnaires were used to compare 70 girls with TS who received injections (GH group) and 61 similarly followed untreated TS controls (C) on multiple facets of psychosocial functioning. Questionnaires were given (i) at baseline (session 1, mean age = 10.4 y), (ii) before estrogen therapy for puberty induction (session 2, mean age = 13.0 y), (iii) after 1 year of estrogen therapy (session 3, mean age = 14.4 y), and (iv) when growth stopped (session 4, mean age = 16.3 y). Groups were compared for multiple facets of psychosocial function within social, behavioral, self-esteem, and academic domains. Results were also correlated with indices of adult height. We found no global (i.e., across-session) group differences on any scales or subscales of the four domains. In both GH and C groups, age-related improvements were seen for social problems, externalizing behavior problems, and school functioning and age-related declines for social competence and social relations. Both parents and patients claimed GH received less teasing than C but C had more friends than GH. Results from analyses conducted within individual sessions showed that while GH at early sessions claimed to be more popular, more socially engaged, better adapted, and to have higher self-esteem than C, C was reported to be less anxious, depressed, and withdrawn than GH at adult height. The correlation analyses revealed different effects of adult height and height gain on outcome for the two groups. In GH, both height parameters were correlated with multiple parent- and/or self-reported indices from the four psychosocial domains, whereas in C, only adult height and two indices (viz., total self-concept and school functioning), were correlated. The observed modest gains in psychosocial functioning for patients with TS treated with GH highlight the need for alternative approaches to assist them in coping with the challenges of their condition.

"Genome-wide association and transcriptome studies identify target genes and risk loci for breast cancer","2019","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 170 breast cancer susceptibility loci. Here we hypothesize that some risk-associated variants might act in non-breast tissues, specifically adipose tissue and immune cells from blood and spleen. Using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) reported in these tissues, we identify 26 previously unreported, likely target genes of overall breast cancer risk variants, and 17 for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer, several with a known immune function. We determine the directional effect of gene expression on disease risk measured based on single and multiple eQTL. In addition, using a gene-based test of association that considers eQTL from multiple tissues, we identify seven (and four) regions with variants associated with overall (and ER-negative) breast cancer risk, which were not reported in previous GWAS. Further investigation of the function of the implicated genes in breast and immune cells may provide insights into the etiology of breast cancer. ? 2019, The Author(s).","estrogen receptor; cancer; etiology; gene; gene expression; genetic analysis; genome; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; female; follow up; gene expression; genome-wide association study; human; major clinical study; quantitative trait locus; breast tumor; gene expression profiling; genetic predisposition; genetics; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Quantitative Trait Loci"
"Prospective cohort study of vitamin D and autism spectrum disorder diagnoses in early childhood","2019","Several studies have suggested an association between vitamin D in childhood and autism spectrum disorder. No prospective studies have evaluated whether lower vitamin D levels precede ASD diagnoses – a necessary condition for causality. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate whether vitamin D serum levels in early childhood was associated with incident physician diagnosed ASD. A prospective cohort study was conducted using data from preschool-aged children in the TARGet Kids! practice-based research network in Toronto, Canada, from June 2008 to July 2015. 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was measured through blood samples and vitamin D supplementation from parent report. Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was determined from medical records at follow-up visits. Covariates included age, sex, family history of autism spectrum disorder, maternal ethnicity, and neighborhood household income. Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression with a robust error variance. In this study, 3852 children were included. Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was identified in 41 children (incidence = 1.1%) over the observation period (average follow-up time = 2.5 years). An association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and autism spectrum disorder was not identified in the unadjusted (relative risk = 1.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.97, 1.11 per 10 nmol/L increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration) or adjusted models (adjusted relative risk = 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.18). An association between vitamin D supplementation in early childhood and autism spectrum disorder was also not identified (adjusted relative risk = 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.46, 1.62). Vitamin D in early childhood may not be associated with incident physician diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder. ?

"Intermittent antipsychotic medication and mortality in institutionalized older adults: A scoping review","2019","Objective/Background: Antipsychotic use appears to increase mortality risk among older adults with dementia. Whether this risk is similar for regular or intermittent use is unknown. This scoping review aims to explore the temporal association between antipsychotic use and mortality risk for older institutionalized adults. Method: We conducted a scoping review using Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane libraries between October 2018 and January 2019. Results: Twenty-eight articles met review criteria. We found that different antipsychotic medications present different safety profiles. The risk of mortality was highest with conventional antipsychotic use and within 40?days of antipsychotic initiation. Conclusions: Conventional antipsychotic use increases mortality for older institutionalized adults. The evidence for atypical antipsychotics is less clear. Mortality risk appears highest within 30 to 40?days of initiating antipsychotic treatment. This temporal association suggests increased mortality may actually be the result of some previously unrecognized illness, comorbidity, change in health status, or increased frailty, rather than an idiosyncrasy of the antipsychotic itself. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","atypical antipsychotic agent; neuroleptic agent; placebo; adult; comorbidity; dementia; drug intermittent therapy; drug safety; drug use; frailty; health status; high risk patient; human; institutional care; institutionalized person; mental disease; mortality risk; prospective study; Review; risk assessment; systematic review"
"Improving reporting of meta-ethnography: The eMERGe reporting guidance","2019","Aims: The aim of this study was to provide guidance to improve the completeness and clarity of meta-ethnography reporting. Background: Evidence-based policy and practice require robust evidence syntheses which can further understanding of people's experiences and associated social processes. Meta-ethnography is a rigorous seven-phase qualitative evidence synthesis methodology, developed by Noblit and Hare. Meta-ethnography is used widely in health research, but reporting is often poor quality and this discourages trust in and use of its findings. Meta-ethnography reporting guidance is needed to improve reporting quality. Design: The eMERGe study used a rigorous mixed-methods design and evidence-based methods to develop the novel reporting guidance and explanatory notes. Methods: The study, conducted from 2015 to 2017, comprised of: (1) a methodological systematic review of guidance for meta-ethnography conduct and reporting; (2) a review and audit of published meta-ethnographies to identify good practice principles; (3) international, multidisciplinary consensus-building processes to agree guidance content; (4) innovative development of the guidance and explanatory notes. Findings: Recommendations and good practice for all seven phases of meta-ethnography conduct and reporting were newly identified leading to 19 reporting criteria and accompanying detailed guidance. Conclusion: The bespoke eMERGe Reporting Guidance, which incorporates new methodological developments and advances the methodology, can help researchers to report the important aspects of meta-ethnography. Use of the guidance should raise reporting quality. Better reporting could make assessments of confidence in the findings more robust and increase use of meta-ethnography outputs to improve practice, policy, and service user outcomes in health and other fields. This is the first tailored reporting guideline for meta-ethnography.

"Electronic referral systems in health care: A scoping review","2019","Introduction: Electronic referral (eReferral) systems have been designed with the dual purpose of decreasing wait times and improving workflow efficiency. Evidence about the clinical and economic value enabled through the use of eReferral systems is limited. Our objective was to review the evidence base for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of eReferral systems. This review is part of a bigger project to inform the economic benefits of a regional eReferral implementation program. Material and methods: A systematic search was conducted to capture the available literature on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of eReferral system interventions. Evaluation of eReferral system for cost or outcome(s) were included. Strictly e-consultation systems were excluded. We only included publications in English. Results: We found 274 citations. After removing duplicates and conducting levels one and two screenings, nine publications qualified. Results were divided into four categories: Cost or cost-effectiveness analysis, changes in workflow efficiency, the quantity of referrals, and the quality of referrals. A full economic evaluation, conducted in Denmark, found that an eReferral system was cost-effective compared with a paper-based referral system. Of the other eight studies, three demonstrated positive changes in referral processing; two evaluated changes in the quality of the referrals, and three evaluated if the eReferral system increased the quantity of referrals. Discussion: The evidence base on the effectiveness of eReferral systems to improve communication between primary care and specialists and to decrease wait times is positive but limited. Economic evaluations are needed to examine the clinical and economic value of eReferral systems in health care. ? 2019 Azamar-Alonso et al.","article; cost effectiveness analysis; Denmark; human; outcome assessment; patient referral; primary medical care; publication; systematic review; telehealth; workflow"
"Influence of Surgical Procedures and General Anesthesia on Child Development before Primary School Entry among Matched Sibling Pairs","2019","Importance: Substantial preclinical evidence suggests that the developing brain is susceptible to injury from anesthetic drugs. Findings from clinical studies of the neurotoxic effects of anesthesia are mixed, but these effects can be influenced by unmeasured confounding from biological and environmental risk and protective factors on child development. Objective: To examine the association between surgical procedures that require general anesthesia before primary school entry and child development in biological siblings. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective sibling-matched cohort study included sibling pairs aged 5 to 6 years with the same birth mother who had Early Development Instrument (EDI) data completed. The EDI is a population-based measure of child development that assesses children's readiness to learn in 5 major domains (physical health and well-being, social knowledge and competence, emotional health and maturity, language and cognitive development, and communication skills and general knowledge). All eligible children in public and Catholic schools in Ontario, Canada, from 2004 through 2012 were included. Data were analyzed from December 13, 2017, through July 27, 2018. Exposures: Surgical procedures that require general anesthesia from the date of birth to EDI completion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Early developmental vulnerability, defined as any major domain of the EDI in the lowest 10th percentile of the Ontario population. Results: Of the 187226 eligible children for whom the EDI was completed, a total of 10897 sibling pairs (21 794 children; 53.8% female; mean [SD] age, 5.7 [0.3] years) were subsequently identified, including 2346 with only 1 child exposed to surgery. No significant differences were found between exposed and unexposed children in early developmental vulnerability (697 of 3080 [22.6%] vs 3739 of 18 714 [20.0%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.98-1.14; P =.58) or for each of the 5 major EDI domains (aOR for language and cognitive development, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.80-1.14]; aOR for physical health and well-being, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.96-1.24]; aOR for social knowledge and competence, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.84-1.14]; aOR for emotional health and maturity, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.84-1.14]; and aOR for communication skills and general knowledge, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.77-1.05]), after adjusting for confounding factors (age at EDI completion, sex, mother's age at birth, and eldest sibling status). Conclusions and Relevance: In this provincial cohort study, children who had surgical procedures that require general anesthesia before primary school entry were not found to be at increased risk of adverse child development outcomes compared with their biological siblings who did not have surgery. These findings further support that anesthesia exposure in early childhood is not associated with detectable adverse child development outcomes.. ? 2018 American Medical Association.

"Antiplatelet Therapy versus Anticoagulation after Surgical Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","Background The optimal antithrombotic therapy after surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (BAVR) is uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation in patients with surgical BAVR. Methods We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to 3 November 2017 for studies evaluating antiplatelet therapy versus anticoagulation early after surgical BAVR. We performed title and abstract screening, full-text review, risk of bias evaluation and data collection independently and in duplicate. We evaluated overall quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, and pooled data using a random effects model. Results We identified 2 RCTs (n = 397) and 5 observational studies (n = 2,012) meeting our eligibility criteria. The mean follow-up for all outcomes was 3 months in RCTs, and 10 months for observational studies. Antiplatelet compared with anticoagulant therapy demonstrated a trend towards fewer major bleeds in RCTs (relative risk [RR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-1.04, p = 0.06, I 2 = 0%, low quality evidence), and significantly fewer major bleeds in observational studies (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20-0.58, p ? 0.0001, I 2 = 0%, very low quality evidence), but stroke, thromboembolism and mortality did not show a significant difference in either RCTs or observational studies. Conclusion Antiplatelet therapy demonstrated reduced bleeding risk with no negative effects on stroke, thromboembolism or mortality compared with anticoagulation therapy after surgical BAVR. Our confidence in the results is reduced by the low quality of the available evidence. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.","acetylsalicylic acid; triflusal; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; all cause mortality; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; aortic valve replacement; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; cerebrovascular accident; dual antiplatelet therapy; follow up; genetic heterogeneity; GRADE approach; human; international normalized ratio; meta analysis; mortality; priority journal; prospective study; publication bias; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk factor; screening; sensitivity analysis; sinus rhythm; systematic review; thromboembolism; transient ischemic attack; aortic valve; bioprosthesis; blood clotting; comparative study; heart valve prosthesis; observational study; risk; thromboembolism; valvular heart disease; Anticoagulants; Aortic Valve; Bioprosthesis; Blood Coagulation; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Valve Diseases; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Hemorrhage; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk; Thromboembolism"
"Comparison of two X-ray detection systems used to investigate properties of normal and malignant breast tissues","2020","The present study was implemented using two X-ray detection systems; a monochromatic X-ray system for X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Angular Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (ADXRD) techniques, and a combined Polarized Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (PEDXRF) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (EDXRD) system. As both of these systems involve different techniques, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and accuracy of each system using results achieved from XRF measurements. The assessment of the two systems was carried out by investigating tissues samples containing invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast and normal surrounding breast tissues. The results established from the two XRF systems are in a very good agreement with each other. The statistical analysis reveals a significant and measurable increase (p < 0.01) in the concentration of K, Ca, Zn, Rb and Fe (p < 0.05) in the tumorous tissue when compared with the healthy tissue. However, the levels of Cl, Cu and Br attained by both systems have not demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the normal and cancerous tissues. Investigating the structural components of the same breast tissues using each of the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) spectrometers incorporated in both systems indicated a statistically significant difference in the components of normal and malignant samples. Furthermore, the results have shown a significant increase in the fibrous and water contents of the tumour tissue at p < 0.01, and a significant increase in the adipose content of the normal tissue at (p < 0.01). The results acquired from both XRD approaches were shown to be statistically compatible with each other. Overall, the comparisons between the two X-ray detection systems have shown improved results for the combined PEDXRF and EDXRD system for the purpose of classifying normal and tumour breast tissues. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Trace elements; Tumors; X ray diffraction; Breast Cancer; Breast margin assessment; Energy dispersive x-ray diffractions; Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence; Invasive ductal carcinomata; Statistically significant difference; Structural component; X ray fluorescence; Histology"
"The role of circulating extracellular vesicles in breast cancer classification and molecular subtyping","2019","Currently, tumor biopsies are used for breast cancer molecular subtyping. Biopsies are associated with various pathological changes and are thought to contribute to the dissemination of tumor cells. Extracellular vesicles shed by tumor cells into circulation exhibit the molecular signature of the parent cells. Herein, we show that proteomic analysis of circulating EV can discriminate BC patients from healthy subjects and indicate stage of the disease. Also, we performed a correlation between the BC molecular subtype using plasma EV and immunohistochemistry of tumor biopsies. Circulating EV may represent a useful, non-invasive tool to study the molecular makeup of BC tumors. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ADAM12 protein; beta catenin; cell protein; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor alpha; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; progesterone; ADAM12 protein; ADAM12 protein, human; beta catenin; CTNNB1 protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor alpha; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; progesterone receptor; SERPINE1 protein, human; tumor marker; Article; breast biopsy; breast cancer; cancer classification; cancer patient; cancer staging; clinical article; controlled study; down regulation; exosome; female; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; molecular typing; proteomics; tumor biopsy; upregulation; adult; aged; blood; breast tumor; case control study; exosome; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; tumor cell line; very elderly; ADAM12 Protein; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; beta Catenin; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Cell Line, Tumor; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Extracellular Vesicles; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Middle Aged; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Proteomics; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Progesterone"
"Genome-wide association studies of impulsive personality traits (BIS-11 and UPPS-P) and drug experimentation in up to 22,861 adult research participants identify loci in the CACNA1I and CADM2 genes","2019","Impulsive personality traits are complex heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly drug abuse and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, we performed 10 genome-wide association studies on measures of impulsive personality traits [the short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)] and drug experimentation (the number of drug classes an individual had tried in their lifetime) in up to 22,861 male and female adult human research participants of European ancestry. Impulsive personality traits and drug experimentation showed single nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities that ranged from 5 to 11%. Genetic variants in the CADM2 locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Sensation Seeking (p = 8.3 × 10-9, rs139528938) and showed a suggestive association with Drug Experimentation (p = 3.0 × 10-7, rs2163971; r2 = 0.68 with rs139528938). Furthermore, genetic variants in the CACNA1I locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Negative Urgency (p = 3.8 × 10-8; rs199694726). The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. Multiple subscales from both UPPS-P and BIS showed strong genetic correlations (&gt;0.5) with Drug Experimentation and other substance use traits measured in independent cohorts, including smoking initiation, and lifetime cannabis use.

"For Baby’s Sake: Intervention Development and Evaluation Design of a Whole-Family Perinatal Intervention to Break the Cycle of Domestic Abuse","2019","For Baby’s Sake is an innovative whole-family intervention that works with parents from pregnancy to two years postpartum to break cycles of domestic abuse and improve outcomes for children. The programme launched in 2015 across two community settings in England, with an independent evaluation led by King’s College London. This paper aims to (1) summarise the process of developing For Baby’s Sake and how it has been embedded within two different settings and (2) describe the evaluation design using early data to illustrate successes and challenges. The programme was developed following a review of the evidence and extensive stakeholder engagement. Three experts co-designed the content in partnership with the Stefanou Foundation and the programme delivery teams have been integrated into two local authorities. The evaluation uses mixed methods to assess abuse victimisation/perpetration, mental health, parenting and child outcomes, alongside service user experiences of early engagement. Forty individuals (27 women and 13 men) have been recruited to the evaluation. Early findings suggest that parents value the novel approach of For Baby’s Sake and their relationships with practitioners. Data on parents’ mental health and childhood adversities supports the decision to create a trauma-informed intervention. Interventions for domestic abuse are necessary to improve health and behaviour outcomes for families and prevent intergenerational transmission of abuse and developmental trauma. For Baby’s Sake addresses limitations of existing interventions, through its trauma-informed, attachment-based, whole-family approach. Early data from the evaluation suggests that the programme is reaching its intended audience and that service users appreciate the supportive approach. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Characteristics and Management of Patients with Venous Thromboembolism: The GARFIELD-VTE Registry","2019","Background Management of venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), varies worldwide. Methods The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD - Venous Thromboembolism (GARFIELD-VTE) is a prospective, observational study of 10,685 patients with objectively diagnosed VTE recruited from May 2014 to January 2017 at 417 sites in 28 countries. All patients are followed for at least 3 years. We describe the baseline characteristics of the study population and their management within 30 days of diagnosis. Results The median age was 60.2 years; 50.4% were male; 61.7% had DVT and 38.3% had PE ± DVT; and 32.3% were obese (body mass index ? 30 kg/m 2 ). The most common risk factors were surgery (12.5%), hospitalization (12.0%) and trauma to the lower limbs (7.8%). At the time of VTE diagnosis, 10.1% had active cancer and 5.7% were chronically immobilized. Treatment for VTE was anticoagulant (AC) therapy alone in 90.9% of patients; 5.1% received thrombolytic and/or surgical/mechanical therapy ± AC and 4.0% received no therapy. Pre-diagnosis, 12.8% received AC therapy alone and 0.2% received thrombolytic and/or surgical/mechanical therapy ± AC. After diagnosis, parenteral AC therapy alone was administered in 17.6% of patients, and it was followed by a direct oral AC (DOAC) in 16.4% or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in 26.8%. DOACs alone were prescribed to 32.3% of patients, while 5.9% received VKA alone. Conclusion The initial findings from this global registry highlight the heterogeneity in characteristics and management of VTE patients. Prospective follow-up will reveal the impact of this heterogeneity on outcomes. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

"Management of Urinary Retention in Patients with Benign Prostatic Obstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Context: Practice patterns for the management of urinary retention (UR) secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO; UR/BPO) vary widely and remain unstandardized. Objective: To review the evidence for managing patients with UR/BPO with pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments included in the European Association of Urology guidelines on non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms. Evidence acquisition: Search was conducted up to April 22, 2018, using CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. This systematic review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective comparative studies. Methods as detailed in the Cochrane handbook were followed. Certainty of evidence (CoE) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Evidence synthesis: Literature search identified 2074 citations. Twenty-one studies were included (qualitative synthesis). The evidence for managing patients with UR/BPO with pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatments is limited. CoE for most outcomes was low/very low. Only α1-blockers (alfuzosin and tamsulosin) have been evaluated in more than one RCT. Pooled results indicated that α1-blockers provided significantly higher rates of successful trial without catheter compared with placebo [alfuzosin: 322/540 (60%) vs 156/400 (39%) (odds ratio {OR} 2.28, 95% confidence interval {CI} 1.55 to 3.36; participants = 940; studies = 7; I 2 = 41%; low CoE); tamsulosin: 75/158 (47%) vs 40/139 (29%) (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 4.45; participants = 297; studies = 3; I 2 = 30%; low CoE)] with rare adverse events. Similar rates were achieved with tamsulosin or alfuzosin [51/87 (59%) vs 45/84 (54%) (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.41; participants = 171; studies = 2; I 2 = 0%; very low CoE)]. Nonpharmacological treatments have been evaluated in RCTs/prospective comparative studies only sporadically. Conclusions: There is some evidence that usage of α1-blockers (alfuzosin and tamsulosin) may improve resolution of UR/BPO. As most nonpharmacological treatments have not been evaluated in patients with UR/BPO, the evidence is inconclusive about their benefits and harms. Patient summary: There is some evidence that alfuzosin and tamsulosin may increase the rates of successful trial without catheter, but little or no evidence on various nonpharmacological treatment options for managing patients with urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction. ? 2019 European Association of UrologyAlfuzosin and tamsulosin appear to provide higher rates of successful trial without catheter. Most nonpharmacological treatment options have not been evaluated in patients with urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction. Consequently, the evidence is inconclusive regarding the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions for the management of urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction. ? 2019 European Association of Urology","alfuzosin; doxazosin; finasteride; silodosin; tamsulosin; alfuzosin; alpha 1 adrenergic receptor blocking agent; quinazoline derivative; benign prostatic obstruction; bladder irrigation; bladder training; catheter removal; comparative study; GRADE approach; hospitalization; human; intermittent catheterization; International Prostate Symptom Score; lower urinary tract symptom; male; meta analysis; operation duration; practice guideline; priority journal; prostate disease; prostatectomy; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence risk; Review; suprapubic catheterization; systematic review; transurethral microwave thermotherapy; transurethral resection; treatment outcome; urethral catheterization; urine retention; bladder catheterization; complication; prostate hypertrophy; urine retention; Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists; Humans; Male; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Quinazolines; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tamsulosin; Urinary Catheterization; Urinary Retention"
"Therapeutic Options for Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis","2019","Importance: Multiple therapies are currently available for patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet many therapies have not been compared head-to-head within randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Objective: To assess the relative safety and efficacy of therapies for NETs. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registries, meeting abstracts, and reference lists from January 1, 1947, to March 2, 2018, were searched. Key search terms included neuroendocrine tumors, gastrointestinal neoplasms, therapy, and randomized controlled trial. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials comparing 2 or more therapies in patients with NETs (primarily gastrointestinal and pancreatic) were evaluated. Thirty RCTs met the selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Pairs of independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A network meta-analysis with a frequentist approach was used to compare the efficacy of therapies; the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was used. Main Outcomes and Measures: Disease control, progression-free survival, overall survival, adverse events, and quality of life. Results: The systematic review identified 30 relevant RCTs comprising 3895 patients (48.4% women) assigned to 22 different therapies for NETs. These therapies showed a broad range of risk for serious and nonserious adverse events. The network meta-analyses included 16 RCTs with predominantly a low risk of bias; nevertheless, precision-of-treatment estimates and estimated heterogeneity were limited. The network meta-analysis found 7 therapies for pancreatic NETs: everolimus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35 [95% CI, 0.28-0.45]), everolimus plus somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.25-0.51]), everolimus plus bevacizumab plus somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.26-0.75]), interferon (HR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.16-0.83]), interferon plus somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.13-0.71]), somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.33-0.66]), and sunitinib (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.26-0.67]), and 5 therapies for gastrointestinal NETs: bevacizumab plus somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.05-0.99]), everolimus plus somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.11-0.90]), interferon plus somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.07-0.96]), Lu 177-dotatate plus somatostatin analogue (HR, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.03-0.26], and somatostatin analogues (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.21-0.78]) with higher efficacy than placebo and suggests an overall superiority of combination therapies. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings from this study suggest that a range of efficient therapies with different safety profiles is available for patients with NETs. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"A Scoping Review to Map Empirical Evidence Regarding Key Domains and Questions in the Clinical Pathway of Delirium in Palliative Care","2019","Context: Based on the clinical care pathway of delirium in palliative care (PC), a published analytic framework (AF) formulated research questions in key domains and recommended a scoping review to identify evidence gaps. Objectives: To produce a literature map for key domains of the published AF: screening, prognosis and diagnosis, management, and the health-related outcomes. Methods: A standard scoping review framework was used by an interdisciplinary study team of nurse- and physician-delirium researchers, an information specialist, and review methodologists to conduct the review. Knowledge user engagement provided context in refining 19 AF questions. A peer-reviewed search strategy identified citations in Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL databases between 1980 and 2018. Two reviewers independently screened records for inclusion using explicit study eligibility criteria for the population, design, delirium diagnosis, and investigational intent. Results: Of 104 studies reporting empirical data and meeting eligibility criteria, most were conducted in patients with cancer (73.1%) and in inpatient PC units (52%). The most frequent study design was a one or more group, nonrandomized trial or cohort (67.3%). Evidence gaps were identified: delirium risk prediction; comparative effectiveness and harms of prevention, variability in delirium management across PC settings, advanced directive and substitute decision-maker input, and transition of care location; and estimating delirium reversibility. Future rigorous primary studies are required to address these gaps and preliminary concerns regarding the quality of extant literature. Conclusion: Substantial evidence gaps exist, providing opportunities for future research regarding the assessment, prognosis, and management of delirium in PC settings. ? 2018 The Authors","Article; clinical pathway; clinical research; comparative effectiveness; data base; delirium; human; informatician; nurse; palliative therapy; physician; prognosis; research priority"
"Factors for Self-Managing Care Following Older Adults' Discharge from the Emergency Department: A Qualitative Study","2019","This study identified factors affecting seniors' ability to self-manage their health following an Emergency Department (ED) visit. Surveys (n = 380) completed by older adults and their caregivers in the ED assessed their understanding of information provided. Interviews (n = 51) completed with a participant subsample up to four weeks post-ED visit examined self-management factors. Perceived understanding of the information (Yes, definitely) received in the ED was greater at the time of the visit (91%) than at follow-up (71%). Patients reported self-management was influenced by communication with ED staff, understanding of post-discharge expectations and the health condition(s), caregiver availability, and various external factors. Caregivers also identified support for caregivers and patient resistance to recommendations. Senior-friendly strategies (e.g., recommendations in writing, confirmed understanding of recommendations), particularly those related to identifying those at risk and needing greater transitional supports, and greater access to and integration with community supports could enhance post-ED self-management. ? 2018 Canadian Association on Gerontology.","aged; aging; article; caregiver; community care; emergency ward; expectation; female; follow up; human; interview; major clinical study; male; qualitative research; self care; writing"
"Transfer learning for depression: Early detection and severity prediction from social media postings","2019","Online social media platforms allow open sharing of thoughts and dialogue. These platforms generate large amounts of data about their users' online behaviour, which can be repurposed for the development of technologies which can detect mental health disorders. Towards this goal, we applied transfer and supervised learning techniques for predicting the severity and risk of depression for the eRisk 2019 Lab at the CLEF workshop. Both tasks were very difficult due to lack of training data, motivating our efforts to learn signals from other pre-trained models and datasets. For the early detection of signs of self-harm (Task 2), our classifiers that operated at the level of posts were too sensitive, resulting in low precision. For the task that evaluated ability to measure the severity of the signs of depression, we found that our submissions did not outperform chance or simple predictions for three of the four metrics. As pre-trained language models improve, we are optimistic that transfer learning will accelerate progress in early risk prediction on the internet. ? 2019 CEUR-WS.

"Association between air travel and importation of chikungunya into the USA","2019","Background: During infectious disease outbreaks with pandemic potential, the number of air passengers travelling from the outbreak source to international destinations has been used as a proxy for disease importation risk to new locations. However, evaluations of the validity of this approach are limited. We sought to quantify the association between international air travel and disease importation using the 2014-2016 chikungunya outbreak in the Americas as a case study. Methods: We used country-level chikungunya case data to define a time period of epidemic activity for each of the 45 countries and territories in the Americas reporting outbreaks between 2014 and 2016. For each country, we identified airports within or proximate to areas considered suitable for chikungunya transmission and summed the number of commercial air passengers departing from these airports during the epidemic period to each US state. We used negative binomial models to quantify the association between the number of incoming air passengers from countries experiencing chikungunya epidemics and the annual rate of chikungunya importation into the USA at the state level. Results: We found a statistically significant positive association between passenger flows via airline travel from countries experiencing chikungunya epidemics and the number of imported cases in the USA at the state level (P < 0.0001). Additionally, we found that as the number of arriving airline passengers increased by 10%, the estimated number of imported cases increased by 5.2% (95% CI: 3.0-7.6). Conclusion: This validation study demonstrated that air travel was strongly associated with observed importation of chikungunya cases in the USA and can be a useful proxy for identifying areas at increased risk for disease importation. This approach may be useful for understanding exportation risk of other arboviruses. ? 2019 International Society of Travel Medicine 2019. All rights reserved.

"Association of immigrant generational status with asthma","2019","Objective: We sought to examine whether asthma risk is lower in second-generation immigrants (i.e., Canadian-born children with at least one foreign-born parent) and first-generation immigrants (i.e., foreign-born children) compared with non-immigrants (i.e., Canadian-born children to Canadian-born parents). Methods: Data were obtained from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth from 1994 to 2008, which measured child health and developmental factors from birth to early adulthood. The sample included 15,799 participants aged 2–26?years. Asthma was defined as diagnosis by a health professional as having asthma, having wheezing or whistling in the chest, or use of medication for asthma. Results: Prevalence of asthma (defined as a combination of any three factors) was lower in first-generation (32%) and second-generation (34%) immigrants compared with non-immigrants (46%). After controlling for covariates, first- and second-generation immigrants had 0.21 (AOR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.07–0.67) and 0.19 (AOR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.09–0.39) lower odds of reporting asthma compared with non-immigrants, respectively. For every year the parent(s) of second-generation immigrants resided in Canada, the odds for asthma increased by 5% (AOR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02–1.06). Conclusion: Immigrant children and youth in Canada, regardless of whether they are first- or second-generation, have lower odds for asthma compared with non-immigrants. ? 2019, The Canadian Public Health Association.",""
"Investigating service features to sustain engagement in early intervention mental health services","2019","Aim: To understand what service features would sustain patient engagement in early intervention mental health treatment. Methods: Mental health patients, family members of individuals with mental illness and mental health professionals completed a survey consisting of 18 choice tasks that involved 14 different service attributes. Preferences were ascertained using importance and utility scores. Latent class analysis revealed segments characterized by distinct preferences. Simulations were carried out to estimate utilization of hypothetical clinical services. Results: Overall, 333 patients and family members and 183 professionals (N = 516) participated. Respondents were distributed between a Professional segment (53%) and a Patient segment (47%) that differed in a number of their preferences including for appointment times, individual vs group sessions and mode of after-hours support. Members of both segments shared preferences for many of the service attributes including having crisis support available 24 h per day, having a choice of different treatment modalities, being offered help for substance use problems and having a focus on improving symptoms rather than functioning. Simulations predicted that 60% of the Patient segment thought patients would remain engaged with a Hospital service, while 69% of the Professional segment thought patients would be most likely to remain engaged with an E-Health service. Conclusions: Patients, family members and professionals shared a number of preferences about what service characteristics will optimize patient engagement in early intervention services but diverged on others. Providing effective crisis support as well as a range of treatment options should be prioritized in the future design of early intervention services. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adolescent; adult; Article; controlled study; drug dependence; early intervention; female; health care utilization; health survey; hospital service; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health care; mental health care personnel; mental health service; mental task; middle aged; patient decision making; patient participation; patient preference; prediction; priority journal; scoring system; simulation; social interaction; social problem; social support; symptom; young adult"
"Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome","2019","Cannabis is commonly used in cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) due to its antiemetic and anxiolytic properties. Paradoxically, chronic cannabis use in the context of cyclic vomiting has led to the recognition of a putative new disorder called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Since its first description in 2004, numerous case series and case reports have emerged describing this phenomenon. Although not pathognomonic, a patient behavior called “compulsive hot water bathing” has been associated with CHS. There is considerable controversy about how CHS is defined. Most of the data remain heterogenous with limited follow-up, making it difficult to ascertain whether chronic cannabis use is causal, merely a clinical association with CVS, or unmasks or triggers symptoms in patients inherently predisposed to develop CVS. This article will discuss the role of cannabis in the regulation of nausea and vomiting, specifically focusing on both CVS and CHS, in order to address controversies in this context. To this objective, we have collated and analyzed published case series and case reports on CHS in order to determine the number of reported cases that meet current Rome IV criteria for CHS. We have also identified limitations in the existing diagnostic framework and propose revised criteria to diagnose CHS. Future research in this area should improve our understanding of the role of cannabis use in cyclic vomiting and help us better understand and manage this disorder. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Micro-CT assessment of dental mineralization defects indicative of vitamin D deficiency in two 17th–19th century Dutch communities","2019","Objectives: This study investigates vitamin D deficiency patterns in individuals from birth to the beginning of adolescence. Microscopic computed tomography (micro-CT) evaluation of interglobular dentine (IGD) in teeth provides information on the age of disease onset and the number of deficient periods per individual, which will increase our understanding of factors influencing vitamin D deficiency prevalence, including sociocultural practices and latitude. Materials and methods: Beemster and Hattem, two Dutch 17th–19th century communities, yielded relatively high prevalences of rickets (15–24%) and residual rickets (15–24%). From the affected individuals, a subsample of 20 teeth were selected for micro-CT scanning. Thin sections were made of 17 teeth, consisting of 6 teeth with and 11 teeth without observable IGD on micro-CT that were included for method comparison. Results: About 19 out of 29 (65.5%) individuals (one tooth was deemed unobservable) presented with IGD on micro-CT. Eight of the 11 (72.7%) individuals without IGD on micro-CT demonstrated histologically visible IGD. In 40.7% (11/27) of the affected individuals (combined micro-CT and histology results), vitamin D deficiency was recurrent, and in four individuals, some episodes occurred at approximately annual intervals suggesting vitamin D deficiency was seasonal. In three individuals, IGD occurred in the dentine formed around birth, suggesting maternal vitamin D deficiency. Discussion: Micro-CT analysis of IGD is found to be a valuable non-destructive method that can improve our understanding of the influence of sociocultural practices and latitude on disease development within age and sex groups in past communities. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Dynamic 31 P spectroscopic imaging of skeletal muscles combining flyback echo-planar spectroscopic imaging and compressed sensing","2019","Purpose: Dynamic phosphorus MR spectroscopic imaging ( 31 P-MRSI) experiments require temporal resolution on the order of seconds to concurrently assess different muscle groups. A highly accelerated pulse sequence combining flyback echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and compressed sensing was developed and tested in a phantom and healthy humans during an exercise-recovery challenge of the lower leg muscles, using a clinical 3T MRI. Methods: A flyback EPSI readout designed to achieve 2.25 × 2.25 cm 2 resolution over a 18 × 18 cm 2 field of view (i.e., 8 × 8 matrix) was combined with compressed sensing through the inclusion of pseudorandom gradient blips to sub-sample the ky-kt dimensions by a factor of 2.7×, achieving a temporal resolution of 9 s. The sequence was first tested in a phantom to assess performance compared to fully sampled EPSI (fidEPSI) and phase encoded chemical shift imaging (fidCSI). Then, tests were performed in 11 healthy volunteers during an exercise-recovery challenge of the lower leg muscles. Voxels containing tissue from different muscle groups were evaluated measuring percentage phosphocreatine (%PCr) depletion, time constant of PCr recovery (τPCr) and intracellular pH at rest and following exercise. Results: The sequence was capable to track the dynamic PCr response of multiple muscles simultaneously. No statistical differences were found in the metabolite ratio, pH or linewidth when compared with fidEPSI and fidCSI in the phantom study. Dynamic experiments showed differences in PCr depletion when comparing soleus with gastrocnemius muscles. Intracellular pH, τPCr and %PCr decrease were consistent with reported values. Conclusion: Highly accelerated 31 P-MRSI combining flyback EPSI and compressed sensing is capable of assessing concurrent energy metabolism in multiple muscle groups using a clinical 3T MR system. ? 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","creatine phosphate; adult; Article; cell pH; compressed sensing; depletion; echo planar imaging; echo planar spectroscopic imaging; energy metabolism; female; gastrocnemius muscle; human; human experiment; image processing; male; metabolite; muscle metabolism; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; skeletal muscle; soleus muscle"
"Research in nutritional supplements and nutraceuticals for health, physical activity, and performance: moving forward","2019","This Horizons is part of a series that identifies key, forward-thinking research questions and challenges that need to be addressed. Specifically, this Horizons paper discusses research in nutritional supplements and nutraceuticals for health, physical activity, and performance, and is the product of a discussion by an expert panel that took place in January 2018 prior to the Canadian Nutrition Society Thematic Conference “Advances in Sport Nutrition from Daily Living to High Performance Sport”. The objective of this Horizons paper was to identify core considerations for future studies for this research area, and how scientists can be leaders in the field to ensure the best quality science is available for decision makers. It is strongly recommended that the various elements highlighted throughout this Horizons paper will increase the awareness of the significant before-, during-, and after-research due-diligence required to produce research of the highest quality. While it is recognized that many scientists will not be able to meet all of these aspects, it is nonetheless important to consider the points outlined and to recognize that those elements that are not met in studies may be significant limitations. Highlights ? Research questions that are hypothesis-driven are the strongest, and when combined with careful planning of the study, the result will often be of the best quality. ? Studies with a strong experimental design help discern between evidence-based findings and those that have not been substantiated. ? 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

"High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin to treat spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome","2019","Essentials Spontaneous HIT syndrome clinically/serologically resembles HIT but without proximate heparin. Rarely, spontaneous HIT syndrome complicates total knee arthroplasty surgery. Mesenteric vein thrombosis is a rare presentation of spontaneous HIT syndrome. IVIg rapidly corrects thrombocytopenia by inhibiting heparin-independent platelet activation. Summary: Spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) syndrome is an autoimmune HIT (aHIT) disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and HIT antibodies despite no proximate heparin exposure. For unknown reasons, many cases occur after total knee arthroplasty. A 52-year-old woman presented 12 days posttotal knee replacement (aspirin thromboprophylaxis) with gastrointestinal bleeding (superior mesenteric vein thrombosis); the platelet count was 63 × 10 9 L ?1 . After bowel resection and a brief course of heparin, treatment was changed to argatroban followed by fondaparinux. In addition, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), 1 g kg ?1 on 2 consecutive days, resulted in abrupt platelet count rise from 21 (nadir) pre-IVIg to 137 (post-IVIg), and 2 days later to 200 × 10 9 L ?1 . Heparin-independent serum-induced serotonin-release abruptly decreased from 91% (pre-IVIg) to 14% (post-IVIg); although serotonin-release later rebounded to 49%, the patient's platelet counts remained normal. Our observations support the emerging concept that high-dose IVIg is effective for treating aHIT disorders, including spontaneous HIT syndrome. ? 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","acetylsalicylic acid; argatroban; fondaparinux; heparin; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin G; abdominal bleeding; abdominal pain; adult; Article; body mass; case report; clinical article; colitis; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted tomography; disease association; drug megadose; drug safety; enzyme immunoassay; female; heparin induced thrombocytopenia; human; ileitis; immunoglobulin blood level; intraoperative period; laparotomy; mesenteric vein thrombosis; middle aged; obesity; platelet count; postoperative period; priority journal; serotonin release; spontaneous heparin induced thrombocytopenia syndrome; thrombocyte activation; total knee arthroplasty"
"The Role of Rehabilitation Professionals in Care Transitions for Older Adults: A Scoping Review","2019","Aim: To identify existing theories and conceptual models that inform care transition interventions and to explore whether the role of rehabilitation professionals is explicitly stated or implied in these theories and models. Methods: We searched multiple databases and included articles published from 2000 to 2018, with distinct mention of care transitions of older adults (>65 years) from one care setting to another. Result: Two theories (Middle Range Theory and System of Care Philosophy), and six conceptual models (Coleman’s Model, 4Cs of Transitional Model, Quality Cost Model of Advanced Practice Nurses Transitional Care, Health Belief Model, Care Transition Framework, Ideal Transition in Care) were identified in 13 of the 21 articles; however, only one conceptual model in an opinion paper illustrated the role of a physiotherapist in care transition. Conclusion: Most of the models, frameworks and theories that inform care transition interventions did not explicitly consider the role of RPs. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","advanced practice nurse; aged; article; Health Belief Model; human; philosophy; physiotherapist; theoretical study; transitional care"
"Rationale and design of the EU-CERT-ICD prospective study: comparative effectiveness of prophylactic ICD implantation","2019","Aims: The clinical effectiveness of primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is under debate. The EUropean Comparative Effectiveness Research to Assess the Use of Primary ProphylacTic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (EU-CERT-ICD) aims to assess its current clinical value. Methods and results: The EU-CERT-ICD is a prospective investigator-initiated non-randomized, controlled, multicentre observational cohort study performed in 44 centres across 15 European Union countries. We will recruit 2250 patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and a guideline indication for primary prophylactic ICD implantation. This sample will include 1500 patients at their first ICD implantation and 750 patients who did not receive a primary prevention ICD despite having an indication for it (non-randomized control group). The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality; the co-primary endpoint in ICD patients is time to first appropriate shock. Secondary endpoints include sudden cardiac death, first inappropriate shock, any ICD shock, arrhythmogenic syncope, revision procedures, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. At baseline (and prior to ICD implantation if applicable), all patients undergo 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter ECG analysis using multiple advanced methods for risk stratification as well as detailed documentation of clinical characteristics and laboratory values. Genetic biobanking is also organized. As of August 2018, baseline data of 2265 patients are complete. All subjects will be followed for up to 4.5?years. Conclusions: The EU-CERT-ICD study will provide a necessary update about clinical effectiveness of primary prophylactic ICD implantation. This study also aims for improved risk stratification and patient selection using clinical and ECG risk markers. ? 2018 The Authors.

"New advances for newborn screening of inborn errors of metabolism by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS)","2019","Expanded newborn screening of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technology is one of the most successful preventative healthcare initiatives for presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of rare yet treatable genetic diseases in the population. However, confirmatory testing of presumptive screen-positive cases is required using high efficiency separations for improved specificity in order to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) for certain classes of IEMs. Here, we describe recent advances using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for reliable second-tier screening or confirmatory testing based on targeted analysis of amino acids, acylcarnitines, nucleosides, and other classes of polar metabolites associated with IEMs. Additionally, nontargeted metabolite profiling enables the identification of unknown biomarkers of clinical significance for other genetic diseases that are currently screened by bioassays and/or mutation panels, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Noteworthy, CE-MS allows for resolution of isobaric/isomeric interferences without complicated sample handling that is ideal when analyzing volume-restricted biospecimens from neonates/infants, including dried blood spots and sweat specimens. New developments to improve concentration sensitivity, as well as enhance sample throughput and quality control for unambiguous confirmatory testing of IEMs will also be discussed when using multiplexed separations based on multisegment injection-CE-MS. ?

"Coeliac disease","2019","Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy against dietary gluten present in wheat, rye and barley and is one of the most common lifelong food-related disorders worldwide. Coeliac disease is also considered to be a systemic disorder characterized by a variable combination of gluten-related signs and symptoms and disease-specific antibodies in addition to enteropathy. The ingestion of gluten leads to the generation of harmful gluten peptides, which, in predisposed individuals, can induce adaptive and innate immune responses. The clinical presentation is extremely variable; patients may have severe gastrointestinal symptoms and malabsorption, extraintestinal symptoms or have no symptoms at all. Owing to the multifaceted clinical presentation, diagnosis remains a challenge and coeliac disease is heavily underdiagnosed. The diagnosis of coeliac disease is achieved by combining coeliac disease serology and small intestinal mucosal histology during a gluten-containing diet. Currently, the only effective treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet; however, the diet is restrictive and gluten is difficult to avoid. Optimizing diagnosis and care in coeliac disease requires continuous research and education of both patients and health-care professionals. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","autoantibody; cytokine; gluten; celiac disease; diet; environmental factor; follow up; genetics; gluten free diet; human; immune response; incidence; innate immunity; intestine biopsy; intestine mucosa; intraepithelial lymphocyte; microorganism; nonhuman; oat; pathophysiology; physical disease by body function; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; quality of life; Review; risk factor; screening; serology; T lymphocyte; adverse event; celiac disease; pathology; Poaceae; procedures; psychology; wheat; Celiac Disease; Diet, Gluten-Free; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Poaceae; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Triticum"
"Cognitive functioning in thyroid cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Some thyroid cancer (TC) survivors experience cognitive symptoms. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic literature review and meta-analysis comparing cognitive performance in TC survivors to controls. Methods: We performed a seven-database electronic search and hand-search. We performed duplicate independent reviews and data abstraction. Random effects meta-analyses reported standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where a negative value implies worse performance in the TC group. Results: We reviewed 1174 unique citations and 10 full-text papers. We included seven studies of 241 treated TC survivors and 273 controls. Cognitive function was statistically significantly worse in TC survivors in the following domains: Attention and Concentration (Digit Span Forwards) SMD ? 0.37 (95% CI ? 0.62, ? 0.13, p = 0.003, four studies), Speed of Processing (Trail Making A) SMD ? 0.36 (95% CI ? 0.66, ? 0.05, p = 0.022, four studies), and Language (Controlled Oral Word Association [COWAT]-Categories) SMD ? 0.97 (95% ? 1.31, ? 0.64, p < 0.001, two studies).

"Can routinely collected laboratory and health administrative data be used to assess influenza vaccine effectiveness? Assessing the validity of the Flu and Other Respiratory Viruses Research (FOREVER) Cohort","2019","Background: Linking data on laboratory specimens collected during clinical practice with health administrative data permits highly powered vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies to be conducted at relatively low cost, but bias from using convenience samples is a concern. We evaluated the validity of using such data for estimating VE. Methods: We created the Flu and Other Respiratory Viruses Research (FOREVER) Cohort by linking individual-level data on respiratory virus laboratory tests, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and physician services. For community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, we assessed the presence and magnitude of information and selection biases, generated VE estimates under various conditions, and compared our VE estimates with those from other studies. Results: We included 65,648 unique testing episodes obtained from 54,434 individuals during the 2010–11 to 2015–16 influenza seasons. To examine information bias, we found the proportion testing positive for influenza for patients with unknown interval from illness onset to specimen collection was more similar to patients for whom illness onset date was ? 7 days before specimen collection than to patients for whom illness onset was > 7 days before specimen collection. To assess the presence of selection bias, we found the likelihood of influenza testing was comparable between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, although the adjusted odds ratios were significantly greater than 1 for some healthcare settings and during some influenza seasons. Over 6 seasons, VE estimates ranged between 36% (95%CI, 27–44%) in 2010–11 and 5% (95%CI, –2, 11%) in 2014–15. VE estimates were similar under a range of conditions, but were consistently higher when accounting for misclassification of vaccination status through a quantitative sensitivity analysis. VE estimates from the FOREVER Cohort were comparable to those from other studies. Conclusions: Routinely collected laboratory and health administrative data contained in the FOREVER Cohort can be used to estimate influenza VE in community-dwelling older adults. ? 2019 The Authors","influenza vaccine; aged; Article; community dwelling person; drug efficacy; female; human; influenza; influenza vaccination; male; Ontario; priority journal; quantitative analysis; selection bias; sensitivity analysis; validity; very elderly"

"Complete Resolution of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease After Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Background & Aims: Bariatric surgery has been reported to lead to complete resolution of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) following the sustained weight loss induced in obese patients. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of bariatric surgery on NAFLD in obese patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases through May 2018 for studies that compared liver biopsy results before and after bariatric surgery in obese patients. Primary outcomes were biopsy-confirmed resolution of NAFLD and NAFLD activity score. Secondary outcomes were worsening of NAFLD after surgery and liver volume. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evidence approach was conducted to assess overall quality of evidence. Results: We analyzed data from 32 cohort studies comprising 3093 biopsy specimens. Bariatric surgery resulted in a biopsy-confirmed resolution of steatosis in 66% of patients (95% CI, 56%–75%), inflammation in 50% (95% CI, 35%–64%), ballooning degeneration in 76% (95% CI, 64%–86%), and fibrosis in 40% (95% CI, 29%–51%). Patients’ mean NAFLD activity score was reduced significantly after bariatric surgery (mean difference, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.58–3.20; P < .001). However, bariatric surgery resulted in new or worsening features of NAFLD, such as fibrosis, in 12% of patients (95% CI, 5%–20%). The overall Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evidence quality of evidence was very low. Conclusions: Through this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that bariatric surgery leads to complete resolution of NAFLD in obese patients. However, some patients develop new or worsened features of NAFLD. Randomized controlled trials are needed to further examine the therapeutic benefits of bariatric surgery for patients with NAFLD. ? 2019 AGA Institute","Article; ballooning degeneration; bariatric surgery; fatty liver; hepatitis; human; liver biopsy; liver fibrosis; liver histology; liver weight; meta analysis; nonalcoholic fatty liver; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score; systematic review"
"Time-sensitive predictors of embolism in patients with left-sided endocarditis: Cohort study","2019","Introduction Accurate prediction of embolic events in infective endocarditis could inform critical clinical decisions, such as the timing of cardiac surgical intervention. However, many embolic events occur before hospital admission and echocardiography and are thus non-modifiable. We aimed to identify time-sensitive variables that predict embolic events in infective endocarditis, focusing on those that occur after diagnosis. Methods Clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic characteristics were collected from 116 patients with definite or probable left-sided infective endocarditis admitted to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Toronto, Canada) between October 2013 and July 2016; associations between these characteristics and embolic events were identified using simple logistic regression. Results The mean (SD) age was 66 (17) years; 82 patients (71%) were men. The most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (23%) and viridans group streptococci (21%). Seventy-nine (68%) patients had left-sided vegetations, with involvement of the aortic valve in 34 (43%) patients, mitral valve in 37 (47%) patients, and both in 8 (10%) patients. The mean (SD) vegetation size was 10 (7) mm. Forty-three unique patients (37%) had 50 embolic events, with most (34/43; 79%) having a first embolic event (38/50; 76%) before or on the day of echocardiography. There were no significant predictors of the 11 patients with an embolic event after echocardiography; significant predictors of an embolic event at any time were single valve vegetation vs. no vegetation (OR, 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76–12.78) and, among patients with a vegetation, mitral vs. aortic valve location (OR, 4.43; 95%CI, 1.63–12.04). Conclusions Associations between patient and echocardiographic characteristics and embolism in patients with infective endocarditis may be time-sensitive, as few embolic events occurred after clinical and echocardiographic assessment. ? 2019 Yang et al.

"Combining vascular normalization with an oncolytic virus enhances immunotherapy in a preclinical model of advanced-stage ovarian cancer","2019","Purpose: Intravenous delivery of oncolytic viruses often leads to tumor vascular shutdown, resulting in decreased tumor perfusion and elevated tumor hypoxia. We hypothesized that using 3TSR to normalize tumor vasculature prior to administration of an oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) would enhance virus delivery and trafficking of immunologic cell subsets to the tumor core, resulting in systemically enhanced immunotherapy and regression of advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Experimental Design: Using an orthotopic, syngeneic mouse model of advanced-stage EOC, we pretreated mice with 3TSR (4 mg/kg per day) alone or followed by combination with fusogenic NDV(F3aa) (1.0 10 8 plaque-forming units). Results: Treatment with 3TSR normalized tumor vasculature, enhanced blood perfusion of primary EOC tumors, and induced disease regression. Animals treated with combination therapy had the greatest reduction in primary tumor mass, ascites accumulation, and secondary lesions (50% of mice were completely devoid of peritoneal metastases). Combining 3TSR ? NDV(F3aa) led to enhanced trafficking of immunologic cells into the primary tumor core. Conclusions: We have shown, for the first time, that NDV, like other oncolytic viruses, is a potent mediator of acute vascular shutdown and that preventing this through vascular normalization can promote regression in a preclinical model of advanced-stage ovarian cancer. This challenges the current focus on induction of intravascular thrombosis as a requisite for successful oncolytic virotherapy. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","oncolytic virus; viral protein; advanced cancer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer immunotherapy; cancer regression; cancer staging; cell growth; cell viability; controlled study; drug effect; drug potency; female; human; human cell; immunofluorescence test; in vivo study; mouse; Newcastle disease virus; nonhuman; ovary cancer; priority journal; protein expression; tumor hypoxia"
"Antidepressants plus benzodiazepines for adults with major depression","2019","Background Anxiety frequently coexists with depression and adding benzodiazepines to antidepressant treatment is common practice to treat people with major depression. However, more evidence is needed to determine whether this combined treatment is more effective and not any more harmful than antidepressants alone. It has been suggested that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long-term administration and their chronic use carries risks of dependence. This is the 2019 updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2005. This update follows a new protocol to conform with the most recent Cochrane methodology guidelines, with the inclusion of 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE evaluations for quality of evidence. Objectives To assess the effects of combining antidepressants with benzodiazepines compared with antidepressants alone for major depression in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO toMay 2019. We searched theWorld Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any additional unpublished or ongoing studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressants alone for adults with major depression. We excluded studies administering psychosocial therapies targeted at depression and anxiety disorders concurrently. Antidepressants had to be prescribed, on average, at or above the minimum effective dose as presented by Hansen 2009 or according to the North American or European regulations. The combination therapy had to last at least four weeks. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We entered data into Review Manager 5. We used intention-to-treat data. We combined continuous outcome variables of depressive and anxiety severity using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Regarding the primary outcome of acceptability, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies. Main results We identified 10 studies published between 1978 to 2002 involving 731 participants. Six studies used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), two studies used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), one study used another heterocyclic antidepressant and one study used TCA or heterocyclic antidepressant. Combined therapy of benzodiazepines plus antidepressants was more effective than antidepressants alone for depressive severity in the early phase (four weeks) (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.03; 10 studies, 598 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was no difference between treatments in the acute phase (five to 12 weeks) (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.03; 7 studies, 347 participants; low-quality evidence) or in the continuous phase (more than 12 weeks) (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.35; 1 study, 50 participants; low-quality evidence). For acceptability of treatment, there was no difference in the dropouts due to any reason between combined therapy and antidepressants alone (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). For response in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58; 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.35; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 1 study, 52 participants). For remission in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.90, 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 1.31, 95%CI 0.80 to 2.16; 1 study, 52 participants). There was no evidence of a difference between combined therapy and antidepressants alone for anxiety severity in the early phase (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.14; 3 studies, 129 participants) or in the acute phase (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.10; 3 studies, 129 participants). No studies measured severity of insomnia. In terms of adverse effects, the dropout rates due to adverse events were lower for combined therapy than for antidepressants alone (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, participants in the combined therapy group reported at least one adverse effect more often than participants who received antidepressants alone (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23; 7 studies, 510 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Most domains of risk of bias in themajority of the included studies were unclear. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting were problematic due to insufficient details reported in most of the included studies and lack of availability of the study protocols. The greatest limitation in the quality of evidence was issues with attrition. Authors' conclusions Combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in improving depression severity, response in depression and remission in depression in the early phase. However, these effects were not maintained in the acute or the continuous phase. Combined therapy resulted in fewer dropouts due to adverse events than antidepressants alone, but combined therapy was associated with a greater proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. The moderate quality evidence of benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant in the early phase must be balanced judiciously against possible harms and consideration given to other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant monotherapy may be considered inadequate. We need long-term, pragmatic randomised controlled trials to compare combination therapy against the monotherapy of antidepressant in major depression. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

"Burnout and absence among hospital nurses: An empirical study of the role of context in Argentina","2019","This study explores the role of absence and contextual factors on burnout, including shiftwork rotation, stressful work units, and understaffing. The efficacy of absence as a coping mechanism is examined in the most and least stressful work units under conditions of shiftwork rotation and understaffing, respectively. The sample consists of 304 hospital nurses in Argentina. Results reveal that absence mitigates the impact of emotional exhaustion on diminished personal accomplishment among fixed shift nurses who work in the least stressful units. Absence buffers the impact of emotional exhaustion on diminished personal accomplishment in understaffed units. Its role changes when it comes to buffering the impact of emotional exhaustion on depersonalisation across levels of understaffing. We argue that absence plays an attenuating role only when specific contextual factors cohere. Nurses who are aware of this contextual confluence manage their mental health better. These findings have practical implications for healthcare management. ? 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",""
"Inter-rater reliability of Dartfish TM movement analysis software for measuring maximum flexion and extension at the hip and knee in older adults with osteoporosis and osteopenia","2019","Various methods are used to measure hip and knee joint motion angles; however, their use is often limited by cost or inability to measure dynamic movements. The assessment of movement patterns is clinically useful in individuals with osteoporosis (OP) and osteopenia (OPe) through its potential to optimize fracture risk assessment. This study evaluates the inter-rater reliability of using Dartfish TM 2-D Motion Analysis Software to measure maximum flexion and extension angles at the hip and knee in individuals with OP or OPe while performing five tasks of the Safe Functional Motion test. Twelve participants were videotaped performing the pour, footwear, newspaper, sweep, and sit-to-floor tasks. Five raters used Dartfish TM to analyze maximum flexion and extension angles at the hip and knee, and an intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and SEM were calculated for each measurement. In all five tasks, ICC and SEM values ranged from 0.23 to 0.95, and 1.75 to 11.54?degrees, respectively, with maximum knee flexion angles generally having higher ICC, and lower SEM point estimates. The results indicate that Dartfish TM measurements of maximum knee flexion angles in uniplanar tasks demonstrate a moderate to excellent degree of inter-rater reliability, while measurements at the hip joint should be used with caution. Given that the results of this study display moderate to excellent reliability, they lay the groundwork for future research aimed at determining the validity of these measurements. Such research would help to further develop the base of evidence surrounding the usefulness of Dartfish TM Motion Analysis in fracture risk analysis among individuals with OP. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis.","aged; biomechanics; computer assisted diagnosis; cross-sectional study; female; hip; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; metabolic bone disease; middle aged; observer variation; osteoporosis; pathophysiology; physical examination; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; software; videorecording; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hip Joint; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Osteoporosis; Physical Examination; Predictive Value of Tests; Range of Motion, Articular; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Video Recording"
"Oncolytic viruses: how “lytic” must they be for therapeutic efficacy?","2019","Oncolytic viruses (OVs) preferentially target and kill cancer cells without affecting healthy cells through a multi-modal mechanism of action. While historically the direct killing activity of OVs was considered the primary mode of action, initiation or augmentation of a host antitumor immune response is now considered an essential aspect of oncolytic virotherapy.

"Impact of Prolonged Anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban on Provoked Venous Thromboembolism Recurrence: IMPROVE-VTE","2019","Background: We sought to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of prolonged anticoagulation with rivaroxaban following a provoked venous thromboembolism. Methods: Using US MarketScan claims from November 2012 to March 2017, we identified adults with ?1 primary hospitalization or emergency department diagnosis code for venous thromboembolism, a provoking (major or minor, persistent or transient) risk factor, at least 3 months of continuous rivaroxaban treatment, and ?12 months of continuous insurance benefits prior to their qualifying venous thromboembolism. Patients were categorized as either continuing rivaroxaban or discontinuing anticoagulation (no anticoagulation or nonaspirin antiplatelet agents but may have received aspirin) after the initial 3 months of rivaroxaban treatment (index date). Differences in baseline covariates between cohorts were adjusted for using inverse probability-of-treatment weights based on propensity scores (absolute standardized differences <0.1 achieved for all covariates after adjustment). Twelve month incidences of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding were compared between cohorts using Cox regression (according to an intention-to-treat methodology) and reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Among patients experiencing a provoked venous thromboembolism and treated with rivaroxaban for the first 3 months (N=4,990), continued rivaroxaban use beyond 3 months (median [25%, 75% range duration of additional rivaroxaban use = 3 [2, 5] months) was associated with a 44% (95% CI of 9%-66%) lower hazard of recurrent venous thromboembolism without altering major bleeding risk [HR of 0.87, 95% CI of 0.51-1.49] versus anticoagulation discontinuation (with or without aspirin use). Conclusions: Our study suggests continuing rivaroxaban after the initial 3 month period was associated with a decreased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The observed reduction in recurrent venous thromboembolism with prolonged rivaroxaban use was not associated with a significant change in major bleeding risk. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; antiulcer agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; estrogen derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; rivaroxaban; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; rivaroxaban; adult; aged; anticoagulant therapy; Article; chronic drug administration; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug safety; emergency ward; female; health insurance; hospitalization; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; patient coding; priority journal; probability; propensity score; recurrent disease; retrospective study; risk factor; standardization; venous thromboembolism; middle aged; recurrent disease; secondary prevention; venous thromboembolism; Aged; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Rivaroxaban; Secondary Prevention; Venous Thromboembolism"
"Benefits and limitations of genome-wide association studies","2019","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve testing genetic variants across the genomes of many individuals to identify genotype–phenotype associations. GWAS have revolutionized the field of complex disease genetics over the past decade, providing numerous compelling associations for human complex traits and diseases. Despite clear successes in identifying novel disease susceptibility genes and biological pathways and in translating these findings into clinical care, GWAS have not been without controversy. Prominent criticisms include concerns that GWAS will eventually implicate the entire genome in disease predisposition and that most association signals reflect variants and genes with no direct biological relevance to disease. In this Review, we comprehensively assess the benefits and limitations of GWAS in human populations and discuss the relevance of performing more GWAS. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","cost effectiveness analysis; ethnic difference; gene identification; gene mapping; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; genotype; heritability; human; iceberg; management; monogenic disorder; predictive value; priority journal; Review; animal; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; genome; genome-wide association study; phenotype; procedures; Animals; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genome; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Phenotype"
"Reporting, presentation and wording of recommendations in clinical practice guideline for gout: A systematic analysis","2019","Objectives We systematically analysed recommendations from gout guidelines as an example, to provide a basis for developing a reporting standard of recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Design Systematic review without meta-analysis. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE and all relevant guideline websites (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, WHO, Guidelines International Network, DynaMed, UpTodate, Best Practice) from their inception to January 2017 to identify and select gout CPGs. We used search terms such as gout', 'hyperuricemia' and 'guideline'. We included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria after screening titles, abstracts and full texts. The characteristics of recommendations reported in the included guidelines were extracted and analysed. Results A total of 15 gout guidelines with a range of 5-80 recommendations were retrieved. Several indicators were used in the gout guidelines to facilitate identification of recommendations, including grouping all recommendations in a summary section, formatting recommendations in a particular or special way, using locating words for recommendations and indicating the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. We found some components commonly used in the recommendations. The wording of recommendations varied across guidelines. Recommendations were detailed and explained in the section of rationale and explanation of recommendations. In some guidelines, recommendations were accompanied with other material to assist their reporting. Conclusions Variability and inconsistency were found on the reporting and presentation of recommendations in gout guidelines. Several points for reporting recommendation can be summarised. First, we suggested summarising and highlighting the core recommendations in a guideline. Second, guideline developers should try to structure and write recommendations reasonably. Third, it was necessary to detail and explain the recommendations and their rationale. Finally, describing and providing other potential useful contents was also a helpful way for clear reporting. ?

"Arti Hurria and the progress in integrating the geriatric assessment into oncology: Young international society of geriatric oncology review paper","2019","Until recently, the progress in the diagnosis and management of cancer has not been matched by similar progress in the assessment of the increasing numbers of older and more complex patients with cancer. Dr. Arti Hurria identified this gap at the outset of her career, which she dedicated toward studying the geriatric assessment (GA) as an improvement over traditional methods used in oncology to assess vulnerability in older patients with cancer. This review documents the progress of the GA and its integration into oncology. First, we detail the GA's origins in the field of geriatrics. Next, we chronicle the early rise of geriatric oncology, highlighting the calls of early thought-leaders to meet the demands of the rapidly aging cancer population. We describe Dr. Hurria's early efforts toward meeting these calls though the implementation of the GA in oncology research. We then summarize some of the seminal studies constituting the evidence base supporting GA's implementation. Finally, we lay out the evolution of cancer-focused guidelines recommending the GA, concluding with future needs to advance the next steps toward more widespread implementation in routine cancer care. Throughout, we describe Dr. Hurria's vision and its execution in driving progress of the GA in oncology, from her fellowship training to her co-authored guidelines recommending GA for all older adults with cancer—published in the year of her untimely death. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","aged; aging; death; female; geriatric assessment; geriatrics; human; leadership; male; oncology; review; stratification; vision"
"Diet-induced hepatic steatosis abrogates cell-surface LDLR by inducing de novo PCSK9 expression in mice","2019","The worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing rapidly. Although this condition is generally benign, accumulating evidence now suggests that patients with NAFLD are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death in developed nations. Despite the well-established role of the liver as a central regulator of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, a known driver of CVD, the mechanism(s) by which hepatic steatosis contributes to CVD remains elusive. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels correlate positively with liver steatosis grade. Given that PCSK9 degrades the LDL receptor (LDLR) and prevents the removal of LDL from the blood into the liver, in the present study we examined the effect of hepatic steatosis on LDLR expression and circulating LDL cholesterol levels. We now report that in a manner consistent with findings in patients, diet-induced steatosis increases circulating PCSK9 levels as a result of de novo expression in mice. We also report the finding that steatosis abrogates hepatic LDLR expression and increases circulating LDL levels in a PCSK9-dependent manner. These findings provide important mechanistic insights as to how hepatic steatosis modulates lipid regulatory genes, including PCSK9 and the LDLR, and also highlights a novel mechanism by which liver disease may contribute to CVD. ? 2019 Lebeau et al.","Cell membranes; Cholesterol; Mammals; Cardiovascular disease; Cholesterol levels; Hepatic steatosis; LDL cholesterol; Liver steatosis; Low density lipoproteins; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Regulatory genes; Diseases; 4 phenylbutyric acid; fibronectin; glucose regulated protein 78; glucose regulated protein 94; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein receptor; metformin; palmitic acid; proprotein convertase 9; protein IRE1; sterol regulatory element binding protein 2; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; clinical article; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fatty liver; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal"
"Road avoidance and its energetic consequences for reptiles","2019","Roads are one of the most widespread human-caused habitat modifications that can increase wildlife mortality rates and alter behavior. Roads can act as barriers with variable permeability to movement and can increase distances wildlife travel to access habitats. Movement is energetically costly, and avoidance of roads could therefore impact an animal's energy budget. We tested whether reptiles avoid roads or road crossings and explored whether the energetic consequences of road avoidance decreased individual fitness. Using telemetry data from Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii; 11,658 locations of 286 turtles from 15 sites) and eastern massasaugas (Sistrurus catenatus; 1,868 locations of 49 snakes from 3 sites), we compared frequency of observed road crossings and use of road-adjacent habitat by reptiles to expected frequencies based on simulated correlated random walks. Turtles and snakes did not avoid habitats near roads, but both species avoided road crossings. Compared with simulations, turtles made fewer crossings of paved roads with low speed limits and more crossings of paved roads with high speed limits. Snakes made fewer crossings of all road types than expected based on simulated paths. Turtles traveled longer daily distances when their home range contained roads, but the predicted energetic cost was negligible: substantially less than the cost of producing one egg. Snakes with roads in their home range did not travel further per day than snakes without roads in their home range. We found that turtles and snakes avoided crossing roads, but road avoidance is unlikely to impact fitness through energetic expenditures. Therefore, mortality from vehicle strikes remains the most significant impact of roads on reptile populations. ? 2019 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",""
"Research Review: Test–retest reliability of standardized diagnostic interviews to assess child and adolescent psychiatric disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: A better understanding of factors contributing to the observed variability in estimates of test–retest reliability in published studies on standardized diagnostic interviews (SDI) is needed. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the pooled test–retest reliability for parent and youth assessments of seven common disorders, and to examine sources of between-study heterogeneity in reliability. Methods: Following a systematic review of the literature, multilevel random effects meta-analyses were used to analyse 202 reliability estimates (Cohen's kappa?=??) from 31 eligible studies and 5,369 assessments of 3,344 children and youth. Results: Pooled reliability was moderate at ??=.58 (CI 95% 0.53–0.63) and between-study heterogeneity was substantial (Q?=?2,063 (df?=?201), p?&lt;.001 and I2?=?79%). In subgroup analysis, reliability varied across informants for specific types of psychiatric disorder (??=.53–.69 for parent vs. ??=.39–.68 for youth) with estimates significantly higher for parents on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and the broad groupings of externalizing and any disorder. Reliability was also significantly higher in studies with indicators of poor or fair study methodology quality (sample size &lt;50, retest interval &lt;7?days). Conclusions: Our findings raise important questions about the meaningfulness of published evidence on the test–retest reliability of SDIs and the usefulness of these tools in both clinical and research contexts. Potential remedies include the introduction of standardized study and reporting requirements for reliability studies, and exploration of other approaches to assessing and classifying child and adolescent psychiatric disorder. ? 2018 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",""
"A community health case for psychiatric care: A cross-sectional study of county health rankings","2019","Objectives: To determine if there is an association between the provision of mental health services and county health rankings in the United States. Methods: We used retrospective population-based, 2016 U.S. county level cross-sectional analysis to determine the association of mental health services provision on U.S. counties health rankings. The key dependent variables in this study were the county health factor rankings (CHR). The presence of inpatient, outpatient and other facilities which may provide mental health services are identified for each county. Multilevel mixed effects ordinal logistic regression models were used to account for nesting effects utilizing two levels of data which include hospital- and county-level data. Results: Better county health rankings were associated with the presence of Outpatient services (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55–0.85) and Psychiatric hospital (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.40–0.74). Conclusion: These findings suggest a significant association between psychiatric care and community health. Access to psychiatric services is associated with improved population health. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dependent variable; female; hospital patient; human; male; mental health service; mental hospital; nesting; outpatient care; population health; retrospective study; United States; ambulatory care; cross-sectional study; mental health service; mental hospital; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Ambulatory Care; Community Mental Health Services; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Models, Statistical; Retrospective Studies"

"Time of Transfer of Admitted Patients from the ED: A Contributor to ED Boarding in High-Volume Community Hospitals","2019","The twin challenges of bed boarding and ""hallway medicine"" have emerged in recent years as key healthcare issues. Many hospitals, challenged with increasing demand and limited resources, have tried to find efficiencies within their operations. One such strategy is that of early morning discharges and expedited bed turnaround times. We conducted a retrospective study within three high-volume hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area looking at discharge times of in-patients and transfer times of admitted, Emergency Department (ED)-boarded patients. We discovered a consistent pattern of late-in-the-day discharges, and even later-in-the-day transfers of boarded ED patients, indicating that this may be a potential source of increased efficiency for overburdened hospitals.

"The Forest and the Trees: Evidence-Based Medicine in the Age of Information","2019","In 2005, John Hamilton2 wrote in the Journal on how best to practice evidence-based medicine, namely develop an answerable question from a clinical situation and then work your way down a hierarchy of evidence to identify the best available evidence to inform your clinical decision. He advised formulating each clinical question requiring the use of evidence as population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and timing (PICOT). Actually, Hamilton referred to PECOT, where “E” stands for “exposure,” but we prefer the acronym Haynes et al.3 used. For Alyssa's query, the question would be, “Among adolescents with depression (P), is venlafaxine (I) more effective than placebo (C) in decreasing depressive symptoms (O) after 12 weeks (T)?” In this Translations article, we set out to answer the question, “What approach is currently recommended for clinicians searching for high-quality evidence to guide optimal clinical decision making?” When Hamilton wrote his piece, he focused on individual randomized controlled trials as the primary source of good evidence. However, in 2018, given the amount of information available, it has become increasingly clear that it is more helpful and efficient to start with high-quality evidence syntheses of primary studies (ie, systematic reviews [SRs], meta-analyses [MAs], and clinical practice guidelines [CPGs]) rather than with the individual primary studies. This means that clinicians now need to become versed in how to distinguish a high-quality synthesis from low-quality ones. ? 2018 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry","clozapine; midazolam; olanzapine; risperidone; venlafaxine; adolescent; adolescent depression; anhedonia; case report; clinical article; clinical decision making; clinical research; concentration loss; disease severity; Editorial; empirical research; evidence based medicine; female; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; insomnia; mental health; patient preference; practice guideline; priority journal; shared decision making; symptom"
"Perceptions of barriers to accessing perinatal mental health care in midwifery: A scoping review","2019","Background: Despite greater contact with the healthcare system during the perinatal period, detection and treatment of perinatal mental health conditions remain suboptimal. Aim: To explore midwives’ and midwifery clients’ perceptions of factors that impede access to perinatal mental health care in high resource settings. Design: Scoping review. Methods: Arksey and O'Malley's (2006) framework for scoping studies was employed. A systematic search of the literature was completed. Included publications must have (1) addressed barriers to obtaining perinatal mental health care; (2) been either peer-reviewed primary literature or grey literature; (3) if primary literature, the study explored the perceptions of midwives or those in midwifery care; and (4) if grey literature, the publication pertained directly to midwifery care. A study was excluded from the review if (1) it was published in a language other than English; (2) it was published prior to the year 2000; or (3) it took place in a country with a Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) above 14. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque et al.'s (2013) ten-dimension framework (five supply-side dimensions and five demand-side dimensions) on access to health care in order to determine which points along the chain to accessing perinatal mental health care were most adversely impacted. Findings: The search yielded a total of 1051 records, and twenty-six were included in the review (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, grey literature). Supply-side barriers included midwives’ lack of PMH training, knowledge, and confidence, both generally and cross-culturally; inconsistent screening practices; broken referral pathways; lack of specialized services; underlying stigma toward those with PMH concerns; inefficiently long wait lists for services; and midwives’ perception that PMH is not within their scope of practice. Demand-side barriers included emotional isolation and loneliness; normalization of PMH concerns as symptoms of pregnancy; cultural norms surrounding motherhood and mental health; and symptoms of PMH concerns as inhibiting the ability to obtain help. Conclusions and implications for practice: Twenty-one out of the twenty-six publications included in this review identified problems at the very beginning of the care-accessing process, suggesting that PMH care is often unapproachable, or that people are unable to perceive their need for care in the first place. Midwives can help ameliorate these initial barriers by engaging in additional perinatal mental health training in order to increase knowledge and confidence; being aware of community resources and referral pathways; and initiating discussion about perinatal mental health with all clients with the help of a validated screening tool. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","female; human; human experiment; language; loneliness; maternal mortality; mental health care; midwife; patient referral; perception; pregnancy; publication; quantitative analysis; review; scope of practice; stigma; systematic review; adult; health care delivery; mental health service; midwife; nurse midwife; prenatal care; procedures; psychology; standards; Adult; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mental Health Services; Midwifery; Nurse Midwives; Perception; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care"
"Untangling the ethical intersection of epidemiology, human subjects research, and public health","2019","Purpose: Members of the American College of Epidemiology (ACE) Ethics Committee identified current ethics and epidemiology topic areas to consider for further discussion, consultation, teaching opportunities, and conference presentation. This article reflects on the activities of the Committee at the ACE Annual Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, September 24–26, 2017. Methods: The overall aim for the Ethics Committee was to engage members of the College and other audiences and highlight the evolution of ethics and epidemiology since the inception of the original Ethics Guidelines published by the ACE Ethics and Standards of Practice Committee in 2000. The Ethics Committee organized a symposium session at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ACE on the ethics of human subjects research as it relates to specialized areas of epidemiology and the intersecting role of public health. This article presents a summary and further discussion of that symposium session. Results: Three topic areas were presented: an overview of ethics and epidemiology (E.S.P.), very high biomarker levels in environmental epidemiology research (S.M.P.), and the interface of epidemiology, human subjects research, and public health interventions (S.M.). This article begins by reviewing the foundations of epidemiology and public health and the well-known ethical principles of human subjects research. Then, it considers the ethical considerations in the use of population registry data in epidemiological research, environmental epidemiology, and epidemic surveillance and response. This article may form the basis of teaching of ethics principles related to epidemiology and public health and may serve as a companion piece to the original ACE Ethics Guidelines. Conclusions: Researchers are increasingly faced with ethical considerations in diverse, nontraditional, and specialized areas of epidemiology and public health. This article illustrates these challenges with real-world examples of clinical and population registry data, the study of environmental biomarkers, and Zika virus epidemic; it also reviews relevant ethical principles underpinning these examples and identifies where gaps in knowledge may exist. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article; clinical research; epidemiology; human; medical ethics; population; priority journal; public health; register; symposium"

"Adiposity measures and their validity in estimating risk of hypertension in South Asian children: A cross-sectional study","2019","Objective Given the South Asian phenotype of higher body fat at similar body mass index (BMI) relative to Caucasians, we sought to explore the association between prominent adiposity indicators with blood pressure (BP) and hypertension, to compare the accuracy of these indicators in estimating hypertension, and to provide cut-off values associated with adverse hypertension risk in South Asian children. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Community-based recruitment in two Canadian cities (Hamilton and Surrey). Participants South Asian children (n=762) were recruited from two Canadian cities. Waist circumference, waist to height ratio and BMI were determined. Body fat percentage was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis and BP was assessed using an automated device. All variables (except body fat percentage) were transformed to z-scores using published standards. Outcome measures Linear and Poisson regression was used to explore associations between the adiposity indicators with BP z-score and hypertension. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to explore the strength of the adiposity indicators in estimating hypertension risk and sex-stratified optimal adiposity cut-off values associated with hypertension risk. Results Significant associations were detected in adjusted and unadjusted models between the adiposity indicators with BP z-score and hypertension (p<0.01 for all). The area under the curve (AUC) values for the adiposity indicators for boys and girls ranged from 0.74 to 0.80, suggesting that the adiposity indicators are fair measures of estimating hypertension risk. Sex-stratified cut-off associated with adverse risk of hypertension for girls and boys, respectively, were at the 92nd and 82nd percentile for BMI z-scores, 65th and 80th percentile for WC z-score, 63rd and 67th percentile for WHtR z-score and at 29.8% and 23.5% for body fat. Conclusion Our results show associations between adiposity indicators with BP and hypertension and suggests that South Asian children might be at adverse risk of hypertension at levels of adiposity considered normal. ?

"Debiasing versus knowledge retrieval checklists to reduce diagnostic error in ECG interpretation","2019","There is an ongoing debate regarding the cause of diagnostic errors. One view is that errors result from unconscious application of cognitive heuristics; the alternative is that errors are a consequence of knowledge deficits. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of checklists that (a) identify and address cognitive biases or (b) promote knowledge retrieval, as a means to reduce errors in ECG interpretation. Novice postgraduate year (PGY) 1 emergency medicine and internal medicine residents (n = 40) and experienced cardiology fellows (PGY 4–6) (n = 21) were randomly allocated to three conditions: a debiasing checklist, a content (knowledge) checklist, or control (no checklist) to be used while interpreting 20 ECGs. Half of the ECGs were deliberately engineered to predispose to bias. Diagnostic performance under either checklist intervention was not significantly better than the control. As expected, more errors occurred when cases were designed to induce bias (F = 96.9, p < 0.0001). There was no significant interaction between the instructional condition and level of learner. Checklists attempting to help learners identify cognitive bias or mobilize domain-specific knowledge did not have an overall effect in reducing diagnostic errors in ECG interpretation, although they may help novices. Even when cognitive biases are deliberately inserted in cases, cognitive debiasing checklists did not improve participants’ performance. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","adult; article; cardiology; checklist; clinical article; cognitive bias; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; diagnostic error; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; electrocardiogram; emergency medicine; female; human; human experiment; information retrieval; male; postgraduate student; randomized controlled trial; resident"

"Oncological Outcomes of Laparoscopic Nephroureterectomy Versus Open Radical Nephroureterectomy for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: An European Association of Urology Guidelines Systematic Review","2019","The oncological outcomes of laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy may be poorer than those of open radical nephroureterectomy when bladder cuff is excised laparoscopically, and in patients with locally advanced high-risk (pT3/pT4 and/or high-grade) upper tract urothelial carcinoma. ? 2017 European Association of UrologyContext: Most series have suggested better perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) over open RNU. However, the oncological safety of laparoscopic RNU remains controversial. Objective: To systematically review all relevant literature comparing oncological outcomes of open versus laparoscopic RNU. Evidence acquisition: A systematic literature search using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases and clinicaltrial.gov was performed in December 2014 and updated in August 2016. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective or retrospective nonrandomised comparative studies comparing the oncological outcomes of any laparoscopic RNU with those of open RNU were included. The primary outcome was cancer-specific survival. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using Cochrane RoB tools. A narrative synthesis of the evidence is presented. Evidence synthesis: Overall, 42 studies were included, which accounted for 7554 patients: 4925 in the open groups and 2629 in the laparoscopic groups. Most included studies were retrospective comparative series. Only one RCT was found. RoB and confounding were high in most studies. No study compared the oncological outcomes of robotic RNU with those of open RNU. Bladder cuff excision in laparoscopic groups was performed via an open approach in most studies, with only three studies reporting laparoscopic removal of the bladder cuff. Port-site metastasis rates ranged from 0% to 2.8%. No significant difference in oncological outcomes was reported in most series. However, three studies, including the only RCT, reported significantly poorer oncological outcomes in patients who underwent laparoscopic RNU, especially in the subgroups of patients with locally advanced (pT3/pT4) or high-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), as well as in instances when the bladder cuff was excised laparoscopically. Conclusions: The current available evidence suggests that the oncological outcomes of laparoscopic RNU may be poorer than those of open RNU when bladder cuff is excised laparoscopically and in patients with locally advanced high-risk (pT3/pT4 and/or high-grade) UTUC. Patient summary: We reviewed the literature comparing the outcomes of two different surgical procedures for the treatment of upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Open radical nephroureterectomy is a surgical procedure in which the kidney is removed through a large incision in the abdomen, while in laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy, the kidney is removed through a number of small incisions. Our findings suggest that the outcomes of laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy may be poorer than those of open radical nephroureterectomy, particularly when the bladder cuff is also required to be removed. Laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy may also be less effective in patients with locally advanced (pT3/pT4) or high-grade upper tract urothelial carcinomas. ? 2017 European Association of Urology","cancer specific survival; clinical practice; disease severity; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic nephroureterectomy; metastasis free survival; nephroureterectomy; open radical nephroureterectomy; outcome assessment; overall survival; port site metastasis; postoperative period; practice guideline; recurrence free survival; Review; surgical approach; surgical technique; systematic review; transitional cell carcinoma; adverse event; bladder; comparative study; disease free survival; epidemiology; Europe; laparoscopy; nephroureterectomy; organization and management; pathology; perioperative period; practice guideline; procedures; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; retrospective study; transitional cell carcinoma; treatment outcome; ureter tumor; urology; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Disease-Free Survival; Europe; Humans; Laparoscopy; Nephroureterectomy; Perioperative Period; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Prospective Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Ureteral Neoplasms; Urinary Bladder; Urology"

"Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12?weeks in hepatitis C virus-infected patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis","2019","Background & Aims: Although off-label use of sofosbuvir-containing regimens occurs regularly in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection undergoing dialysis for severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), these regimens are not licensed for this indication, and there is an absence of dosing recommendations in this population. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients with HCV infection with ESRD undergoing dialysis. Methods: In this phase II, single-arm study, 59 patients with genotype 1–6 HCV infection with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received open-label sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (400 mg/100 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. Patients were HCV treatment naive or treatment experienced without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. Patients previously treated with any HCV NS5A inhibitor were not eligible. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after discontinuation of treatment (SVR12). The primary safety endpoint was the proportion of patients who discontinued study drug due to adverse events. Results: Overall, 56 of 59 patients achieved SVR12 (95%; 95% CI 86–99%). Of the 3 patients who did not achieve SVR12, 2 patients had virologic relapse determined at post-treatment Week 4 (including 1 who prematurely discontinued study treatment), and 1 patient died from suicide after achieving SVR through post-treatment Week 4. The most common adverse events were headache (17%), fatigue (14%), nausea (14%), and vomiting (14%). Serious adverse events were reported for 11 patients (19%), and all were deemed to be unrelated to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Conclusions: Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks was safe and effective in patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis. Lay summary: Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is a combination direct-acting antiviral that is approved for treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Despite the lack of dosing recommendations, sofosbuvir-containing regimens (including sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) are frequently used for HCV-infected patients undergoing dialysis. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in patients with HCV infection who were undergoing dialysis. Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was safe and well tolerated, resulting in a cure rate of 95% in patients with HCV infection and end-stage renal disease.

"Learning to lead: a review and synthesis of literature examining health care managers' use of knowledge","2019","Background: Scholarship cites health care managers (HCMs) as not using research evidence in their management practice. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance HCMs use of research evidence in practice. Methods: We carried out a systematic review and focus groups to validate the review findings. We searched 10 electronic databases for studies reporting on interventions for HCMs to enhance research utilization in their practice. Qualitative studies were analysed using Hoon’s approach to meta-synthesis. Results: Seven, primarily qualitative, studies of varying quality (reported in 11 articles) met our inclusion criteria. Interventions to enhance research use by HCMs included: informal and formal training, computer-based application, executive-level knowledge translation activities and residency programmes. Studies did not report efficacy of interventions or impacts of increasing managers’ use of research on staff or patient outcomes. Meta-synthesis yielded four contextual factors influencing the perceived effectiveness of interventions to enhance research use by HCMs: organizational culture, competing priorities, time as a resource and capacity building. Included studies differed in how they defined research and demonstrated varying understandings of research among HCMs, limiting the generalizability of work in this field. Conclusions: Healthcare managers are increasingly called upon to make evidence-based decisions in practice, but the small number of studies and diverse strategies employed hinder our ability to identify any intervention to increase use of evidence as superior. Future studies in this area should clearly articulate the definition of research evidence they base their decisions on. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42014006256). ?

"Composition and Variation of the Human Milk Microbiota Are Influenced by Maternal and Early-Life Factors","2019","Breastmilk contains a complex community of bacteria that may help seed the infant gut microbiota. The composition and determinants of milk microbiota are poorly understood. Among 393 mother-infant dyads from the CHILD cohort, we found that milk microbiota at 3–4 months postpartum was dominated by inversely correlated Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and exhibited discrete compositional patterns. Milk microbiota composition and diversity were associated with maternal factors (BMI, parity, and mode of delivery), breastfeeding practices, and other milk components in a sex-specific manner. Causal modeling identified mode of breastfeeding as a key determinant of milk microbiota composition. Specifically, providing pumped breastmilk was consistently associated with multiple microbiota parameters including enrichment of potential pathogens and depletion of bifidobacteria. Further, these data support the retrograde inoculation hypothesis, whereby the infant oral cavity impacts the milk microbiota. Collectively, these results identify features and determinants of human milk microbiota composition, with potential implications for infant health and development. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.Moossavi et al. examine human milk microbiota in the CHILD birth cohort and use causal modeling to describe sex-specific associations with maternal, infant, and early-life factors. A strong association with feeding method (i.e., pumped versus directly at the breast) suggests some milk bacteria originate from the infant oral cavity. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","article; body mass; breast feeding; breast milk; causal modeling; child; child health; female; Firmicutes; human; infant; infectious agent; inoculation; major clinical study; male; microbiome; mouth cavity; nonhuman; parity; Proteobacteria; adult; Bifidobacterium; breast milk; cohort analysis; genetics; longitudinal study; maternal age; maternal welfare; microbiology; sex factor; bacterial DNA; Adult; Bifidobacterium; Breast Feeding; Cohort Studies; DNA, Bacterial; Female; Firmicutes; Humans; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Maternal Age; Maternal Health; Milk, Human; Proteobacteria; Sex Factors"
"Safety and Feasibility of Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Criteria to Identify Patients with ""good Prognosis"" Rectal Cancer Eligible for Primary Surgery: The Phase 2 Nonrandomized QuickSilver Clinical Trial","2019","Importance: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT), followed by surgery, is the recommended approach for stage II and III rectal cancer. While CRT decreases the risk of local recurrence, it does not improve survival and leads to poorer functional outcomes than surgery alone. Therefore, new approaches to better select patients for CRT are important. Objective: To conduct a phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria to select patients with ""good prognosis"" rectal tumors for primary surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective nonrandomized phase 2 study at 12 high-volume colorectal surgery centers across Canada. From September 30, 2014, to October 21, 2016, a total of 82 patients were recruited for the study. Participants were patients newly diagnosed as having rectal cancer with MRI-predicted good prognosis rectal cancer. The MRI criteria for good prognosis tumors included distance to the mesorectal fascia greater than 1 mm; definite T2, T2/early T3, or definite T3 with less than 5 mm of extramural depth of invasion; and absent or equivocal extramural venous invasion. Interventions: Patients with rectal cancer with MRI-predicted good prognosis tumors underwent primary surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) rate. Assuming a 10% baseline probability of a positive CRM, a sample size of 75 was estimated to yield a 95% CI of ±6.7%. Results: Eighty-two patients (74% male) participated in the study. The median age at the time of surgery was 66 years (range, 37-89 years). Based on MRI, most tumors were midrectal (65% [n = 53]), T2/early T3 (60% [n = 49]), with no suspicious lymph nodes (63% [n = 52]). On final pathology, 91% (n = 75) of tumors were T2 or greater, 29% (n = 24) were node positive, and 59% (n = 48) were stage II or III. The positive CRM rate was 4 of 82 (4.9%; 95% CI, 0.2%-9.6%). Conclusions and Relevance: The use of MRI criteria to select patients with good prognosis rectal cancer for primary surgery results in a low rate of positive CRM and suggests that CRT may not be necessary for all patients with stage II and III rectal cancer. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

PROTROPIC?: valeur pronostique de l’?l?vation des troponines dans une maladie critique]","2019","Purpose: Elevated cardiac troponin concentrations in people with critical illness are associated with an increased risk of death. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a larger study to ascertain the utility of cardiac troponin as a prognostic tool for mortality in critically ill patients. Methods: Patients admitted to participating intensive care units during the one-month enrolment period were eligible. We excluded cardiac surgical patients and patients who were admitted and either died or were discharged within 12 hr. In enrolled patients, we measured high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and obtained electrocardiograms to ascertain the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and isolated troponin elevation. Our feasibility objectives were to measure recruitment rate, the proportion of patients who consented under a deferred consent model, and time required for data collection and study procedures. Results: Over a four-week enrolment period, 280 patients were enrolled using a deferred consent model. We obtained subsequent consent from 81% of patients. Study procedures and data collection required 1.7 hr per participant. Overall, 86 (38%) suffered a MI, 23 (10%) had an isolated hs-cTnI elevation, and 117 (52%) had no hs-cTnI elevation. The crude hospital mortality rate was 10% without an hs-cTnI elevation, 29% with an isolated hs-cTnl elevation (relative risk [RR]) 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 6.0) and 29% with an MI (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 5.1). Conclusion: Myocardial injury with elevated hs-cTnI concentrations and MIs occur frequently during critical illness.

"The ART of conversation: Feasibility and acceptability of a pilot peer intervention to help transition complex HIV-positive people from hospital to community","2019","Objectives To pilot a peer-based intervention for people living with HIV who used substances, had challenges with antiretroviral adherence and would be discharged from hospital to community. Study design A community-based, quasi-experimental pilot intervention study designed to assess feasibility, acceptability and connection to a community-based HIV organisation. Setting This study was conducted in Toronto, Canada, at Casey House (CH; hospital for people living with HIV) in collaboration with the AIDS Committee of Toronto (ACT; community-based HIV organisation). Participants People living with HIV who were CH inpatient between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, struggled with antiretroviral adherence, actively used substances and would be discharged to community were eligible. Forty people met criteria, 19 were approached by an inpatient nurse and 17 consented. Average age was 48.8 years (SD=11.4), 58.8% were male and participants averaged 7.8 physical and mental health comorbidities (SD=3.1). Intervention Titled 'The ART of Conversation', the three-pronged personalised intervention was developed through input from CH clients and ACT volunteers, all living with HIV. Intervention components were (a) predischarge goal-setting (adherence, substance use and self-identified goal) with the study nurse; (b) predischarge meeting with an HIV+ peer volunteer (PV) and (c) nine postdischarge phone calls between PV and participant, once per day for 3 days, then once per week for 6 weeks. Primary outcomes Feasibility was measured through proportion of eligible participants recruited and PV availability. Acceptability was assessed through participant interviews at three times (preintervention, post-intervention and 6 weeks follow-up) and through PV call logs. Client records determined connection to ACT within the study timeframe. Results Twelve participants completed the intervention and nine connected with ACT. Predischarge goal-setting and PV meeting were both feasible and acceptable. Postdischarge phone calls were a challenge as half of completers missed at least one call. Conclusions Although predischarge goal-setting and PV meeting were feasible, methods to maintain connection following discharge require further investigation. ?

"Long term prognostic importance of late gadolinium enhancement in first-presentation non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy","2019","Background: Presence of myocardial fibrosis in well-established non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. However, the impact of myocardial fibrosis at first presentation in NIDCM, and its long-term association with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF) and ventricular arrhythmia (VA) remains unclear. We investigated whether the presence of myocardial fibrosis quantified by late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) at presentation, is independently associated with long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with first presentation NIDCM. Methods: Consecutive patients with a first diagnosis of NIDCM were recruited. Patients underwent LGE-CMR at baseline. Replacement myocardial fibrosis by LGE-CMR was quantified by experienced observers blinded to patient outcome. MACE was defined as a composite end-point including cardiac death, HF rehospitalisation and the occurrence of sustained VA. Results: Fifty-one patients with first presentation NIDCM were included, of which 49 (96%) had follow up and outcome data. Median follow up was 8.2 years. Both the LGE positive and LGE negative groups had similar clinical characteristics at follow up. In univariate Cox regression analysis, positive LGE was associated with MACE (HR:3.44; 95% CI:1.89 to 6.24, p-value < 0.001) and HF rehospitalisation (HR:2.89; 95% CI:1.42 to 5.85, p-value = 0.003). In multivariate Cox regression, positive LGE-CMR was independently associated with MACE (HR:3.53; 95% CI:1.51 to 8.27, p-value = 0.004) and HF rehospitalisation (HR:3.07; 95% CI:1.24 to 7.59, p-value = 0.015). Conclusions: The presence of myocardial fibrosis in first presentation NIDCM is independently associated with an increased risk of HF rehospitalisation, at long term follow-up. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","gadolinium; gadolinium; adult; aged; Article; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; congestive cardiomyopathy; disease association; female; follow up; heart death; heart failure; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle arrhythmia; hospital readmission; human; late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance; major clinical study; male; non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; prognostic assessment; risk assessment; risk factor; cine magnetic resonance imaging; congestive cardiomyopathy; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; prognosis; time factor; Aged; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gadolinium; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Readmission; Prognosis; Time Factors"
"Under-and over-diagnosis of COPD: A global perspective","2019","Globally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth major cause of mortality and morbidity and projected to rise to third within a decade as our efforts to prevent, identify, diagnose and treat patients at a global population level have been insufficient. The European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society, along with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy document, have highlighted key pathological risk factors and suggested clinical treatment strategies in order to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with COPD. This review focuses solely on issues related to the under-and over-diagnosis of COPD across the main geographical regions of the world and highlights some of the associated risk factors. Prevalence of COPD obtained mainly from epidemiological studies varies greatly depending on the clinical and spirometric criteria used to diagnose COPD, i.e. forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity ratio <0.7 or 5% below the lower limit of normal, and this subsequently affects the rates of under-and over-diagnosis. Although under-utilisation of spirometry is the major reason, additional factors such as exposure to airborne pollutants, educational level, age of patients and language barriers have been widely identified as other potential risk factors. Co-existent diseases, such as asthma, bronchiectasis, heart failure and previously treated tuberculosis, are reported to be the other determinants of under-and over-diagnosis of COPD. ?

"Codesigning health and other public services with vulnerable and disadvantaged populations: Insights from an international collaboration","2019","Background: Codesign has the potential to transform health and other public services. To avoid unintentionally reinforcing existing inequities, better understanding is needed of how to facilitate involvement of vulnerable populations in acceptable, ethical and effective codesign. Objective: To explore citizens’ involvement in codesigning public services for vulnerable groups, identify challenges and suggest improvements. Design: A modified case study approach. Pattern matching was used to compare reported challenges with a priori theoretical propositions. Setting and participants: A two-day international symposium involved 28 practitioners, academics and service users from seven countries to reflect on challenges and to codesign improved processes for involving vulnerable populations. Intervention studied: Eight case studies working with vulnerable and disadvantaged populations in three countries. Results: We identified five shared challenges to meaningful, sustained participation of vulnerable populations: engagement; power differentials; health concerns; funding; and other economic/social circumstances. In response, a focus on relationships and flexibility is essential. We encourage codesign projects to enact a set of principles or heuristics rather than following pre-specified steps. We identify a set of principles and tactics, relating to challenges outlined in our case studies, which may help in codesigning public services with vulnerable populations. Discussion and conclusions: Codesign facilitators must consider how meaningful engagement will be achieved and how power differentials will be managed when working with services for vulnerable populations. The need for flexibility and responsiveness to service user needs may challenge expectations about timelines and outcomes. User-centred evaluations of codesigned public services are needed. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia: recommendations for evidence-based practice, an international approach","2019","Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) may result in severe bleeding, particularly fetal and neonatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). As a result, FNAIT requires prompt identification and treatment; subsequent pregnancies need close surveillance and management. An international panel convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management of FNAIT. A rigorous approach was used to search, review and develop recommendations from published data for: antenatal management, postnatal management, diagnostic testing and universal screening. To confirm FNAIT, fetal human platelet antigen (HPA) typing, using non-invasive methods if quality-assured, should be performed during pregnancy when the father is unknown, unavailable for testing or heterozygous for the implicated antigen. Women with a previous child with an ICH related to FNAIT should be offered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions during subsequent affected pregnancies as early as 12?weeks gestation. Ideally, HPA-selected platelets should be available at delivery for potentially affected infants and used to increase the neonatal platelet count as needed. If HPA-selected platelets are not immediately available, unselected platelets should be transfused. FNAIT studies that optimize antenatal and postnatal management, develop risk stratification algorithms to guide management and standardize laboratory testing to identify high risk pregnancies are needed. ? 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","corticosteroid; immunoglobulin; thrombocyte antigen; alloimmunization; Article; brain hemorrhage; disease surveillance; evidence based practice; genotype; gestational age; heterozygosity; human; mass screening; neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia; non invasive procedure; obstetric delivery; perinatal period; platelet count; pregnancy; prenatal period; priority journal; systematic review"

"Effectiveness of the Diagnose-Intervene- Verify-Adjust (DIVA) model for integrated primary healthcare planning and performance improvement: An embedded mixed methods evaluation in Kaduna state, Nigeria","2019","Objectives This study evaluates the real-world effectiveness of Diagnose-Intervene-Verify-Adjust (DIVA), an innovative quality improvement mode, in improving primary healthcare (PHC) bottlenecks impeding health system performance in Kaduna, a northern Nigerian state. Design An embedded mixed method study design involving participant observation. Setting PHCs in 23 local government areas of Kaduna state, Nigeria. Participants 138 PHC managers across the state (PHC directors and programme managers in the 23 local governments). Intervention DIVA is a four-step improvement model in which 'Diagnose' identifies constraints to effective coverage, 'Intervene' develops/implements action plans addressing constraints, while 'Verify/Adjust' monitor performance and revise plans. Primary and secondary outcome measures The model, as adapted in Nigeria, is designed to evaluate and improve the availability of health commodities, human resources, geographical accessibility, acceptability, continuous utilisation and quality of four PHC interventions (immunisation, integrated management of childhood illnesses, antenatal care and skilled birth attendance). Results 183 bottlenecks were identified by local government teams across all interventions in 2013. 41% of bottlenecks concern human resources. Geographical access and availability of commodities ranked least. Availability of commodities was the most improved determinant although among the least constrained, probably indicating skewed implementation of operational plans. 1562 activities were planned to address identified bottlenecks in the state, of which only 568 (36%) were completely implemented Conclusion Our study demonstrates that PHC planning using the DIVA model can potentially improve health system performance. However, effective implementation is critical and may require some central government oversight. ?

"Circulating Peroxiredoxin-1 is a novel damage-associated molecular pattern and aggravates acute liver injury via promoting inflammation","2019","Sterile inflammation is initiated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and a key contributor to acute liver injury (ALI). However, the current knowledge on those DAMPs that activate hepatic inflammation under ALI remains incomplete. We report here that circulating peroxiredoxin-1 (Prdx1) is a novel DAMP for ALI. Intraperitoneal injection of acetaminophen (APAP) elicited a progressive course of ALI in mice, which was developed from 12 to 24 h post injection along with liver inflammation evident by macrophage infiltration and upregulations of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α); these alterations were concurrently occurred with a robust and progressive production of serum Prdx1. Similar observations were also obtained in carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced ALI in mice. Removal of the source of serum Prdx1 protected mice deficient in Prdx1 from APAP and CCl 4 -induced liver injury, and decreased macrophage infiltration, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α production. As a result, Prdx1 ?/? mice were strongly protected from APAP-induced death that was likely progressed from ALI. Additionally, intravenous re-introduction of recombinant Prdx1 (rPrdx1) in Prdx1 ?/? mice reversed or reduced all the above events, demonstrating an important contribution of circulating Prdx1 to ALI. rPrdx1 potently induced in primary macrophages the expression of pro-IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β through the NF-κB signaling as well as the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling, evident by caspase-1 activation. Furthermore, a significant elevation of serum Prdx1 was demonstrated in patients (n = 15) with ALI; the elevation is associated with ALI severity. Collectively, we provide the first demonstration for serum Prdx1 contributing to ALI. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","carbon tetrachloride; cryopyrin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 6; peroxiredoxin 1; recombinant enzyme; tumor necrosis factor; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine production; disease course; disease exacerbation; drug fatality; enzyme activation; enzyme blood level; enzyme synthesis; female; hepatitis; human; human cell; immunoregulation; liver injury; macrophage migration; male; molecular pathology; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneum macrophage; peroxiredoxin 1 blood level; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; upregulation"
"Mortality risk reduction differs according to bisphosphonate class: a 15-year observational study","2019","Summary: In this prospective cohort of 6120 participants aged 50+, nitrogen-bisphosphonates but not non-nitrogen bisphosphonates were associated with a significant 34% mortality risk reduction compared to non-treated propensity score matched controls. These findings open new avenues for research into mechanistic pathways. Introduction: Emerging evidence suggests that bisphosphonates (BP), first-line treatment of osteoporosis, are associated with reduced risks for all-cause mortality. This study aimed to determine the association between different BP types and mortality risk in participants with or without a fracture. Methods: A prospective cohort study of users of different BPs matched to non-users by propensity score (age, gender, co-morbidities, fragility fracture status) and time to starting the BP medication from the population-based Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study from nine Canadian centres followed from 1995 to 2013. Mortality risk for bisphosphonate users vs matched non-users was assessed using pairwise multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results: There were 2048 women and 308 men on BP and 1970 women and 1794 men who did not receive medication for osteoporosis. The relationship between BP and mortality risk was explored in three separate 1:1 propensity score-matched cohorts of BP users and no treatment (etidronate, n = 599, alendronate, n = 498, and risedronate n = 213). Nitrogen BP (n-BP) (alendronate and risedronate) was associated with lower mortality risks [pairwise HR, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48–0.91)] while the less potent non-n-BP, etidronate, was not [pairwise HR: 0.89 (95% CI, 0.66–1.20)]. A direct comparison between n-BP and etidronate (n = 340 pairs) also suggested a better survival for n-BP [paired HR, 0.47 (95%CI, (95% CI, 031–0.70)] for n-BP vs. etidronate]. Conclusion: Compared to no treatment, nitrogen but not non-nitrogen bisphosphonates appear to be associated with better survival. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","alendronic acid; bisphosphonic acid derivative; etidronic acid; risedronic acid; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; Canadian; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; female; fragility fracture; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; mortality risk; observational study; osteoporosis; priority journal; propensity score; prospective study; survival rate; Canada; clinical trial; epidemiology; follow up; fragility fracture; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; risk factor; risk reduction; Aged; Alendronate; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Canada; Diphosphonates; Etidronic Acid; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Prospective Studies; Risedronic Acid; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior"
"Aspirin Use and Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study","2019","Background: Aspirin use probably protects against some malignancies but its effects on lethal prostate cancer (PC) are unclear. Objective: To investigate the association between regular aspirin use and lethal PC. Design, setting, and participants: Participants were aged 40–75 yr at baseline in 1986 and have been followed with biennial questionnaires. The risk analysis includes 49 409 men. The survival analysis includes 5980 PC patients without metastatic disease at diagnosis. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the association between current, past, or never regular aspirin use (?2 d/wk) in relation to lethal (metastatic or fatal) PC. We also examined years of use among current users and years since stopping among past users. In the risk analysis, aspirin was updated throughout follow-up. In the survival analysis, aspirin use after diagnosis was assessed. Results and limitations: Some 29% of participants used aspirin regularly at baseline, which increased to 60% by 2010. In the risk analysis, 804 men were diagnosed with lethal PC. Current regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66–0.96) compared to never users. In the survival analysis, 451 of the men diagnosed with nonmetastatic PC later developed lethal disease. Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64–1.00) and overall mortality (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90). When restricted to highly screened men, the risk analysis associations were stronger and survival analysis associations remained statistically significant. Reverse causation and residual confounding remain concerns, as demonstrated by the attenuated results in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC. Postdiagnostic use was associated with better survival after diagnosis. Patient summary: We found that it may be advisable for prostate cancer patients to take aspirin to improve their survival for both prostate cancer mortality and other mortality outcomes. It is advisable for older adults without a contraindication to take aspirin for many established health benefits. We show that there may be further disease-specific benefits among men with prostate cancer. However, a randomized trial is needed to confirm or refute this association. ? 2018 European Association of Urology","acetylsalicylic acid; adult; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; prostate cancer; questionnaire; risk assessment; survival analysis"
"Prevalence of type ii and type iii workplace violence against physicians: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Workplace violence (WPV) in the health care sector remains a prominent, under-reported global occupational hazard and public health issue. Objective: To determine the types and prevalence of WPV among doctors. Methods: Primary papers on WPV in medicine were identified through a literature search in 4 health databases (Ovid Medline, EMBASE, PsychoINFO and CINAHL). The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for the mapping and identification of records. To assess the studies included in our review, we used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme cohort review checklist and the Risk of Bias Assessment. Results: 13 out of 2154 articles retrieved were reviewed. Factors outlining physician WPV included (1) working in remote health care areas, (2) understaffing, (3) mental/emotional stress of patients/visitors, (4) insufficient security, and (5) lacking preventative measures. The results of 6 studies were combined in a meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of WPV was 69% (95% CI 58% to 78%). Conclusion: The impact of WPV on health care institutions is profound and far-reaching; it is quite common among physicians. Therefore, steps must be taken to promote an organizational culture where there are measures to protect and promote the well-being of doctors. ? 2019, NIOC Health Organization.

"Economic sanctions threaten population health: the case of Iran","2019","Objective: The aim of the study is to review evidence of the negative consequences of international economic sanctions on population health in Iran and pathways via which the sanctions affect health. Study design: This is a narrative review. Methods: Data from the World Bank and the Central Bank of Iran were gathered to clarify economic consequences of sanctions. Moreover, the literature was reviewed for published data on health consequences of economic sanctions in Iran and economic crisis in other parts of the world. Finally, some mechanisms via which economic sanctions could affect health were reviewed. Results: Iran experienced 11.8% reduction in gross domestic production growth in 2012 compared with 2011, besides 40% inflation and 200% depreciation of Iranian currency. Ultimately, it resulted in increased living costs and unemployment. One year after termination of sanctions, Iran's gross domestic production growth increased by 14.1% in 2016. Data revealed that mental health has been affected during sanctions. Moreover, access to essential and lifesaving medication has been compromised, similar to other countries during economic recession. Conclusion: Economic sanctions have had negative consequences on population health in Iran by impairing social determinants of health and access to medication and care. These sanctions widen economic inequality and health gap. ? 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health","central bank; economic impact; global economy; Gross Domestic Product; health care; health impact; inflation; mental health; public health; World Bank; accounting; article; controlled study; economic recession; human; human experiment; Iran; mental health; narrative; population health; social determinants of health; unemployment; economics; health care delivery; Iran; policy; social determinants of health; Iran; Economics; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Iran; Policy; Population Health; Social Determinants of Health"
"The use of an intensive physical exertion test as a final return to play measure in concussed athletes: a prospective cohort","2019","Objectives: To examine the utility of a novel physical exertion test developed by the Chicago Blackhawks medical staff as a final return to play (RTP) clearance test in youth and young adult athletes, and to determine the relationship between participant and test variables on RTP within asymptomatic athletes diagnosed with concussion. Methods: Once asymptomatic and following completion of all RTP steps, concussed athletes underwent the Gapski-Goodman Test (GGT) or modified GGT (mGGT) at partnered Complete Concussion Management Inc. (CCMI) clinics as part of RTP decision-making. Prospective data was collected electronically by trained CCMI clinicians utilizing the CCMI Concussion Database System. A review was conducted to examine data collected between January 2016 and February 2017. Participant and test variables were analyzed to determine relationships with pass/fail rate of the GGT/mGGT. Results: A total of 759 athletes performed the GGT/mGGT in the study period. Although all asymptomatic, 14.6% of concussed athletes failed the GGT/mGGT while attempting to achieve RTP clearance. Statistically significant relationships were found between failure of the test and symptom severity score on initial presentation and self-reported history of pre-morbid anxiety. When taken together, sex, age, and pre-morbid anxiety significantly predicted the length of time between injury and RTP clearance. Conclusion: The GGT may identify individuals who are not ready to RTP despite a self-reported asymptomatic status and completion of all RTP steps. These results illustrate that RTP clearance decisions based on self-reported asymptomatic status at rest may be inadequate. Instead, monitored, intensive, sport-specific, physical exertion testing should be utilized to inform clinical RTP decisions. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescent; adult; anxiety; Article; asymptomatic disease; athlete; chiropractor; clinical decision making; clinical protocol; cohort analysis; cycling; depression; disease severity; exercise test; female; Gapski Goodman Test; health care personnel; heart rate; human; injury scale; life cycle; major clinical study; male; neurobiology; outcome assessment; physiotherapist; plyometrics; prospective study; recreation; rehabilitation care; return to sport; scoring system; sports and sport related phenomena; Symptom Severity Score; treadmill test; young adult; age; brain concussion; exercise; exercise test; procedures; psychology; return to sport; self report; severity of illness index; sex factor; sport injury; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Anxiety; Athletic Injuries; Brain Concussion; Clinical Decision-Making; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Physical Exertion; Prospective Studies; Return to Sport; Self Report; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Young Adult"
"Phase 2 clinical trial of PBI-4050 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","2019","PBI-4050 is a novel orally active small-molecule compound with demonstrated anti-fibrotic activity in several models of fibrosis, including lung fibrosis. We present results from our first clinical study of PBI-4050 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This 12-week open-label study explored the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of daily oral doses of 800 mg PBI-4050 alone and in combination with nintedanib or pirfenidone in patients with predominantly mild or moderate IPF. Nine patients received PBI-4050 alone, 16 patients received PBI-4050 with nintedanib and 16 patients received PBI-4050 with pirfenidone. PBI-4050 alone or in combination with nintedanib or pirfenidone was well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic profiles for PBI-4050 were similar in the PBI-4050 alone and PBI-4050+nintedanib groups but reduced in the PBI-4050+pirfenidone group, suggesting a drug–drug interaction. There were no significant changes in forced vital capacity (FVC), either in % predicted or mL, from baseline to week 12 for PBI-4050 alone or PBI-4050+nintedanib. In contrast, a statistically significant reduction (p<0.024) in FVC % pred was seen for PBI-4050+pirfenidone after 12 weeks. There were no safety concerns with PBI-4050 alone or in combination with nintedanib or pirfenidone in IPF patients. The stability of FVC between baseline and week 12 looked encouraging for PBI-4050 alone and in combination with nintedanib.

"Streamlining the Assessment of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Weight Loss and Body Contouring Patients: Applying Computerized Adaptive Testing to the BODY-Q","2019","Background: The BODY-Q is a widely used patient-reported outcome measure of surgical outcomes in weight loss and body contouring patients. Reducing the length of the BODY-Q assessment could overcome implementation barriers in busy clinics. A shorter BODY-Q could be achieved by using computerized adaptive testing, a method to shorten and tailor assessments while maintaining reliability and accuracy. In this study, the authors apply computerized adaptive testing to the BODY-Q and assess computerized adaptive testing performance in terms of item reduction and accuracy. Methods: Parameters describing the psychometric properties of 138 BODY-Q items (i.e., questions) were derived from the original validation sample (n = 734). The 138 items are arranged into 18 scales reflecting Appearance, Quality of Life, and Experience of Care domains. The authors simulated 1000 administrations of the computerized adaptive testing until a stopping rule, reflecting assessment accuracy of standard error less than 0.55, was met. The authors describe the reduction of assessment length in terms of the mean and range of items administered. The authors assessed accuracy by determining correlation between full test and computerized adaptive testing scores. Results: The authors ran 54 simulations. Mean item reduction was 36.9 percent (51 items; range, 48 to 138 items). Highest item reduction was achieved for the Experience of Care domain (56.2 percent, 22.5 items). Correlation between full test scores and the BODY-Q computerized adaptive test scores averaged 0.99. Conclusions: Substantial item reduction is possible by using BODY-Q computerized adaptive testing. Reduced assessment length using BODY-Q computerized adaptive testing could reduce patient burden while preserving the accuracy of clinical patient-reported outcomes for patients undergoing weight loss and body contouring operations. ? 2019 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.","adult; article; body contouring; body weight loss; computerized adaptive testing; female; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; personal experience; quality of life; simulation; surgery; aged; bariatric surgery; computer simulation; evaluation study; middle aged; obesity; patient satisfaction; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; software; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Aged; Bariatric Surgery; Body Contouring; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Effects of historic radiation dose on the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethals in Drosophila populations following the Chernobyl nuclear accident","2019","Contrary to the effects of high doses of radiation, the effects of low doses of radiation are still being investigated. Low doses and their non-targeted effects in particular are of special interest for researchers. The accident that occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) gives researchers the opportunity to view these effects outside of a laboratory environment. For this paper, the relationship between low historic radiation doses and the persistent genetic damage observed in populations of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) around the Chernobyl NPP over 3 years will be investigated. Data from Zainullin et al. (1992) on the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethals (SLRLs) in D. melanogaster around the Chernobyl NPP. To calculate the absorbed historic external dose, a method based on the Gaussian plume model was used to find the external dose from both plume shine and ground shine. The dose attributed to the ground shine dose made a greater contribution to the overall absorbed external historic radiation dose than the plume shine dose. For earlier generations of Drosophila living in the radioactive contaminated sites, the SLRL frequencies appeared to correlate with the dose in a linear no-threshold relationship. The later descendent generations appeared to have developed a radio-adaptive-like response. This work contributes to the understanding of historic dose effects on wildlife health following the accidental release of high mount of radioactive materials into the environment. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adaptation; Chernobyl accident; dose-response relationship; fly; historical record; radiation exposure; article; Chernobyl accident; dose response; Drosophila melanogaster; genetic damage; human; nonhuman; plume; progeny; radiation dose; radiation exposure; wildlife; animal; genetics; radiation dose; radiation response; Ukraine; Drosophila melanogaster; Animals; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Drosophila melanogaster; Radiation Dosage; Ukraine"
"Relationships and Mechanisms Between Occupational Risk Factors and Distal Upper Extremity Disorders","2019","Objective: The relationships between workplace risk factors and upper extremity injuries from epidemiological and laboratory studies were examined. Background: Epidemiological studies are associated with several limitations, affecting the strength of association between risk factors and the development of injuries. Method: In this narrative review, we identified epidemiological and laboratory studies (published primarily since 1997) investigating exposure to workplace risk factors (force, repetition, posture, vibration) and risk of hand/wrist tendon–related disorders, epicondylitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Results: Forceful exertions are strongly associated with hand/wrist tendon–related disorders, epicondylitis, and CTS. Dose–response relationships were found for epicondylitis (repetition) and CTS (posture). Interactions demonstrate multiplicative effects of risk factors for injury risk. Laboratory studies display clear associations between task demands and biomechanical measures linked to mechanisms for upper extremity injuries with animal models providing further evidence of a dose–response between risk factors and injury. Conclusion: Forceful, repetitive work requiring non-neutral postures are associated with increasing risk of hand/wrist tendon–related disorders, epicondylitis, and CTS as evidenced by epidemiology studies and laboratory-based investigations of humans and animals. Application: Understanding the relationship between exposure levels of workplace risk factors and upper extremity disorders can improve injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies. ? 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Animals; Biomechanics; Epidemiology; Health risks; Laboratories; Musculoskeletal system; Risk assessment; Tendons; Carpal tunnel syndrome; Epidemiological studies; injury; Injury prevention; Laboratory studies; Multiplicative effects; Rehabilitation strategy; Upper extremity; Occupational risks"
"Outcomes associated with non-recommended dosing of rivaroxaban: Results from the XANTUS study","2019","Aims In Europe, the approved rivaroxaban dose for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is 20 mg once daily (o.d.), with 15 mg o.d. recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 15-49 mL/min. Non-recommended doses are prescribed in real-world practice. This analysis of the XANTUS study assessed outcomes associated with non-recommended dosing and patient characteristics that may have impacted dose choice. Methods and results Baseline characteristics and 1 year outcomes were compared in 4464/6784 patients with known CrCl, receiving recommended or non-recommended rivaroxaban doses; 3608 (80.8%) patients received recommended doses (mean CHADS 2 score 1.9) and 856 (19.2%) non-recommended doses (mean CHADS 2 score 2.5). Incidence rate (events/100 patient-years) for the composite of treatment-emergent adjudicated major bleeding, stroke/systemic embolism, and death was 7.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-9.8] and 4.8 (95% CI 4.1-5.7) with non-recommended and recommended doses, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 1.55, 95% CI 1.2-2.1; P = 0.004]. Incidence rates for the components of the composite were 3.7 and 2.6, 1.4 and 0.9, and 3.5 and 1.9, respectively. Adjustment for baseline characteristics showed similar rates of the composite outcome (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77-1.45; P = 0.719). Multivariable analysis identified age, anaemia, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, CrCl, lower body weight, AF type, and vascular disease as predictors of non-recommended dosing. Conclusion Non-recommended rivaroxaban dosing was associated with less favourable outcomes, possibly due to baseline characteristics, in addition to renal function, that may also affect physicians' dosing decisions.

"Optimization of home care nurses in Canada: A scoping review","2019","Nurses are among the largest providers of home care services thus optimisation of this workforce can positively influence client outcomes. This scoping review maps existing Canadian literature on factors influencing the optimisation of home care nurses (HCNs). Arskey and O'Malley's five stages for scoping literature reviews were followed. Populations of interest included Registered Nurses, Registered/Licensed Practical Nurses, Registered Nursing Assistants, Advanced Practice Nurses, Nurse Practitioners and Clinical Nurse Specialists. Interventions included any nurse(s), organisational and system interventions focused on optimising home care nursing. Papers were included if published between January 1, 2002 up to May 15, 2015. The review included 127 papers, including 94 studies, 16 descriptive papers, 6 position papers, 4 discussion papers, 3 policy papers, 2 literature reviews and 2 other. Optimisation factors were categorised under seven domains: Continuity of Care/Care; Staffing Mix and Staffing Levels; Professional Development; Quality Practice Environments; Intra-professional and Inter-professional and Inter-sectoral Collaboration; Enhancing Scope of Practice: and, Appropriate Use of Technology. Fragmentation and underfunding of the home care sector and resultant service cuts negatively impact optimisation. Given the fiscal climate, optimising the existing workforce is essential to support effective and efficient care delivery models. Many factors are inter-related and have synergistic impacts (e.g., recruitment and retention, compensation and benefits, professional development supports, staffing mix and levels, workload management and the use of technology). Quality practice environments facilitate optimal practice by maximixing human resources and supporting workforce stability. Role clarity and leadership supports foster more effective interprofessional team functioning that leverages expertise and enhances patient outcomes. Results inform employers, policy makers and relevant associations regarding barriers and enablers that influence the optimisation of home care nursing in nursing, intra- and inter-professional and inter-organisational contexts. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Challenge and Impact of Quinidine Access in Sudden Death Syndromes: A National Experience","2019","Objectives: This study sought to determine the nature of quinidine use and accessibility in a national network of inherited arrhythmia clinics. Background: Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic medication that has been shown to be beneficial in select patients with Brugada syndrome, early repolarization syndrome, and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Because of the low prevalence of these conditions and restricted access to quinidine through a single regulatory process, quinidine use is rare in Canada. Methods: Subjects prescribed quinidine were identified through the Hearts in Rhythm Organization that connects the network of inherited arrhythmia clinics across Canada. Cases were retrospectively reviewed for patient characteristics, indications for quinidine use, rate of recurrent ventricular arrhythmia, and issues with quinidine accessibility. Results: In a population of 36 million, 46 patients are currently prescribed quinidine (0.0000013%, age 48.1 ± 16.1 years, 25 are male). Brugada syndrome, early repolarization syndrome, and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation constituted a diagnosis in 13 subjects (28%), 6 (13%), and 21 (46%), respectively. Overall, 37 subjects (81%) had cardiac arrest as an index event. After initial presentation, subjects experienced 7.47 ± 12.3 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks prior to quinidine use over 34.3 ± 45.9 months, versus 0.86 ± 1.69 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks in 43.8 ± 41.8 months while on quinidine (risk ratio: 8.7, p < 0.001). Twenty-two patients access quinidine through routes external to Health Canada's Special Access Program. Conclusions: Quinidine use is rare in Canada, but it is associated with a reduction in recurrent ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Brugada syndrome, early repolarization syndrome, and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, with minimal toxicity necessitating discontinuation. Drug interruption is associated with frequent breakthrough events. Access to quinidine is important to deliver this potentially lifesaving therapy. ? 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","amiodarone; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; quinidine; sotalol; adult; adverse event; aged; Article; Brugada syndrome; cardiac patient; cause of death; child; drug dose reduction; drug use; drug withdrawal; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; ethnicity; female; follow up; health care access; heart arrest; heart proarrhythmia; heart repolarization; heart ventricle arrhythmia; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; idiopathic disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prevalence; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; shock; sudden cardiac death; survival; torsade des pointes; very elderly"
"Neoadjuvant therapy and major arterial resection for potentially reconstructable arterial involvement by stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the pancreas","2019","Background: Stage 3 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is defined by arterial involvement. This study objective was to evaluate outcomes for patients with stage 3 PDAC with potentially reconstructable arterial involvement, considered for neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and pancreatic resection, and to compare outcomes following arterial (AR) and non-arterial resection (NAR). Methods: This study included patients from 2009 to 2016 with biopsy-proven stage 3 PDAC who were offered NAT before surgical exploration. AR was performed if required to achieve R0 resection. Time to event outcomes were analysed from diagnosis date. Results: 87/89 patients (97.8%) received NAT (chemotherapy 41.6%, chemotherapy/radiotherapy 56.2%). 46/89 (51.7%) underwent exploration; 31 underwent resection (AR n = 20, NAR n = 11). AR patients had longer operative time (681 vs. 563 min, p = 0.006) and more blood loss (1600 vs. 575 mL, p = 0.0004), with no difference for blood transfusion, pancreatic fistula, length of stay, reoperation, or mortality. R0 rate was 30/31. Post-resection 90-day mortality was 3.2%. Median overall survival was statistically comparable between the AR and NAR groups (19.7 vs. 28.4 months, p = 0.41). Conclusions: AR had comparable clinical and oncologic outcomes to NAR. Following careful selection and non-progression after NAT, major AR may cautiously be considered if required to obtain a negative resection margin. ? 2018","capecitabine; cisplatin; fluorouracil; gemcitabine; irinotecan; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; adult; aged; artery surgery; Article; blood transfusion; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreas fistula; reoperation; retrospective study"
"Precarious versus Entrepreneurial Origins of the Recently Self-Employed: Work and Family Determinants of Canadians’ Self-Employment Transitions","2019","We investigate the wage work and family determinants of self-employment entry using a panel study of Canadian workers (Canadian Work Stress and Health Study). Rather than treating the self-employed as a homogenous group—a characterization that conflates entrepreneurial ventures with lower quality and more precarious self-employment—we disaggregate self-employment entrants by occupational class. Descriptive analyses show that the nonprofessional self-employed—the most common form of self-employment observed in the study—are considerably more likely to report low income (<$25,000) and insufficient work hours compared to wage workers and the professional self-employed. Event history analyses based on a multinomial logistic model also reveal that poor wage-work quality—including low income, job insecurity, and unchallenging work—increases the likelihood of a transition from wage work into nonprofessional self-employment. In contrast, job autonomy and human capital predict an increased likelihood of a transition into professional self-employment. Our results suggest that both classic entrepreneurial and forced motivations explain self-employment entry when the self-employed's occupational class is distinguished; however, findings are mixed regarding the salience of work-family factors in predicting self-employment entry. We discuss the value of using a “good jobs, bad jobs” perspective to disaggregate the pathways from wage work into lower versus higher quality self-employment. ? 2019 Eastern Sociological Society",""
"High-mobility group box 1 links sensing of reactive oxygen species by huntingtin to its nuclear entry","2019","Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative, age-onset disorder caused by a CAG DNA expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene, resulting in a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein. Nuclear accumulation of mutant huntingtin is a hallmark of HD, resulting in elevated mutant huntingtin levels in cell nuclei. Huntingtin is normally retained at the endoplasmic reticulum via its N17 amphipathic -helix domain but is released by oxidation of Met-8 during reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Huntingtin enters the nucleus via an importin 1–and 2– dependent proline–tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS), which has a unique intervening sequence in huntingtin. Here, we have identified the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein as an interactor of the intervening sequence within the PY-NLS. Nuclear levels of HMGB1 positively correlated with varying levels of nuclear huntingtin in both HD and normal human fibroblasts. We also found that HMGB1 interacts with the huntingtin N17 region and that this interaction is enhanced by the presence of ROS and phosphorylation of critical serine residues in the N17 region. We conclude that HMGB1 is a huntingtin N17/PY-NLS ROS-dependent interactor, and this protein bridging is essential for relaying ROS sensing by huntingtin to its nuclear entry during ROS stress. ROS may therefore be a critical age-onset stress that triggers nuclear accumulation of mutant huntington in Huntington’s disease. ? 2019 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","Amino acids; Cell culture; Cell membranes; Expansion; Oxygen; Proteins; Endoplasmic reticulum; High-mobility group box 1 proteins; High-mobility groups; Neurodegenerative; Normal human fibroblast; Nuclear accumulation; Nuclear localization signal; Reactive oxygen species; Neurodegenerative diseases; high mobility group B1 protein; huntingtin; proline; reactive oxygen metabolite; tyrosine; high mobility group B1 protein; huntingtin; nuclear protein; protein binding; reactive oxygen metabolite; Article; correlational study; fibroblast; human; human cell; nuclear localization signal; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; binding site; cell culture; drug effect; metabolism; nucleocytoplasmic transport; phosphorylation; physiology; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Binding Sites; Cells, Cultured; Fibroblasts; HMGB1 Protein; Humans; Huntingtin Protein; Nuclear Localization Signals; Nuclear Proteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Reactive Oxygen Species"
"The impact of step reduction on muscle health in aging: Protein and exercise as countermeasures","2019","Declines in strength and muscle function with age—sarcopenia—contribute to a variety of negative outcomes including an increased risk of: falls, fractures, hospitalization, and reduced mobility in older persons. Population-based estimates of the loss of muscle after age 60 show a loss of ~1% per year while strength loss is more rapid at ~3% per year. These rates are not, however, linear as periodic bouts of reduced physical activity and muscle disuse transiently accelerate loss of muscle and declines in muscle strength and power. Episodic complete muscle disuse can be due to sickness-related bed rest or local muscle disuse as a result of limb immobilization/surgery. Alternatively, relative muscle disuse occurs during inactivity due to illness and the associated convalescence resulting in marked reductions in daily steps, often referred to as step reduction (SR). While it is a “milder” form of disuse, it can have a similar adverse impact on skeletal muscle health. The physiological consequences of even short-term inactivity, modeled by SR, show losses in muscle mass and strength, as well as impaired insulin sensitivity and an increase in systemic inflammation. Though seemingly benign in comparison to bed rest, periodic inactivity likely occurs, we posit, more frequently with advancing age due to illness, declining mental health and declining mobility. Given that recovery from inactivity in older adults is slow or possibly incomplete we hypothesize that accumulated periods of inactivity contribute to sarcopenia. Periodic activity, even in small quantities, and protein supplementation may serve as effective strategies to offset the loss of muscle mass with aging, specifically during periods of inactivity. The aim of this review is to examine the recent literature encompassing SR, as a model of inactivity, and to explore the capacity of nutrition and exercise interventions to mitigate adverse physiological changes as a result of SR. ? 2019 Oikawa, Holloway and Phillips.",""
"Atrial fibrillation in elderly patients with implantable loop recorders for unexplained syncope","2019","Background: An implantable loop recorder (ILR) assists in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope and atrial fibrillation (AF). Both become prevalent with age. Limited data exist describing the incidence of AF as the diagnostic rhythm underlying syncope in the elderly. This study aims to report the incidence of AF in older adults with ILRs for unexplained syncope and identify clinical characteristics associated with AF in this population. Methods: Retrospective observational study on patients with unexplained syncope seen in syncope clinics from two Canadian centers. Participants were ?65?years old, without a history of AF, and received an ILR for unexplained syncope. Data were collected from patient’s clinic charts. Arrhythmia diagnosis was based on ILR electrocardiogram reading during syncope (symptom–rhythm correlation). Fisher’s exact test and the Student’s t test were used to compare participants with and without AF. Results: In our cohort of 222 patients, 124 were females and 98 were males. Mean age at implant was 80?±?8?years. Arrhythmia was diagnosed in 98 patients (44.1%). Median time to diagnosis was 18?months. AF was diagnosed in 17 (7.7%) participants. There were fewer males in the AF group than the no AF group (11.8%, 46.8%, p?=?0.01). Age, baseline EKG, and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, or ischemic heart disease were not statistically different between patients with AF and without AF. Conclusions: Atrial fibrillation was a common diagnostic rhythm in this cohort of adults, aged 65 and older, with ILRs for unexplained syncope. It was observed more frequently in females. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","age; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; Canadian; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; cohort analysis; correlational study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; electrocardiogram; faintness; female; heart arrhythmia; heart rhythm; human; hypertension; incidence; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; observational study; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; very elderly"
"Pre-surgical neoadjuvant oncolytic virotherapy confers protection against rechallenge in a murine model of breast cancer","2019","The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus and association with mortality in childhood solid organ transplant recipients: A population-based study","2019","Background. Precise estimates of the long-term risk of new-onset diabetes and its impact on mortality among transplanted children are not known. Methods. We conducted a cohort study comparing children undergoing solid organ (kidney, heart, liver, lung and multiple organ) transplant (n = 1020) between 1991 and 2014 with healthy non-transplanted children (n = 7 134 067) using Ontario health administrative data. Outcomes included incidence of diabetes among transplanted and non-transplanted children, the relative hazard of diabetes among solid organ transplant recipients, overall and at specific intervals posttransplant, and mortality among diabetic transplant recipients. Results. During 56 019 824 person-years of follow-up, the incidence rate of diabetes was 17.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 15-21] and 2.5 (95% CI 2.5-2.5) per 1000 person-years among transplanted and non-transplanted children, respectively. The transplant cohort had a 9-fold [hazard ratio (HR) 8.9; 95% CI 7.5-10.5] higher hazard of diabetes compared with those not transplanted. Risk was highest within the first year after transplant (HR 20.7; 95% CI 15.9-27.1), and remained elevated even at 5 and 10 years of follow-up. Lung and multiple organ recipients had a 5-fold (HR 5.4; 95% CI 3.0-9.8) higher hazard of developing diabetes compared with kidney transplant recipients. Transplant recipients with diabetes had a three times higher hazard of death compared with those who did not develop diabetes (HR 3.3; 95% CI 2.3-4.8). Conclusions. The elevated risk of diabetes in transplant recipients persists even after a decade, highlighting the importance of ongoing surveillance. Diabetes after transplantation increases the risk of mortality among childhood transplant recipients. ? 2018 The Author(s).","Article; child; childhood mortality; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; graft recipient; heart transplantation; human; kidney transplantation; liver transplantation; lung transplantation; major clinical study; male; mortality risk; organ transplantation; population research; priority journal; adolescent; adverse event; diabetes mellitus; graft recipient; incidence; infant; mortality; newborn; onset age; Ontario; organ transplantation; preschool child; risk factor; Adolescent; Age of Onset; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Ontario; Organ Transplantation; Risk Factors; Transplant Recipients"
"Associations Among Child Maltreatment, Mental Health, and Police Contact in Adulthood: Findings From a National Canadian Sample","2019","The purpose of this study was to examine associations between three subtypes of childhood maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, and exposure to intimate partner violence) and two forms of adult police contact (criminality, victimization) using nationally representative Canadian data. Presence of a mental health disorder was also explored as a potential mediating variable in these associations. The weighted sample included 23,846 adult participants from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–Mental Health. Logistic and multinomial regression analyses examined associations among individual and multiple exposures to subtypes of childhood maltreatment with police contact. The Sobel test was used to assess the mediating effect of mental health disorders. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables, results indicated that all maltreatment subtypes were significantly associated with increased odds of both forms of police contact (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 2.06 to 2.95). Presence of a mental health disorder was a partial mediator in the associations between child maltreatment and both forms of adult police contact (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.52 to 2.32). In addition, a dose–response relationship was observed for victimization; as the number of subtypes of maltreatment increased, there was an incremental increase in risk of victimization. Future efforts are needed to prioritize child maltreatment prevention, trauma-informed approaches, mental health awareness, and training in law enforcement. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"Trends in Reporting of Swallowing Outcomes in Oropharyngeal Cancer Studies: A Systematic Review","2020","Over the last two decades, dysphagia is increasingly recognized as a significant short-term and long-term issue in oropharyngeal cancer patients. However, there remains a lack of standardization and agreement about reporting swallowing outcomes in studies that assess treatment outcomes in this population. A systematic review was performed following PRISMA Guidelines by searching Pubmed (MEDLINE) and Scopus. The inclusion criteria used included (1) prospective and retrospective clinical studies involving adult patients with oropharyngeal cancer, (2) reports swallowing outcomes, (3) English studies or studies with English translation, (4) full text retrievable and (5) publication between 1990 and 2016. 410 unique studies were identified, and 106 were analyzed. A majority (> 80%) of studies that reported swallowing outcomes were published after 2010. While 75.4% of studies reported subjective outcomes (e.g., patient-reported or clinician-reported outcome measures), only 30.2% of studies presented results of objective instrumental assessment of swallowing. The majority (61%) of studies reported short-term swallowing outcomes at 1?year or less, and only 10% of studies examined 5-year swallowing comes. One study examined late-dysphagia (> 10?years) in the oropharyngeal cancer population. Considerable heterogeneity remains in the reporting of swallowing outcomes after treatment of oropharyngeal cancer despite its importance for quality of life. Studies reporting long-term swallowing outcomes are lacking in the literature, and objective measures of swallowing function remain underutilized and nonstandardized. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical outcome; clinician; disease association; dysphagia; evidence based medicine; human; oropharynx cancer; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; surgical oncologist; systematic review; treatment response; trend study"
"Updated systematic review of exercise studies in breast cancer survivors: Attention to the principles of exercise training","2019","Objectives To update our previous evaluation of the exercise interventions used in randomised controlled trials of breast cancer survivors in relation to (1) the application of the principles of exercise training in the exercise prescription; (2) the reporting of the components of the exercise prescription; and (3) the reporting of adherence of participants to the prescribed interventions. Design Systematic review. Data sources The OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus electronic databases were searched from January 2010 to January 2017. Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least 4 weeks of aerobic and/or resistance exercise in women diagnosed with breast cancer, reporting on physical fitness or body composition outcomes. Results Specificity was appropriately applied by 84%, progression by 29%, overload by 38% and initial values by 67% of newly identified studies. Reversibility was reported by 3% anddiminishing returns by 22% of newly identified studies. No studies reported all components of the exercise prescription in the methods, or adherence to the prescribed intervention in the results. Reporting of reversibility has increased from 2010, but no other improvements in reporting were noted from the previous review. Summary/Conclusion No studies of exercise in women with breast cancer attended to all principles of exercise training, or reported all components of the exercise prescription in the methods, or adherence to the prescription in the results. Full reporting of the exercise prescribed and completed is essential for study replication in research and translating research findings into the community, and should be prioritised in future trials. ?

"Fear and Distrust Within the Canadian Welfare System: Experiences of People With Mental Illness","2019","While experiences of fear and distrust have been documented as a part of recipients’ interactions with disability benefits, there have been few attempts to explore how they are shaped by system features and their impact on employment pursuits. The purpose of this article is to unpack how fear and distrust emerge among people with mental illness who have recently entered the welfare system. Using an interpretative qualitative approach, the authors draw on the findings from 69 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders about their experiences with employment. Stakeholders included recipients, welfare program and policy staff, and service providers in the community. Data were analyzed by exploring similarities and differences across perspectives and contexts. The findings highlight how system features shape and perpetuate fear and distrust through poorly communicating information about the system, a chaotic state of constant change and complexity, a lack of attention to building trusting relationships between caseworkers and recipients, ongoing system errors, and excessive reporting requirements. The impact of the current state of affairs is significantly harmful to recipients, especially those living with mental illness. Our findings also highlight a possible way forward by building trusting relationships and finding ways to improve communication channels. ? Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2018.",""
"Increased pitch velocity and workload are common risk factors for ulnar collateral ligament injury in baseball players: A systematic review","2019","Importance: Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries commonly occur in baseball players. Strategies for injury prevention have long been accepted without clinical data informing which risk factors lead to serious injury. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the impact of various pitching-related risk factors for UCL injury in baseball players from all levels of play. Evidence review: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched until 4 March 2018, and pertinent data were abstracted by two independent reviewers. Search terms included 'ulnar collateral ligament', 'medial ulnar collateral ligament', 'Tommy John', 'risk' and 'association'. Inclusion criteria were English-language studies, level of evidence I-IV and studies reporting risk factors for UCL injury of the elbow in baseball players. Study quality was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomised studies (MINORS) criteria. The results are presented in a narrative summary. Findings: Pitching practices (workload and pitch characteristics) were reported in 9/15 studies. Specifically, three of four studies (n=1810) reported increased pitch workload as a risk factor for native UCL injury (p<0.001 to 0.02). The most common pitch characteristic reported was pitch velocity with four of five studies showing increased velocity being significantly associated with native UCL injury (p<0.01 to 0.02). Biomechanical risk factors reported were increased humeral retrotorsion (two studies; n=324), poor lower extremity and trunk balance (one study; n=42) and loss of total arc of shoulder motion (two studies; n=118), all significantly associated with UCL injury (p<0.0001 to 0.05). One of three studies assessing pitch workload as a risk factor for re-rupture of UCL reconstruction found a significant association (p<0.01). Conclusions and relevance: Pitching practices, reflected by increased pitch workload and velocity, were most commonly associated with UCL injury; however, the definition of workload (number of pitches per game, inning or season) was inconsistently reported. Biomechanical risk factors were less commonly reported and lack sufficient evidence to recommend preventative strategies. More quality data is needed to refine the current recommendations for injury prevention in baseball players. ? 2019 International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine.","baseball; biomechanics; body equilibrium; body movement; disease association; elbow injury; human; humerus; ligament injury; lower limb; priority journal; Review; risk factor; shoulder; sport injury; systematic review; torsion; trunk; ulnar collateral ligament (elbow); velocity; workload"
"Incident Fragility Fractures Have a Long-Term Negative Impact on Health-Related Quality of Life of Older People: The Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study","2019","Although the short-term impact of incident fragility fractures on health-related quality of life (HRQL) of older people has been confirmed, we lack long-term evidence. We explored the impact of incident fragility fractures on HRQL, among people aged 50 years and older, using 10-year prospective data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos). This study was based on data from 7753 (2187 men and 5566 women) participants of CaMos. The HRQL, measured through the Health Utility Index (HUI), was captured at baseline and year 10. The incident fragility fractures were recorded over 10 years of follow-up at spine, hip, rib, shoulder, pelvis, or forearm. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted to measure the mean difference, termed as deficit, in the HUI scores for participants with and without fractures. We examined the effects of single or multiple fragility fractures, time (fractures that occurred between year 1 to 5 and 6 to 10) and recovery to the prefracture level. Incident spine and hip fractures were associated with significant deficits (varied from –0.19 to –0.07) on the HUI scores. Hip and spine fractures were associated with negative impact on mobility, self-care, and ambulation. Fractures that occurred closer to the follow-up assessment were associated with significant impact on HRQL compared to fractures occurring a long time before it, except for hip fracture (deficits lasted 5 years or longer). Similarly, multiple hip (–0.14), spine (–0.16), and rib (–0.21) fractures significantly impacted the HRQL of women. Women with a hip fracture never recovered to their prefracture level score (OR = 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.98). Our analysis suggests that single and multiple hip fractures as well as multiple spine and rib fractures strongly impact the HRQL of older people over a prolonged period of time. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research","adult; aged; Article; Canada; Canadian; controlled study; female; forearm; forearm fracture; fragility fracture; health utility index; hip fracture; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mobilization; multiple fracture; osteoporosis; pelvis fracture; physical mobility; quality of life; rib fracture; self care; sex difference; shoulder fracture; spine fracture; time factor"
"Validation of the BAP-65 score for prediction of in-hospital death or use of mechanical ventilation in patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute exacerbation of COPD: a retrospective multi-center study from the Italian Society of Emergency Medicine (SIMEU)","2019","Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPDE) frequently require hospitalizations, may necessitate of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and are associated with a remarkable in-hospital mortality. The BAP-65 score is a risk assessment model (RAM) based on simple variables, that has been proposed for the prediction of these adverse outcomes in patients with COPDE. If showed to be accurate, the BAP-65 RAM might be used to guide the patients management, in terms of destination and treatment. We conducted a retrospective, multicentre, chart-review study, on patients attending the ED for a COPDE during 2014. The aim of the study was the validation of the BAP-65 RAM for the prediction of in-hospital death or use of IMV (composite primary outcome). We assessed the discrimination and the prognostic performance of the BAP-65 RAM. We enrolled 2908 patients from 20 centres across Italy. The mean (standard deviation) age was 76 (11) years, and 38% of patients were female. The composite outcome occurred in 5.3% of patients. The AUROC of BAP-65 for the composite outcome was 0.64 (95%CI 0.59–0.68). The sensitivity of BAP-65 score ? 4 to predict in-hospital mortality was 44% (95% CI 34%–55%), the specificity was 84% (95% CI 82%–85%), the positive predictive value was 9% (95% CI 6%–12%), and the negative predictive value was 98% (95% CI 97%–98%). Conclusions: In patients attending Italian EDs with a COPDE, we found that the BAP-65 score did not have sufficient accuracy to stratify patients upon their risk of severe in-hospital outcomes. ? 2018 European Federation of Internal Medicine","aged; Article; artificial ventilation; bap 65 score; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; emergency ward; female; hospital mortality; human; Italy; major clinical study; male; medical society; predictive value; prognostic assessment; retrospective study; risk assessment; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; artificial ventilation; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial; epidemiology; hospital emergency service; hospital mortality; mortality; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; organization and management; pathophysiology; procedures; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Italy; Logistic Models; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiration, Artificial; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve"
"Validation of a behavioral economic purchase task for assessing drug abuse liability","2019","Behavioral economic purchase tasks quantify drug demand (i.e. reinforcing value of a drug) and have been used extensively to assess the value of various drugs among current users. However, purchase tasks have been rarely used with unfamiliar drugs to address a compound's abuse liability, and the current study sought to validate the paradigm in this capacity. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects drug challenge design, the study evaluated differential drug demand on an experimental drug purchase task for a 20?mg dose of oral D-amphetamine (versus placebo), a prototypic psychostimulant, in 98 stimulant-na?ve participants. Compared with placebo, amphetamine significantly increased intensity, breakpoint and O max , and significantly decreased elasticity. Mechanistic analyses revealed that O max and breakpoint mediated the relationship between subjective drug effects and ‘willingness to take again’, a putative indicator of liability via motivation for future drug-seeking behavior. These findings validate the purchase task paradigm for quantifying the reinforcing value and, in turn, abuse liability of unfamiliar compounds, providing a foundation for a variety of future applications. ? 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction","dexamphetamine; placebo; adult; Article; blood pressure; body mass; controlled study; correlation analysis; dopamine release; double blind procedure; drug abuse; drug seeking behavior; DSM-IV; electrocardiography; female; human; human experiment; male; mental stress; motivation; normal human; physical examination; priority journal; psychometry; questionnaire; reinforcement; synaptic transmission; validation study; young adult"
"The cost effectiveness of minimally invasive spine surgery in the treatment of adult degenerative scoliosis: a comparison of transpsoas and open techniques","2019","INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment improves quality of life in patients with adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). However, open ADS surgeries are complex, large magnitude operations associated with a high rate of complications. The lateral transpsoas interbody fusion technique is a less invasive alternative to open ADS surgery, but less invasive techniques tend to be more expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the transpsoas technique for patients with ADS over a 12-month time horizon from a public payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on a consecutive case series of patients who underwent ADS surgeries between 2006 and 2012. Effectiveness was expressed as the difference in patient reported preoperative and 12-month postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which was measured in quality-adjusted life years. Health-care resource use was tabulated based on a clinical chart review on an item-by-item basis. Unit cost data were obtained from published provincial costs in Alberta, Canada. All costs were adjusted to 2015 Canadian dollars. The base case analysis included costs for the surgery, initial hospitalization, and treatment for complications over a 12-month follow-up period. The uncomplicated case analysis included costs for the surgery and initial hospitalization only. The joint uncertainty surrounding the cost and HRQOL differences was estimated using bootstrapping with 10,000 replicates. RESULTS: A total of 10 open technique and 12 transpsoas technique T11–pelvis fusions were included in the analysis. In the base case analysis, the transpsoas technique was less costly compared with the open technique, total cost of $83,513 (95% CI: $72,772–$94,253) versus $111,381 (95% CI: $36,340–$186,423), respectively (incremental cost $27,869), and was associated with 0.06 more quality-adjusted life years and/or patient. However, in the uncomplicated case, the open technique was less costly compared with the transpsoas technique ($47,795 [95% CI: $39,003–$56,586] vs $76,510 [95% CI: $72,273–$80,746]), respectively, with an incremental cost of $28,715. Based on the probabilistic analysis of 10,000 bootstrap iterations for the base case analysis, the transpsoas technique was more effective and less costly compared with the open technique 57% of time. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis by adjusting bone-morphogenetic protein-2 dosage further improved cost effectiveness of the transpsoas technique by lowering overall costs. CONCLUSIONS: Transpsoas surgeries were associated with better outcomes in terms of HRQOL and lower costs over 1-year follow-up period compared with more invasive open technique. This study should be viewed as a pilot evaluation and should be replicated in a larger prospective multicenter controlled study. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","bone morphogenetic protein 2; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; Canada; case study; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; Clostridium difficile infection; comparative effectiveness; conservative treatment; cost effectiveness analysis; deep vein thrombosis; female; health care cost; health care system; health care utilization; heart block; heart failure; heart infarction; heart ventricle tachycardia; hospitalization; human; liver failure; male; malnutrition; minimally invasive surgery; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; open surgery; operation duration; postoperative care; postoperative delirium; preoperative period; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; reoperation; retrospective study; scoliosis; spine surgery; surgical technique; thorax pain; transient ischemic attack; transpsoas surgical technique; urinary tract infection; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; economics; middle aged; minimally invasive surgery; procedures; scoliosis; spine fusion; Adult; Canada; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Scoliosis; Spinal Fusion"
"Interobserver Agreement for Mismatch Repair Protein Immunohistochemistry in Endometrial and Nonserous, Nonmucinous Ovarian Carcinomas","2019","Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins is an established test to identify Lynch syndrome (LS) in patients with colorectal cancer and is being increasingly used to identify LS in women with endometrial and/or nonserous ovarian cancer (OC). We assessed interobserver agreement in the interpretation of MMR-IHC on endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. The study consisted of 73 consecutive endometrial cancers (n=48) and nonserous, nonmucinous epithelial OCs (n=25). Six pathologists from 2 cancer centers, one with and the other without, previous experience in interpreting MMR-IHC, evaluated MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 stains. Before the study, an experienced pathologist led a review of 9 teaching cases. A decision tool was developed as a guide in MMR-IHC interpretation. Staining was interpreted as intact, deficient, or equivocal for each protein. Interobserver agreement for the patient MMR status was categorized as ""almost perfect"" with κ=0.919 (95% CI, 0.863-0.976). All observers were in agreement in 66 (92%) tumors. Four of the less experienced pathologists had at least 1 discrepant interpretation. There were 6 discordant cases: 3 MMR-deficient cases and 2 MMR-intact cases by majority opinion were called equivocal by at least 1 observer, and 1 MMR-deficient case by majority opinion was interpreted as MMR intact by 1 pathologist. Only the latter case (1/73 patients, 1.4%) had an unequivocal disagreement that could affect patient management. Issues associated with discordant interpretation included heterogeneous staining, intratumoral lymphocytes, regional reduced internal control tissue staining, and scattered absent/weak staining adjacent to tumor cells with strong nuclear staining. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Cost-effectiveness analysis of standalone trabecular micro-bypass stents in patients with mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma in Canada","2019","Objectives: To estimate the cost-utility of two trabecular micro-bypass stents (TBS) implantation vs standard of care (SOC) in patients with mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in the Canadian healthcare setting. Methods: The deterioration in visual field (VF) defect over a 15-year time horizon was tracked using a Markov model with Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson stages of glaucoma (mild, moderate, advanced, severe/blind) and death as health states. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials were conducted to estimate the pooled reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and medication use due to TBS and SOC. The rate of decline in VF loss was adjusted by the extent of IOP reduction to estimate transition probabilities. Healthcare resource utilization, unit costs (2017 CAD), and progression-related utility scores were obtained by literature review, and medication costs with wastage were obtained from IMS Brogan PharmaStat. The impact of parameter and methodological uncertainty on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was examined using probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses. Results: The meta-analysis showed an additional reduction of 1.13 medications/patient and an additional decrease in IOP of –1.10 mmHg at 36 months favoring TBS. TBS strongly dominated medication alone, due to higher improvement in quality-of-life (0.068 QALYs), fewer blind eyes (–0.0031), and a decrease in total healthcare costs of C$2,908.3 per patient over the time horizon (C$9,394.1 TBS vs C$12,302.4 medication alone). Sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust to the uncertainties in model inputs and assumptions. Time-to-dominance was 44 months (3.7 years). Conclusions: The TBS procedure was cost-effective over SOC in a 15-year time horizon, with quality-of-life gains. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bimatoprost; brimonidine; brimonidine plus brinzolamide; brimonidine plus timolol; brinzolamide; brinzolamide plus timolol; dorzolamide; latanoprost; latanoprost plus timolol; timolol; aged; Article; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; health care cost; health care quality; health status; human; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; nursing home; open angle glaucoma; practice guideline; quality adjusted life year; randomized controlled trial; trabeculectomy; uncertainty; visual field; Canada; cost benefit analysis; economics; female; health care planning; male; Markov chain; meta analysis; middle aged; open angle glaucoma; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; stent; time factor; visual acuity; Aged; Canada; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Health Expenditures; Health Resources; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Markov Chains; Middle Aged; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Severity of Illness Index; Stents; Time Factors; Trabeculectomy; Visual Acuity"
"Differences between unipolar mania and bipolar-I disorder: Evidence from nine epidemiological studies","2019","Objectives: Although clinical evidence suggests important differences between unipolar mania and bipolar-I disorder (BP-I), epidemiological data are limited. Combining data from nine population-based studies, we compared subjects with mania (M) or mania with mild depression (Md) to those with BP-I with both manic and depressive episodes with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics in order to highlight differences. Methods: Participants were compared for gender, age, age at onset of mania, psychiatric comorbidity, temperament, and family history of mental disorders. Generalized linear mixed models with adjustment for sex and age as well as for each study source were applied. Analyses were performed for the pooled adult and adolescent samples, separately. Results: Within the included cohorts, 109 adults and 195 adolescents were diagnosed with M/Md and 323 adults and 182 adolescents with BP-I. In both adult and adolescent samples, there was a male preponderance in M/Md, whereas lifetime generalized anxiety and/panic disorders and suicide attempts were less common in M/Md than in BP-I. Furthermore, adults with mania revealed bulimia/binge eating and drug use disorders less frequently than those with BP-I. Conclusions: The significant differences found in gender and comorbidity between mania and BP-I suggest that unipolar mania, despite its low prevalence, should be established as a separate diagnosis both for clinical and research purposes. In clinical settings, the rarer occurrence of suicide attempts, anxiety, and drug use disorders among individuals with unipolar mania may facilitate successful treatment of the disorder and lead to a more favorable course than that of BP-I disorder. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"An international external quality assessment for laboratory diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia","2019","Essentials A pilot study for External Quality Assessment for testing of HIT is described. The qualitative accordance for the PF4/heparin IgG test was 97.6%. The qualitative accordance for functional HIT tests was considerably lower. External Quality Assessment for functional HIT tests is required. Summary: Objective Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially life-threatening complication of heparin exposure. Diagnosis is most reliable using a combination of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that detects antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin complexes (“antigen” assay) and a “functional” assay that detects platelet-activating properties of the pathogenic HIT antibodies. No External Quality Assessment (EQA) is available for a combination of the tests. Here we report on the results of the first international EQA. Methods The pilot EQA was organized by the Department of Transfusion Medicine, Universit?tsmedizin Greifswald, Germany. Six serum samples of patients, which were referred to Greifswald for HIT diagnosis, and one negative control sample were distributed to seven participants in Germany, Canada, and Singapore. Participants were asked to report the optical density (OD) values of their local EIA test for IgG-specific antibodies against the PF4/heparin complexes and the results for a functional assay (HIPA or SRA). Consensus was defined as a minimum 70% agreement, i.e., agreement among at least five of the seven participating laboratories. Results and conclusion Six out of seven participants reported results for EIA, with a high quantitative accordance (97.6%). For the functional assay, consensus was reached for all samples except the negative control, for which some participants reported nonspecific reactivity. All HIT-negative samples were correctly diagnosed by all participants; for HIT-positive samples, consensus of 70% was reached. Although the limited availability of sample material is an obstacle to overcome, an EQA combining both EIA and functional testing is feasible. ? 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","heparin; heparin platelet factor 4 antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; low molecular weight heparin; adult; aged; antibody specificity; Article; blood sampling; Canada; clinical article; consensus; controlled study; diagnostic test; enzyme immunoassay; female; function test; Germany; gold standard; heparin induced thrombocytopenia; human; human cell; immunological procedures; laboratory diagnosis; laboratory test; male; middle aged; optical density; pilot study; priority journal; qualitative diagnosis; quality control; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; Singapore; thrombocyte activation"
"Structural neuroimaging correlates of social deficits are similar in autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: analysis from the POND Network","2019","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been associated with difficulties recognizing and responding to social cues. Neuroimaging studies have begun to map the social brain; however, the specific neural substrates contributing to social deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders remain unclear. Three hundred and twelve children underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (controls = 32, OCD = 44, ADHD = 77, ASD = 159; mean age = 11). Their social deficits were quantified on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Multivariable regression models were used to examine the structural neuroimaging correlates of social deficits, with both a region of interest and a whole-brain vertex-wise approach. For the region of interest analysis, social brain regions were grouped into three networks: (1) lateral mentalization (e.g., temporal–parietal junction), (2) frontal cognitive (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex), and (3) subcortical affective (e.g., limbic system) regions. Overall, social communication deficits on the SCQ were associated with thinner cortices in the left lateral regions and the right insula, and decreased volume in the ventral striatum, across diagnostic groups (p = 0.006 to <0.0001). Smaller subcortical volumes were associated with more severe social deficits on the SCQ in ASD and ADHD, and less severe deficits in OCD. On the RMET, larger amygdala/hippocampal volumes were associated with fewer deficits across groups. Overall, patterns of associations were similar in ASD and ADHD, supporting a common underlying biology and the blurring of the diagnostic boundaries between these disorders. ? 2019, The Author(s).","oxytocin receptor; Article; attention deficit disorder; autism; Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised; Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; brain region; brain size; Child Behavior Checklist; comparative study; controlled study; correlational study; disease association; disease severity; human; image analysis; mental disease assessment; mentalization; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obsessive compulsive disorder; Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test; social behavior; Social Communication Questionnaire; social competence; Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; adolescent; attention deficit disorder; autism; brain cortex; child; communication disorder; complication; diagnostic imaging; female; limbic system; male; pathology; pathophysiology; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Female; Humans; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Social Communication Disorder"
"Assessing Competence in Emergency Radiology Using an Online Simulator","2019","Rationale and Objectives: Traditional assessments in radiology residency focus on the Medical Expert CanMEDS role and typically rely upon a single or limited static images. We designed an Emergency Radiology Simulator that aimed to assess the breadth of competencies required across Medical and NonMedical Expert domains. Material and Methods: An online simulator with typical emergency cases was administered in October 2015 to Post Graduate Year (PGY)2–5 residents in Radiology. Residents provided preliminary reports, which were graded for style and content. The simulation also included prioritization, protocoling, counseling, and handover exercises geared to assess NonMedical Expert roles. Results: Fourty eight residents participated in the simulation. Level of resident was 11 PGY-2, 17 PGY-3, 13 PGY-4, and 7 PGY-5. There was a significant difference in resident performance between PGY-2 residents and those more senior in terms of the Medical Expert role (findings, diagnosis, recommendations, and clinical relevance of reports). Differences in performance between PGY levels were not seen in the NonMedical Expert roles (prioritization, protocoling, counseling, and handover). Conclusion: Simulation provides an opportunity to assess radiology resident performance across multiple domains. PGY-2 residents performed worse on the Medical Expert domains, although performance did not significantly vary between the other years. This may suggest that competence in Emergency Radiology is achieved early in residency, possibly related to the importance placed on developing skills related to on-call performance during the PGY-2 year. The simulator should be extended to other areas of Radiology, in order to assess the ability to discriminate performance in other subspecialties. ? 2018 The Association of University Radiologists","Article; cancer diagnosis; clinical assessment; clinical competence; clinical protocol; computer simulation; curriculum; emergency care; emergency patient; emergency ward; exercise; human; image quality; incidental finding; interventional radiology; medical expert; online analysis; patient counseling; priority journal; radiology department; residency education; simulation training; skill; student satisfaction; treatment indication"
"Identification and Characterization of AES-135, a Hydroxamic Acid-Based HDAC Inhibitor That Prolongs Survival in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of Pancreatic Cancer","2019","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive, incurable cancer with a 20% 1 year survival rate. While standard-of-care therapy can prolong life in a small fraction of cases, PDAC is inherently resistant to current treatments, and novel therapies are urgently required. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are effective in killing pancreatic cancer cells in in vitro PDAC studies, and although there are a few clinical studies investigating combination therapy including HDAC inhibitors, no HDAC drug or combination therapy with an HDAC drug has been approved for the treatment of PDAC. We developed an inhibitor of HDACs, AES-135, that exhibits nanomolar inhibitory activity against HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC11 in biochemical assays. In a three-dimensional coculture model, AES-135 kills low-passage patient-derived tumor spheroids selectively over surrounding cancer-associated fibroblasts and has excellent pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. In an orthotopic murine model of pancreatic cancer, AES-135 prolongs survival significantly, therefore representing a candidate for further preclinical testing. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","aes 135; antineoplastic agent; histone deacetylase 11; histone deacetylase 3; histone deacetylase 6; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxamic acid derivative; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer associated fibroblast; cancer survival; coculture; controlled study; drug synthesis; enzyme activity; human; human cell; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; pancreas adenocarcinoma; tumor spheroid"
"Patterns of daily activity among young people with epilepsy","2019","Aim: To: (1) explore how young people with epilepsy spend time on physical activity, screen-time, and sleep in a 24-hour period; (2) compare these findings to young people without epilepsy; and (3) evaluate the findings relative to the Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines for children and youth. Method: The study is based on Canadian data from the 2013 to 2014 ‘Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study’ (HBSC), a cross-sectional sample of young people aged 10 to 17?years. Three groups participated: 163 young people with epilepsy, 3613 young people with non-neurological conditions, and 18?339 population norms. Self-reported activity data were compared across groups. Results: Demographics were similar across groups. Young people with epilepsy spent 5.8?hours per week on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity versus 5.6?hours per week in population norms; 32% met the recommended 1?hour or more per day. Screen-time was 8.7?hours per day versus 7.4?hours per day in population norms; only 5.4% met the 2?hours or less per day recommendation. Sleep duration was 10.2?hours per day versus 9.8?hours per day in population norms, and 50.7% met the recommendation. Overall, 25.7% of young people with epilepsy did not meet any of the guidelines, 60.5% met one, 13.5% met two, and 0.3% met?all three recommendations; whereas 2.8% of population norms and 2% of young people with non-neurological conditions met?all three recommendations. Interpretation: These data could inform future interventions and alert policy-makers, health care professionals, parents, educators, and advocacy-groups to the low adherence of young people with epilepsy with Canadian guidelines and their risk for poor health. What this paper adds: Young people with epilepsy adhere poorly to Canadian guidelines for daily sleep duration, physical activity, and sedentary screen time. Young people with epilepsy accumulate more screen-time than those with non-neurological conditions or population norms. ? 2019 Mac Keith Press","adolescent; advocacy group; article; child; controlled study; daily life activity; epileptic patient; health behavior; human; juvenile; physical activity; practice guideline; screen time; sleep time"
"Metachronous or synchronous primary lung cancer in the era of computed tomography surveillance","2019","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, characteristics, and survival of second primary lung cancer initially identified as an indeterminate lesion on the original computed tomography scan and then diagnosed during the surveillance period in a prospective study. Methods: A prospective database of 271 patients enrolled in a surveillance study was updated. Indeterminate lesions present on the original computed tomography at the time of initial primary lung cancer diagnosis that subsequently grew and were diagnosed as cancer were termed “synchronous primary lung cancer.” Lesions that were not present on the original computed tomography scan and subsequently diagnosed on surveillance were termed “metachronous primary lung cancer.” Results: Thirty patients (11.1%) developed 37 second primary lung cancers over a median surveillance period of 84.7 (range, 15.9-147.6) months. Of these, 15 of 37 (40.5%) were identified as synchronous primary lung cancer, and 22 of 37 (59.5%) were identified as metachronous primary lung cancer. At first identification, ground-glass lesions were identified in 9 of 15 (60%) synchronous primary lung cancers compared with only 5 of 22 (22.7%) of metachronous primary lung cancers (P =.034). Compared with metachronous primary lung cancer, from first identification to diagnosis, synchronous primary lung cancer developed over a longer interval (33.6 vs 7.2 months, P =.001) and had a slower growth rate (0.17 vs 0.45 mm/month, P =.027). The 5-year overall survival from second lung cancer was 73.0%. No significant differences were observed between the synchronous primary lung cancer and metachronous primary lung cancer cohorts in overall survival from initial primary lung cancer (P =.583) or from second lung cancer (P =.966). Conclusions: Computed tomography surveillance identifies 2 types of curable second lung cancers leading to excellent overall survival. ? 2018 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery","antineoplastic agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; Article; cancer survival; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; female; growth rate; human; induction chemotherapy; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; overall survival; primary tumor; priority journal; prospective study; second cancer; squamous cell lung carcinoma; thorax surgery"
"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells: Not only in tumor immunity","2019","Since the realization that immature myeloid cells are powerful modulators of the immune response, many studies on “myeloid-derived suppressor cells” (MDSCs) have documented their ability to promote tumor progression in melanoma and other cancers. Whether MDSCs are induced solely pathologically in tumorigenesis, or whether they also represent physiological immune control mechanisms, is not well-understood, but is particularly important in the light of ongoing attempts to block their activities in order to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Here, we briefly review studies which explore (1) how best to identify MDSCs in the context of cancer and how this compares to other conditions in humans; (2) what the suppressive mechanisms of MDSCs are and how to target them pharmacologically; (3) whether levels of MDSCs with various phenotypes are informative for clinical outcome not only in cancer but also other diseases, and (4) whether MDSCs are only found under pathological conditions or whether they also represent a physiological regulatory mechanism for the feedback control of immunity. Studies unequivocally document that MDSCs strongly influence cancer outcomes, but are less informative regarding their relevance to infection, autoimmunity, transplantation and aging, especially in humans. So far, the results of clinical interventions to reverse their negative effects in cancer have been disappointing; thus, developing differential approaches to modulate MSDCs in cancer and other diseases without unduly comprising any normal physiological function requires further exploration.

"The impact of dietary fermentable carbohydrates on a postinflammatory model of irritable bowel syndrome","2019","Background: A low fermentable carbohydrate (FODMAP) diet is used in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease when irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms occur. There is concern that the diet could exacerbate inflammation by modifying microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We examined the effect of altering dietary FODMAP content on inflammation in preclinical inflammatory models. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were given 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5?days and recovered for 3?weeks (postinflammatory, n?=?12), or 5?days (positive-control, n?=?12). Following recovery, DSS-treated or control mice (negative-control, n?=?12) were randomized to 2-week low- (0.51?g/100?g total FODMAP) or high-FODMAP (4.10?g) diets. Diets mimicked human consumption containing fructose, sorbitol, galacto-oligosaccharide, and fructan. Colons were assessed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological damage. Supernatants were generated for perforated patch-clamp recordings and cytokine measurement. Cecum contents were analyzed for microbiota, SCFA, and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni. Key results: Inflammatory markers were higher in the positive-control compared with negative-control and postinflammatory groups, but no differences occurred between the two diets within each treatment (MPO P?>.99, histological scores P?>.99, cytokines P?>.05), or the perforated patch-clamp recordings (P?>.05). Microbiota clustered mainly based on DSS exposure. No difference in SCFA content occurred. Higher total BCFA occurred with the low-FODMAP diet in positive-control (P?<.01) and postinflammatory groups (P?<.01). Conclusions and inferences: In this preclinical study, reducing dietary FODMAPs did not exacerbate nor mitigate inflammation. Microbiota profile changes were largely driven by inflammation rather than diet. Low FODMAP intake caused a shift toward proteolytic fermentation following inflammation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","branched chain fatty acid; carbohydrate; casein; cellulose; chemoattractant; cytokine; fatty acid; fructan; fructose; galactose oligosaccharide; gamma interferon; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; keratinocyte chemoattractant; lard; macrophage inflammatory protein 2; maltodextrin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; myeloperoxidase; sorbitol; soybean oil; starch; sucrose; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight change; cecum content; colon; controlled study; diet therapy; inflammatory bowel disease; low FODMAP diet; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; perforated patch clamp; priority journal"
"Predicting health risks from intrusion into drinking water pipes over time","2019","This exploratory study uses corrosion rates in aging metal pipes to predict the number of holes in drinking water supply systems over time. Using this estimate of the number of holes, it is possible to estimate the volume and number of pathogens introduced by negativepressure events by Monte Carlo simulation. The probability of an intrusion volume greater than 10 L increases from less than 1% in a 25-yearold pipe to greater than 70% in a 150-year-old pipe. Surprisingly, however, health risks associated with three pathogens increase little with increasing pipe age. Some pathogens, like Giardia, are so abundant that almost any intrusion volume presents a risk, virtually independent of pipe age. Other organisms, such as Cryptosporidium, are present at such low concentrations that the risk remains low. The only evidence of significant increase in health risk (rotavirus) was predicted to occur early in the service life of the pipe (i.e., fewer than 50 years), and many pipes are much older. Because there is little evidence health risk due to intrusion increasing over time, it would seem that controlling intrusion risk is unlikely to be the key factor in developing pipe repair and replacement strategies. A simple model for assessing the overall health risks associated with intrusion is provided, suggesting the number of negative-pressure events and pipe residence time are important risk factors. ? 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Corrosion rate; Health; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Pipeline corrosion; Potable water; Protozoa; Residence time distribution; Risk assessment; Water pipelines; Water supply; Water supply systems; Giardia; Intrusion; Monte carlo simulations (MCS); Rotaviruses; Water distributions; Health risks; corrosion; distribution system; drinking water; health risk; Monte Carlo analysis; pathogen; prediction; virus; water supply; Cryptosporidium; Giardia; Rotavirus"
"Trajectories of body mass index, from adolescence to older adulthood, and pancreatic cancer risk; a population-based case–control study in Ontario, Canada","2019","Purpose: Pancreatic cancer has the highest fatality rate of all cancers. Adulthood obesity is an established risk factor for pancreatic cancer; however, life-course obesity is not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) trajectories throughout the life-course and pancreatic cancer risk. Methods: A population-based case–control study was conducted (2011–2013) in Ontario, Canada. Cases were recruited from the Ontario pancreas cancer study (n = 310) and controls from the Ontario cancer risk factor study (n = 1258). Questionnaires captured self-reported height and weight at four timepoints (adolescence, 20?s, 30–40?s, 50–60?s). BMI trajectories were identified using latent class growth mixture modeling. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression. Results: Five BMI trajectories were identified: stable-normal weight (38.9%), progressively overweight (42.2%), persistent overweight (12.6%), progressive obesity (4.2%), and persistent obesity (2.1%). The persistent overweight (OR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.02, 2.39) and progressive obesity trajectories (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 0.77, 2.87) compared to stable-normal weight were associated with increased odds of pancreatic cancer. When BMI was evaluated separately the strongest associations with pancreatic cancer emerged in young and mid-adulthood. Conclusion: BMI trajectories characterized by overweight in early adulthood were associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk suggesting a life-course approach to disease risk. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adolescence; adult; adulthood; aged; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; cancer risk; case control study; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; obesity; Ontario; pancreas cancer; population research; priority journal; questionnaire; self report; adolescent; middle aged; obesity; pancreas tumor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Overweight; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Young Adult"
"Ready-to-use thermally stable mastermix pills for molecular biology applications","2019","Rolling circle amplification (RCA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are powerful tools that can be used for gene manipulation, pathogen detection, and infectious disease diagnostics. However, these techniques require trained personnel, as the pipetting steps involved can lead to contamination and, consequently, erroneous results. Furthermore, many of the reagents used in molecular biology are thermally labile and must be kept within a cold-chain. In this article, we present a simple and cost-effective method that allows molecular biology reagents to be thermally stabilized into ready-to-use mastermixes via drying in pullulan and trehalose films. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method is capable of preserving the activity of RCA, PCR, LAMP, ligase, polynucleotide kinase, and Klenow fragment mastermixes for at least 3 months at ambient conditions. Thus, stabilizing reagents via drying in pullulan and trehalose film may allow for a drastic reduction in the number of pipetting steps and the elimination of the need for a cold chain. ? 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

"The utility of apparent diffusion coefficients for predicting treatment response to uterine arterial embolization for uterine leiomyomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","PURPOSE Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, which are derived from diffusion-weighted imaging, have a potential role for predicting treatment response. A systematic review was conducted to examine the value of baseline ADC values for predicting leiomyoma size reduction after uterine arterial embolization (UAE). METHODS Study selection, quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors. Statistical analyses included the calculation of weighted means and summary correlation coefficients (under the random effects model). RESULTS Eleven studies consisting of a total of 258 patients (age, weighted mean±standard deviation [SD], 43.1±10.1 years) were included. The weighted mean±SD ADC value was 1.2±1.5 ×10 -3 s/mm2 at baseline (ten studies) and 1.3±2.8 ×10 -3 s/mm 2 at approximately 6 months after embolization (six studies). The weighted mean percentage leiomyoma volume reduction (VR) at 6 months was 47.1%±35.6% (seven studies). Based on four studies, the weighted summary correlation coefficient for the correlation between baseline ADC and leiomyoma VR at approximately 6 months was not significant (r=0.40; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.72; I 2 =69.7%). No associations were found in three of the four studies that examined changes in ADC values as a predictor. CONCLUSION Due to high heterogeneity, it is unclear whether ADC may be useful for predicting treatment responses to UAE. ?

"Understanding the supports needed for policy implementation: A comparative analysis of the placement of intermediaries across three mental health systems","2019","Background: Intermediaries are organisations or programmes that work between policy-makers and service providers to facilitate effective implementation of evidence-informed policies, programmes and practices. A number of intermediaries now exist in well-established mental health systems; however, research on them, and how they may be optimised to support implementation is lacking. This research seeks to understand the puzzling variation in the system placement of intermediaries supporting policy implementation in the mental health systems of Canada (Ontario), New Zealand and Scotland. Methods: Using a comparative case study approach, the analytic goal was to compare intermediaries across jurisdictions and explain differences in their placement using explanatory frameworks from political science. Data for this analysis were derived from several sources, including key informant interviews, a literature search of published and grey literature on intermediaries and on policy implementation in mental health systems, a review of relevant policy documents and websites, as well as documents and websites relating to the various intermediaries and other interest groups within each system. Results: Through the analysis, we argue that the placement of intermediaries supporting policy implementation can be explained through an understanding of the political structures, the policy legacies leading to the current public/private mix of mental health service delivery, and the differing administrative capacities of mental health systems. Conclusions: This research contributes to our growing understanding of policy-related intermediaries supporting implementation at scale and how we might build appropriate infrastructure in systems to support the implementation of policy and achieve better outcomes for citizens. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; controlled study; grey literature; human; human experiment; interview; mental health service; New Zealand; Ontario; outcome assessment; public-private partnership; Scotland"
"Expanding the Boundaries of RNA Sequencing as a Diagnostic Tool for Rare Mendelian Disease","2019","Gene-panel and whole-exome analyses are now standard methodologies for mutation detection in Mendelian disease. However, the diagnostic yield achieved is at best 50%, leaving the genetic basis for disease unsolved in many individuals. New approaches are thus needed to narrow the diagnostic gap. Whole-genome sequencing is one potential strategy, but it currently has variant-interpretation challenges, particularly for non-coding changes. In this study we focus on transcriptome analysis, specifically total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), by using monogenetic neuromuscular disorders as proof of principle. We examined a cohort of 25 exome and/or panel “negative” cases and provided genetic resolution in 36% (9/25). Causative mutations were identified in coding and non-coding exons, as well as in intronic regions, and the mutational pathomechanisms included transcriptional repression, exon skipping, and intron inclusion. We address a key barrier of transcriptome-based diagnostics: the need for source material with disease-representative expression patterns. We establish that blood-based RNA-seq is not adequate for neuromuscular diagnostics, whereas myotubes generated by transdifferentiation from an individual's fibroblasts accurately reflect the muscle transcriptome and faithfully reveal disease-causing mutations. Our work confirms that RNA-seq can greatly improve diagnostic yield in genetically unresolved cases of Mendelian disease, defines strengths and challenges of the technology, and demonstrates the suitability of cell models for RNA-based diagnostics. Our data set the stage for development of RNA-seq as a powerful clinical diagnostic tool that can be applied to the large population of individuals with undiagnosed, rare diseases and provide a framework for establishing minimally invasive strategies for doing so. ? 2019 The Authors","transcriptome; transcriptome; ACTA1 gene; allele; ANO5 gene; Article; CAPN3 gene; CAV3 gene; cell transdifferentiation; CHRNA1 gene; CLCN1 gene; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; coding; cohort analysis; COL6A1 gene; COL6A3 gene; COLQ gene; controlled study; DES gene; exome; exon; female; fibroblast; gene expression; gene mutation; gene repression; genetic disorder; genetic variability; genetics; human; human cell; human tissue; intron; KBTBD13 gene; KLH1 gene; male; Mendelian disease; minimally invasive procedure; myotube; NEB gene; neuromuscular disease; pathogenesis; POMT2 gene; priority journal; promoter region; RNA sequence; SCN4A gene; SGCA gene; SGCB gene; skeletal muscle; SYNE2 gene; SYT2 gene; TNNT1 gene; TPM3 gene; TTN gene; whole genome sequencing; adolescent; adult; cell culture; child; genetic marker; genetic variation; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; muscle disease; mutation; pathology; procedures; rare disease; skeletal muscle cell; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cells, Cultured; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Variation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Male; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Muscular Diseases; Mutation; Rare Diseases; Transcriptome; Young Adult"
"Retrospective analysis of aeroallergen's sensitization patterns in Edmonton, Canada","2019","Background: Sensitization to common environmental aeroallergens plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and severity of respiratory allergic disorders, specifically asthma and allergic rhinitis. Understanding sensitization patterns helps clinicians tailor care more effectively. This study examines patterns of sensitization to aeroallergens in subjects suspected of having an allergic disease in Edmonton and catchment area. Methods: Retrospective chart review of skin prick test (SPT) results to 11 environmental aeroallergens performed between January 1st and June 30th 2014 at a University-based clinic, where patients are referred for SPT by allergists, respirologists, otolaryngologists, internists and general practitioners. Potential differences in aeroallergen sensitization patterns were evaluated. Results: A total of 623 patients (36.9% males; 63.1% females), aged 4-84 years (mean age 38.6 years) had SPT done, of which 438 (70.3%) had a positive test for at least one aeroallergen (atopy). There were no significant sex differences in the frequency of atopy (males: 71.3% versus females: 69.7%; p = 0.373). The frequency of sensitivity to particular allergens among atopic subjects was: cat (53.1%), house dust mites (50.3%), grass (39.2%), birch (23.7%), alternaria (23.7%), dog (17.3%), poplar (12.1%), cedar (9.6%), aspergillus (9.6%), hormodendrum (8%), and penicillium (6.2%). Of 438 atopic patients, 110 (25.1%) were mono sensitized, 199 (45.4%) oligosensitized (2-3 allergens), and 129 (29.5%) polysensitized (? 4 allergens). There were no significant differences between males and females in the odds of being oligo-sensitized (OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.58, 1.57). Polysensitization was significantly more frequent in males 37.2% than in females 24.8%; (OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.58, 1.57). Conclusion: Cat is the most frequent perennial allergen and timothy grass pollen the most frequent seasonal allergen in Edmonton and catchment area. There was no significant difference in the frequency of atopy between males and females. However, males were more likely to be polysensitized compared to females. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aeroallergen; allergen; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; aged; allergic disease; Alternaria; Article; Aspergillus; atopy; birch; Canada; cat; cedar; child; Dermatophagoides; dog; female; frequency; fungus; grass; hormodendrum; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mono sensitization; oligosensitization; Penicillium; polysensitization; Populus; prick test; residential care; retrospective study; sensitization; sex difference; tree"
"Bridging the gap: incorporating exercise evidence into clinical practice in breast cancer care","2020","Purpose: To determine the feasibility (recruitment, retention, and adherence rates) of implementing a multi-dimensional knowledge translation (KT) intervention designed for women with breast cancer, and to explore preliminary estimates of effects of the implementation strategy on exercise level, exercise knowledge and behavior, health-related quality of life, and overall health status among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Design: Implementation Trial. Participants: Community-dwelling women, over 18?years of age, currently undergoing chemotherapy for stage 1–3 BRCA. Randomization and Blinding: A blinded researcher randomized participants on a record-by-record basis to the intervention or control group. A researcher blinded to the group allocation of the participants conducted the statistical analysis. Intervention Group: Eight sessions of moderate intensity aerobic exercise along with eight self-management modules were delivered during chemotherapy within the cancer institution. Control Group: Usual care. Primary Outcome: Feasibility of implementation strategy measured through recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Results: Twenty-nine women were screened for this study. Twenty-seven met inclusion criteria and twenty-six participants were enrolled in the study. The implementation strategy was determined to be feasible and had a recruitment rate of 96%, retention rate of 100%, and adherence rate of 89%. The intervention group had significantly higher exercise levels (mean difference = 25.38, 95%CI = (9.35, 41.42)) post-intervention compared with the control group. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: The implementation of this KT intervention is feasible and demonstrates preliminary effects for secondary outcomes for women with breast cancer during chemotherapy. Findings support the implementation of this intervention in a multi-center trial.

"Systemic treatments for metastatic urothelial carcinoma","2019","Introduction: Urothelial carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in the western world and, until recently, had limited therapeutic options. The contemporary advancement of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has heralded a new era for these patients and represents a major shift in the evolving treatment landscape. Areas covered: This article provides a comprehensive summary of the currently available treatments for metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). The authors also review ongoing, phase-III studies with novel therapeutic targets and highlight recent insights into tumor biology that may help better understand the disease. Expert opinion: The treatment landscape for first-line therapy of mUC continues to include platinum-based chemotherapy for patients who are eligible. While the approval of ICI has changed the management in those who are post-platinum or platinum-ineligible, the wider use of ICI in the first-line setting requires further clarity given recent FDA announcements. Maintaining the remarkable progress in mUC may depend upon ongoing phase-III studies evaluating treatment options beyond ICI. Better prognostication and identification of those unlikely to respond to ICI remain important unanswered questions, particularly as this class of agents moves further along the disease spectrum of non-metastatic UC. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer survival; follow up; food and drug administration; human; immunocompetent cell; maintenance therapy; metastasis; metastatic urothelial carcinoma; national health organization; Review; risk factor; systemic therapy; transitional cell carcinoma; tumor microenvironment; Western world; bladder tumor; transitional cell carcinoma; antineoplastic agent; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Humans; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"
"Attending Emergency Physicians’ Perceptions of a Programmatic Workplace-Based Assessment System: The McMaster Modular Assessment Program (McMAP)","2019","Construct: The McMaster Modular Assessment Program (McMAP) is a programmatic workplace-based assessment (WBA) system that provides emergency medicine trainees with competency judgments through frequent task-specific and global daily assessments. Background: The longevity of McMAP relative to other programmatic WBA systems affords a unique view that precedes large-scale transitions to competency-based medical education (CBME), particularly in North America. Although prior work has described the perspective of residents using this system, the in-depth experiences of assessors using the system have yet to be explored. This perspective is important for understanding the validity of the competency judgments the system produces. Approach: We conducted a qualitative study that used semi-structured interviews analyzed using interpretive description (Thorne) to explore 16 attending physicians’ experiences using McMAP. Data analysis was completed independently by 2 researchers, who met regularly to discuss codes and resolve any disagreements. Results: Having a structured assessment framework for a range of clinical tasks has helped encourage what attendings perceived to be more frequent and better-quality assessments, with the added advantages of being holistic, flexible, and learner-driven. However, attendings also perceived a number of challenges of McMAP and programmatic WBA more broadly. These included a reluctance to give and to document negative feedback, “gaming” of the system by both attendings and residents, and a variety of logistic and technology-related concerns. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we offer several key recommendations that can help programs maximize the benefits of programmatic WBA as they transition to CBME. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; article; data analysis; decision making; emergency medicine; emergency physician; female; human; human experiment; male; medical education; negative feedback; perception; postgraduate student; qualitative research; quality control; resident; scientist; semi structured interview; validity; workplace; attitude to health; education; emergency medicine; interview; medical education; medical staff; Educational Measurement; Emergency Medicine; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Internship and Residency; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medical Staff, Hospital; Qualitative Research; Workplace"
"Cerebral cortical thickness after treatment with desvenlafaxine succinate in major depressive disorder","2019","Thickness of the cerebral cortex has been previously investigated for its potential as a biomarker in major depressive disorder (MDD). This is the first study to examine the longitudinal effects of a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS), on whole-brain cortical thickness (CT) in patients treated for MDD. We also aimed to replicate a previous finding of an association between improvement in clinical severity and CT in one of five predefined regions-of-interest (ROI). Twenty-five individuals with MDD received treatment with DVS (50 mg/day) for 8 weeks, with 19 completing the study. We used FreeSurfer 6.0 to compare group differences between MDD and controls (n=23) and between treatment responders, treatment nonresponders and controls. We tested correlations between 8-week change in depression severity and regional CT in five ROIs: the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex, lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus. There were no differences in CT between MDD and controls or DVS responders and controls. There was greater CT in DVS nonresponders in the left pars orbitalis when compared to controls [MNI (X, Y, Z=-38.4, 37.6,-11.1); P=0.027]. There were no significant correlations between change in depression severity and CT in any of the five ROIs. Brain CT does not seem to be a sensitive marker of short-term antidepressant response in MDD, except increased CT in nonresponders. Duration of the intervention and interindividual heterogeneity may impede identification of discriminating features of treatment response as associated to CT. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Surfactant dysfunction and alveolar collapse are linked with fibrotic septal wall remodeling in the TGF-β1-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis","2019","In human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), collapse of distal airspaces occurs in areas of the lung not (yet) remodeled. Mice lungs overexpressing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) recapitulate this abnormality: surfactant dysfunction results in alveolar collapse preceding fibrosis and loss of alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells’ apical membrane surface area. Here we examined whether surfactant dysfunction-related alveolar collapse due to TGF-β1 overexpression is linked to septal wall remodeling and AE2 cell abnormalities. Three and 6 days after gene transfer of TGF-β1, mice received either intratracheal surfactant (Surf-groups: Curosurf?, 100 mg/kg bodyweight) or 0.9% NaCl (Saline-groups). On days 7 (D7) and 14 (D14), lung mechanics were assessed followed by design-based stereology at light and electron microscopic level to quantify structures. Compared with Saline, Surf showed significantly improved tissue elastance, increased numbers of open alveoli, as well as reduced alveolar size heterogeneity on D7. Deterioration in lung mechanics was highly correlated to the loss of open alveoli. On D14, lung mechanics, number of open alveoli, and alveolar size heterogeneity remained significantly improved in the Surf-group. Volumes of extracellular matrix and collagen fibrils in septal walls were significantly reduced, whereas the apical membrane surface area of AE2 cells was increased in Surf compared with Saline. In remodeled tissue with collapsed alveoli, three-dimensional reconstruction of AE2 cells based on scanning electron microscopy array tomography revealed that AE2 cells were trapped without contact to airspaces in the TGF-β1 mouse model. Similar observations were made in human IPF. Based on correlation analyses, the number of open alveoli and of alveolar size heterogeneity were highly linked with the loss of apical membrane surface area of AE2 cells and deposition of collagen fibrils in septal walls on D14. In conclusion, surfactant replacement therapy stabilizes alveoli and prevents extracellular matrix deposition in septal walls in the TGF-β1 model. ? 2019, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","hydroxyproline; poractant; sodium chloride; transforming growth factor beta1; airway remodeling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apical membrane; Article; cell ultrastructure; collagen fibril; controlled study; deterioration; extracellular matrix; female; gene transfer; lung alveolus cell; lung alveolus collapse; lung alveolus surface tension; lung compliance; lung disease; lung fibrosis; lung mechanics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; scanning electron microscopy; substitution therapy; surfactant dysfunction; three dimensional imaging"
"The future of perioperative therapy in advanced renal cell carcinoma: How can we PROSPER?","2019","While many patients with early stage kidney cancer can be cured by removal of the tumor and kidney ('nephrectomy'), upward of 40% of patients can recur due to microscopic spread of the cancer prior to surgery. Adding anticancer drugs that are effective in the metastatic setting to surgery has potential to eliminate the microscopic disease and increase cure rates. The PROSPER renal cell carcinoma study is testing whether adding nivolumab, a drug that engages the immune system to better recognize, fight and eliminate the cancer, will improve disease control over surgery alone. Nivolumab will be given before and after surgery to see if it reduces the chance of the disease returning and decreases death from kidney cancer compared with patients receiving surgery only. ? 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","alpha interferon; atezolizumab; axitinib; durvalumab; everolimus; interleukin 2; ipilimumab; nivolumab; pazopanib; pembrolizumab; placebo; sorafenib; sunitinib; ticilimumab; immunological antineoplastic agent; tumor marker; adjuvant therapy; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer immunotherapy; disease free survival; drug dose reduction; drug megadose; drug withdrawal; human; liver dysfunction; molecularly targeted therapy; nephrectomy; outcome assessment; overall survival; perioperative period; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence free survival; renal cell carcinoma; sample size; study design; unspecified side effect; cancer staging; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled study; disease predisposition; kidney tumor; multimodality cancer therapy; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology; phase 3 clinical trial; procedures; randomized controlled trial; renal cell carcinoma; treatment outcome; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Clinical Protocols; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Staging; Nephrectomy; Perioperative Care; Treatment Outcome"
"Outcomes following neonatal portal vein thrombosis: A descriptive, single-center study and review of anticoagulant therapy","2019","Background: Neonatal portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is uncommon with potentially serious complications that may manifest in infancy and childhood. Objective: The primary aim of our study was to describe the short-term and long-term outcomes of neonatal PVT. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted from 2008 to 2016 of neonates diagnosed with PVT. A systematic review was also performed from 2000 to 2018 to evaluate anticoagulant therapy (ACT) in neonatal PVT. Results: Forty-four premature and 30 term infants (mean gestational age 30.7 vs 39.1?weeks, respectively) had PVT. Sixty-eight involved the left portal vein, one involved only the main portal vein, and 5 involved ?1 vein. PVT was catheter associated in 46 (62%); none of the 7 neonates tested had thrombophilia. Of 74 neonates, 19 (26%) received ACT and 55 (74%) were untreated. The mean follow-up duration was 16.6 months (SD?=?17.62; range, 0–89.6); 59.5% were followed for ?6 months. On last ultrasound examination, thrombus resolution was documented in treated (ACT; n?=?19) and nontreated (n?=?55) neonates: 12 (63%) versus 32 (58%) with complete resolution, 1 (5%) versus 6 (11%) partial, 0 versus 1 (2%) extension, and 6 (32%) versus 16 (29%) had nonprogressive lesions, respectively. Seventy-one (96%) had no complications. Seventy-one articles met inclusion criteria for the systematic review and 19 were retained for analysis after assessment. Conclusions: PVT resolution rate was similar to previous reports. Although a low complication rate was detected, longer follow-up is necessary to determine the need for early treatment and the precise incidence of outcomes such as portal hypertension. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","low molecular weight heparin; anticoagulant therapy; Article; catheter thrombosis; child; clinical outcome; controlled study; descriptive research; echography; female; hepatic portal vein; human; infant; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; newborn; newborn disease; portal vein thrombosis; prematurity; priority journal; retrospective study; systematic review; tertiary care center; thrombocytopenia; diagnostic imaging; newborn disease; thrombosis; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Male; Portal Vein; Retrospective Studies; Thrombosis"
"Role of lipoprotein apheresis in cardiovascular disease risk reduction","2019","Background and Aim: Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or lipoprotein(a) are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Management of hypercholesterolemia consists of drug therapies, including statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors. In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is utilized to control lipid levels. However, LA is not currently a standard therapy for non-FH. This review summarizes the literature regarding LA therapy in CVD prevention. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE databases were searched using the keywords “LA” and “CVD”. Citations were individually reviewed for relevance. Results: The efficacy of LA was clearly demonstrated, largely based on evidence from observational studies. In patients who are unresponsive to traditional lipid-lowering medications, LA effectively reduced serum lipoprotein levels and adverse cardiovascular events. Conclusion: It was concluded that LA is a safe and effective technique that could be considered in the management of hypercholesterolemia and future risk. Randomized control trials would further support a role for LA as a therapeutic option. ? 2019 S.

"Work intensification and health outcomes of health sector workers","2019","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating role of stress between work intensification and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) focusing on personal support workers (PSWs) in home and community care. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis sample of 922 comes from the 2015 survey of PSWs employed in Ontario, Canada. The endogenous variable is self-reported MSDs, and the exogenous variable is work intensification. Stress, measured as symptoms of stress, is the mediating variable. Other factors shown in the literature as associated with stress and/or MSDs are included as control variables. Structural equation model regression analyses are presented. Findings: The results show that stress mediates the effect of work intensification on PSW’s MSDs. Other significant factors included being injured in the past year, facing hazards at work and preferring less hours – all had positive and significant substantive effects on MSDs. Research limitations/implications: The survey is cross-sectional and not longitudinal or experimental in design, and it focuses on a single occupation in a single sector in Ontario, Canada and, as such, this can limit the generalizability of the results to other occupations and sectors. Practical implications: For PSW employers including their human resource managers, supervisors, schedulers and policy-makers, the study recommends reducing work intensification to lower stress levels and MSDs. Originality/value: The findings of this study contribute to the theory and knowledge by providing evidence on how work intensification can affect workers’ health and assist decision makers in taking actions to create healthy work environments. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",""
"Diversity of Rotavirus Strains Circulating in Botswana before and after introduction of the Monovalent Rotavirus Vaccine","2019","Background: Globally, rotavirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children aged <5 years. Botswana introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) in July 2012. To study the impact of this vaccine on rotavirus genotypes circulating in Botswana, a comparison of the genotypes pre-vaccination (2011–2012) and post-vaccination (2013–2018) periods was conducted. Subjects and methods: Residual samples from 284 children <5 years of age that tested positive for rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay were genotyped. One hundred and five samples were from the pre-vaccination period and 179 were from the post-vaccination period. Genotyping was performed using two multiplexed one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the amplification and genotyping of rotavirus VP7 (G) and VP4 (P) genes. Results: Prior to vaccine introduction, the predominant rotavirus circulating genotypes were G9P[8] (n = 63, 60%) and G1P[8] (n = 22, 21%). During the vaccine period, G2P[4] was the predominant genotype (n = 49, 28%), followed by G9P[8] (n = 40, 22%) and G1P[8] (n = 33, 18.5%). There was a significant decline in the prevalence of G9P[8] (p = 0.001) in the post-vaccination period. There was also a notable decline in G1P[8]. A spike in G2P[4] was observed in 2013, one year post-vaccine introduction. Rotavirus strain G3P[4] (n = 8) was only detected in the post-vaccine introduction period. In 2018 there was a marked increase in genotype G3P[8] (p = 0.0003). Conclusions: The distribution of circulating rotavirus genotypes in Botswana changed after vaccine implementation. Further studies are needed to examine whether these changes are related to vaccination or simply represent natural secular variation. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","protein VP4; protein VP7; Rotavirus vaccine; acute gastroenteritis; Article; Botswana; child; controlled study; enzyme immunoassay; female; gene amplification; genotype; genotyping technique; human; major clinical study; male; multiplexed one step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rotavirus; Rotavirus infection; vaccination; virus gene; virus spike; virus strain; VP4 gene; VP7 gene"

"Feasibility and safety of delivering full-dose anticoagulation therapy in children treated according to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute acute lymphoblastic leukemia consortium therapy protocols","2019","Background: The literature is void of an evidence-based anticoagulation therapy (ACT) management strategy in the context of thrombocytopenia. We examined the impact of thrombocytopenia on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dosing and incidence of bleeding in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) who developed thromboembolism (TE) during therapy according to DFCI ALL protocols. Procedure: Patient records from our tertiary care center were reviewed for demographics, details of diagnoses and therapy of ALL/LL and TE diagnoses, platelet counts during ACT, LMWH dosing, and bleeding episodes. Results: Thirty-nine TEs were diagnosed in 33 patients [mean age 9 years (range, 2.5–18); 16 males and 31 with ALL] during the study period. A majority (85%) of patients were diagnosed with TE in the consolidation phase with mean time to TE 5.75 months from ALL/LL diagnosis. All patients received LMWH, and the median duration of ACT was 5.9 months (range, 1–11 months). Platelets were measured weekly. On 29 occasions, platelet nadir was?&lt;50?×?109/L, and twice it was?&lt;?20?×?109/L. One (3%) patient had major bleeding episode while on ACT. Platelet count at the time of bleeding was 222?×?109/L. Ninety-two procedures [83 lumbar punctures (LPs), 9 central venous line (CVL) insertion/revision] were completed without bleeding complications. Asparaginase was held temporarily with TE diagnosis in 48% of patients; most (88%) patients completed all scheduled doses as per protocol. Conclusions: Ability to administer full-dose LMWH, expected bleeding rate, and completion of asparaginase doses while on ACT suggest full-dose ACT is feasible and safe in children with ALL/LL who develop TE during DFCI ALL consortium therapy protocols. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","anticoagulant agent; antineoplastic agent; low molecular weight heparin; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; bleeding; child; cohort analysis; complication; feasibility study; female; human; incidence; male; preschool child; retrospective study; thrombocytopenia; thromboembolism; Adolescent; Anticoagulants; Antineoplastic Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Feasibility Studies; Female; Hemorrhage; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Incidence; Male; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Retrospective Studies; Thrombocytopenia; Thromboembolism"
"What do employers spend to protect the health of workers?","2019","Objective This study aimed to estimate firm-level expenditures on occupational health and safety (OHS) for a representative sample of Canadian employers. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 334 employers with ?20 employees in 18 economic sectors in the Ontario economy. Participants provided information on five dimensions of OHS expenditures: (i) organizational management and supervision; (ii) staff training in health and safety; (iii) personal protective equipment; (iv) professional services and, (v) estimates of the share of new capital investment that could be attributed to improved OHS performance. Expenditures for each of the five dimensions were summed for each organization and divided by the number of employees, resulting in an estimate of OHS expenditure per employee per year. Results The average OHS expenditure per worker per year was Can$1303 [95% confidence interval (CI) Can$1167-1454]. Expenditures were three times higher in the goods-producing sectors (Can$2417, 95% CI Can$2026-2809) relative to the service sectors (Can$847, 95% CI Can$777-915). The proportion of expenditures allocated to each of the five dimensions was generally consistent across economic sectors: 58% to organizational management and supervision, 22% to staff training in health and safety and 14% to personal protective equipment. On average, <5% of OHS expenditures per worker per year were allocated to professional services or estimated as the share of new capital investment attributed to OHS. Conclusions Employer expenditures on OHS are substantial. The results of this study are consistent with recent European estimates and strengthen understanding of the scale of employer financial expenditures to protect the health of workers. ? 2019, Nordic Association of Occupational Safety and Health.

"Characterization of the Human Skeletal Muscle Metabolome for Elucidating the Mechanisms of Bicarbonate Ingestion on Strenuous Interval Exercise","2019","Bicarbonate has long been touted as a putative ergogenic aid that improves exercise performance and blood buffering capacity during strenuous exercise. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of bicarbonate intake on skeletal muscle metabolism have yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we apply two orthogonal analytical platforms for nontargeted profiling of metabolites and targeted analysis of electrolytes from mass-limited muscle tissue biopsies (?2 mg dried mass) when multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS) and CE with indirect UV detection are used, respectively. Seven untrained men performed a standardized bout of high-intensity interval exercise trial following either bicarbonate (0.40 g/kg) or placebo ingestion in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study design, where paired skeletal muscle tissue and plasma specimens were collected at three time intervals at rest, postexercise, and recovery. Optimization of a quantitative microextraction procedure was first developed for lyophilized tissue prior to characterization of the human muscle metabolome, which resulted in the identification and quantification of more than 80 polar/ionic metabolites reliably (CV < 30%) detected in a majority (>75%) of samples with quality control. Complementary univariate and multivariate statistical methods were used to identify biomarkers associated with strenuous exercise and/or bicarbonate treatment responses, whereas structural elucidation of biologically significant intramuscular metabolites was performed using high-resolution MS/MS. Importantly, bicarbonate ingestion prior to strenuous interval exercise was found to elicit a modest treatment effect (p < 0.05) in comparison to placebo on metabolic pathways associated with ionic homeostasis (potassium), purine degradation (uric acid), and oxidative stress as regulated by glutathione metabolism (oxidized mixed glutathione disulfide) and histidine-containing dipeptides (anserine) within muscle tissue that was distinctive from dynamic metabolic changes measured in circulation. This work provides deeper biochemical insights into the effect of acute alkalosis in preserving contracting muscle function during high-intensity exercise, which is also applicable to the study of muscle-related pathologies relevant to human health and aging. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Amino acids; Biomarkers; Biomolecules; Capillary electrophoresis; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Multivariant analysis; Muscle; Peptides; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Buffering capacities; Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometries; Glutathione disulfide; Glutathione metabolism; Metabolic pathways; Micro-extraction procedures; Multivariate statistical method; Structural elucidation; Tissue homeostasis"
"Switching patients in the age of long-acting recombinant products?","2019","Introduction: Prophylaxis with factor replacement therapy is the gold standard for the treatment of hemophilia, but this often requires frequent infusions. A number of long-acting factor products have been developed to reduce the burden on patients. Areas covered: This is an overview of information presented at two symposia held at the World Federation of Hemophilia and International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis–Scientific and Standardization Committee annual meetings. The pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data for long-acting recombinant products are reviewed, with a focus on recombinant factor IX albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP) and rVIII-SingleChain. This overview also provides a guide for managing a patient’s switch to long-acting products. Expert opinion: Long-acting products may allow patients to maintain or decrease bleeding rates whilst increasing their dosing interval, which may in turn reduce the burden on patients and caregivers. When switching patients to long-acting products health-care professionals should provide balanced and thorough education to the patient, whilst supporting their emotional well-being. Regimens should address patients’ needs and goals but should also be guided by clinical phenotype and pharmacokinetic assessment. Follow-up should assess safety concerns, bleeding rates, joint health and the impact of the regimen on patients’ lifestyle. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","albumin; Fc receptor; long acting drug; recombinant blood clotting factor 8; recombinant blood clotting factor 9; recombinant protein; Article; clinical trial (topic); drug efficacy; drug safety; hemophilia; human; PEGylation; priority journal"
"Low-dose methotrexate for the prevention of atherosclerotic events","2019","BACKGROUND: Inflammation is causally related to atherothrombosis. Treatment with canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits inflammation by neutralizing interleukin-1β, resulted in a lower rate of cardiovascular events than placebo in a previous randomized trial. We sought to determine whether an alternative approach to inflammation inhibition with low-dose methotrexate might provide similar benefit. METHODS :We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of low-dose methotrexate (at a target dose of 15 to 20 mg weekly) or matching placebo in 4786 patients with previous myocardial infarction or multivessel coronary disease who additionally had either type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. All participants received 1 mg of folate daily. The primary end point at the onset of the trial was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Near the conclusion of the trial, but before unblinding, hospitalization for unstable angina that led to urgent revascularization was added to the primary end point. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 2.3 years. Methotrexate did not result in lower interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, or C-reactive protein levels than placebo. The final primary end point occurred in 201 patients in the methotrexate group and in 207 in the placebo group (incidence rate, 4.13 vs. 4.31 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.16). The original primary end point occurred in 170 patients in the methotrexate group and in 167 in the placebo group (incidence rate, 3.46 vs. 3.43 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25). Methotrexate was associated with elevations in liver-enzyme levels, reductions in leukocyte counts and hematocrit levels, and a higher incidence of non-basal-cell skin cancers than placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with stable atherosclerosis, low-dose methotrexate did not reduce levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, or C-reactive protein and did not result in fewer cardiovascular events than placebo.

"A macrophage-based screen identifies antibacterial compounds selective for intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium","2019","Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) establishes systemic infection in susceptible hosts by evading the innate immune response and replicating within host phagocytes. Here, we sought to identify inhibitors of intracellular S. Tm replication by conducting parallel chemical screens against S. Tm growing in macrophage-mimicking media and within macrophages. We identify several compounds that inhibit Salmonella growth in the intracellular environment and in acidic, ion-limited media. We report on the antimicrobial activity of the psychoactive drug metergoline, which is specific against intracellular S. Tm. Screening an S. Tm deletion library in the presence of metergoline reveals hypersensitization of outer membrane mutants to metergoline activity. Metergoline disrupts the proton motive force at the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and extends animal survival during a systemic S. Tm infection. This work highlights the predictive nature of intracellular screens for in vivo efficacy, and identifies metergoline as a novel antimicrobial active against Salmonella. ? 2019, The Author(s).","amino acid; bromperidol; ciclopirox; erythromycin; lactate dehydrogenase; meropenem; metergoline; methysergide; nicergoline; novobiocin; nucleotide; pergolide; piperacillin; pseudomonic acid; rifampicin; rifaximin; telithromycin; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; metergoline; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial viability; bone marrow derived macrophage; cell membrane; colony forming unit; controlled study; drug potency; female; intestine epithelium cell; intracellular space; luminescence; macrophage; minimum inhibitory concentration; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; nutrient limitation; outer membrane; phagocyte; phenotype; proton motive force; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; survival time; animal; atomic force microscopy; C57BL mouse; disease model; drug effect; gene deletion; genetics; high throughput screening; human; immunology; macrophage; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; mortality; pathogenicity; preclinical study; procedures; RAW 264.7 cell line; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; salmonellosis; treatment outcome; ultrastructure; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cell Membrane; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Female; Gene Deletion; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Macrophages; Metergoline; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Microscopy, Atomic Force; RAW 264.7 Cells; Salmonella Infections; Salmonella typhimurium; Treatment Outcome"
"A Machine Learning Framework for Automatic and Continuous MMN Detection with Preliminary Results for Coma Outcome Prediction","2019","Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a component of the event-related potential (ERP) that is elicited through an odd-ball paradigm. The existence of the MMN in a coma patient has a good correlation with coma emergence; however, this component can be difficult to detect. Previously, MMN detection was based on visual inspection of the averaged ERPs by a skilled clinician, a process that is expensive and not always feasible in practice. In this paper, we propose a practical machine learning (ML) based approach for detection of MMN component, thus, improving the accuracy of prediction of emergence from coma. Furthermore, the method can operate on an automatic and continuous basis thus alleviating the need for clinician involvement. The proposed method is capable of the MMN detection over intervals as short as two minutes. This finer time resolution enables identification of waxing and waning cycles of a conscious state. An auditory odd-ball paradigm was applied to 22 healthy subjects and 2 coma patients. A coma patient is tested by measuring the similarity of the patient's ERP responses with the aggregate healthy responses. Because the training process for measuring similarity requires only healthy subjects, the complexity and practicality of training procedure of the proposed method are greatly improved relative to training on coma patients directly. Since there are only two coma patients involved with this study, the results are reported on a very preliminary basis. Preliminary results indicate we can detect the MMN component with an accuracy of 92.7% on healthy subjects. The method successfully predicted emergence in both coma patients when conventional methods failed. The proposed method for collecting training data using exclusively healthy subjects is a novel approach that may prove useful in future, unrelated studies where ML methods are used. ? 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction; Flow visualization; Forecasting; Machine components; Personnel training; Standards; Automatic Detection; Informatics; Mismatch negativity; Outcome prediction; Sensitivity; Learning systems; adult; article; case report; clinical article; clinician; comatose patient; feature extraction; female; human; information science; male; mismatch negativity; prediction; preliminary data; auditory evoked potential; coma; electroencephalography; machine learning; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; signal processing; young adult; Adult; Coma; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Prognosis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult"
"A Longitudinal Investigation of Sleep and Daytime Wakefulness in Children and Youth With Concussion","2019","A high proportion of adults who sustain a concussion identify changes in their sleep during the acute stage, typically reporting an increased need for sleep or nonrestful sleep. Our understanding of sleep following concussion is less well understood within a pediatric population. In this study, we investigated the trajectory of sleep and daytime sleepiness in a prospective cohort of 40 children and youth (6–18 years old) with concussion, 40 age-and sex-matched healthy children and youth, and 40 with upper-extremity orthopedic injury. Evaluations occurred during the acute stage (<2 weeks) and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month postinjury using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Postconcussion Symptom Scale. There were no significant differences within- or between-group differences in sleep across all four time points with analysis of the groups as a whole. When groups were divided by age (6–11 and 12– < 18 years), there was a significant difference in the ability to initiate sleep for the younger concussed group during the acute stage, compared with healthy controls, as well as significantly greater daytime nap duration that decreased over time. Significant correlations were also found between the frequency and duration of daytime naps and Postconcussion Symptom Scale total score and subscores (cognitive, physical/migraine, mood, and sleep) in the concussed group during the acute stage. Our results suggest that in a group with noncomplicated concussion, children and youth have transient alterations in daytime sleepiness that are related to concussion symptoms. Younger children may be more vulnerable to disturbances in sleep and daytime wakefulness. ?

"Kaiso-induced intestinal inflammation is preceded by diminished E-cadherin expression and intestinal integrity","2019","Chronic intestinal inflammation contributes to pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. While the precise etiology remains controversial, IBD is believed to manifest as a result of various factors. We previously reported that intestinalspecific overexpression of the transcription factor Kaiso results in an intestinal inflammatory response; however, the cause of this inflammation is unknown. To elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) of the Kaiso-mediated intestinal inflammatory phenotype, we evaluated two independent transgenic mouse lines that express varying levels of Kaiso (KaisoTg). Histological analyses of KaisoTg mice revealed intestinal damage including thickening of the mucosa, intestinal ""lesions"" and crypt abscesses, which are reminiscent of IBD pathology. Additionally, higher Kaiso levels induced intestinal neutrophilia as early as 12 weeks, which worsened as the mice aged. Notably, the Kaiso-induced intestinal inflammation correlated with a leaky intestinal barrier and mis-regulation of E-cadherin expression and localization. Interestingly, Kaiso overexpression resulted in reduced proliferation but enhanced migration of intestinal epithelial cells prior to the onset of inflammation. Collectively, these data suggest that Kaiso plays a role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell integrity and function, dysregulation of which contributes to a chronic inflammatory phenotype as mice age. ? 2019 Robinson et al.

"Microvesicle proteomic profiling of uterine liquid biopsy for ovarian cancer early detection","2019","High-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) is the leading cause of mortality from gynecological malignancies, because of diagnosis at a metastatic stage. Current screening options fail to improve mortality because of the absence of early-stage-specific biomarkers. We postulated that a liquid biopsy, such as utero-tubal lavage (UtL), may identify localized lesions better than systemic approaches of serum/plasma analysis. Further, while mutation-based assays are challenged by the rarity of tumor DNA within nonmutated DNA, analyzing the proteomic profile, is expected to enable earlier detection, as it reveals perturbations in both the tumor as well as in its microenvironment. To attain deep proteomic coverage and overcome the high dynamic range of this body fluid, we applied our method for microvesicle proteomics to the UtL samples. Liquid biopsies from HGOC patients (n 49) and controls (n 127) were divided into a discovery and validation sets. Data-dependent analysis of the samples on the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer provided depth of 8578 UtL proteins in total, and on average 3000 proteins per sample. We used support vector machine algorithms for sample classification, and crossed three feature-selection algorithms, to construct and validate a 9-protein classifier with 70% sensitivity and 76.2% specificity. The signature correctly identified all Stage I lesions. These results demonstrate the potential power of microvesicle-based proteomic biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. ? 2019 Barnabas et al.

"Expressions of pro- and anti-vaccine sentiment on YouTube","2019","Billions of hours of YouTube content are viewed every day. Much of this content is aimed at entertainment, some of it is educational, and a considerable quantity is meant to influence or reinforce public opinion on a variety of matters, including health. Most of the content on YouTube is not created by professionals, public institutions or the traditional media, and instead is authored by private individual content creators. Given the potential impact of this medium for communicating health information, it is important for researchers and public health practitioners to understand the nature of health information as it is shared on YouTube. The primary objective of this research is to describe expressions of vaccine hesitancy content on YouTube, and specifically, compare the expression of pro- and anti-immunization sentiments. We do this by not only analyzing a systematic sample of influenza and measles immunization videos in terms of viewer analytics, but also by choice of language. We find that pro- and anti-immunization videos are common, but that videos with anti-immunization sentiment tend to be more ‘liked’. We also find that a small number of words can be effectively used to identify anti-immunization content, an observation that could be useful for identifying trends in anti-immunization sentiment on social media. Our results suggest that public health experts may need to increase the profile of their content on YouTube, and that there may be some useful strategies for improving the public's disposition towards pro-immunization messaging. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","influenza vaccine; measles vaccine; Article; controlled study; government; health care concepts; human; influenza vaccination; measles vaccination; medical information; population research; priority journal; social media; trend study; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; videorecording; web browser; YouTube"
"Landmark trials in thrombotic vascular disease: a critical appraisal of potential practice-changing trials in 2016–2017","2019","Recent years have witnessed an onslaught of large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials evaluating the prevention and management of thrombotic vascular diseases. While these trials have applied rigorous methodology to pragmatic and clinically relevant questions, several important gaps in knowledge remain. In this review, we critically appraise landmark studies in thrombosis published between 2016 and 2017 that address several ongoing areas of clinical uncertainty. Specifically, we review the role of endovascular therapy in the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome following acute lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (ATTRACT trial), the efficacy of edoxaban as the first direct oral anticoagulant used for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis (HOKUSAI VTE-Cancer study), whether aspirin can be considered for thromboprophylaxis post-major orthopedic surgery (EPCAT-2 trial), and the need for anticoagulant therapy for treatment of isolated distal DVT (CACTUS trial). Using illustrative cases, we highlight the applicability of these trials to current practice and emphasize the unanswered questions that remain. ? 2018, Societ?

"Previous experiences of pregnancy and early motherhood among women living with HIV: a latent class analysis","2019","Previous maternity experiences may influence subsequent reproductive intentions and motherhood experiences. We used latent class analysis to identify patterns of early motherhood experience reported for the most recent live birth of 905 women living with HIV enrolled in the Canadian HIV Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS). Four indicators were used: difficulties getting pregnant, feelings when finding out pregnancy, feelings during pregnancy, and feelings during the first year postpartum. Most (70.8%) pregnancies analyzed occurred before HIV diagnosis. A four-class maternity experience model was selected: “overall positive experience” (40%); “positive experience with postpartum challenges” (23%); “overall mixed experience” (14%); and “overall negative experience” (23%). Women represented in the “overall negative experience” class were more likely to be younger at delivery, to not know the HIV status of their pregnancy partner, and to report previous pregnancy termination. Women represented in the “positive experience with postpartum challenges” class were more likely to report previous miscarriage, stillbirth or ectopic pregnancy. We found no associations between timing of HIV diagnosis (before, during or after pregnancy) and experience patterns. Recognition of the different patterns of experiences can help providers offer a more adapted approach to reproductive counseling of women with HIV. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; aged; Article; Canada; cohort analysis; ectopic pregnancy; emotion; female; happiness; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; multicenter study; patient counseling; pattern recognition; pregnancy; pregnancy termination; priority journal; puerperium; questionnaire; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; unplanned pregnancy"
"Integrating mental health peer support in clinical settings: Lessons from Canada and Norway","2019","Mental health peer support is an evidence-based approach called for by Canada’s mental health strategy that presents health leaders with an opportunity to transform mental health service experiences, improve health outcomes, and lower overall system costs. Originally offered in community settings, peer support has been expanding to clinical settings, but challenges to integration exist. This qualitative case study of peer support in clinical settings in Canada and Norway examines the perceived value of peer support and change management strategies that health leaders, managers, staff, and peer support providers can use to support integration of peer support in existing healthcare teams in clinical settings. Recommended strategies for health leaders include adopting a gradual approach to integration, building champions, demonstrating value, focusing on resistant groups, adopting a continuous improvement approach, setting peer support as an organizational priority, and linking peer support to patient-centred care. ? 2019 The Canadian College of Health Leaders.","adult; article; Canada; change management; controlled study; human; leadership; manager; mental health service; Norway; patient care; peer group; staff; Canada; mental disease; mental health service; nonbiological model; Norway; organization and management; psychology; social support; Canada; Humans; Leadership; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Models, Organizational; Norway; Peer Group; Social Support"
"Comparative accuracy of typhoid diagnostic tools: A Bayesian latent-class network analysis","2019","Background Typhoid fevers are infections caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) and Paratyphi A, B and C (Salmonella Paratyphi). Approximately 17.8 million incident cases of typhoid fever occur annually, and incidence is highest in children. The accuracy of current diagnostic tests of typhoid fever is poorly understood. We aimed to determine the comparative accuracy of available tests for the pediatric population. Methods We first conducted a systematic literature review to identify studies that compared diagnostic tests for typhoid fever in children (aged ?15 years) to blood culture results. We applied a Bayesian latent-class extension to a network meta-analysis model. We modelled known diagnostic properties of bone marrow culture and the relationship between bone marrow and blood culture as informative priors in a Bayesian framework. We tested sensitivities for the proportion of negative blood samples that were false as well as bone marrow sensitivity and specificity. Results We found 510 comparisons from 196 studies and 57 specific to the pediatric population. IgM-based tests outperformed their IgG-based counterparts for ELISA and Typhidot tests. The lateral flow IgG test performed comparatively well with 92% sensitivity (72% to 98% across scenario analyses) and 94% specificity. The most sensitive test of those investigated for the South Asian pediatric population was the Reverse Passive Hemagglutination Assay with 99% sensitivity (98%-100% across scenario analyses). Adding a Widal slide test to other typhoid diagnostics did not substantially improve diagnostic performance beyond the single test alone, however, a lateral flow-based IgG rapid test combined with the typhoid/ paratyphoid (TPT) assay yielded improvements in sensitivity without substantial declines in specificity and was the best performing combination test in this setting. Conclusion In the pediatric population, lateral-flow IgG, TPT and Reverse Passive Hemagglutination tests had high diagnostic accuracy compared to other diagnostics. Combinations of tests may provide a feasible option to increase diagnostic sensitivity. South Asia has the most informed set of data on typhoid diagnostic testing accuracy, and the evidence base in other important regions needs to be expanded. ? 2019 Arora et al.","blood group H antigen; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; bacterium antibody; Article; blood culture; bone marrow biopsy; bone marrow culture; diagnostic accuracy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hemagglutination; human; immunoassay; meta analysis; paratyphoid fever; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; typhoid fever; adolescent; Bayes theorem; blood; child; comparative study; devices; diagnostic kit; diagnostic test; female; genetics; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; preschool child; procedures; typhoid fever; young adult; Adolescent; Antibodies, Bacterial; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Male; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; Salmonella typhi; Sensitivity and Specificity; Typhoid Fever; Young Adult"
"Reversal of the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor by simulated platelet transfusion","2019","BACKGROUND: Reversal of antiplatelet therapy is desirable in patients presenting with life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery. This study aimed to examine ticagrelor reversal using donor platelets and to explore the effects of residual ticagrelor on donor platelets. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In Cohort 1, 16 healthy subjects were treated with ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily alone or in combination with aspirin 100 mg once daily for 7 days followed by single blood sampling for preparation of platelet-rich plasma. An additional 16 healthy subjects served as controls. In Cohort 2, 16 healthy subjects were treated with ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for 7 days followed by serial blood samplings for preparation of platelet-poor plasma (PPP). An additional 16 healthy subjects served as controls. RESULTS: In Cohort 1, inhibition of adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation (PL ADP ) by ticagrelor could not be fully reversed by mixing with up to 90% control platelets, whereas inhibition of arachidonic acid–induced platelet aggregation by aspirin was fully reversed with the addition of 60% control platelets. In Cohort 2, 10% PPP obtained from ticagrelor-treated subjects reduced PL ADP from 74% to 40% at 2 hours, 72% to 58% at 6 hours, and 73% to 59% at 10 hours, while 10% or 20% PPP obtained from clopidogrel-treated subjects did not inhibit PL ADP . CONCLUSION: The antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor cannot be fully reversed by donor platelets, which could be explained by the presence of active drug. The effect of residual drug on donor platelets appears to be evident for at least 10 hours after ticagrelor ingestion. ? 2019 AABB","acetylsalicylic acid; adenosine diphosphate; arachidonic acid; clopidogrel; ticagrelor; adult; aged; antiplatelet effect reversal; Article; blood sampling; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; drug effect; female; human; human cell; human experiment; male; medical procedures; normal human; simulation; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte rich plasma; thrombocyte transfusion"
"Health promotion by International Olympic Sport Federations: Priorities and barriers","2019","To identify changes in International Federations' priorities and the barriers to implementing athlete and global health initiatives. Results should influence the work of the International Federation medical committees, the IOC and the Association of Summer Olympic International Federation. Methods The 28 Summer and 7 Winter International Federations participating in the most recent Olympic Games (2016; 2018) were surveyed to (i) identify the importance of 27 health topics, (ii) assess their progress on implementation health-related programmes and (iii) the barriers to implementation of these programmes. We compared International Federations' activities in 2016 and 2017. Results The response rate was 83%. Health topics which most International Federations regarded as important and in which the International Federations felt insufficiently active were a  team physician certification', a  prevention of harassment and abuse', a  eating disorders/disordered eating', a  mental health' and a  injury surveillance'. Compared with 2016, there was a decrease in International Federations' activities in a  injury surveillance', a  nutritional supplements' and a  hyperandrogenism'. The main barrier to implementing health-related programmes was a  International Federation political support/willingness', followed by a  knowledge'. a  Time' and a  coach support' were more often reported than a  finances', or a  IOC or Association of Summer Olympic International Federations partnership'. Conclusion If International Federations are going to promote health of athletes and global health promotion through physical activity (sport), International Federation leadership must change their focus and provide greater political support for related initiatives. Improving coach and athlete knowledge of the health issues could also facilitate health programme delivery. Time constraints could be mitigated by sharing experiences among the International Federations, Association of Summer Olympic International Federations and the IOC. International Federations should focus on those health-related topics that they identified as being important, yet rate as having insufficient activity. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

"Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America","2019","Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB. ?

"Frailty and risk of osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Data from the Ontario Biologics Research Initiative","2019","The evidence assessing the relationship between frailty and risk of adverse health outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains limited and sparse in the literature. Data from the Ontario Best Practices Research Initiative (OBRI), a clinical registry of patients with RA, were used to explore the relationship between frailty and fracture risk in patients with RA. Patients were referred to OBRI by their participating rheumatologist, and contacted by OBRI trained interviewers. Primary outcome was time to first incident osteoporotic fractures during follow-up that led to a hospitalization or emergency room visit. Frailty was measured by a Rockwood-type frailty index (FI) of deficit accumulation that consisted of 32 health-related deficits. To quantify the relationship between frailty and risk of fracture, we used Cox proportional hazards models with hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported. We included 2923 patients (mean age 57.7 standard deviation [SD]: 12.7; 78% female,) for analyses. During a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, there were 125 (4.3%) incident fractures reported. The FI was significantly higher in patients with a fracture compared to controls (0.24 vs. 0.20, p = 0.02). The FI was found to be significantly related to increased risk of fracture in the fully-adjusted models, with a HR of 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02–1.06, p < 0.001) and 1.58 (95% CI: 1.32–1.89, p < 0.001) for per-0.01 and per-SD increase in the FI respectively. In summary, our study demonstrates that higher frailty status is significantly related to increased risk of osteoporotic fractures in patients with RA. Quantifying the frailty status as a research tool may aid in fracture risk assessment, management and decision-making in RA. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; age; ankle fracture; Article; controlled study; disease duration; elbow fracture; emergency care; female; femur fracture; follow up; forearm fracture; fragility fracture; frailty; functional status assessment; gender; hip fracture; hospitalization; human; incidence; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; osteoporosis; pelvis fracture; proportional hazards model; register; rheumatoid arthritis; rib fracture; Rockwood type frailty index; shoulder fracture; spine fracture; wrist fracture"
"Seamless designs: Current practice and considerations for early-phase drug development in oncology","2019","Traditionally, drug development has evaluated dose, safety, activity, and comparative benefit in a sequence of phases using trial designs and endpoints specifically devised for each phase. Innovations in drug development seek to consolidate the phases and rapidly expand accrual with ""seamless"" trial designs. Although consolidation and rapid accrual may yield efficiencies, widespread use of seamless first-in-human (FiH) trials without careful consideration of objectives, statistical analysis plans, or trial oversight raises concerns. A working group formed by the National Cancer Institute convened to consider and discuss opportunities and challenges for such trials as well as encourage responsible use of these designs. We reviewed all abstracts presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings from 2010 to 2017 for FiH trials enrolling at least 100 patients. We identified 1786 early-phase trials enrolling 57 559 adult patients. Fifty-one of the trials (2.9%) investigated 50 investigational new drugs, were seamless, and accounted for 14.6% of the total patients. The seamless trials included a median of 3 (range = 1-13) expansion cohorts. The overall risk of clinically significant treatment-related adverse events (grade 3-4) was 49.1% (range = 0.0-100%), and seven studies reported at least one toxic death. Rapid expansion of FiH trials may lead to earlier drug approval and corresponding widespread patient access to active therapeutics.

"Cost-effectiveness of a collaborative dementia care management—Results of a cluster-randomized controlled trial","2019","Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of collaborative dementia care management (DCM). Methods: The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the data of 444 patients of a cluster-randomized, controlled trial, conceptualized to evaluate a collaborative DCM that aimed to optimize treatment and care in dementia. Health-care resource use, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY gained were measured over a 24-month time horizon. Results: DCM increased QALYs (+0.05) and decreased costs (?569) due to a lower hospitalization and a delayed institutionalization (7 months) compared with usual care. The probability of DCM being cost-effective was 88% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of 40,000 per QALY gained and higher in patients living alone compared to those not living alone (96% vs. 26%). Discussion: DCM is likely to be a cost-effective strategy in treating dementia and thus beneficial for public health-care payers and patients, especially for those living alone. ? 2019 The Authors","aged; Article; collaborative care team; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; Delphi study; dementia; female; follow up; health care cost; health care management; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; institutionalization; major clinical study; male; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; Willingness To Pay"
"Age-related deficits in intracortical myelination in young adults with bipolar disorder type I","2019","Background: Previous studies have implicated white-matter-related changes in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. However, most of what is known is derived from in vivo subcortical white-matter imaging or postmortem studies. In this study, we investigated wholebrain intracortical myelin (ICM) content in people with bipolar disorder type I and controls. Methods: Between Sept. 1, 2014, and Jan. 31, 2017, we used a 3 T General Electric scanner to collect T1-weighted images in 45 people with bipolar disorder type I and 60 controls aged 17 to 45 years using an optimized sequence that was sensitive to ICM content. We analyzed images using a surfacebased approach. We used general linear models with quadratic age terms to examine the signal trajectory of ICM across the age range. Results: In healthy controls, the T1-weighted signal followed an inverted-U trajectory over age; in people with bipolar disorder type I, the association between ICM and age followed a flat trajectory (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Exploratory analyses showed that ICM signal intensity was associated with duration of illness, age of onset, and anticonvulsant and antipsychotic use in people with bipolar disorder type I (p < 0.05, uncorrected). Limitations: Because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, we were unable to comment on whether the effects were due to dysmyelination or demyelination in bipolar disorder. Conclusion: This foundational study is, to our knowledge, the first to show global age-related deficits in ICM maturation throughout the cortex in bipolar disorder. Considering the impact of myelination on the maintenance of neural synchrony and the integrity of neural connections, this work may help us better understand the cognitive and behavioural deficits seen in bipolar disorder. ? 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors.","anticonvulsive agent; anxiolytic agent; lithium; adult; agoraphobia; alcoholism; anorexia nervosa; anterior cingulate; Article; bipolar disorder; body mass; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drug dependence; DSM-IV; female; human; hypomania; image analysis; male; myelination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; panic; posterior cingulate; psychosis; social phobia; white matter; young adult"
"Hiring, training, and supporting Peer Research Associates: Operationalizing community-based research principles within epidemiological studies by, with, and for women living with HIV","2019","BACKGROUND: A community-based research (CBR) approach is critical to redressing the exclusion of women-particularly, traditionally marginalized women including those who use substances-from HIV research participation and benefit. However, few studies have articulated their process of involving and engaging peers, particularly within large-scale cohort studies of women living with HIV where gender, cultural and linguistic diversity, HIV stigma, substance use experience, and power inequities must be navigated. METHODS: Through our work on the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS), Canada's largest community-collaborative longitudinal cohort of women living with HIV (n = 1422), we developed a comprehensive, regionally tailored approach for hiring, training, and supporting women living with HIV as Peer Research Associates (PRAs). To reflect the diversity of women with HIV in Canada, we initially hired 37 PRAs from British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, prioritizing women historically under-represented in research, including women who use or have used illicit drugs, and women living with HIV of other social identities including Indigenous, racialized, LGBTQ2S, and sex work communities, noting important points of intersection between these groups. RESULTS: Building on PRAs' lived experience, research capacity was supported through a comprehensive, multi-phase, and evidence-based experiential training curriculum, with mentorship and support opportunities provided at various stages of the study. Challenges included the following: being responsive to PRAs' diversity; ensuring PRAs' health, well-being, safety, and confidentiality; supporting PRAs to navigate shifting roles in their community; and ensuring sufficient time and resources for the translation of materials between English and French. Opportunities included the following: mutual capacity building of PRAs and researchers; community-informed approaches to study the processes and challenges; enhanced recruitment of harder-to-reach populations; and stronger community partnerships facilitating advocacy and action on findings. CONCLUSIONS: Community-collaborative studies are key to increasing the relevance and impact potential of research. For women living with HIV to participate in and benefit from HIV research, studies must foster inclusive, flexible, safe, and reciprocal approaches to PRA engagement, employment, and training tailored to regional contexts and women's lives.

"Characterization of the genital mucosa immune profile to distinguish phases of the menstrual cycle: Implications for HIV susceptibility","2019","Background Inflammation and immune activation are key factors in sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We sought to define the impact of hormonal cycling on the mucosal immune environment and HIV risk in sex workers with a natural menstrual cycle. Methods We compared soluble mucosal immune factors and cervical mononuclear cells during hormone titer-defined phases of the menstrual cycle among 37 sex workers from Nairobi, Kenya. Systemic and mucosal samples were collected 14 days apart to distinguish the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, and phases were confirmed by hormone measurements. Vaginal concentrations of 19 immune modulators and cervical T-cell activation markers were measured. Results The follicular phase signature was characterized by an elevated CCL2 level, decreased interleukin 1α and interleukin 1β cervical concentrations, and a significant increase in the proportion of CD4 + T cells that expressed CD69. The genital concentration of CCL2 was the best marker to distinguish the follicular from the luteal phase in univariate and multivariate analyses and remained independent of elevated genital inflammation and bacterial vaginosis. Conclusion The follicular phase of the menstrual cycle was associated with an elevated CCL2 level and retention of resident memory CD4+ T cells, which has implications for increased susceptibility to HIV infection. ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Real-world vs. randomized trial outcomes in similar populations of rivaroxaban-treated patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in ROCKET AF and XANTUS","2019","Aims Based on Phase III data, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are recommended for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. To determine whether trial outcomes translate into similar event rates in unselected patients, this analysis compared outcomes from the real-world XANTUS study with those from the Phase III ROCKET AF study. Methods and results Individual patient data from 4020 XANTUS patients were re-weighted to match the proportion of selected baseline characteristics in 7061 rivaroxaban-treated patients from ROCKET AF, using the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method. For the primary analysis, CHADS 2 scores and gender were selected as relevant variables. Adjusted annualized incidence rates for XANTUS were calculated and compared with incidence rates from ROCKET AF - the ratio of these rates ('MAIC ratio') was used as a relative effect estimate. Rates of major bleeding [3.10%/year vs. 3.60%/year; MAIC ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-1.12] and stroke/non-central nervous system systemic embolism (1.54%/year vs. 1.70%/year; MAIC ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.62-1.32) were similar between XANTUS and ROCKET AF. The rate of all-cause death was higher in XANTUS (3.22%/year vs. 1.87%/year; MAIC ratio 1.72; 95% CI 1.31-2.27), but the rates of vascular death were similar (1.83%/year vs. 1.53%/year; MAIC ratio 1.19; 95% CI 0.84-1.70). Sensitivity analyses weighted by different baseline characteristics supported these results. Conclusion The low rates of major bleeding and stroke in XANTUS were consistent with results from ROCKET AF. All-cause death, but not vascular death, was higher in XANTUS, as expected in an unselected real-world population. ? Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

"Monitoring Fidelity to an Evidence-Based Treatment: Practitioner Perspectives","2019","Despite the push to implement evidence-based treatment (EBT) in child and youth mental health service settings, few studies have focused on the optimal processes for adopting and sustaining EBTs in these contexts. There is even less evidence regarding practitioner perspectives on the optimal processes for sustaining fidelity to EBTs in practice, despite unequivocal evidence linking the importance of practitioner fidelity to intervention outcomes. Following the principles of inductive qualitative inquiry, this study examined practitioner perspectives of fidelity monitoring processes within the context of implementing motivational interviewing (MI) in four community-based child and youth mental health organizations. MI is a widely disseminated EBT that supports behavior change among adolescents and adults living with psychological, alcohol, and substance use challenges. Practitioners (n = 22) completed semi-structured, qualitative focus groups that elicited their perceptions of the processes and supports provided to support fidelity to MI practice throughout the implementation project. Conventional content analysis revealed a number of important contextual, practitioner, and client factors that have the potential to support or deter the embedding of fidelity processes on the front lines. In addition, practitioners spoke of the importance of using a brief, straightforward fidelity-checking tool to support practitioner learning and practice in relation to MI. Findings have implications for supporting sustained practitioner fidelity to EBTs in settings where MI may constitute one of many possible treatments offered by practitioners in community-based mental health services. Findings also have implications for sustaining practitioner fidelity to EBTs more broadly. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",""
"A Monoclonal Antibody Against β1 Integrin Inhibits Proliferation and Increases Survival in an Orthotopic Model of High-Grade Meningioma","2019","Background: High-grade meningiomas (HGMs; World Health Organization [WHO] classification grade II and III) have high relapse rates and poor clinical outcomes despite surgery and radiation treatments. No effective medical therapy currently exists for HGMs, and developing novel therapeutic strategies depends on the identification of molecular drivers. In cancer, β1 integrin enhances malignant characteristics, including proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. Objective: We conducted this study to investigate whether β1 integrin could be a therapeutic target in HGMs. Patients and Methods: Expression of β1 integrin was examined in gene array datasets, with proteomics of clinical meningioma specimens, and in patient-derived HGM xenografts. Anti-tumor activity of OS2966, a first-in-class humanized antagonizing monoclonal antibody against β1 integrin, was tested in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of patient-derived malignant meningioma. Results: β1 integrin was expressed in meningiomas of all WHO grades and two xenografts tested. In vitro, OS2966 suppressed the viability of NF2-deficient MN3 sphere cells and NF2-wild-type IOMM-Lee malignant meningioma cells only when plated on laminin-coated plastic. While OS2966 decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both MN3 cells and laminin-grown IOMM-Lee cells, OS2966 only affected the phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr397) in MN3, and of Akt (Ser473) in IOMM-Lee cells, respectively, indicating differential pathway inhibition. Systemic administration of OS2966 in mice bearing orthotopic MN3 HGMs inhibited HGM cell proliferation and significantly extended overall survival of the treated mice. Conclusions: β1 Integrin may be a therapeutic target in HGMs, and further preclinical and clinical development of OS2966 for HGM therapy is warranted. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","antineoplastic agent; beta1 integrin; epithelial membrane antigen; focal adhesion kinase; Ki 67 antigen; laminin; lymphocyte antibody; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; os 2966; transcriptome; unclassified drug; vimentin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer grading; cancer survival; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug targeting; enzyme phosphorylation; female; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; intracellular signaling; malignant meningioma; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; RNA analysis"
"Genome-wide association analyses of risk tolerance and risky behaviors in over 1 million individuals identify hundreds of loci and shared genetic influences","2019","Humans vary substantially in their willingness to take risks. In a combined sample of over 1 million individuals, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance, adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general risk tolerance. We report evidence of substantial shared genetic influences across risk tolerance and the risky behaviors: 46 of the 99 general risk tolerance loci contain a lead SNP for at least one of our other GWAS, and general risk tolerance is genetically correlated (∣r? g∣ ~ 0.25 to 0.50) with a range of risky behaviors. Bioinformatics analyses imply that genes near SNPs associated with general risk tolerance are highly expressed in brain tissues and point to a role for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We found no evidence of enrichment for genes previously hypothesized to relate to risk tolerance. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","adult; article; bioinformatics; brain tissue; controlled study; drinking; female; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; high risk behavior; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; neurotransmission; risk assessment; smoking; behavior; behavior genetics; case control study; gene locus; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; meta analysis; physiology; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; Behavior; Case-Control Studies; Female; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetics, Behavioral; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"
"A randomised controlled trial assessing the use of citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine and mirtazapine in preventing relapse in primary care patients who are taking long-term maintenance antidepressants (ANTLER: ANTidepressants to prevent reLapse in dEpRession): Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","2019","Background: Antidepressants are used both for treating acute episodes and for prophylaxis to prevent future episodes of depression, also called maintenance treatment. This article describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (ANTLER: ANTidepressants to prevent reLapse in dEpRession) to investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in UK primary care of continuing on long-term maintenance antidepressants compared with a placebo in preventing relapse of depression in those who have taken antidepressants for more than 9 months and who are currently well enough to consider stopping maintenance treatment. Methods/design: The ANTLER trial is an individually randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants are randomised to remain on active medication or to take an identical placebo after a tapering period of 2 months. Eligible participants are those who: are between the ages of 18 and 74 years; have had at least two episodes of depression; and have been taking antidepressants for 9 months or more and are currently taking citalopram 20 mg, sertraline 100 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg or mirtazapine 30 mg but are well enough to consider stopping their medication. The participants will be followed up at 6, 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. The primary outcome will be the time in weeks to the beginning of the first episode of depression after randomisation. This will be measured using a retrospective version of the Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised administered at 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include depressive and anxiety symptoms, adverse effects, withdrawal symptoms, emotional processing tasks, quality of life and the resources and costs used. We will also perform a cost-effectiveness analysis based on results of the trial. Discussion: The ANTLER trial findings will inform primary care prescribing practice by providing a valid and generalisable estimate of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of long-term maintenance treatment with antidepressants in UK primary care.

"Statins promote interleukin-1β-dependent adipocyte insulin resistance through lower prenylation, not cholesterol","2019","Statins lower cholesterol and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but this drug class increases diabetes risk. Statins are generally anti-inflammatory. However, statins can promote inflammasome-mediated adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance through an unidentified immune effector. Statins lower mevalonate pathway intermediates beyond cholesterol, but it is unknown whether lower cholesterol underpins statin-mediated insulin resistance. We sought to define the mevalonate pathway metabolites and immune effectors that propagate statin-induced adipose insulin resistance. We found that LDL cholesterol lowering was dispensable, but statin-induced lowering of isoprenoids required for protein prenylation triggered NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-dependent insulin resistance in adipose tissue. Multiple statins impaired insulin action at the level of Akt/protein kinase B signaling in mouse adipose tissue. Providing geranylgeranyl isoprenoids or inhibiting caspase-1 prevented statin-induced defects in insulin signaling. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) impaired insulin signaling in adipose tissue from wild-type and IL-18-/- mice, but not IL-1β-/- mice. Atorvastatin decreased cell-autonomous insulin-stimulated lipogenesis but did not alter lipolysis or glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results show that statin lowering of prenylation isoprenoids activates caspase-1/IL-1β inflammasome responses that impair endocrine control of adipocyte lipogenesis. This may allow the targeting of cholesterol-independent statin side effects on adipose lipid handling without compromising the blood lipid/ cholesterol-lowering effects of statins. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","atorvastatin; cholesterol; cryopyrin; insulin; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; isoprenoid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; mevalonic acid; protein kinase B; zoledronic acid; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; adipose tissue; Akt signaling; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; glucose transport; insulin resistance; lipogenesis; lipolysis; male; mouse; neuroendocrine regulation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein prenylation; wild type"
"Predicting West Nile virus transmission in North American bird communities using phylogenetic mixed effects models and eBird citizen science data","2019","Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted disease of birds that has caused bird population declines and can spill over into human populations. Previous research has identified bird species that infect a large fraction of the total pool of infected mosquitoes and correlate with human infection risk; however, these analyses cover small spatial regions and cannot be used to predict transmission in bird communities in which these species are rare or absent. Here we present a mechanistic model for WNV transmission that predicts WNV spread (R0) in any bird community in North America by scaling up from the physiological responses of individual birds to transmission at the level of the community. We predict unmeasured bird species' responses to infection using phylogenetic imputation, based on these species' phylogenetic relationships with bird species with measured responses. Results: We focused our analysis on Texas, USA, because it is among the states with the highest total incidence of WNV in humans and is well sampled by birders in the eBird database. Spatio-temporal patterns: WNV transmission is primarily driven by temperature variation across time and space, and secondarily by bird community composition. In Texas, we predicted WNV R0 to be highest in the spring and fall when temperatures maximize the product of mosquito transmission and survival probabilities. In the most favorable months for WNV transmission (April, May, September and October), we predicted R0 to be highest in the ""Piney Woods"" and ""Oak Woods &amp; Prairies"" ecoregions of Texas, and lowest in the ""High Plains"" and ""South Texas Brush County"" ecoregions. Dilution effect: More abundant bird species are more competent hosts for WNV, and predicted WNV R0 decreases with increasing species richness. Keystone species: We predicted that northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) are the most important hosts for amplifying WNV and that mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) are the most important sinks of infection across Texas. Conclusions: Despite some data limitations, we demonstrate the power of phylogenetic imputation in predicting disease transmission in heterogeneous host communities. Our mechanistic modeling framework shows promise both for assisting future analyses on transmission and spillover in heterogeneous multispecies pathogen systems and for improving model transparency by clarifying assumptions, choices and shortcomings in complex ecological analyses. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; bird; Cardinalis cardinalis; controlled study; environmental temperature; falling; genetic heterogeneity; host pathogen interaction; incidence; nonhuman; North American; phylogeny; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; species composition; species richness; spring; survival analysis; Texas; virus transmission; West Nile virus; Zenaida macroura; animal; biological model; bird; bird disease; epidemiology; mosquito; North America; phylogeny; physiology; season; veterinary medicine; virology; West Nile fever; West Nile virus; Animals; Bird Diseases; Birds; Citizen Science; Culicidae; Models, Biological; North America; Phylogeny; Seasons; Texas; West Nile Fever; West Nile virus"
"Detecting Stem Cell Marker Expression Using the NanoString nCounter System","2019","The use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has become commonplace in the study of neuronal development, physiology, disease modelling, and therapy development. Due to the transient nature of working with these cells, it is important to regularly confirm the cell status as a naive stem cell versus a more defined neural progenitor cell (NPC). Classically, this has been done using a panel of specific antibodies to test for the expression of transcription factors known to be observed in ESCs, but not NPCs. However, this method is both time consuming and expensive. Here, we describe the use of the NanoString nCounter system for determining the levels of expression of key transcription factors that will effectively aid in determining the state of your stem cell cultures. ?

"Muscular and kinematic adaptations to fatiguing repetitive upper extremity work","2019","Repetitive work is common in the modern workplace and the effects are often studied using fatigue protocols; however, there is evidence that the manner in which fatigue develops impacts the kinematic and muscular response to reduced physical capacity. The purpose of this study was to simultaneously evaluate muscular and kinematic adaptations during fatiguing, repetitive work until exhaustion. We measured muscle activity in 13 muscles in the shoulder and trunk, and captured full body kinematics while participants completed simulated, repetitive work tasks. Every 12 min, reference data were collected to quantify fatigue. This sequence continued until they reached the termination criteria. Participants displayed significant signs of muscle fatigue, loss of strength and increased perceived fatigue (p < 0.05). Analysis revealed a significant effect of time on posture and muscle activity that was both task and time dependent, and variable both between and within individuals. Participants were able to compensate for reduced physical capacity and maintain task performance through coordinated compensation strategies. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fatigue of materials; Muscle; Shoulders (road); Compensation strategy; Loss of strength; Muscle activities; Repetitive works; Task performance; Termination criteria; Upper extremity; Variability; Kinematics; adaptation; adult; Article; compensation; controlled study; exhaustion; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; muscle contraction; muscle fatigue; muscle strength; normal human; physical capacity; shoulder muscle; skeletal muscle; task performance; upper limb; workplace; biomechanics; cumulative trauma disorder; muscle fatigue; occupational disease; pathophysiology; physiology; shoulder; trunk; upper limb; work; young adult; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cumulative Trauma Disorders; Humans; Male; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle, Skeletal; Occupational Diseases; Shoulder; Task Performance and Analysis; Torso; Upper Extremity; Work; Young Adult"
"EPH Profiling of BTIC Populations in Glioblastoma Multiforme Using CyTOF","2019","The ability to elucidate the phenotype of brain tumor initiating cell (BTIC) in the context of bulk tumor in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) provides significant therapeutic benefits for therapeutic evaluation. For the identification of such an elusive and rare subpopulation of cells, a single cell analysis technology with deep profiling capabilities known as Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) can prove to be highly useful. CyTOF circumvents the spectral overlap limitations of traditional flow cytometry by replacing fluorophores with metal isotope tags, allowing the accurate detection of significantly more parameters at the same time. In this chapter, we demonstrate that synthetic antibodies can be conjugated with metal isotope tags for CyTOF analysis, resulting in the development of a highly tailored, custom multi-parameter panel. This toolset was used to stain patient-derived GBM cells, which was analyzed via CyTOF. Analysis software viSNE and SPADE were applied to study the co-expression patterns of the Eph Receptor (EphR) family and several putative BTIC markers in GBM, resulting in the identification of a distinct group of cells consistent with a BTIC subpopulation. This approach can be readily adapted to the detection of cancer stem-like cells in other cancer types. ?

"Spinning, hurting, still, afraid: Living life spaces with Type I Chiari Malformation","2019","Human geography's varied engagement with the brain has involved considerations of the way people know and respond to their environments, and their place-based experiences with emotions, mental illnesses and disorders, intellectual disabilities and particular neurological conditions. This paper argues however that this scholarship could be augmented by, and existing expertise be directed towards, considering physical brain abnormalities and injuries. As a case in point it considers the spatial experience of living with Type 1 Chiari Malformation. Through interviews with four sufferers, the research articulates three domains that they have had to re-negotiate - home space, social space and medical space - emphasizing supportive and challenging aspects of each, as well as meaningful and affective qualities to encounters. The paper concludes with some pointers towards the future study of physical brain abnormalities and injuries and the kinds of knowledge it might create to increase awareness and inform care. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","brain; human geography; injury; spatial variation; Arnold Chiari malformation; Article; awareness; clinical feature; human; patient care; prevalence; quality of life; risk factor"
"Variation in Teachers’ Reported Use of Classroom Management and Behavioral Health Strategies by Grade Level","2019","Teachers’ use of evidence-informed classroom management and behavioral health strategies may improve student behavior and classroom function. However, little is known about the extent to which teachers employ various strategies and whether strategy use varies across grades. This study aimed to determine the frequency distribution of reported use of a range of strategies in a large representative sample of teachers in Ontario, Canada, and their variation across grades (junior kindergarten to grade twelve). The teacher survey contained strategies derived from a positive behavior support questionnaire (PBSQ) and a behavioral health questionnaire (EIBHQ), eight items each. Among the PBSQ items, completed by 3004 teachers, “Expected student behaviors and routines are taught directly” was the most frequently endorsed at the “always” level (60.5%), while “Rewards are varied to maintain student interest” was the least at this same level (30.6%). Among the EIBHQ items, completed by 2801 teachers, “Provided social rewards, such as praise, encouragement, and affection, to promote desired behaviors” was the most frequently endorsed at the “daily” level (71.1%), while “Taught the student to solve problems by outlining steps, such as identifying the problem, generating multiple solutions, and selecting the best alternative” was the least frequently endorsed (24.8%). For all items, frequency of endorsement significantly decreased with increasing grade level suggesting that students in higher grades are less likely to be exposed to this particular group of strategies. Additional studies are required that incorporate a wider range of teacher strategies and verify patterns with observational data. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","article; human; human experiment; kindergarten; Ontario; praise; questionnaire; reward; student; teacher"
"Changes in the Prevalence of Child and Youth Mental Disorders and Perceived Need for Professional Help between 1983 and 2014: Evidence from the Ontario Child Health Study [Changements de la pr?valence des troubles mentaux des enfants et des adolescents et du besoin per?u d'aide professionnelle entre 1983 et 2014 : donn?es probantes de l' ?tude sur la sant? des jeunes Ontariens]","2019","Objectives: To examine: 1) changes in the prevalence of mental disorders and perceived need for professional help among children (ages 4 to 11) and youth (ages 12 to 16) between 1983 and 2014 in Ontario and 2) whether these changes vary by age and sex, urban-rural residency, poverty, lone-parent status, and immigrant background. Methods: The 1983 (n = 2836) and 2014 (n = 5785) Ontario Child Health Studies are provincially representative cross-sectional surveys with identical self-report checklist measures of conduct disorder, hyperactivity, and emotional disorder, as well as perceived need for professional help, assessed by integrating parent and teacher responses (ages 4 to 11) and parent and youth responses (ages 12 to 16). Results: The overall prevalence of perceived need for professional help increased from 6.8% to 18.9% among 4- to 16-year-olds. An increase in any disorder among children (15.4% to 19.6%) was attributable to increases in hyperactivity among males (8.9% to 15.7%). Although the prevalence of any disorder did not change among youth, conduct disorder decreased (7.2% to 2.5%) while emotional disorder increased (9.2% to 13.2%). The prevalence of any disorder increased more in rural and small to medium urban areas versus large urban areas. The prevalence of any disorder decreased for children and youth in immigrant but not nonimmigrant families. Conclusions: Although there have been decreases in the prevalence of conduct disorder, increases in other mental disorders and perceived need for professional help underscore the continued need for effective prevention and intervention programs. ?

"Improving the adoption of optimal venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in critically ill patients: A process evaluation of a complex quality improvement initiative","2019","Purpose: This study evaluated a complex initiative to increase evidence-based use of low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis among adult medical-surgical ICU patients. Materials and methods: This study included: quantitative survey and interviews. Participants were healthcare providers within four ICUs. Surveys collected knowledge of evidence underpinning best practice, exposure to the implementation strategies and their perceived utility, and recommendations. The interview expanded on survey topics. Descriptive statistics summarized the data and chi-squared tests were used to compare groups. Qualitative data were analyzed using a blended deductive and inductive coding approach. Results: Providers had good knowledge of the evidence (range = 58% to 94%). Pharmacist-to-physician reminders (80%), other reminders (50%), and local guidelines (50%) were the most commonly observed strategies. Local champions (76%), on-site education (74%), and computerized decision support system (69%) were perceived to be most helpful. Interviews elicited five themes: provider roles, perceptions of the implementation strategies, facilitators and barriers to uptake of best practice, and recommendations. Assessment of the implementation strategies varied by professional group. Conclusions: The findings of this process evaluation identified implementation strategies that can improve the use of evidence-informed practices, help interpret outcomes in the context of interventions and guide future quality improvement initiatives. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","low molecular weight heparin; Article; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; critically ill patient; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; evidence based medicine; health education; human; intensive care unit; practice guideline; quantitative analysis; thrombosis prevention; venous thromboembolism"
"DNA Repair signaling of huntingtin: The next link between late-onset neurodegenerative disease and oxidative DNA damage","2019","A new hypothesis for the mechanism of Huntington's disease (HD) is driven by a small molecule lead that may connect age-associated reactive oxygen stress, oxidative DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These pathways have also recently been defined in genome-wide association studies of cytosine-adenine-guanine-expansion polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases, including HD and the spinocerebellar ataxias. We discuss how N6-furfuryladenine (N6FFA) nucleotide salvage and role as a kinase neosubstrate may have important mechanistic implications for both HD and familial Parkinson's disease. N6FFA highlights a mechanism of how energy dysregulation and protein misfolding in neurodegeneration may be the effect of age-associated reactive oxygen species damage to DNA and part of a feedback loop augmenting with aging. ? 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","adenine; cytosine; guanine; huntingtin; kinetin; phosphotransferase; PINK1 protein; polyglutamine; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; HTT protein, human; huntingtin; aging; Article; bioenergy; degenerative disease; DNA damage; DNA repair; energy metabolism; enzyme substrate; feedback system; genome-wide association study; human; Huntington chorea; mitochondrion; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Parkinson disease; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein misfolding; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; spinocerebellar degeneration; animal; degenerative disease; genetics; metabolism; oxidative stress; signal transduction; Animals; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Humans; Huntingtin Protein; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Oxidative Stress; Signal Transduction"
"Utilizing public health core competencies to share data effectively with community organizations to promote health equity","2019","Objectives: This article utilizes an adapted model for research transfer to highlight the important role of Local Public Health Agencies (LPHAs) to share data more effectively with local community organizations to advance health equity. Methods: A literature review related to public health data sharing with local community partners was conducted using Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases and grey literature sources with 12 articles included for analysis. Six LPHAs distributed an online survey to 405 local community organizations to define their current data uses and needs. Survey and literature review findings informed a one-day deliberative dialogue event with 19 participants who brought multiple perspectives together on the barriers and potential solutions for data sharing. Results: Results are discussed utilizing the three stages of data sharing: awareness, communication, and collaboration. Awareness of the barriers and needs of community partners related to data, and the public health core competency of assessment and analysis is the first stage. More effective is the second stage, where LPHAs proactively communicate to understand and meet the needs of community partners. Data sharing is the most effective when LPHAs use the third stage of collaboration to work with community partners to mutually benefit from data sharing. Conclusion: When LPHAs utilize their core competencies of assessment and analysis, communication, and collaboration to share data with community partners, they are able to share data more effectively. This allows community partners to modify programs to better serve priority populations and improve population health. ? 2019, The Canadian Public Health Association.","adult; article; awareness; Cinahl; Embase; female; grey literature; health equity; human; human experiment; male; Medline; population health; public health; systematic review; Canada; community care; health equity; information dissemination; organization and management; professional competence; public relations; questionnaire; Canada; Community Networks; Health Equity; Humans; Information Dissemination; Interinstitutional Relations; Professional Competence; Public Health; Surveys and Questionnaires"

"The role of sphingosine kinase 2 in alcoholic liver disease","2019","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the most common liver diseases worldwide. However, the exact mechanisms underlying ALD remain unclear. Previous studies reported that sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) plays an essential role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. In the current study, we demonstrate that compared to wild-type (WT) mice, SphK2 deficient (SphK2?/?) mice exhibited a greater degree of liver injury and hepatic lipid accumulation after feeding with an alcohol diet for 60 days. This is accompanied by a down-regulation of steroid 7-alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7b1) and an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (Tnfα, F4/80, Il-1β). In vitro experiments showed that alcohol induced SphK2 expression in mouse primary hepatocytes and cultured mouse macrophages. Furthermore, alcohol feeding induced a more severe intestinal barrier dysfunction in SphK2?/? mice than WT mice. Deficiency of SphK2 impaired the growth of intestinal organoids. Finally, SphK2 expression levels were down-regulated in the livers of human patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma compared to healthy controls. In summary, these findings suggest that SphK2 is a crucial regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism and that modulating the SphK2-mediated signaling pathway may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ALD and other metabolic liver diseases. ? 2019","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; actin; alcohol; biological marker; cholesterol 7alpha monooxygenase; collagen type 1; cytokine receptor; egf like module containing mucin like hormone receptor like 1; fatty acid synthase; fibronectin; interleukin 10 receptor; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 22; interleukin 22 receptor; lipid; messenger RNA; protein; RNA H19; sphingosine kinase 2; steroid 17alpha monooxygenase; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; alcohol consumption; alcohol liver cirrhosis; alcohol liver disease; alcoholic fatty liver; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activity; female; gene expression regulation; human; in vitro study; inflammation; intestine function; intestine mucosa permeability; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver injury; macrophage culture; male; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; organ growth; organoid; primary cell; priority journal; protein expression level; RAW 264.7 cell line; signal transduction; strain difference; upregulation; wild type mouse"
"Reporting Guidelines for Imaging Research","2019","Suboptimal reporting in the publication of imaging research studies is a growing concern. Deficient and incomplete reporting prevents the evaluation of the validity, replicability, and the overall quality of the research. Reporting guidelines are checklists designed to guide researchers about the minimum information to be provided in research studies to allow for adequate quality appraisal and to assess generalizability. They are a powerful tool to allow key stakeholders such as journal editors, peer reviewers, funding agencies, and readers to better identify robust health research. The Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency of Health Research Network is an international initiative that attempts to improve the reporting practices of a variety of health research study designs by providing the resources required to develop, disseminate, and implement reporting guidelines. In this review, we elaborate on the impact of good reporting on imaging research, and the different types of guidelines relevant for the various study designs applicable in imaging research. ? 2018","article; checklist; editor; funding; human; human experiment; medical research; practice guideline; publication; scientist; validity; clinical trial (topic); diagnostic imaging; methodology; Clinical Trials as Topic; Diagnostic Imaging; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Research Design; Systematic Reviews as Topic"
"The Vancouver 3M (Multidisciplinary, Multimodality, But Minimalist) Clinical Pathway Facilitates Safe Next-Day Discharge Home at Low-, Medium-, and High-Volume Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Centers: The 3M TAVR Study","2019","Objectives: The authors sought to prospectively determine the safety and efficacy of next-day discharge using the Vancouver 3M (Multidisciplinary, Multimodality, but Minimalist) Clinical Pathway. Background: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgery in high- and intermediate-risk patients; however, hospital stays average at least 6 days in most trials. The Vancouver 3M Clinical Pathway is focused on next-day discharge, made possible by the use of objective screening criteria as well as streamlined peri- and post-procedural management guidelines. Methods: Patients were enrolled from 6 low-volume (<100 TAVR/year), 4 medium-volume, and 3 high-volume (>200 TAVR/year) centers in Canada and the United States. The primary outcomes were a composite of all-cause death or stroke by 30 days and the proportion of patients successfully discharged home the day following TAVR. Results: Of 1,400 screened patients, 411 were enrolled at 13 centers and received a SAPIEN XT (58.2%) or SAPIEN 3 (41.8%) valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California). In centers enrolling exclusively in the study, 55% of screened patients were enrolled. The median age was 84 years (interquartile range: 78 to 87 years) with a median STS score of 4.9% (interquartile range: 3.3% to 6.8%). Next-day discharge home was achieved in 80.1% of patients, and within 48 h in 89.5%. The composite of all-cause mortality or stroke by 30 days occurred in 2.9% (95% confidence interval: 1.7% to 5.1%), with neither component of the primary outcome affected by hospital TAVR volume (p = 0.51). Secondary outcomes at 30 days included major vascular complication 2.4% (n = 10), readmission 9.2% (n = 36), cardiac readmission 5.7% (n = 22), new permanent pacemaker 5.7% (n = 23), and >mild paravalvular regurgitation 3.8% (n = 15). Conclusions: Adherence to the Vancouver 3M Clinical Pathway at low-, medium-, and high-volume TAVR centers allows next-day discharge home with excellent safety and efficacy outcomes. ? 2019","aged; all cause mortality; Article; Canada; cerebrovascular accident; clinical pathway; feasibility study; female; heart valve regurgitation; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; Society of Thoracic Surgeons score; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; United States"
"Assessment of the visual function of partially sighted and blind Canadian youth using the VFQ-25 questionnaire: a preliminary study","2019","Objective: Young people are a relatively underrepresented group in literature on poor vision and blindness. This study assessed the quality of life and function of young people who have poor vision or blindness by asking directly about their personal experiences. Methods: A modified version of the VFQ-25 was administered to 47 students at a school for blind youth. All students who received the test had visual acuity scores of 20/100 or worse. The VFQ-25 scoring system was used, and results from additional qualitative questions were themed and ranked. Further analysis was performed, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to check for correlation between duration of blindness and VFQ score. Results: Participants recorded a composite VFQ score of 65, showing that poor vision had a self-perceived moderate effect on their daily function. Proportion of participant's life spent with visual impairment correlated with higher composite scores. In general, lower scores were reported by participants with worse visual acuity. However, variations were observed in the mental health category. Conclusions: Young people have a more optimistic and nuanced view of their function than expected based on VFQ scores of other groups. Larger studies, particularly ones including youth in non-specialized schools would be useful to expand these findings. ? 2019 Canadian Ophthalmological Society","adolescent; adult; Article; blindness; child; clinical article; female; human; male; mental health; National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire; personal experience; quality of life; student; vision; visual acuity; visual impairment"
"Gelatin tannate for acute diarrhoea and gastroenteritis in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2020","To determine the effectiveness and safety of gelatin tannate (GT) for reducing the duration of the acute diarrhoea and gastroenteritis (ADG) in children. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, LILACS and grey literature, published from inception to October 2018. No language restrictions. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials in children with ADG, comparing GT with placebo. Results Of 797 titles identified, we included three studies (276 children). We performed a random effects model meta-analysis for the main outcome (diarrhoea duration). We did not find significant differences between GT and placebo for diarrhoea duration (mean difference (MD)=-15.85 hours; 95% CI -42.24 to 14.82, I 2 =92%; three studies), stool frequency at day 2 (MD=0.11 stools/day; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.62: I 2 =26%; two studies), diarrhoea at day 3 (risk ratio [RR]=0.46; 95% CI 0.06 to 3.47: I 2 =73%; two studies), vomiting (RR=1.31; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.80: I 2 =0%; two studies) or adverse events (RR=0.86; 95% CI 0.27 to 2.66: I 2 =0%; two studies). Most common adverse events included abdominal pain and nausea. Conclusion The effect of GT was no different to placebo for mean diarrhoea duration (low certainty on the evidence) and stool frequency at day 2 (high certainty) and for the presence of diarrhoea at day 3 (very low certainty) of vomiting (moderate certainty) and of adverse events (low certainty).

"Measuring Public Preferences for Health Outcomes and Expenditures in a Context of Healthcare Resource Re-Allocation","2019","Background: The final outcome of any resource allocation decision in healthcare cannot be determined in advance. Thus, decision makers, in deciding which new program to implement (or not), need to accommodate the uncertainty of different potential outcomes (i.e., change in both health and costs) that can occur, the size and nature (i.e., ‘bad’ or ‘good’) of these outcomes, and how they are being valued. Using the decision-making plane, which explicitly incorporates opportunity costs and relaxes the assumptions of perfect divisibility and constant returns to scale of the cost-effectiveness plane, all the potential outcomes of each resource allocation decision can be described. Objective: In this study, we describe the development and testing of an instrument, using a discrete choice experiment methodology, allowing the measurement of public preferences for potential outcomes falling in different quadrants of the decision-making plane. Method: In a sample of 200 participants providing 4200 observations, we compared four versions of the preference-elicitation instrument using a range of indicators. Results: We identified one version that was well accepted by the participants and with good measurement properties. Conclusion: This validated instrument can now be used in a larger representative sample to study the preferences of the public for potential outcomes stemming from re-allocation of healthcare resources. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","adult; article; controlled study; decision making; female; human; human experiment; human tissue; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment"
"The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials","2019","Vitamin D has received attention for its potential to disrupt cancer processes. However, its effect in the treatment of prostate cancer is controversial. This study aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on patients with prostate cancer. In the present study, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched up to September 2017 for trials that evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on prostate specific antigen (PSA) response, mortality, and its possible side effects in participants with prostate cancer. The DerSimonian and Laird inverse-weighted random-effects model was used to pool the effect estimates. Twenty-two studies (16 before-after and 6 randomized controlled trials) were found and included in the meta-analysis. The analysis of controlled clinical trials revealed that PSA change from baseline [weighted mean difference (WMD)=-1.66 ng/ml, 95% CI: -0.69, 0.36, p=0.543)], PSA response proportion (RP=1.18, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.45, p=0.104) and mortality rate (risk ratio (RR)=1.05, 95% CI: 0.81-1.36; p=0.713) were not significantly different between vitamin D supplementation and placebo groups. Single arm trials revealed that vitamin D supplementation had a modest effect on PSA response proportion: 19% of those enrolled had at least a 50% reduction in PSA by the end of treatment (95% CI: 7% to 31%; p=0.002). Although before-after studies showed that vitamin D increases the PSA response proportion, it does not seem that patients with prostate cancer benefit from high dose vitamin D supplementation and it should not be recommended for the treatment. ? 2019 Georg Thieme.","alfacalcidol; calcitriol; carboplatin; dexamethasone; docetaxel; ergocalciferol; mitoxantrone; naproxen; paricalcitol; prostate specific antigen; vitamin D; zoledronic acid; prostate specific antigen; vitamin D; ageusia; anemia; Article; cancer mortality; diarrhea; drug effect; dyspnea; fatigue; human; hypercalcemia; hyperglycemia; leukopenia; meta analysis; mortality rate; nausea; neutropenia; priority journal; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; vitamin supplementation; analysis; blood; clinical trial (topic); dietary supplement; male; mortality; prostate tumor; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Male; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Vitamin D"

"The experiences of workers who do not successfully return to work following a work-related injury","2019","Background: A minority of workers with work-related injuries experience challenges returning to work. While factors that hinder return-to-work (RTW) are well-documented, the consequences of failing to successfully return to work on the lives of workers who have experienced a workplace injury remain poorly understood. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of workers who do not successfully return to work following a work-related injury. Methods: Using an interpretive approach to qualitative research and maximal variability sampling, 11 workers who have sustained work-related injuries without a successful RTW and four service providers were recruited through community organizations. Participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. A constant comparative approach was used to identify key themes across the worker and service provider experiences. Results: The findings that emerged from the analysis capture the challenging RTW experiences of workers and describe wide ranging impacts on their lives when their workers' compensation claims are denied or discontinued, including ongoing financial strain, family tensions, subsequent health concerns, and negative employment experiences. The findings also highlight the negative consequences of existing cost-cutting frameworks that can restrict entitlement and benefits for many people with disabilities. Conclusions: The findings from this study highlight the experiences of workers who might need additional supports throughout the RTW process, and begin to shed light on the impact on their lives when RTW is not successful. ? 2018 IOS Press and the authors.

"Bim escapes displacement by BH3- mimetic anti-cancer drugs by double-bolt locking both Bcl-XL and Bcl-2","2019","Tumor initiation, progression and resistance to chemotherapy rely on cancer cells bypassing programmed cell death by apoptosis. We report that unlike other pro-apoptotic proteins, Bim contains two distinct binding sites for the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. These include the BH3 sequence shared with other pro-apoptotic proteins and an unexpected sequence located near the Bim carboxyl-terminus (residues 181-192). Using automated Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy - Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FLIM-FRET) we show that the two binding interfaces enable Bim to double-bolt lock Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 in complexes resistant to displacement by BH3-mimetic drugs currently in use or being evaluated for cancer therapy. Quantifying in live cells the contributions of individual amino acids revealed that residue L185 previously thought involved in binding Bim to membranes, instead contributes to binding to anti-apoptotic proteins. This double-bolt lock mechanism has profound implications for the utility of BH3-mimetics as drugs. ?

"Experiences of community-dwelling older adults living with multiple chronic conditions: A qualitative study","2019","Objectives The aim of the study was to understand the experiences of living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) from the perspective of community-living older adults with MCC. Design A qualitative study using an interpretive description approach. Setting Participants were recruited from southern Ontario, Canada. Participants 21 community-living, older adults (?65 years) with an average of 7.4 chronic conditions including one of diabetes, dementia or stroke. Methods Data were collected through digitally-recorded, in-depth, semi-structured in-person interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed and coded using Thorne's interpretive description approach. Results Five themes were identified representing older adults' experiences of living with MCC: (a) trying to stay healthy while living with MCC, (b) depending on family caregivers for support with just about everything, (c) paying the high costs of living with MCC, (d) making healthcare decisions by proxy and (e) receiving healthcare services that do not address the complex needs of persons living with MCC. Conclusions The experience of living with MCC in the community was complex and multi-faceted. The need for a person-centred and family-centred approach to care in the community, which includes the coordination of health and social services that are tailored to the needs of older adults and their informal caregivers, was underscored. Such an approach would facilitate improved information-sharing and discussion of care management options between health professionals and their patients, enable older adults with MCC to actively engage in priority-setting and decision-making and may result in improved health and quality of life for older adults with MCC. ?

"Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 is masking PCV13-mediated herd immunity in Canadian adults hospitalized with community acquired pneumonia: A study from the Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network of the Canadian immunization research Network (CIRN)","2019","Background: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was recently shown to be effective against PCV13-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumococcal community acquired pneumonia (CAPSpn) in healthy adults aged ?65 years, prompting many countries to re-assess adult immunization. In Canada, the potential benefits of adult PCV13 immunization were unclear given anticipated herd immunity from PCV13 childhood immunization introduced since 2010. This study describes the serotype distribution and clinical outcomes of Canadian adults aged ?16 years, who were hospitalized with CAPSpn and IPD from 2010 to 2015. Methods: Active surveillance for CAP and IPD was performed in adult hospitals across five Canadian provinces. IPD was identified when Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from sterile sites. Bacteremic and non-bacteremic CAPSpn were identified using blood culture, and sputum culture or PCV13-specific urine antigen detection (UADPCV13), respectively. Serotype was assigned using Quellung reaction, PCR, or UADPCV13. Results: Of 6687 CAP cases where a test was performed, S. pneumoniae positivity decreased from 15.9% in 2011 to 8.8% in 2014, but increased to 12.9% in 2015. CAPSpn attributed to PCV13 serotypes followed a similar trend, dropping from 8.3% in 2010 to 4.6% in 2014, but increasing to 6.3% in 2015. The decline was primarily attributed to serotypes 7F and 19A, and the proportional increase to serotype 3. Similar trends were noted for bacteremic and non-bacteremic CAPSpn. Serious outcomes such as 30-day mortality, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were prominent in CAPSpn and IPD cases, but remained unchanged over the study years. Conclusion: Herd immunity afforded primarily by serotypes 7F and 19A appears to be partly masked by a concomitant proportional increase of serotype 3.

The clinical picture consists of acral (distal extremity) tissue necrosis involving lower limbs in a largely symmetrical fashion and with detectable arterial pulses; in one-third of patients the upper extremities are also affected (potential for four-limb amputations). The laboratory picture includes thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and normoblastemia (circulating nucleated red blood cells). The explanation for limb losses is microvascular thrombosis caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation usually secondary to cardiogenic or septic shock. A common myth is that vasopressors cause the ischaemic limb injury. However, the more likely explanation is failure of the natural anticoagulant systems (protein C and antithrombin) to downregulate thrombin generation in the microvasculature. This is because more than 90% of patients with SPG have preceding 'shock liver', which occurs 2 to 5 days (median, 3 days) prior to ischaemic limb injury, with impaired hepatic production of protein C and antithrombin. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.","anticoagulant protein; antivitamin K; heparin; hypertensive factor; low molecular weight heparin; procoagulant; recombinant thrombomodulin; thrombin inhibitor; anticoagulant therapy; cardiogenic shock; critically ill patient; disease association; disseminated intravascular clotting; gangrene; histopathology; human; International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis DIC Criteria; Japanese Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis DIC Score; limb ischemia; liver disease; microvascular thrombosis; mortality; pathophysiology; Review; scoring system; sepsis induced coagulopathy DIC score; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; shock; shock liver; symmetrical peripheral gangrene; systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria; thrombosis; venous limb gangrene; complication; critical illness; disease management; disseminated intravascular clotting; gangrene; ischemia; limb; microvasculature; pathology; thrombosis; vascularization; Critical Illness; Disease Management; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Extremities; Gangrene; Humans; Ischemia; Microvessels; Thrombosis"
"Drivers of Inpatient Costs after Colorectal Surgery within a Publicly Funded Healthcare System","2019","BACKGROUND: The morbidity and mortality associated with colorectal resections are responsible for significant healthcare use. Identification of efficiencies is vital for decreasing healthcare cost in a resource-limited system. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the short-term cost associated with all colon and rectal resections. DESIGN: This was a population-based, retrospective administrative analysis. SETTINGS: This analysis was composed of all colon and rectal resections with anastomosis in Canada (excluding Quebec) between 2008 and 2015. PATIENTS: A total of 108,304 patients ?18 years of age who underwent colon and/or rectal resections with anastomosis were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total short-term inpatient cost for the index admission and the incremental cost of each comorbidity and complication (in 2014 Canadian dollars) were measured. Cost predictors were modeled using hierarchical linear regression and Monte Carlo Markov Chain estimation. RESULTS: Multivariable regression demonstrated that the adjusted average cost of a 50-year-old man undergoing open colon resection for benign disease with no comorbidities or complications was $9270 ((95% CI, $7146-$11,624; p = <0.001). With adjustment for complications, laparoscopic colon resections carried a cost savings of $1390 (95% CI, $1682-$1099; p = <0.001) compared with open resections. Surgical complications were the main driver for increased cost, because anastomotic leaks added $9129 (95% CI, $8583-$9670; p = <0.001). Medical complications such as renal failure requiring dialysis ($16,939 (95% CI, $15,548-$18,314); p = <0.001) carried significant cost. Complications requiring reoperation cost $16,313 (95% CI, $15,739-$16,886; p = <0.001). The costliest complication cumulatively was reoperation, which exceeded $95 million dollars over the course of the study. LIMITATIONS: Inherent biases associated with administrative databases limited this study. CONCLUSIONS: Medical and surgical complications (especially those requiring reoperation) are major drivers of increased resource use. Laparoscopic colorectal resection with or without adjustment for complications carries a clear cost advantage. There is opportunity for considerable cost savings by reducing specific complications or by preoperatively optimizing select patients susceptible to costly complication.

"Canadian consensus: Oligoprogressive, pseudoprogressive, and oligometastatic non-small-cell lung cancer","2019","Background Little evidence has been generated for how best to manage patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) presenting with rarer clinical scenarios, including oligometastases, oligoprogression, and pseudoprogression. In each of those scenarios, oncologists have to consider how best to balance efficacy with quality of life, while maximizing the duration of each line of therapy and ensuring that patients are still eligible for later options, including clinical trial enrolment. Methods An expert panel was convened to define the clinical questions. Using case-based presentations, consensus practice recommendations for each clinical scenario were generated through focused, evidence-based discussions. Results Treatment strategies and best-practice or consensus recommendations are presented, with areas of consensus and areas of uncertainty identified. Conclusions In each situation, treatment has to be tailored to suit the individual patient, but with the intent of extending and maximizing the use of each line of treatment, while keeping treatment options in reserve for later lines of therapy.

"Perioperative Pain and Addiction Interdisciplinary Network (PAIN): Protocol of a practice advisory for the perioperative management of buprenorphine using a modified Delphi process","2019","Introduction The ongoing opioid epidemic has necessitated increasing prescriptions of buprenorphine, which is an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, and also shown to reduce harms associated with unsafe opioid administration. A systematic review of perioperative management strategies for patients taking buprenorphine concluded that there was little guidance for managing buprenorphine perioperatively. The aim of this project is to develop consensus guidelines on the optimal perioperative management strategies for this group of patients. In this paper, we present the design for a modified Delphi technique that will be used to gain consensus among patients and multidisciplinary experts in addiction, pain, community and perioperative medicine. Methods and analysis A national panel of experts identified by perioperative, pain and/or addiction systematic review authorship established an international profile in perioperative, pain and/or addiction research, community clinical excellence and by peer referral. A steering group will develop the first round with a list of indications to be rated by the panel of national experts, patients and allied healthcare professionals. In round 1, the expert panel will rate the appropriateness of each individual item and provide additional suggestions for revisions, additions or deletions. The definition of consensus will be set a priori. Consensus will be gauged for both appropriateness and inappropriateness of treatment strategies. Where an agreement is not reached and items are suggested for addition/deletion/modification, round 2 will take place over teleconference in order to obtain consensus. Ethics and dissemination Institutional research ethics board provided a waiver for this modified Delphi protocol. We plan on developing a national guideline for the management of patients taking buprenorphine in the perioperative period that will be generalisable across three sets of preoperative diagnoses including opioid use disorder and/or co-occurring pain disorders. The findings will be published in peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"Upper Extremity DVT versus Lower Extremity DVT: Perspectives from the GARFIELD-VTE Registry","2019","Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) is less common than lower extremity DVT (LEDVT) and consequently less well characterized. This study compared clinical characteristics and 1-year outcomes between 438 UEDVT patients and 7,602 LEDVT patients recruited in the GARFIELD-VTE registry. UEDVT patients were significantly more likely to have a central venous catheter than those with LEDVT (11.5% vs. 0.5%; p < 0.0001), and had a higher rate of active cancer (16.2%) or recent hospitalization (19.4%) compared with LEDVT patients (8.7% and 11.2%, respectively). Nearly all patients with UEDVT and LEDVT were initiated on anticoagulant therapy, which was a direct oral anticoagulant in one-third individuals in both groups. At 3, 6, and 12 months, the proportion of UEDVT and LEDVT patients who were receiving anticoagulant therapy was 82.6 and 87.4%, 66.0 and 72.6%, and 45.7 and 54.6%, respectively. In the UEDVT and LEDVT groups, VTE recurrence rate was 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-6.7) and 5.5 (95% CI, 4.9-6.1) per 100 person-years, respectively; major bleed was noted in 1.3 (95% CI, 0.6-3.2) and 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3-1.9) per 100 person-years and all-cause mortality in 9.7 (95% CI, 7.1-13.4) and 6.7 (95% CI, 6.1-7.3) per 100 person-years, respectively. Hence, risk of recurrence was similar in the two groups whereas all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the UEDVT group than the LEDVT group (p = 0.0338). This latter finding was likely due to the high prevalence of cancer in the UEDVT group. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

"Affective flexibility and generalized anxiety disorder: valence-specific shifting difficulties","2019","Background: Growing evidence suggests that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with poor affective flexibility, defined as the ability to switch between emotional aspects and non-emotional aspects of a situation. However, it is unclear whether affective inflexibility is valence-specific in GAD. Methods: Participants with GAD (n = 21) and non-clinical control participants (n = 28) were tested on an Affective Switching Task during which participants were asked to categorize pictures either by the?valence or by?the number of humans present in the pictures. Results: Individuals with GAD, but not healthy controls, exhibited greater difficulty shifting from emotional aspects of negative material compared to emotional aspects of positive material and shifting to the emotional aspects of positive material compared to emotional aspects of negative material. Conclusions: These findings suggest that GAD is associated with valence-specific affective flexibility biases. The relevance of the findings and directions for future research are discussed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Clinical leadership in reducing risk: Managing patient airways","2019","Niagara Health, a multi-site hospital organization, has developed a multimodal, comprehensive strategy to manage patients with a Difficult Airway (DA) in a non-operative setting. The Difficult Airway Pathway (DAP) is an evidence-based strategy aimed to train staff to reduce critical events.

"Intestinal organoids: A new paradigm for engineering intestinal epithelium in vitro","2019","In recent years, the advent of intestinal organoid culture systems has revolutionized in vitro studies of the small intestine epithelium. Intestinal organoids are derived from self-organizing and self-renewing intestinal stem cells and closely recapitulate the native intestinal epithelium. They therefore represent a more physiologically-relevant in vitro model than conventional cell cultures for studying intestinal development, biology and pathophysiology. Moreover, they represent a promising and unprecedented new tool in the realm of regenerative and personalized medicine. In this review, we outline the current approaches to develop intestinal organoids and describe the strategies used to induce complexity, multicellularity and modularity in organoid culture systems; this knowledge will contribute to improved biomimicry of the organoid culture system. We focus on co-culture systems and explore the convergence of organoid technology and engineering principals. Finally, we describe applications of intestinal organoids in various fields. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomimetics; Cell culture; Physiological models; Stem cells; Tissue engineering; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Microbial interactions; Organoids; Organs-on-a-Chips; Small intestine; Cell engineering; coculture; host microbe interaction; human cell; induced pluripotent stem cell; intestine epithelium; organoid; personalized medicine; review; small intestine; tissue engineering"
"‘Hopeful adaptation’ in health geographies: Seeking health and wellbeing in times of adversity","2019","Living with adversity can create wide-ranging challenges for people's health and wellbeing. This adversity may arise through personal embodied difference (e.g. acquiring a brain injury or losing mobility in older age) as well as wider structural relations that shape a person's capacity to adapt. A number of dichotomies have dominated our understanding of how people engage with health and wellbeing practices in their lives, from classifying behaviours as harmful/health-enabling, to understanding the self as being defined before/after illness. This paper critically interrogates a number of these dichotomies and proposes the concept of ‘hopeful adaptation’ to understand the myriad, often non-linear ways that people seek and find health and wellbeing in spite of adversity. We highlight the transformative potential in these adaptive practices, rather than solely focusing on how people persist and absorb adversity. The paper outlines an agenda for a health geography of hopeful adaptation, introducing a collection of papers that examine varied forms of adaptation in people's everyday struggles to find health and wellbeing whilst living with and challenging adversity. ? 2018","health care; health geography; quality of life; welfare impact; aged; article; human; medical geography; welfare; wellbeing"
"The course and prognostic factors of cognitive outcomes after traumatic brain injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Despite indications that TBI may be a precursor of cognitive decline and subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease, little is known about the time course of this relationship and the factors involved. This systematic review summarizes the evidence pertinent to this subject matter. All English language studies of longitudinal design, and works cited within them, found in six literature databases, were considered, and their quality assessed. Of 65 articles appraised, 44 studies were selected. Results were organized by timing of assessments, injury severity, and cognitive domains assessed. Differences in the course of cognitive performance were observed across injury severity groups and cognitive domains, with differential proportions of reports of improvement, decline, or no change over time. The evidence for genetic, sex-, age-, and injury-related factors as determinants of cognitive outcome was inconsistent. The non-uniform trajectory of cognitive performance post-TBI supports the notion that this construct is non-homogeneous, and that different factors influence its course. Agreement on a core set of predictors and consideration of psychometric properties of outcome measures is needed. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","age; brain concussion; cognition; cognition assessment; cognitive defect; disease course; disease duration; genetics; Glasgow coma scale; health hazard; human; illness trajectory; injury severity; mental performance; nervous system development; nonhuman; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; Review; risk factor; sex difference; substance use; systematic review; traumatic brain injury; Alzheimer disease; animal; cognition; cognitive defect; drug effect; meta analysis; prognosis; psychology; traumatic brain injury; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Prognosis"
"How can the results of the COMPASS trial benefit patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease in Poland","2019","Aspirin decreases the risk of recurrent thrombotic events in patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease but the risk of recurrent events remains high. Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy or the combination of aspirin and warfarin further reduces the risk of recurrent events, but at the cost of increased bleeding, and neither of these treatments reduce mortality. The COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes in People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) randomized controlled trial involving 27 395 patients from 602 sites in 33 countries (Poland: 9 sites, 518 patients) tested whether low-dose anticoagulant therapy with the coagulation factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban given alone or combined with aspirin reduced thrombotic risk compared with aspirin in patients with apparently stable chronic coronary and/or peripheral artery disease. In patients treated with the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily and aspirin 100 mg once daily, compared with aspirin alone, the primary outcome of the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction was decreased by 24% (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.86; P < 0.001), and mortality by 18% at the cost of a 70% increase in major bleeding but no significant increase in fatal or intracranial bleeding. Results were consistent in patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease, and the greatest absolute benefit was evident in the highest risk patients, including those with polyvascular disease, mild or moderate heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes. These results establish the combination of low-dose rivaroxaban and aspirin as a highly effective treatment to decrease morbidity and mortality rates in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease.

"Can the effects of the mobilization of vulnerable elders in Ontario (MOVE ON) implementation be replicated in new settings: an interrupted time series design","2019","Background: Bed rest for older hospitalized patients places them at risk for hospital-acquired morbidity. We previously evaluated an early mobilization intervention and found it to be effective at improving mobilization rates and decreasing length of stay on internal medicine units. The aim of this study was to conduct a replication study evaluating the impact of the evidence-informed mobilization intervention on surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units. Methods: A multi-component early mobilization intervention was tailored to the local context at seven hospitals in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome was patient mobilization measured by conducting visual audits twice a week, three times a day. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and discharge destination, which were obtained from hospital decision support data. The study population was patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted to surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units between March and August 2014. Using an interrupted time series design, the intervention was evaluated over three time periods-pre-intervention, during, and post-intervention. Results: A total of 3098 patients [mean age 78.46 years (SD 8.38)] were included in the overall analysis. There was a significant increase in mobility immediately after the intervention period compared to pre-intervention with a slope change of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-3.08, P-value = 0.0014). A decreasing trend in median length of stay was observed in the majority of the participating sites. Overall, a median length of stay of 26.24 days (95% CI 23.67-28.80) was observed pre-intervention compared to 23.81 days (95% CI 20.13-27.49) during the intervention and 24.69 days (95% CI 22.43-26.95) post-intervention. The overall decrease in median length of stay was associated with the increase in mobility across the sites. Conclusions: MOVE increased mobilization and these results were replicated across surgery, psychiatry, medicine, and cardiology inpatient units. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aged; article; cardiology; controlled study; decision support system; female; hospital patient; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mobilization; multicenter study; Ontario; outcome assessment; psychiatry; replication study; statistical significance; time series analysis; clinical trial; epidemiology; frail elderly; hospital discharge; hospitalization; internal medicine; Ontario; procedures; psychology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Early Ambulation; Female; Frail Elderly; Hospitalization; Humans; Internal Medicine; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Length of Stay; Male; Ontario; Patient Discharge"
"Comparison of Partial Versus Radical Nephrectomy Effect on Other-cause Mortality, Cancer-specific Mortality, and 30-day Mortality in Patients Older Than 75 Years","2019","Background: Historically, partial nephrectomy (PN) showed no benefit on other-cause mortality (OCM) in elderly patients with small renal masses. Objective: To test the effect of PN versus radical nephrectomy (RN) on OCM, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), as well as 30-d mortality in patients with nonmetastatic T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC), aged ?75 yr old. Design, setting, and participants: Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry (2004–2014), we identified surgically treated patients with nonmetastatic pT1a RCC aged ?75 yr. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We relied on propensity score (PS) matching to reduce the effect of inherent differences between PN and RN. After PS matching, cumulative incidence, multivariable competing-risks regression (CRR) and logistic regression models were used. LOESS plots graphically depicted the relation between nephrectomy type and OCM after adjustment for all the covariates. Landmark analyses at 6 mo tested for immortal time bias. Results and limitations: Of all 4541 patients, 41.6% underwent PN. After 1:1 PS matching, 2826 patients remained. In multivariable CRR models, lower OCM rates were recorded in PN patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.67, confidence interval [CI]: 0.54–0.84; p < 0.001). LOESS plots showed lower OCM rates after PN across all examined ages. Lower CSM rates were also recorded in PN patients (HR: 0.64, CI = 0.44–0.92; p = 0.02). Landmark analyses rejected the hypothesis of immortal time bias. Finally, PN did not result in different 30-d mortality rates (odds ratio: 1.87; CI: 0.79–4.47; p = 0.2) versus RN. Data are retrospective. Conclusions: PN results in lower OCM in elderly patients with pT1a RCC. Moreover, PN does not contribute to higher CSM or 30-d mortality in patients aged ?75 yr. In consequence, PN should be given strong consideration, even in elderly patients. Patient summary: Partial nephrectomy (PN) may protect from renal insufficiency, hypertension, and other unfavorable health outcomes, even in elderly patients. This protective effect results in lower other-cause mortality. Moreover, PN benefits are not undermined by higher cancer-specific mortality or 30-d mortality. ? 2018 European Association of UrologyPartial nephrectomy should be given strong consideration even in elderly patients. ? 2018 European Association of Urology","aged; Article; cancer epidemiology; cancer grading; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; groups by age; human; intermethod comparison; kidney tumor; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality rate; other cause mortality; outcome assessment; partial nephrectomy; radical nephrectomy; renal cell carcinoma; retrospective study; social status; tumor volume"
"Complexity science education for clinical nurse researchers","2019","Nurse researchers-in-training learn that traditional research methods aligning with the positivist paradigm are suitable for evaluating the effects of clinical interventions. Preferred research methods (such as the randomized controlled trial) are based on assumptions that linear cause-and-effect relationships are discoverable through careful manipulation of variables under controlled conditions. Yet clinical intervention trials in practice are much more often done in environments which are in constant states of flux, with dynamic and unpredictable variables rather than settings where uniformity and control are routine. Graduate nursing programs should expose students with interests in clinical research to methods that will enable them to make sense of how to evaluate clinical interventions in real world conditions. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of concepts from the field of Complexity Science—with a focus on Complex Adaptive Systems—to clinical research and examine their potential value to guide nursing research that informs evidence-based nursing interventions. We argue that the introduction of these concepts into graduate nursing curricula is fundamental to the preparation of future nurse scientists who will address the complex healthcare problems of this century. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","article; clinical evaluation; clinical nursing research; human; human experiment; nurse researcher; nursing education; nursing intervention; student"
"Methods for development of the european commission initiative on breast cancer guidelines","2019","Neither breast cancer prevention and early-detection programs, nor their outcomes, are uniform across Europe. This article describes the rationale, methods, and process for development of the European Commission (EC) Initiative on Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis Guidelines. To be consistent with standards set by the Institute of Medicine and others, the EC followed 6 general principles. First, the EC selected, via an open call, a panel with broad representation of areas of expertise. Second, it ensured that all recommendations were supported by systematic reviews. Third, the EC separately considered important subgroups of women, included patient advocates in the guidelines development group, and focused on good communication to inform women's decisions. Fourth, EC rules on conflicts of interest were followed and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Evidence to Decision frameworks were used to structure the process and minimize the influence of competing interests. Fifth, it focused its recommendations on outcomes that matter to women, and certainty of the evidence is rated for each. Sixth, the EC elicited stakeholder feedback to ensure that the recommendations remain up to date and relevant to practice. This article describes the approach and highlights ways of disseminating and adapting the recommendations both within and outside Europe, using innovative information technology tools. ? 2019 American College of Physicians.

"Timing of decompressive craniectomy for ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury: A review","2019","While studies have demonstrated that decompressive craniectomy after stroke or TBI improves mortality, there is much controversy regarding when decompressive craniectomy is optimally performed. The goal of this paper is to synthesize the data regarding timing of craniectomy for malignant stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) based on studied time windows and clinical correlates of herniation. In stroke patients, evidence supports that early decompression performed within 24 h or before clinical signs of herniation may improve overall mortality and functional outcomes. In adult TBI patients, published results demonstrate that early decompressive craniectomy within 24 h of injury may reduce mortality and improve functional outcomes when compared to late decompressive craniectomy. In contrast to the stroke data, preliminary TBI data have demonstrated that decompressive craniectomy after radiographic signs of herniation may still lead to improved functional outcomes compared to medical management. In pediatric TBI patients, there is also evidence for better functional outcomes when treated with decompressive craniectomy, regardless of timing. More high quality data are needed, particularly that which incorporates a broader set of metrics into decision-making surrounding cranial decompression. In particular, advanced neuromonitoring and imaging technologies may be useful adjuncts in determining the optimal time for decompression in appropriate patients. ? 2019 Shah, Almenawer and Hawryluk.","brain hernia; brain ischemia; brain radiography; correlational study; decision making; decompressive craniectomy; evidence based medicine; human; mortality; nonhuman; Review; traumatic brain injury"
"A Simple DNAzyme-Based Fluorescent Assay for Klebsiella pneumoniae","2019","Pathogenic bacteria pose a serious threat to public health, and the rapid and cost-effective detection of such bacteria remains a major challenge. Herein, we present a DNAzyme-based fluorescent paper sensor for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The DNAzyme was generated by an in vitro selection technique to cleave a fluorogenic DNA–RNA chimeric substrate in the presence of K. pneumoniae. The DNAzyme was printed on a paper substrate in a 96-well format to serve as mix-and-read fluorescent assay that exhibits a limit of detection (LOD) 10 5 CFUs mL ?1 . Evaluated with 20 strains of clinical bacterial isolates, the DNAzyme produced the desired fluorescence signal with the samples of K. pneumoniae, regardless of their source or drug resistance. The assay is simple to use, rapid, inexpensive, and avoids the complex procedures of sample preparation and equipment. We believe that this DNAzyme-based fluorescent assay has potential for practical applications to identify K. pneumoniae. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Associations between carotid artery longitudinal wall motion and arterial stiffness indicators in young children","2019","Background and aims: Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) is associated with established indicators of arterial stiffness in healthy adults and in adults with cardiovascular disease risk factors. CALM assessment may be more feasible for incorporation into routine clinical examination than traditional assessments of arterial stiffness; however, the relationship between CALM and arterial stiffness in children has not been established. Methods: Data were collected from a subset of children participating in the Health Outcomes and Physical activity in Preschoolers study. CALM was characterized by segmental longitudinal wall displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Arterial stiffness was measured using whole-body pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery β-stiffness index. Associations between CALM and arterial stiffness and the influence of age, sex, and height on those associations were determined. Results: One hundred and ninety-one children (ages 5.0–8.0 years) were included in the analyses. Systolic retrograde (r = -0.20, p = 0.01) and maximum (r = -0.15, p = 0.04) CALM displacements were weakly correlated with PWV while systolic anterograde and diastolic CALM displacements and wall velocities and accelerations were not correlated with PWV (r = -0.12 to ?0.03, p = 0.10 to 0.64). There were no significant correlations between any CALM outcome and β-stiffness index (r = -0.12 to 0.10; p > 0.05). Associations were attenuated after adjusting for age, sex, and height. Conclusions: Higher arterial stiffness, measured by PWV, but not β-stiffness, is weakly associated with less longitudinal movement of the common carotid artery in young, healthy children indicating CALM measurement is not a strong candidate for clinical assessment of arterial stiffness in children. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","arterial stiffness; artery wall; Article; cardiovascular disease; carotid artery; child; diastole; diastolic blood pressure; height; human; left common carotid artery; longitudinal study; major clinical study; observational study; physical activity; priority journal; pulse wave; speckle tracking echocardiography; systole; two dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography"
"Dancing from bottoms up – Roles of the POZ-ZF transcription factor Kaiso in Cancer","2019","The POZ-ZF transcription factor Kaiso was discovered two decades ago as a binding partner for p120ctn. Since its discovery, roles for Kaiso in diverse biological processes (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, inflammation) and several signalling pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, TGFβ EGFR, Notch) have emerged. While Kaiso's biological role in normal tissues has yet to be fully elucidated, Kaiso has been increasingly implicated in multiple human cancers including colon, prostate, ovarian, lung, breast and chronic myeloid leukemia. In the majority of human cancers investigated to date, high Kaiso expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics including proliferation and metastasis, and/or poor prognosis. More recently, interest in Kaiso stems from its apparent correlation with racial disparities in breast and prostate cancer incidence and survival outcomes in people of African Ancestry. This review discusses Kaiso's role in various cancers, and Kaiso's potential for driving racial disparities in incidence and/or outcomes in people of African ancestry. ? 2018","DNA; etoposide; microRNA; microRNA 181; transcription factor; transcription factor Kaiso; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; transcription factor; ZNF-kaiso protein, human; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; chronic myeloid leukemia; colon cancer; colorectal cancer; drug response; drug sensitization; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetic transcription; glioma; human; inflammation; lung cancer; malignant neoplasm; metastasis; nonhuman; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; prevalence; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein DNA binding; protein expression; protein function; protein structure; race difference; Review; Wnt signaling; animal; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; physiology; Animals; Humans; Neoplasms; Transcription Factors"
"The Evolving Facets of Bacterial Vaginosis: Implications for HIV Transmission","2019","Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common yet poorly understood vaginal condition that has become a major focus of HIV transmission and immunology research. Varied terminologies are used by clinicians and researchers to describe microbial communities that reside in the female reproductive tract (FRT), which is driven, in part, by microbial genetic and metabolic complexity, evolving diagnostic and molecular techniques, and multidisciplinary perspectives of clinicians, epidemiologists, microbiologists, and immunologists who all appreciate the scientific importance of understanding mechanisms that underlie BV. This Perspectives article aims to clarify the varied terms used to describe the cervicovaginal microbiota and its ""nonoptimal"" state, under the overarching term of BV. The ultimate goal is to move toward language standardization in future literature that facilitates a better understanding of the impact of BV on FRT immunology and risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. ?

"Screening for depression in women during pregnancy or the first year postpartum and in the general adult population: A protocol for two systematic reviews to update a guideline of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care","2019","Background: In 2018, the World Health Organization reported that depression is the most common cause of disability worldwide, with over 300 million people currently living with depression. Depression affects an individual's physical health and well-being, impacts psychosocial functioning, and has specific negative short- and long-term effects on maternal health, child health, developmental trajectories, and family health. The aim of these reviews is to identify evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for depression in the general adult population and in pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: Search strategies were developed and tested through an iterative process by an experienced medical information specialist in consultation with the review team. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library, and a randomized controlled trial filter will be used. The general adult review will be an update of a systematic review previously used by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care for their 2013 guideline recommendation. The search strategy will be updated and will start from the last search date of the previous review (May 2012). The pregnant and postpartum review will be a de novo review with no date restriction. For both reviews, we will search for unpublished documents following the CADTH Grey Matters checklist and relevant websites. Titles and abstracts will be screened using the liberal accelerated method. Two reviewers will independently screen full-text articles for relevance using pre-specified eligibility criteria and assess the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Outcomes of interest for the general adult population review include symptoms of depression or diagnosis of major depressive disorder, health-related quality of life, day-to-day functionality, lost time at work/school, impact on lifestyle behaviour, suicidality, false-positive result, labelling/stigma, overdiagnosis or overtreatment, and harms of treatment. Outcomes of interest for the pregnant and postpartum review include mental health outcomes (e.g. diagnosis of major depressive disorder), parenting outcomes (e.g. mother-child interactions), and infant outcomes (e.g. infant health and development). Discussion: These two systematic reviews will offer informative evaluations of depression screening. The findings will be used by the Task Force to help develop guideline recommendations on depression screening in the general adult population and in pregnant and postpartum women in Canada.

"Process-structure-property relationships of AISI H13 tool steel processed with selective laser melting","2019","Due to a good combination of high hardness, wear resistance, toughness, resistance to high operating temperatures, and fairly low material cost, AISI H13 tool steel is commonly used in the manufacture of injection molds. Additive manufacturing (AM) such as selective laser melting (SLM), due to the layer-wise nature of the process, offers substantial geometric design freedom in comparison with conventional subtractive manufacturing methods, thereby enabling a construction of complex near-net shape parts with internal cavities like conformal cooling channels. The quality of SLM-manufactured parts mainly depends on the part geometry, build orientation and scanning strategy, and processing parameters. In this study, samples of H13 tool steel with a size of 10 × 10 × 15 mm3 were SLM-manufactured using a laser power of 100, 200, and 300W; scanning speed of 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 mm/s; and hatch spacing of 80 and 120 μm. A constant layer thickness of 40 μm, 67° scanning rotation between subsequent layers, and a stripe scanning strategy were maintained during the process. The samples were built considering a preheating of 200 °C. The relative density, surface roughness, crack formation, microstructure, and hardness were evaluated. The relative density is shown to increase with increasing the volumetric energy density up to a value of about 60 J/mm3 and then no significant increase can be pointed out; the maximum relative density of 99.7% was obtained. A preheating of 200 °C generally aids to increase the relative density and eliminate the crack formation. The microstructure of built samples shows fine equiaxed cellular-dendritic structure with martensite and some retained austenite. The microhardness of the as-built samples was found to vary from 650 to 689 HV 0.2, which is comparable to a conventionally produced H13 tool steel. ? 2019 by the authors.","Hardness; Melting; Microstructure; Preheating; Scanning; Surface roughness; Textures; Tool steel; Tools; Wear resistance; Conformal cooling channels; H13 tool steel; High operating temperature; Maximum relative density; Process-structure-property relationship; Relative density; Selective laser melting (SLM); Volumetric energy densities; Selective laser melting"
"Risk factors for chemotherapy-induced nausea in pediatric patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy","2019","Background: Little is known regarding risk factors for chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) in pediatric patients. Procedure: A secondary analysis was conducted of a previously published multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trial assessing the efficacy of acupressure in preventing CIN in pediatric patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The primary outcome was nausea severity, self-reported using the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool. The relationships between acute and delayed nausea severity and patient- (sex, race, age, and cancer diagnosis) and treatment-related (chemotherapy, antiemetic prophylaxis, CIN, and vomiting control) factors were analyzed by a proportional odds generalized estimating equation approach. The acute phase started with administration of the first and continued for 24?hours after the last chemotherapy dose. The delayed phase started at the end of the acute phase and continued until the next chemotherapy block (maximum seven days). Results: In the acute and delayed phases, 165 and 144 patients provided data for analysis, respectively. Nonwhite race was significantly associated with higher acute phase nausea severity (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6). Poor CIN control in the acute phase (OR, 16; 95% CI, 4.0–64.6), diagnosis of a cancer other than a central nervous system (CNS) tumor (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2–5.3), and cisplatin administration (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.1–6.0) were significantly associated with higher delayed phase nausea severity. Conclusion: Acute phase CIN was associated with nonwhite race. Delayed phase CIN was associated with poor acute phase CIN control, diagnosis of non-CNS cancer, and receipt of cisplatin. These findings will inform future antiemetic trial design. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","antineoplastic agent; aprepitant; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; dexamethasone; granisetron; ifosfamide; ondansetron; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; acupressure; Article; cancer chemotherapy; central nervous system tumor; chemotherapy induced nausea; chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; school child; secondary analysis; acupressure; adolescent; clinical trial; multicenter study; nausea; neoplasm; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; Acupressure; Adolescent; Antineoplastic Agents; Child; Cisplatin; Female; Humans; Male; Nausea; Neoplasms; Risk Factors"
"Severely bothersome fatigue in children and adolescents with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","2019","Background: Objectives were to describe bothersome fatigue in children with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) recipients and to identify factors associated with severely bothersome fatigue. Methods: We included children ages 8–18?years treated for cancer or HSCT recipients from three groups: [1] receiving active cancer treatment and admitted to hospital for at least 3?days, [2] attending outpatient clinic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance therapy, and [3] attending outpatient clinic following treatment completion. Fatigue was measured using the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi); severely bothersome fatigue was defined as a lot or extremely bothersome fatigue (score of 3–4 on 0–4 scale). Factors associated with severely bothersome fatigue were examined using univariate and multiple logistic regression. Results: Of 502 children included, 414 (82.5%) reported some degree of bothersome fatigue (scores 1–4), and 123 (24.5%) reported severely bothersome fatigue (score 3 or 4). In multiple regression analysis, factors significantly associated with severely bothersome fatigue were child age 11–14 and 15–18?years vs 8–10?years (odds ratio (OR) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21–3.77 and OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.66–5.44), and inpatients receiving cancer treatment vs outpatients who had completed therapy (OR 3.85, 95% CI 2.17–7.27). Conclusions: We found that 82.5% of children with cancer or HSCT recipients reported bothersome fatigue and 24.5% of children reported severely bothersome fatigue. Risk factors for severely bothersome fatigue were older age and inpatients receiving active cancer treatment. Future work should evaluate systematic symptom screening in clinical practice and apply interventions to reduce fatigue. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; adult; Article; bothersome fatigue; brain tumor; cancer fatigue; cancer therapy; child; childhood cancer; construct validity; disease severity; female; graft recipient; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; internal consistency; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; outpatient department; priority journal; prospective study; psychometry; risk factor; school child; scoring system; solid malignant neoplasm; symptom screening in pediatrics tool"
"Quality of Chronic Kidney Disease Management in Canadian Primary Care","2019","Importance: Although patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are routinely managed in primary care settings, no nationally representative study has assessed the quality of care received by these patients in Canada. Objective: To evaluate the current state of CKD management in Canadian primary care practices to identify care gaps to guide development and implementation of national quality improvement initiatives. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study leveraged Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, to develop a cohort of 46?162 patients with CKD managed in primary care practices. Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2018, to July 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study examined the proportion of patients with CKD who met a set of 12 quality indicators in 6 domains: (1) detection and recognition of CKD, (2) testing and monitoring of kidney function, (3) use of recommended medications, (4) monitoring after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), (5) management of blood pressure, and (6) monitoring for glycemic control in those with diabetes and CKD. The study also analyzed associations of divergence from these quality indicators. Results: The cohort comprised 46?162 patients (mean [SD] age, 69.2 [14.0] years; 25 855 [56.0%] female) with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Only 4 of 12 quality indicators were met by 75% or more of the study cohort. These indicators were receipt of an outpatient serum creatinine test within 18 months after confirmation of CKD, receipt of blood pressure measurement at any time during follow-up, achieving a target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or lower, and receiving a hemoglobin A1c test for monitoring diabetes during follow-up. Indicators in the domains of detection and recognition of CKD, testing and monitoring of kidney function (specifically, urine albumin to creatinine ratio testing), use of recommended medications, and appropriate monitoring after initiation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs were not met. Only 6529 patients (18.4%) with CKD received a urine albumin test within 6 months of CKD diagnosis, and 3954 (39.4%) had a second measurement within 6 months of an abnormal baseline urine albumin level. Older age (?85 years) and CKD stage 5 were significantly associated with not satisfying the criteria for the quality indicators across all domains. Across age categories, younger patients (aged 18-49 years) and older patients (?75 years) were less likely to be tested for albuminuria (314 of 1689 patients aged 18-49 years [18.5%], 1983 of 11 919 patients aged 75-84 years [61.6%], and 614 of 5237 patients aged ?85 years [11.7%] received the urine albumin to creatinine ratio test within 6 months of initial estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2; P?<?.001). Patients aged 18 to 49 years were less commonly prescribed recommended medications (222 of 2881 [7.7%]), whereas patients aged 75 to 84 years were prescribed ACEIs or ARBs most frequently (2328 of 5262 [44.2%]; P?<?.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that management of CKD across primary care practices in Canada varies according to quality indicator. This study revealed potential priority areas for quality improvement initiatives in Canadian primary care practices.",""
"A clinical carepath for obese pregnant women: a pragmatic pilot cluster randomized controlled trial","2019","Objectives: Obese women are at increased risks for complications during pregnancy, birth, and in their infants. Although guidelines have been established for the clinical care of obese pregnant women, management is sometimes suboptimal. Our goal was to determine the feasibility of implementing and testing a clinical carepath for obese pregnant women compared to standard care, in a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: A pragmatic pilot cluster RCT was conducted, randomly allocating eight clinics to the carepath or standard care for obese pregnant women. Women were eligible if they had a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) of ?30 kg/m2 and a viable singleton &lt;21 weeks. The primary outcomes were the feasibility of conducting a full-scale cluster RCT (defined as &gt;80%: randomization of clinics, use in eligible women, and completeness of follow-up) and of the intervention (defined as &gt;80%: compliance with each step in the carepath and recommendation of the carepath by clinicians to a colleague). Results: All eight approached clinics agreed to participate and were randomized. Half of the intervention clinics used the carepath, resulting in &lt;80% uptake of eligible women. High follow-up (99.5%) was achieved, in 188 of 189 women. The carepath was feasible for numerous guideline-directed recommendations for screening, but less so for counseling topics. When the carepath was used in the majority of women, all clinicians, most of whom were midwives, reported they would recommend it to a colleague. The intervention group had significantly higher overall adherence to the guideline recommendations compared to control (relative risk: 1.71, 95% confidence interval: 1.57–1.87). Conclusions: In this pragmatic pilot cluster RCT, a guideline-directed clinical carepath improved some aspects of care of obese pregnant women and was recommended by clinicians, particularly midwives. A cluster RCT may not be feasible in a mix of obstetric and midwifery clinics, but may be feasible in midwifery clinics. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical pathway; cluster analysis; controlled study; feasibility study; female; follow up; gestational age; health care delivery; human; maternal obesity; midwife; multicenter study; outcome assessment; parallel design; patient care; patient counseling; pilot study; practice guideline; pragmatic trial; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prepregnancy care; priority journal; protocol compliance; randomized controlled trial; clinical pathway; clinical trial; complication; health care quality; obesity; organization and management; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; prenatal care; procedures; Adult; Body Mass Index; Cluster Analysis; Critical Pathways; Female; Humans; Midwifery; Obesity; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Care; Standard of Care"
"The Role of Apathy and Depression on Verbal Learning and Memory Performance after Stroke","2019","Objective Psychiatric symptoms, including depression and apathy, may significantly impede functional and cognitive capabilities following a cerebrovascular event. This study examined the role of apathy and depression on learning and memory performance in stroke patients. Method Stroke patients (n = 140 [119 ischemic, 21 hemorrhagic], mean age = 60.6 [SD = 15.1]) completed the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II). Results Using a 2 × 2 MANOVA with depression (CESD ? 16) and apathy (AES ? 34) as the independent variables and cognitive performance (i.e., verbal acquisition, short-term free recall, and long-term free recall) as the dependent variables, we found a main effect for apathy (F[3,134] = 2.98, p =.034), such that apathetic stroke patients (n = 24) performed significantly worse on verbal acquisition (F[1,136] = 6.44; p =.012), short-term free recall (F[1,136] = 7.86; p =.006), and long-term free recall (F[1,136] = 8.37; p =.004) than nonapathetic stroke patients (n = 116). There was no main effect of depression on cognitive performance (F[1,136] = 1.72, p =.155). Conclusions These results suggest that apathy, not depression, is related to verbal memory performance in stroke patients. Future research should explore whether treatment of apathy (e.g., improving motivation) could be a novel target for improving cognition after stroke. Researchers should also examine whether this model can be applied to other aspects of cognition, including executive function and other areas of memory including autobiographical and working memory. ?

"Vaginal progesterone, oral progesterone, 17-OHPC, cerclage, and pessary for preventing preterm birth in at-risk singleton pregnancies: an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis","2019","Background: Recent progesterone trials call for an update of previous syntheses of interventions to prevent preterm birth. Objectives: To compare the relative effects of different types and routes of administration of progesterone, cerclage, and pessary at preventing preterm birth in at-risk women overall and in specific populations. Search strategy: We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science up to 1 January 2018. Selection criteria: We included randomised trials of progesterone, cerclage or pessary for preventing preterm birth in at-risk singleton pregnancies. Data collection and analysis: We used a piloted data extraction form and performed Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses with 95% credibility intervals (CrI), as well as pairwise meta-analyses, rating the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: We included 40 trials (11 311 women). In at-risk women overall, vaginal progesterone reduced preterm birth <34 (OR 0.43, 95% CrI 0.20–0.81) and <37 weeks (OR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.34–0.74), and neonatal death (OR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20–0.83). In women with a previous preterm birth, vaginal progesterone reduced preterm birth <34 (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12–0.68) and <37 weeks (OR 0.43, 95% CrI 0.23–0.74), and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate reduced preterm birth <37 weeks (OR 0.53, 95% CrI 0.27–0.95) and neonatal death (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16–0.95). In women with a short cervix (?25 mm), vaginal progesterone reduced preterm birth <34 weeks (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24–0.84).

"Study protocol for a randomized, blinded, controlled trial of ketamine for acute painful crisis of sickle cell disease","2019","Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hematological disorder where the shape of red blood cells is altered, resulting in the destruction of red blood cells, anemia, and other complications. SCD is prevalent in the southern and eastern provinces of the Arabian peninsula. The most common complications for individuals with SCD are acute painful episodes that require several doses of intravenous opioids, making pain control for these individuals challenging. Instead of opioids, some studies have suggested that ketamine might be used for pain control in acute pain episodes of individuals with SCD. This study aims to evaluate whether the addition of ketamine to morphine can achieve better pain control, decreasing the number of repeated doses of opiates. We hypothesize that early administration of ketamine would lead to a more rapid improvement in pain score and lower opioid requirements. Methods and analysis: This study will be a prospective, randomized, concealed, blinded, pragmatic parallel group, controlled trial enrolling adult patients with SCD and acute vaso-occlusive crisis pain. All patients will receive standard analgesic therapy during evaluation. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will receive low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg in 0.9% sodium chloride, 100 ml bag) in addition to standard intravenous hydration, while those in the control group will receive a standard dose of morphine (0.1 mg/kg in 0.9% sodium chloride, 100 ml bag) in addition to the standard intravenous hydration. All healthcare providers will be blinded to the treatment arm. Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

"Mate Choice and the Persistence of Maternal Mortality","2019","Maternal mortality remains one of the leading causes of death in women of reproductive age in developing countries, and a major concern in some developed countries. It is puzzling why such a condition has not been reduced in frequency, if not eliminated, in the course of evolution. Maternal mortality is a complex phenomenon caused by several physiological and physical factors. Among the physical factors, maternal mortality due to fetopelvic disproportion remains controversial. Several explanations including evolution of bipedal locomotion, rapid brain growth, and nutritional changes and life style changes in settler communities have been proposed. The influences of human reproductive biology and sexual selection have rarely been considered to explain why maternal mortality persisted through human evolution. We entertain the hypothesis that irrespective of the causes, the risks of all factors causing maternal mortality would be aggravated by disassortative mating, specifically male preference for younger females who are generally small statured and at higher risk of obstetric complications. Maternal mortality arising due to sexual selection and mate choice would have the long-term effect of driving widowers toward younger women, often resulting in “child marriage,” which still remains a significant cause of maternal mortality globally. Evolutionarily, such a male driven mating system in polygamous human populations would have prolonged the persistence of maternal mortality despite selection acting against it. The effects may extend beyond maternal mortality because male-mate choice driven maternal mortality would reduce average reproductive life spans of women, thus influencing the evolution of menopause. ?

"Renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy for patients with renal tumours: A randomised controlled clinical trial protocol","2019","Introduction Partial nephrectomy is a standard of care for non-metastatic renal tumours when technically feasible. Despite the increased use of partial nephrectomy, intraoperative techniques that lead to optimal renal function after surgery have not been rigorously studied. Clamping of the renal hilum to prevent bleeding during resection causes temporary renal ischaemia. The internal temperature of the kidney may be lowered after the renal hilum is clamped (renal hypothermia) in an attempt to mitigate the effects of ischaemia. Our objective is to determine if renal hypothermia during open partial nephrectomy results in improved postoperative renal function at 12 months following surgery as compared with warm ischaemia (no renal hypothermia). Methods and analyses This is a multicentre, randomised, single-blinded controlled trial comparing renal hypothermia versus no hypothermia during open partial nephrectomy. Due to the nature of the intervention, complete blinding of the surgical team is not possible; however, surgeons will be blinded until the time of hilar clamping. Glomerular filtration will be based on plasma clearance of a radionucleotide, and differential renal function will be based on renal scintigraphy. The primary outcome is overall renal function at 12 months measured by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Secondary outcomes include change in GFR, GFR of the affected kidney, change in GFR of the affected kidney, serum creatinine, haemoglobin, spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio, quality of life and postoperative complications. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately postoperatively and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained for all participating study sites. Results of the trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Trial registration number NCT01529658; Pre-results. ?

"Multimorbidity risk assessment in adolescents and adults with cerebral palsy: a protocol for establishing a core outcome set for clinical research and practice","2019","Background: Estimates of multimorbidity, defined as the presence of at least two chronic conditions, some of which attributable to modifiable behaviours, are high in adults with cerebral palsy (CP). An assessment protocol evaluating multimorbidity risk is needed in order to develop and evaluate effective interventions to optimize lifelong health in individuals with CP. The aim of this protocol paper is to describe the development of a core outcome set (COS) for assessing multimorbidity risk in adolescents and adults with CP, to be used in clinic and research. Methods: The expert consortium will first define the target population and outcomes to be measured. Through a process of literature review and an international Delphi survey with expert clinicians and researchers, we will then determine which outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) can best measure those outcomes. The resulting OMIs will be used in a feasibility study with adolescents and adults with CP from an international clinical research network. Finally, a face-to-face stakeholder meeting with adolescents and adults with CP, their families/caregivers and researchers and clinicians who are experts in CP, will be organized to reach final agreement on the COS. Discussion: This COS will guide clinicians and researchers in assessing multimorbidity risk in adolescents and adults with CP. The inclusion of experts and individuals with CP from international locations for establishing the COS lends strong support to its generalizability. Evidence of its feasibility and approval from all stakeholders will enable implementation in clinical practice, and guide future research using the COS in individuals with CP. ? 2019 The Author(s).","accuracy; adolescence; Article; caregiver; cerebral palsy; clinical protocol; clinical research; decision making; Delphi study; feasibility study; human; information processing; medical literature; mental disease; multiple chronic conditions; online system; population research; risk assessment; risk factor; scoring system; systematic review; treatment planning; adolescent; adult; cerebral palsy; medical research; outcome assessment; sample size; Adolescent; Adult; Biomedical Research; Cerebral Palsy; Delphi Technique; Humans; Multimorbidity; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Risk Assessment; Sample Size"
"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Diagnostic Performance of BRAF V600E Immunohistochemistry in Thyroid Histopathology","2019","Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in evaluating thyroid surgical specimens may facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluation, with potential therapeutic implications. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the analytic validity of IHC in detecting BRAFV600E mutations in thyroid cancer (primary or metastatic). We screened citations from three electronic databases (until December 20, 2018), supplemented by a hand search of authors’ files and cross-references of reviews. Citations and full-text papers were independently reviewed in duplicate, and consensus was achieved on inclusion of papers. Two reviewers independently critically appraised and abstracted data from included papers. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted for sensitivity and specificity estimates. We reviewed 1499 unique citations and 93 full-text articles. We included 1 systematic review and 30 original articles. The published review (from 2015) needed to be updated as there were multiple subsequent original studies. The pooled sensitivity of IHC in detecting a BRAFV600E mutation was 96.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] at 94.1%, 98.3%) (29 studies, including 2659 BRAFV600E mutant tumors). The IHC pooled specificity was 86.3% (95% CI 80.7%, 90.4%) (28 studies, including 1107 BRAFV600E wild-type specimens). These meta-analyses were subject to statistically significant heterogeneity, partly explained by antibody type (sensitivity and specificity) and tissue/tumor type (specificity). In conclusion, BRAF IHC is highly sensitive and reasonably specific in detecting the BRAFV600E mutation; however, there is some variability in analytic performance. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","B Raf kinase; B Raf kinase; BRAF protein, human; glutamic acid; tumor marker; valine; analytic method; Article; BRAF gene; cancer tissue; citation analysis; consensus; gene mutation; genetic database; genetic heterogeneity; genetic identification; genetic variability; histopathology; human; immunohistochemistry; meta analysis; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; thyroid cancer; validity; amino acid substitution; cytodiagnosis; differential diagnosis; genetics; immunohistochemistry; metabolism; missense mutation; pathology; predictive value; procedures; prognosis; thyroid gland; thyroid nodule; thyroid tumor; Amino Acid Substitution; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cytodiagnosis; Diagnosis, Differential; Glutamic Acid; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Mutation, Missense; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Neoplasms; Thyroid Nodule; Valine"
"Impact of Psychoactive Drug Use on Developing Obesity among Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Diagnosis: A Nested Case-Control Study","2019","Background: Obesity in children on the autism spectrum (AS) is becoming a significant health concern. The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of obesity in a cohort of AS youth and to assess the impact of psychoactive medication use while exploring the second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) dose-response curve. Study Design: A nested case-control study was conducted using Quebec public administrative databases. Subjects with AS <18 years [?2 diagnoses International Classification of Diseases: 9th revision (ICD-9): 299.X] were identified (January 1993 to May 2011). Cases were defined as subjects with an obesity diagnosis (ICD-9: 278.X) during the coverage period and matched to 10 controls for age, gender, and follow-up duration. Potential risk factors for obesity (sociodemographic characteristics, other neuropsychiatric conditions, and psychoactive drug use) were evaluated and analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Results: From a cohort of 5369 AS subjects, we identified 135 obesity cases. Among the different risk factors, only SGAs [rate ratio (RR): 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.07] increased the probability of obesity in multivariate analysis. Exposure for ?12 months increased significantly the likelihood of obesity (RR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.18-3.42). Higher risk was observed with chlorpromazine-equivalent daily doses ?100 mg (RR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.00-4.84). Among SGA users, concomitant antidepressants (per 30-day exposure) slightly increased the probability (RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15). Conclusions: Longer and higher SGA exposure increased the risk of obesity, which has to be considered in relation to the paucity of evidence supporting long-term psychoactive medication use in AS children. Results highlight the need to promote optimal use and interventions to mitigate metabolic side effects of SGAs in this population. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",""
"The intersections of industry with the health research enterprise","2019","There is increased awareness of the negative impact of large multinational corporations - the 'industry' - on public health. These corporations have established different types of relationships with a number of actors in the field of health research. This Commentary explores the different types of relationships between the industry and the actors of health research, how they intersect with the different research steps, and how these relationships allow the industry to exert influence. The types of relationships discussed consist of funding of research, direct relationships with the actors of research (namely advocacy groups, funding agencies, experts, professional organisations, regulatory agencies and health practitioners), and the influencing research standards. The potentially influenced research steps either precede the research (i.e. the prioritisation of research question), relate to it directly (i.e. its planning, conduct, reporting, dissemination and evaluation), or build on it (i.e. regulatory approval, integration into guidelines and adoption into practice). In conclusion, the industry has successfully fostered relationships with almost every actor of the health research enterprise and is using these relationships to influence the different steps of health research. The degree of influence the industry is having on health research calls for more work on managing the relationships discussed herein. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adoption; advocacy group; article; awareness; funding; health practitioner; human; medical research; medical society; practice guideline; commercial phenomena; financial management; health care planning; industry; public health; public relations; stakeholder engagement; Biomedical Research; Commerce; Health Priorities; Humans; Industry; Interinstitutional Relations; Public Health; Research Support as Topic; Stakeholder Participation"
"Relation between socioeconomic variables and surgical, systemic and radiation treatment in a cohort of patients with breast cancer in an urban Canadian centre","2019","Background: Studies have shown an association between socioeconomic status and breast cancer treatment. We examined the relation between socioeconomic status and the treatment of breast cancer (surgical, systemic and radiation) in a universal health care system. Method: Data from a single urban Canadian centre were collected for consecutive patients who received a diagnosis of breast cancer from January 2010 to December 2011. Variables included patient and disease factors, surgery type, systemic and radiation treatment, and breast reconstruction. Socioeconomic variables were obtained from 2006 Canadian census data. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of breast cancer treatment. Results: A total of 721 patients were treated for breast cancer during the study period. Socioeconomic variables were not related to type of breast surgery for breast cancer. Age less than 50 years, having a frst-degree relative with breast cancer and income status were predictors of breast reconstruction. Employment status was a consistent predictor of systemic and radiation treatment. Conclusion: Employment consistently predicted systemic and radiation treatment, and age and income were predictors of breast reconstruction in a universal health care system. Further research is required to determine precisely how socioeconomic factors affect care and to minimize possible disparities in delivery of health care services. ? 2019 IWA Publishing.","adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adult; age; aged; breast reconstruction; breast tumor; Canada; economics; female; health care disparity; hospital; human; mastectomy; middle aged; pathology; retrospective study; socioeconomics; statistical model; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Canada; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hospitals, Urban; Humans; Logistic Models; Mammaplasty; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Universal Health Care"
"Risk of Hospital Admissions in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with multiple comorbidities and various adverse outcome events, suggesting a high risk of hospital admissions in this patient population. However, its exact incidence and potential underlying causes are not well defined. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for hospital admissions in patients with AF. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for studies providing information on all-cause hospital admissions. Studies were included if they provided information on the incidence of all-cause hospital admissions in ? 100 patients with AF, and had ? 1 year of follow-up. Incidence estimates were pooled using random-effects models. Meta-regression analysis was performed to identify characteristics associated with between-study heterogeneity. Results: Thirty-five studies (n = 311,314 patients) were included. The pooled incidence of all-cause hospital admissions was 43.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.5-48.9; I2 = 99.9%) per 100 person-years. In 24 studies (n = 234,028 patients) that provided information on admission causes, cardiovascular hospitalizations were more common than noncardiovascular hospitalizations (pooled incidence 26.3 [95% CI, 22.7-29.9; I2 = 99.9%] vs 15.7 [95% CI, 12.5-18.9; I2 = 99.8%] per 100 person-years). In meta-regression analyses, older age (β = 1.4 [95% CI, 0.33-2.53], P = 0.01, R2 = 15.7%) and prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease (β = 1.5 [95% CI, 0.57-2.45], P = 0.005, R2 = 49.8%) were associated with an increased rate of all-cause hospital admissions. Conclusions: Patients with AF have a very high risk of being admitted to the hospital, both for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes. The development and implementation of preventive strategies should be a public health priority. ? 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society","all cause mortality; atrial fibrillation; chronic lung disease; confidence interval; follow up; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; meta analysis; morbidity; prevalence; Review; risk factor; systematic review"
"Lipoprotein(a): An independent, genetic, and causal factor for cardiovascular disease and acute myocardial infarction","2019","Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a circulating lipoprotein, and its level is largely determined by variation in the Lp(a) gene (LPA) locus encoding apo(a). Genetic variation in the LPA gene that increases Lp(a) level also increases coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, suggesting that Lp(a) is a causal factor for CAD risk. Lp(a) is the preferential lipoprotein carrier for oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), a proatherogenic and proinflammatory biomarker. Lp(a) adversely affects endothelial function, inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrinolysis, and plaque stability, leading to accelerated atherothrombosis and premature CAD. The INTER-HEART Study has established the usefulness of Lp(a) in assessing the risk of acute myocardial infarction in ethnically diverse populations with South Asians having the highest risk and population attributable risk. The 2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guideline have recognized elevated Lp(a) as an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk enhancer for initiating or intensifying statin therapy. ? 2019","acetylsalicylic acid; apolipoprotein A1; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipoprotein A; phospholipid; proprotein convertase 9; lipoprotein A; acute coronary syndrome; acute heart infarction; aortic valve calcification; apheresis; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical assessment; clinical practice; copy number variation; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery recanalization; disease burden; disease exacerbation; ethnic difference; fibrinolysis; genetic risk; genetic trait; genetic variation; heart failure; heart infarction; heredity; high risk population; human; immunoassay; lipoprotein blood level; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; prognosis; recurrence risk; restenosis; Review; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; thrombosis; vascular disease; cardiovascular disease; genetics; genome-wide association study; Southeast Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Cardiovascular Diseases; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Lipoprotein(a); Myocardial Infarction; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors"

"Incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids into human skeletal muscle sarcolemmal and mitochondrial membranes following 12 weeks of fish oil supplementation","2019","Fish oil (FO) supplementation in humans results in the incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C20:6) into skeletal muscle membranes. However, despite the importance of membrane composition in structure–function relationships, a paucity of information exists regarding how different muscle membranes/organelles respond to FO supplementation. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the effects 12 weeks of FO supplementation (3g EPA/2g DHA daily) on the phospholipid composition of sarcolemmal and mitochondrial fractions, as well as whole muscle responses, in healthy young males. FO supplementation increased the total phospholipid content in whole muscle (57%; p < 0.05) and the sarcolemma (38%; p = 0.05), but did not alter the content in mitochondria. The content of omega-3 FAs, EPA and DHA, were increased (+3-fold) in whole muscle, and mitochondrial membranes, and as a result the omega-6/omega-3 ratios were dramatically decreased (-3-fold), while conversely the unsaturation indexes were increased. Intriguingly, before supplementation the unsaturation index (UI) of sarcolemmal membranes was ?3 times lower (p < 0.001) than either whole muscle or mitochondrial membranes. While supplementation also increased DHA within sarcolemmal membranes, EPA was not altered, and as a result the omega-6/omega-3 ratio and UI of these membranes were not altered. All together, these data revealed that mitochondrial and sarcolemmal membranes display unique phospholipid compositions and responses to FO supplementation.

"Loss-of-function mutations in the melanocortin-3 receptor gene confer risk for human obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","The association between rare coding loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the melanocortin receptor 3 (MC3R) gene and human obesity is controversial. To fill this gap of knowledge, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic association studies in all ages and ethnicities. Two reviewers independently performed risk of bias assessment and extracted data. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Preview, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses, and reference lists of relevant studies. All case-control, cross-sectional, prospective, and retrospective studies that evaluated prevalence of rare (less than 1% frequency) coding partial/complete LOF mutations in MC3R among individuals with obesity and normal weight were included. Our systematic search identified 1925 references relevant to the present review. Six studies were deemed eligible. Meta-analysis of 2969 individuals with obesity and 2572 with normal weight showed a positive association between rare heterozygous coding partial/complete LOF mutations in MC3R and obesity in children and adults of European, North African, and Asian ancestries (odds ratio?=?3.07; 95% CI, 1.48-7.00; P?=?4.2?×?10?3). Our data demonstrates that rare partial/complete LOF mutations in the coding region of MC3R confer three-time increased risk of obesity in humans, and implies that rare genetic variants with intermediate effects contribute to the missing heritability of obesity. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","melanocortin 3 receptor; Article; Asian; body weight; ethnicity; European; genetic association; genetic code; genetic risk; genetic variability; heritability; human; loss of function mutation; meta analysis; North African; obesity; prevalence; systematic review"
"Interferon regulatory factor 3-mediated signaling limits middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus propagation in cells from an insectivorous bat","2019","Insectivorous bats are speculated to be ancestral hosts of Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV). MERS-CoV causes disease in humans with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta (IFNβ) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFNβin bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Computerised adaptive testing accurately predicts CLEFT-Q scores by selecting fewer, more patient-focused questions","2019","Background: The International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement (ICHOM) has recently agreed upon a core outcome set for the comprehensive appraisal of cleft care, which puts a greater emphasis on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and, in particular, the CLEFT-Q. The CLEFT-Q comprises 12 scales with a total of 110 items, aimed to be answered by children as young as 8 years old. Objective: In this study, we aimed to use computerised adaptive testing (CAT) to reduce the number of items needed to predict results for each CLEFT-Q scale. Method: We used an open-source CAT simulation package to run item responses over each of the full-length scales and its CAT counterpart at varying degrees of precision, estimated by standard error (SE). The mean number of items needed to achieve a given SE was recorded for each scale's CAT, and the correlations between results from the full-length scales and those predicted by the CAT versions were calculated. Results: Using CATs for each of the 12 CLEFT-Q scales, we reduced the number of questions that participants needed to answer, that is, from 110 to a mean of 43.1 (range 34–60, SE < 0.55) while maintaining a 97% correlation between scores obtained with CAT and full-length scales. Conclusions: CAT is likely to play a fundamental role in the uptake of PROMs into clinical practice given the high degree of accuracy achievable with substantially fewer items. ? 2019 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons","article; clinical practice; computerized adaptive testing; human; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; school child; simulation"
"Nutrition for ultramarathon running: Trail, track, and road","2019","Ultramarathon running events and participation numbers have increased progressively over the past three decades. Besides the exertion of prolonged running with or without a loaded pack, such events are often associated with challenging topography, environmental conditions, acute transient lifestyle discomforts, and/or event-related health complications. These factors create a scenario for greater nutritional needs, while predisposing ultramarathon runners to multiple nutritional intake barriers. The current review aims to explore the physiological and nutritional demands of ultramarathon running and provide general guidance on nutritional requirements for ultramarathon training and competition, including aspects of race nutrition logistics. Research outcomes suggest that daily dietary carbohydrates (up to 12 g·kg?1·day?1) and multiple-transportable carbohydrate intake (?90 g·hr?1 for running distances ?3 hr) during exercise support endurance training adaptations and enhance real-time endurance performance. Whether these intake rates are tolerable during ultramarathon competition is questionable from a practical and gastrointestinal perspective. Dietary protocols, such as glycogen manipulation or low-carbohydrate high-fat diets, are currently popular among ultramarathon runners. Despite the latter dietary manipulation showing increased total fat oxidation rates during submaximal exercise, the role in enhancing ultramarathon running performance is currently not supported. Ultramarathon runners may develop varying degrees of both hypohydration and hyperhydration (with accompanying exercise-associated hyponatremia), dependent on event duration, and environmental conditions. To avoid these two extremes, euhydration can generally be maintained through “drinking to thirst.” A well practiced and individualized nutrition strategy is required to optimize training and competition performance in ultramarathon running events, whether they are single stage or multistage. ? 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.","aerobic capacity; Article; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; carbohydrate intake; competition; dehydration; endurance training; gastrointestinal symptom; human; hydration status; lipid diet; low carbohydrate diet; marathon runner; nutritional requirement; oxidation; sleep deprivation; sports medicine; thermoregulation; adaptation; administration and dosage; athlete; athletic performance; drinking; endurance; nutrition; physiology; running; Adaptation, Physiological; Athletes; Athletic Performance; Dietary Carbohydrates; Drinking; Humans; Nutritional Requirements; Physical Endurance; Running; Sports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"

"Rationale and methods of an Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Community Paramedicine at Home (CP@home) program for frequent users of emergency medical services in multiple Ontario regions: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","2019","Background: Frequent users of emergency medical services for issues that could be more appropriately managed through non-urgent care deplete the limited resources of the health-care system. Community paramedicine is an emerging field that extends the role of paramedics beyond the traditional emergency response. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the impact of a community paramedicine home-visit intervention with frequent users on reducing ambulance calls, hospital visits, and admissions. The study will also provide a cross-sectional description of the characteristics of frequent users of emergency medical services. Methods/design: An open-label, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial with parallel intervention and control groups will be conducted in four paramedic services in Ontario. The sample size has been calculated as 261 per group for a 25% reduction in ambulance calls. Eligible participants will be frequent callers (three or more calls in 6 months), individuals who call for at least one lift assist, or individuals referred to the program by a paramedic. Individuals will be randomly allocated to receive either the Community Paramedicine at Home (CP@home) program intervention or their usual care (control). Intervention participants will receive up to three visits from a community paramedic, who will conduct health risk assessments, provide health promotion and education, provide referrals to local resources, and fax reports back to the family physician. Data will be collected from administrative databases (e.g., paramedic services), a custom CP@home program database, participant surveys, and key informant interviews. An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted, including descriptive statistics and multi-level modeling to find factors predictive of primary and secondary outcomes. A thematic analysis will be used to analyze the qualitative outcomes. An economic analysis will consider the cost-effectiveness of the program. Discussion: CP@home has the potential to reduce the health-care system burden significantly by targeting current frequent users of emergency medical services. By targeting this population, CP@home aims to decrease ambulance calls and emergency department visits, reducing health-care costs and improving the quality of life of a vulnerable population. If successful, CP@home will inform the development of community paramedicine policies and the expanding role of paramedics in regions across Canada.

"A review of materials for managing bone loss in revision total knee arthroplasty","2019","In 2014–2015, 61,421 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were performed in Canada; an increase of about 20% over 2000–2001. Revision total knee arthroplasties (rTKAs) accounted for 6.8% of TKAs performed between 2014 and 2015, and this is estimated to grow another 12% by 2025. rTKAs are typically more complicated than primary TKAs due to the significant loss of femoral and tibial bone stock. The escalating demand and limitations associated with total knee arthroplasty and their revision drives the development of novel treatments. A variety of materials have been utilized to facilitate regeneration of healthy bone around the site of a knee arthroplasty. The selection of these materials is based on the bone defect size and includes bone grafts, graft substitutes and cements. However, all these materials have certain disadvantages such as blood loss, disease transmission (bone grafts), inflammatory response, insufficient mechanical properties (bone graft substitutes) thermal necrosis and stress shielding (bone cement). Recently, the use of metal augments for large bone defects has attracted attention, however they can undergo fretting, corrosion, and stress shielding. All things considered, this review indicates the necessity of developing augments that have structural integrities and biodegradation rates similar to that of human bone. Therefore, the future of bone loss management may lie in fabricating novel bioactive glass augments as they can promote bone healing and implant stability and can degrade with time. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arthroplasty; Bioactive glass; Biodegradation; Defects; Fretting corrosion; Grafting (chemical); Mechanical properties; Orthopedics; Shielding; Augments; Biodegradation rate; Bone graft substitutes; Bone loss; Disease transmission; Inflammatory response; rTKAs; Total knee arthroplasty; Bone; bone cement; animal; bone; bone transplantation; human; knee prosthesis; knee replacement; metabolic bone disease; procedures; prostheses and orthoses; Animals; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Bone and Bones; Bone Cements; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Bone Transplantation; Humans; Knee Prosthesis; Prostheses and Implants"
"Comparison of outcomes and costs between adult diabetic ketoacidosis patients admitted to the ICU and step-down unit","2019","Purpose: There is wide variation in the utilization of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds for treatment and monitoring of adult patients with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). We sought to compare the outcomes and hospital costs of adult DKA patients admitted to ICUs as compared to those admitted to step-down units. Materials and methods: We included consecutive adult patients from two hospitals with a diagnosis of DKA. Patients were either admitted to the ICU, or a step-down unit, which has a nurse-to-patient ratio of 2:1, but does not have capability for mechanical ventilation or administration of vasoactive agents. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: We included 872 patients in the analysis. 71 (8.1%) were admitted to ICU, while 801 (91.9%) were admitted to a step-down unit. We found no difference in in-hospital mortality between patients admitted to the ICU and those admitted to the step-down unit (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87–2.64). Mean total hospital costs were significantly higher for patients admitted to the ICU ($20,428 vs. $6484, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Adult DKA patients admitted to a step-down unit had comparable in-hospital mortality and lower hospital costs as compared to those admitted to the ICU. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","bicarbonate; glucose; insulin; adult; anion gap; Article; artificial ventilation; bicarbonate blood level; cost effectiveness analysis; diabetic ketoacidosis; female; glucose blood level; health care cost; health care facility; health service; hospital mortality; human; imaging; intensive care unit; laboratory test; long term care; major clinical study; male"
"Protein arginine methyltransferase biology in humans during acute and chronic skeletal muscle plasticity","2019","Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of arginine residues on target proteins. While dysregulation of PRMTs has been documented in a number of the most prevalent diseases, our understanding of PRMT biology in human skeletal muscle is limited. This study served to address this knowledge gap by exploring PRMT expression and function in human skeletal muscle in vivo and characterizing PRMT biology in response to acute and chronic stimuli for muscle plasticity. Fourteen untrained, healthy men performed one session of sprint interval exercise (SIE) before completing four bouts of SIE per week for 6 wk as part of a sprint interval training (SIT) program. Throughout this time course, multiple muscle biopsies were collected. We found that at basal, resting conditions PRMT1, PRMT4, PRMT5, and PRMT7 were the most abundantly expressed PRMT mRNAs in human quadriceps muscle. Additionally, the broad subcellular distribution pattern of PRMTs suggests methyltransferase activity throughout human myofibers. A spectrum of PRMT-specific inductions, and decrements, in expression and activity were observed in response to acute and chronic cues for muscle plasticity. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PRMTs are present and active in human skeletal muscle in vivo and that there are distinct, enzyme-specific responses and adaptations in PRMT biology to acute and chronic stimuli for muscle plasticity. This work advances our understanding of this critical family of enzymes in humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first report of protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) biology in human skeletal muscle in vivo. We observed that PRMT1, -4, -5, and -7 were the most abundant PRMT mRNAs in human muscle and that PRMT proteins exhibited a broad subcellular localization that included myonuclear, cytosolic, and sarcolemmal compartments. Acute exercise and chronic training evoked PRMT-specific alterations in expression and activity. This study reveals a hitherto unknown complexity to PRMT biology in human muscle.

"Canadian expert consensus: management of hypersensitivity reactions to intravenous iron in adults","2019","Background and Objectives: Rare but potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions can occur during the administration of intravenous iron. To provide guidance to healthcare professionals caring for adults receiving intravenous iron, a panel of 10 Canadian clinical experts developed a practical algorithm for the identification and management of hypersensitivity reactions to intravenous iron. Materials and methods: A systematic search of PubMed to February 2018 was performed. Articles related to hypersensitivity reactions were selected for review. The algorithm was developed during a 1-day live meeting based on the literature review and clinical expertise where evidence was lacking. The algorithm was then refined through an iterative process involving a web-based platform and virtual meetings. Results: The algorithm provides guidance to healthcare professionals in preparing for and administering IV iron, as well as recognizing and managing hypersensitivity reactions to intravenous iron. Considerations for re-challenging patients who have experienced prior reactions are provided. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of patients receiving intravenous iron should be trained to anticipate, recognize and manage hypersensitivity reactions to intravenous iron to optimize patient care. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Plasmalogen loss caused by remodeling deficiency in mitochondria","2019","Lipid homeostasis is crucial in human health. Barth syndrome (BTHS), a life-threatening disease typically diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and neutropenia, is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial transacylase tafazzin. By high-resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with cryoprobe technology, recently we found a dramatic loss of choline plasmalogen in the tafazzin-knockdown (TAZ-KD) mouse heart, besides observing characteristic cardiolipin (CL) alterations in BTHS. In inner mitochondrial membrane where tafazzin locates, CL and diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine are known to be essential via lipid–protein interactions reflecting their cone shape for integrity of respiratory chain supercomplexes and cristae ultrastructure. Here, we investigate the TAZ-KD brain, liver, kidney, and lymphoblast from patients compared with controls. We identified common yet markedly cell type–dependent losses of ethanolamine plasmalogen as the dominant plasmalogen class therein. Tafazzin function thus critically relates to homeostasis of plasmalogen, which in the ethanolamine class has conceivably analogous and more potent molecular functions in mitochondria than diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine. The present discussion of a loss of plasmalogen–protein interaction applies to other diseases with mitochondrial plasmalogen loss and aberrant forms of this organelle, including Alzheimer’s disease. ? 2019 Kimura et al.",""
"Exploring the association between number, severity, location of fracture, and occiput-to-wall distance","2019","Summary: This study of women with a suspected vertebral fracture determined the association between vertebral fracture characteristics and posture. The number of fractures was associated with posture. Severity of fracture was associated with posture when adjusting for pain. Fracture characteristics explain some variability in posture in women with a suspected vertebral fracture. Purpose: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. An accumulation of vertebral fractures may lead to forward head posture, which has been independently associated with mortality. It is unclear how fracture characteristics, including the number, severity, and location of fracture, contribute to occiput-to-wall distance (OWD). Methods: This was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial, in community-dwelling women aged 65?years and older with a suspected vertebral fragility fracture. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were used to determine the number, location, and severity of fracture. Occiput-to-wall distance (OWD) was used to assess forward head posture. Pain during movement (0–10 scale) and age were considered as confounding variables. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate relationships between fracture variables and OWD. Results: Participants (n = 158) were of mean age 75.9 (SD 6.5) years with a mean (SD) BMI = 26.7 (5.3) kg/m 2 , OWD = 5.7 (4.6) cm, and number of fractures = 2.4 (2.4). In unadjusted analyses, the number of fractures (B = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.04, 1.59) was associated with OWD. When adjusting for pain, severity of fractures (B = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.001, 2.15) was independently associated with OWD. Location was not associated with OWD in any of the models. Conclusions: The number of fractures was significantly associated with OWD in the unadjusted model, explaining more of the variability in OWD than other fracture characteristics. Severity of fracture was associated with OWD in the adjusted model. However, pain may confound the relationship between OWD and fracture characteristics. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","bone density conservation agent; aged; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; clinical practice; comorbidity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; fragility fracture; heart disease; human; hypertension; lumbar region; lumbar spine; major clinical study; morbidity; mortality; musculoskeletal function; occiput to wall distance; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; pain severity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; spine fracture; treatment outcome; body position; diagnostic imaging; injury scale; lumbar vertebra; occipital bone; pathophysiology; radiography; randomized controlled trial (topic); spine fracture; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Occipital Bone; Osteoporotic Fractures; Posture; Radiography; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Spinal Fractures; Trauma Severity Indices"
"Rock Climber Self-Rescue Skills","2019","Introduction: Rock climbing involves some inherent danger, and rock climbers should be able to carry out basic rescue techniques for their own safety. This study seeks to assess such abilities by examining self-rescue skills in a cohort of rock climbers. Methods: Climbers who participate in multipitch sport or traditional climbing styles were recruited via posters at a local climbing gym and on social media. Participants completed a survey assessing climbing history and confidence in their rescue skills and then were evaluated on 3 rescue scenarios in an indoor, standardized setting. Scenario pass rates were calculated and compared with rescue skill confidence on the survey. Results: Twenty-five climbers participated in the study. Mean confidence in rescue skills varied from 4 to 4.5 (on a 7-point scale). The pass rates for the 3 scenarios were 28%, 68%, and 52%. Only 24% of climbers passed all 3 scenarios. Surveyed confidence in rescue skills and pass rate statistically correlated in only 1 scenario. Conclusions: Self-rescue skills were generally lacking in our study population. Climber confidence, experience, training, and climbing frequency did not appear to be associated with a higher level of rescue skills. Self-rescue skills should be emphasized in climbing instruction and courses to increase overall safety. ? 2018 Wilderness Medical Society","accident; adult; article; human; mountaineering; rock climbing; skill; social media; female; first aid; information processing; male; questionnaire; sport injury; young adult; Adult; Athletic Injuries; Data Collection; Female; First Aid; Humans; Male; Mountaineering; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Social capital and self-rated health: A cross-sectional study of the general social survey data comparing rural and urban adults in Ontario","2019","The concept of social capital shows great promise for its potential to influence individual and population health. Yet challenges persist in defining and measuring social capital, and little is known about the mechanisms that link social capital and health. This paper reports on the quantitative phase of a sequential explanatory mixed methods study using data from Canada's 2013 General Social Survey (data collected 2013–14). An exploratory factor analysis revealed six underlying dimensions of social capital for 7,187 adults living in Ontario, Canada. These factors included trust in people, neighbourhood social capital, trust in institutions, sense of belonging, civic engagement, and social network size. A logistic regression indicated that having high Trust in People and Trust in Institutions were associated with better mental health while high Trust in Institutions, Sense of Belonging, and Civic Engagement were associated with better physical health. When comparing rural and urban residents, there were no differences in their self-reported health, nor did social capital influence their health any differently, despite rural residents having higher social capital scores. The study findings are important for understanding the nature of social capital and how it influences health, and provide direction for targeted health promotion strategies. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; exploratory factor analysis; female; health promotion; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mental health; neighborhood; Ontario; quantitative analysis; rural population; social capital; social network; trust; urban population"
"Interventions for displaced radial head fractures: network meta-analysis of randomized trials","2019","Background: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of studies comparing treatments for displaced radial head fractures (RHFs) and perform a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched electronic databases and reviewed the reference lists of included studies and prior systematic reviews. We included RCTs and cohort studies that (1) compared treatments for displaced RHFs in adults and (2) reported a functional outcome or postoperative complications. Data from RCTs were synthesized using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. We compared the proportion of patients categorized as “excellent” or “good” according to the Broberg and Morrey scale and the rate of postoperative complications using odds ratios (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Results: We included 20 studies (4 RCTs). The evidence from RCTs examined radial head arthroplasty (RHA), open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with metal implants (ORIF-M), and ORIF with biodegradable implants (ORIF-B). The network meta-analysis demonstrated that patients treated with an RHA had greater odds of achieving an “excellent” or “good” score compared with ORIF-M (OR, 22.5; 95% CrI, 2.73-299.58) and ORIF-B (OR, 11.83; 95% CrI, 0.58-324.57). For postoperative complications, RHA patients had a lower odds of experiencing a complication than ORIF-M (OR, 0.15; 95% CrI, 0.01-1.81) and ORIF-B (OR, 0.16; 95% CrI, 0.01-3.06) patients. Conclusion: The network meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that RHA results in better function and reduced postoperative complications than ORIF-M and ORIF-B over 2 years in the treatment of displaced RHFs. ? 2018","arthroplasty; Broberg Morrey score; cohort analysis; conservative treatment; excision; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; meta analysis; musculoskeletal disease assessment; network meta-analysis; open reduction (procedure); osteosynthesis; postoperative complication; priority journal; radial head arthroplasty; radius head fracture; randomized controlled trial (topic); replacement arthroplasty; Review; scoring system; silastic replacement; systematic review; arthroplasty; comparative study; devices; open fracture reduction; postoperative complication; procedures; radius fracture; Arthroplasty; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Open Fracture Reduction; Postoperative Complications; Radius Fractures; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
"Evaluating an innovative elearning pain education interprofessional resource: A pre-post study","2019","Objective. The challenges of moving the pain education agenda forward are significant worldwide, and resources, including online, are needed to help educators in curriculum development. Online resources are available but with insufficient evaluation in the context of prelicensure pain education. Therefore, this pre-post study examined the impact of an innovative eLearning model: the Pain Education Interprofessional Resource (PEIR) on usability, pain knowledge, beliefs, and understanding of pain assessment skills including empathy. Methods. Participants were students (N ? 96) recruited from seven prelicensure health sciences programs at the University of Toronto. They worked through three multifaceted modules, developed by an interprofessional team, that followed a patient with acute to persistent postsurgical pain up to one year. Module objectives, content, and assessment were based on International Association for the Study of Pain Pain Curricula domains and related pain core competencies. Multimedia interactive components focused on pain mechanisms and key pain care issues. Outcome measures included previously validated tools; data were analyzed in SPSS. Online exercises provided concurrent individual feedback throughout all modules. Results. The completion rate for modules and online assessments was 100%. Overall usability scores (SD) were strong 4.27/5 (0.56). On average, pain knowledge scores increased 20% (P < 0.001). The Pain Assessment Skills Tool was sensitive to differences in student and expert pain assessment evaluation ratings and was useful as a tool to deliver formative feedback while engaged in interactive eLearning about pain assessment. Conclusions. PEIR is an effective eLearning program with high student ratings for educational design and usability that significantly improved pain knowledge and understanding of collaborative care. ? 2017 American Academy of Pain Medicine.","Article; clinical competence; education program; health belief; human; medical education; outcome assessment; pain assessment; postoperative pain; public-private partnership; sensitivity analysis; adult; curriculum; female; male; pain; pain measurement; pathophysiology; procedures; program evaluation; public relations; teaching; young adult; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Female; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Male; Pain; Pain Measurement; Program Evaluation; Young Adult"
"Cost-Effectiveness of Osimertinib in Treating Newly Diagnosed, Advanced EGFR-Mutation-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","2019","Background: The objective of this study was to assess cost and effectiveness of osimertinib in treating newly diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation from a public payer's perspective in the U.S. and China. Materials and Methods: Markov models were developed to compare three treatment strategies: first-line use of osimertinib, first-line use of the standard first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) followed by the second-line use of osimertinib, and the standard first-generation EGFR-TKI therapy (standard care [SOC]). Clinical data, cost, and utility data were mainly derived from published literatures. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) between the treatments. Results: The resultant incremental cost per QALY gained for the first-line osimertinib versus SOC was $312,903 in the U.S. and $41,512 in China. The incremental cost per QALY for the second-line osimertinib versus SOC was $284,532 in the U.S. and $38,860 in China. The probability of the SOC strategy being cost-effective is 1.0 if the willingness to pay threshold is below $150,000/QALY in the U.S. and below $30,000/QALY in China. Conclusion: Osimertinib as first-line treatment could gain more health benefits in comparison with standard EGFR-TKIs or second-line use of osimertinib. However, because of the high cost of treatment, the cost-effectiveness analyses were not in favor of the first-line use of osimertinib from a public payer's perspective in the U.S. and China. Implications for Practice: Osimertinib as first-line treatment yielded the greatest health outcomes but is not a cost-effective strategy for lung cancer in the U.S. and China. The price of osimertinib has a substantial impact on economic outcomes. ?

"Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of noncontrast MRI in the evaluation of suspected appendiceal abscesses in children","2019","Background: Noncontrast MRI has been shown to be feasible in children with postappendectomy abscesses and helps guide clinical management, but its role in preoperative appendiceal abscesses is unclear. Purpose: To determine the cost-effectiveness and impact on clinical management of noncontrast MRI in pediatric patients with suspected appendiceal abscess, both pre- and postappendectomy. Study Type: Retrospective cohort study. Population: In all, 82 children under the age of 18 years with suspected appendiceal abscess on ultrasound. Field Strength/Sequence: Diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo imaging of the abdomen and pelvis at 1.5T and 3T. Assessment: The presence, location, size, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of fluid collections and the presence of a drainage path was noted by three pediatric radiologists. Imaging time, completeness of the exam, and impact on clinical management was recorded. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for MRI relative to CT, taking into account hospital charges, radiation exposure, and risk of adverse reaction to iodinated contrast. Statistical Tests: Descriptive statistics were used. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss' kappa were used to assess interobserver variation. Proportions were compared using Fisher's exact test (statistical significance at P &lt; 0.05). Results: MRI confirmed the presence of collections in most cases, with alternative diagnosis established in 10 patients (Tubo-ovarian abscess n = 7, Crohn's disease, ileal anastomotic leak, and Birkitts lymphoma each n = 1). MRI showed the presence of a safe drainage pathway in 92–97% of pelvic abscesses and 86–98% of abdominal abscesses compared with 7–10% and 75–81%, respectively, for ultrasound. MR was cost-effective compared with CT, taking into account the direct charges, risk of radiation induced cancer, and adverse reaction to iodinated contrast.

"Sex Differences in the Association Between Cannabis Use and Suicidal Ideation and Attempts, Depression, and Psychological Distress Among Canadians [Diff?rences entre les sexes dans l'association entre l'utilisation du cannabis et la d?tresse psychologique, la d?pression et les comportements suicidaires chez les Canadiens]","2019","Background: Depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders are leading causes of morbidity worldwide. The most commonly used illicit substance is cannabis and there is some evidence that the association between cannabis use and poor mental health is more pronounced among females compared with males. This analysis examines sex differences in the association between cannabis use and major depressive episode (MDE), suicidal thoughts and attempts, and psychological distress. Methods: This study uses data from the 2002 and 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey’s Mental Health Component, repeated cross-sectional surveys of nationally representative samples of Canadians 15 years of age and older (n = 43,466). Linear and binary logistic regressions were performed, applying weighting and bootstrapping. Results: There were significant sex differences in the strength of the association between cannabis use and suicidal thoughts and attempts and psychological distress, but not MDE. Females who reported using cannabis occasionally (defined as 1 to 4 times a week) reported higher levels of psychological distress than their male counterparts. Females who reported using regularly (defined as more than once per week) reported higher levels of psychological distress and were more likely to report suicidal thoughts and attempts. Conclusions: Future research is needed to further our understanding of the nature of these sex differences. Public health messaging should incorporate being female as a potential risk factor for the co-occurrence of cannabis use and emotional problems, particularly at higher frequencies of use. Clinicians should also be aware of this association to better inform integrated mental health and substance use screening, discussions, and care, particularly for female patients. ?

"Can behavioral strategies increase physical activity and influence depressive symptoms and quality of life among children with epilepsy? Results of a randomized controlled trial","2019","Purpose: This study examined whether increasing physical activity (PA) through 6 months of behavioral counseling positively influenced depressive symptoms and quality of life (QoL) over 12 months among children with epilepsy (CWE). Methods: A longitudinal multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 8–14-year-old children with active epilepsy. Participants wore a pedometer to track daily PA and completed 3 measures at 4 time points to examine depressive symptoms and QoL. Stratified by site and activity level, participants were randomized to an intervention or control group. The 6-month intervention included 11 behavioral counseling sessions targeting self-regulation of PA. To assess the associations among PA, depression scores, and QoL, primary analysis involved mixed-effects models. Results: We recruited 122 CWE, of whom 115 were randomized (M age = 11 ± 2; 50% female) and included in the analysis. The intervention did not increase PA in the treatment compared with the control group. No differences were found between groups over time during the subsequent 6 months, where PA decreased among all participants. Results did not show differences between the groups and over time for measures of depressive symptoms and QoL. Significance: The intervention did not improve or sustain PA levels over 12 months. Both groups demonstrated declines in PA over one year, but there were no changes in depression scores or QoL. As most participants were already nearly reaching the Canadian average of step counts of children their age, with a baseline daily step count of over 9000, there may be a challenge for further increasing PA over a longer period. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; behavior therapy; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; controlled study; depression; depression assessment; disease association; epilepsy; female; health care quality; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; patient counseling; physical activity; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; self monitoring; treatment duration"
"Tip of the Iceberg: Assessing the Global Socioeconomic Costs of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and Strategic Implications for Stakeholders","2019","While it is generally understood that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is one of the costliest diseases to society, there is widespread concern that researchers and policymakers are not comprehensively capturing and describing the full scope and magnitude of the socioeconomic burden of ADRD. This review aimed to 1) catalogue the different types of AD-related socioeconomic costs described in the literature; 2) assess the challenges and gaps of existing approaches to measuring these costs; and 3) analyze and discuss the implications for stakeholders including policymakers, healthcare systems, associations, advocacy groups, clinicians, and researchers looking to improve the ability to generate reliable data that can guide evidence-based decision making. A centrally emergent theme from this review is that it is challenging to gauge the true value of policies, programs, or interventions in the ADRD arena given the long-term, progressive nature of the disease, its insidious socioeconomic impact beyond the patient and the formal healthcare system, and the complexities and current deficiencies (in measures and real-world data) in accurately calculating the full costs to society. There is therefore an urgent need for all stakeholders to establish a common understanding of the challenges in evaluating the full cost of ADRD and define approaches that allow us to measure these costs more accurately, with a view to prioritizing evidence-based solutions to mitigate this looming public health crisis. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Health care utilization by people with HIV on release from provincial prison in Ontario, Canada in 2010: a retrospective cohort study","2019","Limited evidence suggests that at the time of release from prison, people with HIV face barriers to health care, which may contribute to worsening HIV clinical outcomes. We aimed to describe health care utilization for people with HIV released from provincial prison in Ontario in 2010, and to compare rates of use with prisoner and general population controls. We used Ontario’s administrative health records and data from the Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services on all persons released from provincial prison in 2010. We matched each person with HIV released from provincial prison by age and sex with three controls in each of three groups: people with no HIV released from provincial prison, people with HIV in the general population, and people with no HIV in the general population. We compared rates of use of primary care, non-primary ambulatory care, emergency departments, and hospitalization in the year after the first release from provincial prison in 2010 and in the corresponding period for matched controls. We identified 330 persons with HIV released from provincial prison in 2010. Their median time to first HIV-ambulatory care visit after prison release was 177 days (SD 136–239). Compared to all control groups, people with HIV released from provincial prison had higher rates of primary care use, unscheduled emergency department visits and hospital admissions at 30, 90 and 365 days after release. People with HIV released from provincial prison have a long time to first contact with HIV ambulatory care, and higher rates of health care utilization across health care settings. Interventions are required to facilitate post-release linkage to care for this population. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; ambulatory care; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; emergency ward; female; health care utilization; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; Ontario; primary medical care; prison; prisoner; retrospective study"
"Detection of Tumor Antigen-Specific T-Cell Responses After Oncolytic Vaccination","2020","Oncolytic vaccines, which consist of recombinant oncolytic viruses (OV) encoding tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), have demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in preclinical models and are currently evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials. On one hand, oncolysis of OV-infected malignant entities reinstates cancer immunosurveillance. On the other hand, overexpression of TAAs in infected cells further stimulates the adaptive arm of antitumor immunity. Particularly, the presence of tumor-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment, as well as in the periphery, has demonstrated prognostic value for cancer treatments. These effector CD8+ T cells can be detected through their production of the prototypical Tc1 cytokine: IFN-γ. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of this immune cell subset remains critical in the development process of efficient cancer vaccines, including oncolytic vaccines. The present chapter will describe a single-cell immunological assay, namely the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), that allows the enumeration of IFN-γ-producing TAA-specific CD8+ T cells in various tissues (tumor, blood, lymphoid organs) following oncolytic vaccination. ? 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""

"A tale of confusion from overlapping confidence intervals","2019","In clinical research presentations, study results are commonly reported in the form of P values and confidence intervals as an estimate of association and treatment effect. The interpretation of confidence intervals that overlap can be confusing and difficult for the reader to draw clinically meaningful conclusions. In this brief report, we describe the basics of confidence intervals and present an example from a recently published randomized control trial to illustrate a common confusion that overlapping confidence intervals between the means of two independent groups may not necessarily reject the true significant difference of effect.

"Nutrition for special populations: Young, female, and masters athletes","2019","Adolescent, female, and masters athletes have unique nutritional requirements as a consequence of undertaking daily training and competition in addition to the specific demands of age- and gender-related physiological changes. Dietary education and recommendations for these special population athletes require a focus on eating for long-term health, with special consideration given to “at-risk” dietary patterns and nutrients (e.g., sustained restricted eating, low calcium, vitamin D and/or iron intakes relative to requirements). Recent research highlighting strategies to address age-related changes in protein metabolism and the development of tools to assist in the management of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport are of particular relevance to special population athletes. Whenever possible, special population athletes should be encouraged to meet their nutrient needs by the consumption of whole foods rather than supplements. The recommendation of dietary supplements (particularly to young athletes) overemphasizes their ability to manipulate performance in comparison with other training/dietary strategies. ? 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.","adolescent; adolescent nutrition; aging; Article; athlete; competition; dietary supplement; female; human; iron intake; nutrition education; nutritional requirement; physical development; sex difference; training; diet; nutrition; Adolescent; Athletes; Diet; Female; Humans; Nutritional Requirements; Sports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"
"Estimates of the current and future burden of cancer attributable to lack of physical activity in Canada","2019","Physical activity reduces the risk of many cancers, yet the prevalence of inadequate physical activity among Canadians remains high. Here we estimated the current attributable and future avoidable burden of cancer related to inadequate physical activity among Canadian adults. Population attributable risk (PAR)for all cancers associated with inadequate physical activity were estimated using relative risks obtained from comprehensive reports, meta-analyses and pooled analyses. Cancer incidence data were acquired from the Canadian Cancer Registry. Physical activity data were taken from Canadian Community Health Survey (Cycle 2.1, 2003), in which respondents were classified as “physically inactive” (<1.5 kcal/kg/day), “moderately active” (1.5–2.9 kcal/kg/day)or “physically active (?3.0 kcal/kg/day). We defined “inadequate physical activity” as being either “physically inactive” or “moderately active” to determine the PAR of cancer due to inadequate physical activity. We estimated the future burden of inadequate physical activity using potential impact fractions and a series of intervention scenarios, including 10% to 50% reductions in inadequate physical activity from 2015 to 2042. For 2015, the total attributable burden due to inadequate physical activity for associated cancers was 10.6% and 4.9% for all cancers. A 50% reduction in inadequate physical activity could avoid 39,877 cumulative cases of cancer by 2042. Over 9000 cancer cases in 2015 were estimated to be attributable to inadequate physical activity and 5170 incident cases of cancer could be prevented with increases in physical activity levels by 2042. Policies aimed at increasing physical activity among Canadian could have a meaningful impact for cancer prevention. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; aged; Article; Canada; cancer incidence; cancer prevention; cancer registry; cancer risk; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease burden; female; health care policy; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; physical inactivity; priority journal"
"A rapid in vitro methodology for simultaneous target discovery and antibody generation against functional cell subpopulations","2019","Cell surface antigen discovery is of great interest for biomedical research both for isolation of rare cell populations and therapeutic targeting. We developed a rapid, cost-effective, fully in vitro technology which facilities the simultaneous target discovery and human antibody generation on the surface of virtually any cell population of interest. We apply our technique to human colorectal cancer-initiating cells (CICs) and identify hundreds of unique human antibodies. We characterized the top three antibody candidates targeting these CICs and identify their protein targets as integrin α7 (ITGA7), HLA-A1 and integrin β6 (ITGB6). We demonstrate that these antibodies can be used to isolate self-renewing colorectal CICs, and that the integrin α7 antibody can prospectively identify glioblastoma brain tumor initiating cells as well as human muscle stem cells. We also demonstrate that genetic ablation of integrin β6 impedes colorectal CIC function. The methodology can be readily applied to other cell populations including stem cells, cancer, or immune cells to facilitate the rapid identification of novel targets and simultaneous generation of potent and specific antibodies with therapeutic potential. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Loneliness and perceived social support in pregnancy and early postpartum of mothers living with HIV in Ontario, Canada","2019","The HIV Mothering Study (n = 72) was a prospective, observational, cohort study exploring psychosocial experiences and needs of WLWHIV in pregnancy and postpartum. We performed quantitative analysis of determinants of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale) and lower perceived social support (SS) (Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Survey). The hypothesized determinants included: age, years with HIV, racism (Everyday Discrimination Scale), depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), nadir CD4 (<200 cells/μL), tertiary vs. community HIV care, and marital status. The median age was 33 (IQR = 30–37); 65.3% were African/Caribbean/Black. Multivariable analyses revealed associations between marital status and perceived social support (β = ?16.48, p < 0.0001), and this association was also seen with change over time (p = 0.02). Variables associated with SS that did not change over time were: income, EDS racism, EPDS score. Significant associations with loneliness were seen with the same variables associated with SS. Variables associated with loneliness that also changed over time were: EDS Racism (β = 0.22, p = 0.0005, and over time p = 0.003), and EPDS score (β = 0.74, p < 0.0001), and over time (p = 0.0211). Variables associated with loneliness but that did not change over time were: marital status and income. This analysis provides clinicians with prenatal risk factors which may be associated with increase loneliness and lower SS during pregnancy and postpartum: marital status, income, racism and depression. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; Article; Canada; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; community care; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; ethnicity; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; loneliness; major clinical study; marriage; observational study; postnatal depression; pregnant woman; priority journal; prospective study; psychosocial care; puerperium; quantitative analysis; racism; social psychology; social support; depression; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; income; loneliness; mother; Ontario; pregnancy; psychological rating scale; psychology; puerperium; risk factor; Adult; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Depression; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Income; Loneliness; Marital Status; Mothers; Ontario; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Racism; Risk Factors; Social Support"
"A randomized, double-blind, window of opportunity trial evaluating the effects of chloroquine in breast cancer patients","2019","Purpose: Chloroquine has demonstrated anti-tumor activities through autophagy inhibition and cell cycle disruption. This study aimed to assess the effect of single-agent chloroquine on breast tumor cellular proliferation in a randomized, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pre-surgical window of opportunity trial. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were randomized 2:1 to chloroquine 500?mg daily or placebo for 2- to 6-weeks prior to their breast surgery. The primary outcome was the relative change in measures of proliferation (Ki67) in primary breast cancer cells pre- and post-treatment. Adverse events and toxicity profiles were also evaluated. Results: From September 2015 to December 2016, 70 patients were randomized [46 (66%) chloroquine and 24 (34%) placebo]. Ten patients who were randomized to chloroquine withdrew from study due to adverse events. Mean duration of drug intake was 15?days (range 14–29?days). There were no significant differences between the chloroquine or placebo arms with respect to either the percentage change (? 0.4 vs. ? 1.2, p = 0.088) or absolute change (? 2.0% vs. ? 5.2%, p = 0.066) in Ki67 index pre- and post-drug treatment. Although adverse effects were minimal and all classified as grade 1, the effects were significant enough to cause nearly 15% of patients to discontinue therapy. Conclusions: Treatment with single-agent chloroquine 500?mg daily in the preoperative setting was not associated with any significant effects on breast cancer cellular proliferation. It was, however, associated with toxicity that may affect its broader use in oncology. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","chloroquine; Ki 67 antigen; metformin; placebo; abdominal cramp; adult; Article; blurred vision; breast biopsy; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cell proliferation; controlled study; diarrhea; dizziness; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug withdrawal; fatigue; human; human tissue; major clinical study; middle aged; muscle weakness; nausea; outcome assessment; phase 2 clinical trial; photosensitivity disorder; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; tinnitus; treatment duration; visual disorder; xerostomia"
"How women living with HIV react and respond to learning about Canadian law that criminalises HIV non-disclosure: ‘how do you prove that you told?’","2019","The Women, ART and the Criminalization of HIV Study is a qualitative, arts-based research study focusing on the impact of the HIV non-disclosure law on women living with HIV in Canada. The federal law requires people living with HIV to disclose their HIV-positive status to sexual partners before engaging in sexual activities that pose what the Supreme Court of Canada called a ‘realistic possibility of transmission’. Drawing on findings from seven education and discussion sessions with 48 women living with HIV regarding HIV non-disclosure laws in Canada, this paper highlights the ways in which women living with HIV respond to learning about the criminalisation of HIV non-disclosure. The most common emergent themes included: the way the law reproduces social and legal injustices; gendered experiences of intimate injustice; and the relationship between disclosure and violence against women living with HIV. These discussions illuminate the troubling consequences inherent in a law that is antithetical to the science of HIV transmission risk, and that fails to acknowledge the multiple barriers to HIV disclosure that women living with HIV experience. Women’s experiences also highlight the various ways the law contributes to their experiences of sexism, racism and other forms of marginalisation in society. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; article; Canada; clinical article; drawing; education; female; human; human experiment; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; learning; male; racism; sexism; violence"
"Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in infants with congenital airway anomalies compared to standard indications and complex medical disorders","2019","An observational study was conducted of children < 2?years who received ? 1 dose of palivizumab in 32 Canadian institutions from 2005 to 2017. We compared respiratory illness (RIH) and respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalization (RSVH) hazards in children with a congenital airway anomaly (CAA) versus those prophylaxed for standard indications (SI) and serious medical disorders (SMD). Data were assembled on neonatal course, demographics, palivizumab utilization and adherence, and respiratory illness events, and analyzed using ANOVA, chi-square tests and Cox proportional hazards. Twenty-five thousand three children (1219 CAA, 3538 SMD, and 20,246 SI) were enrolled. Palivizumab adherence was 74.8% overall and similar across groups. For 2054 respiratory-related events, 1724 children were hospitalized. RIH rates were 13.6% (CAA), 9.6% (SMD), and 6.0% (SI). RSVH rates were 2.4% (CAA), 1.6% (SMD), and 1.5% (SI). After adjustment for demographic and neonatal differences, children with a CAA had a significantly increased RIH and RSVH hazard relative to SI (RIH, HR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.2, p = 0.002; RSVH, HR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.0–4.4, p = 0.037) but similar to SMD (RIH, HR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.9–1.9, p = 0.190; RSVH, HR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.7–4.1, p = 0.277). Conclusion: Children with a CAA experience higher RIH risk. RSVH hazard was similar between CAA and SMD but higher for CAA compared to SI, implying that this population requires surveillance for RSV prophylaxis.What is Known:? Children with congenital airway anomalies (CAA) are at risk for respiratory tract illness and respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalization (RSVH) with accompanying morbidity and mortality? RSV prophylaxis may be useful in children with a CAA, but is not routinely recommendedWhat is New:? Children with a CAA had a 1.6–2.3 fold greater risk of respiratory-related hospitalization and RSVH compared to those prophylaxed for standard, approved indications and serious medical disorders.? RSVH risk in children aged < 2?years with either upper or lower airway anomalies is similar. Children with a CAA require careful surveillance during the RSV season and prophylaxis may be appropriate. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","palivizumab; antivirus agent; palivizumab; Article; atopy; Caucasian; child hospitalization; comorbidity; controlled study; disease severity; family history; female; human; immunotherapy; infant; infection prevention; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; observational study; patient compliance; pneumonia; priority journal; respiratory syncytial virus infection; respiratory tract malformation; case control study; complication; follow up; newborn; prospective study; respiratory syncytial virus infection; respiratory tract malformation; risk factor; virology; Antiviral Agents; Case-Control Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Palivizumab; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory System Abnormalities; Risk Factors"
"Predictive Values of Anthropometric Measurements for Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Cardiovascular Diseases Among 44?048 Chinese","2019","Background: The predictive value of adiposity indices and the newly developed index for cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains unclear in the Chinese population. This study aimed to compare the predictive value of A Body Shape Index with other 5 conventional obesity-related anthropometric indices (body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio) in Chinese population. Methods and Results: A total of 44?048 participants in the study were derived from the baseline data of the PURE-China (Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology) study in China. All participants’ anthropometric parameters, CVDs, and risk factors (dyslipidemia, abnormal blood pressure, and hyperglycemia) were collected by standard procedures. Multivariable logistic regression models and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis were used to evaluate the predictive values of obesity-related anthropometric indices to the cardiometabolic risk factors and CVDs. A positive association was observed between each anthropometric index and cardiometabolic risk factors and CVDs in all models (P<0.001). Compared with other anthropometric indices (body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and A Body Shape Index), waist-to-height ratio had significantly higher areas under the curve (AUCs) for predicting dyslipidemia (AUCs: 0.646, sensitivity: 65%, specificity: 44%), hyperglycemia (AUCs: 0.595, sensitivity: 60%, specificity: 45%), and CVDs (AUCs: 0.619, sensitivity: 59%, specificity: 41%). Waist circumference showed the best prediction for abnormal blood pressure (AUCs: 0.671, sensitivity: 66%, specificity: 40%) compared with other anthropometric indices. However, the new body shape index did not show a better prediction to either cardiometabolic risk factors or CVDs than that of any other traditional obesity-related indices. Conclusions: Waist-to-height ratio appeared to be the best indicator for dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and CVDs, while waist circumference had a better prediction for abnormal blood pressure. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Introducing BREAST-Q Computerized Adaptive Testing: Short and Individualized Patient-Reported Outcome Assessment following Reconstructive Breast Surgery","2019","Background: The BREAST-Q is a widely used patient-reported outcome instrument measuring health-related quality-of-life and patient satisfaction in breast surgery. Shorter assessment potentially increases patients' willingness to complete scales, but simply offering a shortened version leads to unacceptable loss in measurement precision. The authors aimed to develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to shorten the BREAST-Q's Satisfaction with Breasts scale while maintaining reliability of measurement. Methods: The authors created a CAT, which repetitively administered questions from the pool of 16 questions, until prespecified levels of reliability were reached [i.e., standard errors (SE) of 0.32 to 0.55]. In a simulation study, the authors tested the CAT's feasibility for all potential satisfaction scores. In a second study using actual patient data, 5000 breast reconstruction patients who had previously completed the full scale were randomly selected from a large database. Their full-scale satisfaction scores were compared with their CAT-derived scores. Results: In both studies, by applying CAT, the Satisfaction with Breasts scale could be reduced to an average of 10 questions when using the minimum level of measurement precision for individual-patient measurement (SE, 0.32), compared with four questions when using the minimum precision level for group-based research (SE, 0.55). Score estimates were highly correlated between the CAT assessment and the full scale (0.91 to 0.98 in the simulation study, and 0.89 to 0.98 in the patient data study). Conclusions: Applying computerized adaptive testing to the BREAST-Q's Satisfaction with Breasts scale facilitates reliable assessment, with 38 to 75 percent fewer questions than the full version. The novel BREAST-Q CAT version may decrease response burden and help overcome barriers to implementation in routine care. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Effectiveness of interventions for the implementation of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised patients at risk of venous thromboembolism: An updated abridged Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials","2019","Objective To assess the effectiveness of system-wide interventions designed to increase the implementation of thromboprophylaxis and decrease the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalised medical and surgical patients at risk of VTE. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources Medline, PubMed, Embase, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Web of Science, CENTRAL, DARE, EED, LILACS and clinicaltrials.gov without language restrictions from inception to 7 January 2017, as well as the reference lists of relevant review articles. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of system-wide interventions such as alerts, multifaceted, education, and preprinted orders when compared with no intervention, existing policy or another intervention. Results We included 13 RCTs involving 35 997 participants. Eleven RCTs had data available for meta-analysis. Compared with control, we found absolute increase in the prescription of prophylaxis associated with alerts (21% increase, 95% CI [15% to 275%]) and multifaceted interventions (4% increase, 95% CI [3% to 11%]), absolute increase in the prescription of appropriate prophylaxis associated with alerts (16% increase, 95% CI [12% to 20%]) and relative risk reductions (risk ratio 64%, 95% CI [47% to 86%]) in the incidence of symptomatic VTE associated with alerts. Computer alerts were found to be more effective than human alerts, and multifaceted interventions with an alert component appeared to be more effective than multifaceted interventions without, although comparative pooled analyses were not feasible. The quality of evidence for improvement in outcomes was judged to be low to moderate certainty. Conclusions Alerts increased the proportion of patients who received prophylaxis and appropriate prophylaxis, and decreased the incidence of symptomatic VTE. Multifaceted interventions increased the proportion of patients who received prophylaxis but were found to be less effective than alerts interventions. Trial registration number CD008201. ?

"Effects of biomarker diagnostic accuracy on biomarker-guided phase 2 trials","2019","Recent advancements in genomics have attracted attention towards biomarker-guided trials. These trials aim to identify therapies that target diseases based on their genetic profile, and are especially common in cancer research. Careful incorporation of biomarkers in phase II studies is critical to the selection of candidates for further phase III investigation. This short communication focuses on problems of biomarker test accuracy in biomarker-guided trials. We assessed how diagnostic accuracy of biomarker tests affects type I error rate, statistical power, and sample size requirements of single-arm biomarker-guided trials. In particular, we report how false positive rates (FPRs) of biomarker tests reduce statistical power and type I error for Simon's two-stage design, and the degree of sample size correction required to achieve pre-specified power and type I error with varying FPRs. This was done using a case study based on a previous biomarker-guided single-arm trial that was designed with an assumed tumor response rate of 10% under the null hypothesis and 40% for the alternative hypothesis for the mutant group for 5% type I error and 90% power. With varying FPRs of biomarker tests, we considered two scenarios in which the response rate for the wild-type group was assumed to be lower than the response rate for the mutant group at 5% and 10%. We also developed a simple open-source online trial planner for future investigators to use for their biomarker-guided phase II trials (https://mtek.shinyapps.io/Biomarker_Trial_Planner/). ? 2019 The Authors","biological marker; alternative hypothesis; Article; case study; diagnostic accuracy; experimental therapy; false positive result; genetic profile; human; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; sample size"
"Prolonged exercise training improves the acute type II muscle fibre satellite cell response in healthy older men","2019","Key points: Skeletal muscle stem cells, termed satellite cells, play a crucial role in repair and remodelling of muscle in response to exercise An age-related decline in satellite cell number and/or function has been hypothesized to be a key factor in the development of sarcopenia and/or the blunted muscle fibre adaptive response to prolonged exercise training in older persons We report that performing prolonged exercise training improves the acute type II muscle fibre satellite cell response following a single bout of resistance exercise in older men. The observed improvement in muscle satellite function is associated with an increase in muscle fibre capillarization following exercise training suggesting a possible functional link between capillarization and satellite cell function. Abstract: Age-related type II muscle fibre atrophy is accompanied by a fibre type-specific decline in satellite cell number and function. Exercise training restores satellite cell quantity in older adults; however, whether it can restore the impaired satellite cell response to exercise in older adults remains unknown. Therefore we assessed the acute satellite cell response to a single exercise session before and after prolonged exercise training in older men. Fourteen older men (74?±?8?years) participated in a 12-week exercise training programme (resistance exercise performed twice per week, high intensity interval training once per week). Before and after training, percutaneous biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were taken prior to and following 24 and 48?h of post-exercise recovery. Muscle fibre characteristics were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Whereas no changes were observed in type II muscle fibres, type I muscle fibre satellite cell content increased significantly at 24 and 48?h after a single bout of resistance exercise before the exercise training programme (P?<?0.01). Following the exercise training programme, both type I and type II muscle fibre satellite cell content increased significantly at 24 and 48?h after a single bout of resistance exercise (P?<?0.05). The greater acute increase in type II muscle fibre satellite cell content at 24 h post-exercise recovery after training was correlated with an increase in type II muscle fibre capillarization (r?=?0.671, P?=?0.012). We show that the acute muscle satellite cell response following exercise can be improved by prolonged exercise training in older men. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Colorectal cancer in adolescents and young adults: Defining a growing threat","2019","Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising among adolescents and young adults (AYAs), with the greatest increase occurring in distal colon and rectal cancers. Reasons for this striking trend are not well understood. Genetically linked cases of CRC occur in the context of familial conditions such as Lynch Syndrome, but most AYA cases of CRC are sporadic. Unique biology is suggested, yet limited information is available regarding the molecular underpinnings of CRC in this age group. Young patients are more likely to experience delays in diagnosis and to present with advanced-stage disease; yet, prognosis by stage is comparable between younger and older adults. Treatment paradigms are based on evidence reflecting the older adult population. Given the concerning rise in CRC rates among AYAs, there is urgent need for further research into the role of screening from a younger age, biology of disease, and optimal therapies in this age group. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adolescent; adult; cancer epidemiology; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; colorectal cancer; early cancer; fertility; human; oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy; pregnancy; priority journal; Review; risk factor; young adult"
"Patient Experiences and Opinions of a Behavioral Activation Group Intervention for Depression","2019","Purpose: Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability worldwide. This study is part of a mixed methods pilot trial, exploring the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of providing behavioral activation (BA) treatment in a group format. Methods: Using an applied, descriptive approach, qualitative data were collected from individual interviews (18) and focus groups (5) at multiple data points throughout the trial and feedback given to group facilitators, who adapted the program accordingly. Results: Group BA is an effective and acceptable treatment format when a client-centered, flexible approach is utilized. This contrasted with findings from the comparison intervention, a peer support group, from which participants reported no benefit. Conclusions: Group BA is beneficial in a fiscally responsible evidenced-based health-care culture. Comparator groups need to be carefully selected.

"The “problem” of health: An analysis of health care provision in Canada’s federal prisons","2019","The United Nations states that prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community. Despite this, persons in prison experience barriers to care and face unique health challenges. Given the ways in which prisons shape health outcomes for incarcerated persons, it is important to interrogate how the provision of health care is governed in custodial settings. In this article, we examine one important aspect of governance: legislation governing the provision of health care in prisons. We view this issue through a critical lens, building on a body of poststructural scholarship which has illuminated how laws and policies are not merely tools of governance but also key sites for the production of meanings around social “problems,” including the “problem of health.” Taking Canada’s Corrections and Conditional Release Act as a case example and applying Carol Bacchi’s “What’s the Problem Represented to Be” analytical framework, we examine how the specific representation of “health” in this legislation works to produce effects for persons in federal prison. Three key themes are formed through this analysis. First, what constitutes “essential services” in the context of federal prisons is more limited compared with the broader community. Second, the dichotomy between the rights of persons in prison versus the protection of society that is produced in development of these laws has significant bearing on the treatment of those in prison. Third, this representation has negative effects on the health of persons in prison. In order to meet United Nations standards, greater attention must be paid to the ways in which laws and other governing practices reproduce inequities in health care provision in prisons. ?

"Characteristics and Outcomes of Young Children Hospitalized with Laboratory-confirmed Influenza or Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Ontario, Canada, 2009-2014","2019","Background: Respiratory illnesses are a major contributor to pediatric hospitalizations, with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causing substantial morbidity and cost each season. We compared the characteristics and outcomes of children 0-59 months of age who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza or RSV between 2009 and 2014 in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We included hospitalized children who were tested for influenza A, influenza B and RSV and were positive for a single virus. We characterized individuals by their demographics and healthcare utilization patterns and compared their hospital outcomes, in-hospital cost and postdischarge healthcare use by virus type and by presence of underlying comorbidities. Results: We identified and analyzed 7659 hospitalizations during which a specimen tested positive for influenza or RSV. Children with RSV were the youngest whereas children with influenza B were the oldest [median ages 6 months (interquartile range: 2-17 months) and 25 months (interquartile range: 10-45 months), respectively]. Complex chronic conditions were more prevalent among children with all influenza (sub)types than RSV (31%-34% versus 20%). In-hospital outcomes were similar by virus type, but in children with comorbidities, postdischarge outcomes varied. We observed no differences in in-hospital cost between viruses or by presence of comorbidities [overall median cost: $4150 Canadian dollars (interquartile range: $3710-$4948)]. Conclusions: Influenza and RSV account for large numbers of pediatric hospitalizations. RSV and influenza were similar in terms of severity and cost in hospitalized children. Influenza vaccination should be promoted in pregnant women and young children, and a vaccine against RSV would mitigate the high burden of RSV. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Clinical features of differential diagnosis between unipolar and bipolar depression in a drug-free sample of young adults","2019","Introduction: Subjects with bipolar disorder suffering of a depressive episode are frequently misdiagnosed as unipolar depression, being important studies assessing the differential diagnosis between bipolar and unipolar depression. Objective: To assess the sociodemographic and clinical features of drug-free young adults in a depressive episode of bipolar or unipolar disorder in order to identify factors that may differentiate these psychiatric conditions. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with 241 young adults aged between 18 and 29 years who were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). The sample comprised patients with BD (n = 89) and major depressive disorder (n = 152), experiencing a depressive episode and not using psychoactive drugs or illicit psychoactive substances. Results: The characteristics associated with bipolar depression were being male (p < 0.001), with a family history of BD (p = 0.013), a higher frequency of childhood traumatic experiences (p = 0.001), younger age of onset of mood disorder (p = 0.004), many previous depressive episodes (p = 0.027), greater severity of depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and day/night reversal (p = 0.013). Those with unipolar depression showed a higher frequency of biological rhythm disturbances (p < 0.001), and diurnal preference (p = 0.028). Limitations: The sample has not included subjects with severe suicide risk, a possible important marker in differentiate unipolar from bipolar depression. Conclusion: Some clinical aspects may contribute to an early differential diagnosis of both bipolar and unipolar depression even in the initial stages of the disease. ? 2018","adult; Article; biological rhythm; bipolar depression; clinical feature; controlled study; cross-sectional study; differential diagnosis; disease severity; family history; female; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; onset age; priority journal; sexual behavior; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders; young adult; adolescent; bipolar disorder; childhood trauma survivor; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; differential diagnosis; early diagnosis; major depression; psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Bipolar Disorder; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Diagnosis, Differential; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult"

"Interventions to Try to Prevent Preterm Birth in Women With a History of Conization: A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses","2019","Objectives: The most effective preterm birth (PTB) intervention is unknown for women who are at risk of PTB due to a history of conization. The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether PTB interventions, progesterone, cerclage, and pessary decrease the risk of PTB compared to no treatment in singleton—and separately in twin—pregnancies of women with history of conization. Methods: We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1994 until May 2017. In duplicate, we reviewed titles, abstracts, full texts, extracted data, and assessed quality. We included RCTs and observational studies. Our primary outcomes were PTB &lt;34 weeks, PTB &lt;37 weeks, and neonatal mortality. We performed random effects meta-analyses and generated ORs with 95% CIs. Results: We screened 762 nonduplicate titles and abstracts and assessed 91 full texts. After contacting authors, we included nine studies. Women in the cerclage group were more likely to have a short cervix or another risk factor for PTB, raising the possibility of confounding by indication. In women with a history of conization and a singleton who received a cerclage compared to those who did not, the ORs of PTB &lt;34 weeks was 3.99 (95% CI 0.67–23.62, three studies, I2 = 65%); of PTB &lt;37 weeks was 2.10 (95% CI 0.87–5.05, four studies, I2 = 0%); and of neonatal mortality was 8.33 (95% CI 0.22–320.38, two studies, I2 = N/A). We did not find any studies comparing either progesterone or pessary to no treatment. Data for twins were very scarce. Conclusion: In women with a previous conization and a current singleton gestation, the existing evidence, which is likely limited due to confounding by indication, does not support cerclage or other interventions used to try to decrease PTB. ? 2019 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada","progesterone; female; human; medical history; meta analysis; newborn mortality; pregnancy; premature labor; Review; risk reduction; systematic review; treatment outcome; twin pregnancy; uterine cervix cerclage; uterine cervix conization"

"Developmental trajectories of adaptive behavior in autism spectrum disorder: a high-risk sibling cohort","2019","Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience impairments in adaptive behavior. Methods: Developmental trajectories of adaptive behavior in ASD were examined in children from high-risk (siblings of children diagnosed with ASD, n?=?403) and low-risk (no family history of ASD, n?=?163) families. Children were assessed prospectively at 12, 18, 24, and 36?months of age using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and underwent a blind independent diagnostic assessment for ASD at 36?months of age. Results: The semi-parametric group-based modeling approach using standard scores on the Adaptive Behavior Composite revealed three distinct developmental trajectories: (a) Group 1 (21.2% of sample) showed average performance at 12?months and a declining trajectory; (b) Group 2 (52.8% of the sample) showed average performance at 12?months with a slightly declining trajectory; and (c) Group 3 (26.0% of the sample) showed a higher level of adaptive behavior at 12?months and a stable trajectory. The Mullen Scales of Early Learning Early Learning Composite and the Autism Observation Scale for Infants total score at 6 and 12?months predicted trajectory membership. Conclusions: The results emphasize heterogeneous development associated with ASD and the need for interventions tailored to individual presentations. ? 2018 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health","adaptive behavior; article; autism assessment; child; clinical assessment; controlled study; diagnosis; family history; female; human; infant; learning; major clinical study; male; preschool child; prospective study; sibling; visually impaired person"
"The characterisation of interstitial lung disease multidisciplinary team meetings: A global study","2019","Multidisciplinary team (MDT) diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been proposed as a gold standard, but there are no formal recommendations for MDT process or composition and limited knowledge regarding prevalence in routine practice. We performed a systematic evaluation of ILD diagnostic practice across a range of healthcare settings around the world. Electronic questionnaires were distributed across all global regions via society and collaborators networks. Responses from 457 unique centres across 64 countries were included in the analysis. Of the 350 (76.6%) centres holding formal meetings, the majority held face-to-face MDT meetings (80%), for a minimum of 30 min (93%), and discussed diagnosis (96.9%) and patient management (94.9%) at the meetings. Compared with non-academic and academic non-ILD centres, ILD academic centres reported a higher ILD caseload, held more formal MDT meetings, and were more likely to include histopathology and rheumatology specialists in their diagnostic team. Of the centres holding MDT meetings, 5.5% routinely discussed all new cases at such meetings. An MDT approach to ILD diagnosis is consistently interpreted and widely implemented across a range of routine care settings around the world. This observation will inform future ILD diagnostic agreement studies and diagnostic pathway recommendations. ?

"Associations between meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for the Early Years and behavioral and emotional problems among 3-year-olds","2019","Objectives: Primary: examine associations between meeting the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for the Early Years and behavioral and emotional problems in a large sample of 3-year-old children. Secondary: determine the proportion of children meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Participants were 3-year olds (n = 539) from the Edmonton site of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort. Physical activity and sleep duration were accelerometer-derived while screen time was parent-reported. Meeting the overall guidelines was defined as: (1) ?180 min/day of total physical activity, including 60 min/day of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, (2) ?1 h/day of screen time, and (3) 10–13 h of sleep per 24-hour period. Externalizing, internalizing, and total problem scores (lower scores representing fewer problems) were calculated from the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Descriptive statistics and linear regression models were completed. Results: Only 5% of children met the overall guidelines (all three recommendations), with 19.3%, 50.5%, and 83.1% meeting the physical activity, screen time, and sleep recommendations, respectively. Meeting more recommendations was associated with lower scores for total (B = ?1.78, 95%CI: ?3.03, ?0.54), externalizing (B = ?1.51, 95%CI: ?2.80, ?0.22) and internalizing (B = ?1.35, 95%CI: ?2.60, ?0.01) problems. Similar findings were also observed for the specific combinations of: (1) physical activity and screen time and (2) sleep duration and screen time. Conclusions: Meeting more recommendations within the 24-hour Movement Guidelines was associated with fewer behavioral and emotional problems at 3-years. Few 3-year-olds met the overall guidelines. Findings support an integrated approach for healthy growth and development. ? 2019 Sports Medicine Australia","24 hour movement; accelerometry; Article; behavior disorder; child; Child Behavior Checklist; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; emotional disorder; female; household income; human; major clinical study; male; movement (physiology); physical activity; postnatal depression; practice guideline; preschool child; screen time; sleep time; behavior disorder; Canada; checklist; exercise; pathophysiology; physiology; protocol compliance; psychology; questionnaire; sleep; Accelerometry; Canada; Checklist; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Male; Sedentary Behavior; Sleep; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Self-injurious behavior in a patient with dementia: A case report and literature review","2019","Self-injurious behavior (SIB) has frequently been associated with psychiatric illness and neurological lesions as means of reducing tension or diverting from pain. However, these explanations did not capture the complexity of SIB in the case of Mr. X, a 62-year-old patient who ingested his fingers in his sleep where cognitive testing was valuable in informing diagnosis. Mr. X's SIB was severe enough that he had chewed beyond the middle phalanx for most of his fingers. Clinical symptoms included daytime sleepiness, hypnogogic hallucinations, and bradykinesia. His cognitive profile revealed declines in his intellectual functioning as well as visuospatial and executive deficits in the context of preserved attention, language, and memory. His cognitive and clinical presentation suggested that Mr. X had a neurodegenerative disorder, which may have contributed to his SIB. We believed that the most probable diagnosis may have been rapid eye movement behavioral sleep disorder in the context of Lewy bodies dementia. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Satisfactory analgesia with minimal emesis in day surgeries: a randomised controlled trial of morphine versus hydromorphone","2019","Background: Opioids remain the mainstay therapy for post-surgical pain. Although both morphine and hydromorphone are potent analgesics, it has been suggested that hydromorphone is clinically better. Our primary objective was to compare morphine with hydromorphone for achieving satisfactory analgesia with minimal emesis (SAME). Methods: We performed a multicentre RCT in 402 patients having ambulatory surgery. A random computer-generated allocation, stratified by site, was developed by our pharmacy. Concealment was achieved by allocating patients to study groups by nurses using sequentially coded study medication syringes having equi-analgesic doses, made available in the postoperative recovery room. Patients, health providers, and research personnel were blinded. The operating-room protocol allowed for routine anaesthetic management, excluding the use of study medications. Study medications were administered by recovery nurses as per an algorithm. Analyses utilised the intention-to-treat principle, and regression analyses were used for outcomes as appropriate and using multiple imputation. Results: Of 751 patients, 402 were randomised between morphine (n=199) and hydromorphone (n=203). Baseline and intraoperative variables were comparable across the groups. The odds of achieving SAME were similar between the groups (odds ratio: 1.01; 95% confidence interval: 0.57–1.80). There were no differences in the side-effects of severe itching, respiratory depression, or sedation. Patient satisfaction, discharge times, and post-discharge outcomes, including pain and nausea/vomiting over 24 h, were also comparable. Conclusions: There was no difference between morphine and hydromorphone regarding analgesia and common side-effects. The appearance of dose-limiting side-effects is idiosyncratic; the clinical decision must be based on individual responses.

"Impact of standard bacterial vaginosis treatment on the genital microbiota, immune milieu, and ex vivo human immunodeficiency virus susceptibility","2019","Background. Genital immunology is a key determinant of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) susceptibility. Both factors are modulated by bacterial vaginosis (BV) and, to some extent, by Lactobacillus iners, the genital Lactobacillus spp. that predominates in African, Caribbean, and other Black (ACB) women. We conducted a clinical trial to assess the impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the genital immune parameters of HIV acquisition risks in Kenyan women with BV. Methods. The primary endpoint was ex vivo cervical CD4+ T-cell HIV susceptibility after 1 month; secondary endpoints included genital cytokine/chemokine levels, cervical immune cell populations, and the composition of the cervico-vaginal microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results. BV resolved (Nugent score ? 3) at 1 month in 20/45 participants, and cervical CD4+ T-cell HIV entry was moderately reduced in all participants, regardless of treatment outcome. Resolution of BV and reduced abundances of BV-associated gram-negative taxa correlated with reduced genital interleukin (IL)-1α/β. However, BV resolution and the concomitant colonization by Lactobacillus iners substantially increased several genital chemokines associated with HIV acquisition, including interferon-γ inducible protein (IP)-10, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3α, and monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG). In an independent cohort of ACB women, most of whom were BV-free, vaginal chemokines were again closely linked with L. iners abundance, though not other Lactobacillus spp. Conclusions. BV treatment reduced genital CD4+ T-cell HIV susceptibility and IL-1 levels, but dramatically increased the genital chemokines that may enhance HIV susceptibility; the latter effect was related to the restoration of an Lactobacillus iners-dom-inated microbiota. Further studies are needed before treatment of asymptomatic BV can be recommended for HIV prevention in ACB communities. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Long-term fostamatinib treatment of adults with immune thrombocytopenia during the phase 3 clinical trial program","2019","Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrated responses (?50 000/μL) to fostamatinib in adults with long-standing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The long-term safety and efficacy of fostamatinib were evaluated in a follow-on, open-label extension (OLE) study. Patients received double-blind fostamatinib in the randomized trials, and responders continued the same dose, 100 to 150 mg BID, in the OLE study. Nonresponders received 100 mg BID for 4 weeks and could escalate to 150 mg BID at week 4. Endpoints included stable response, platelet count ?50 000/μL at 4/6 biweekly (randomized trials) or 2/3 monthly visits (OLE), and overall response, ?1 platelet count ?50 000/μL during weeks 1 to 12. A total of 146 patients received fostamatinib including 123 in the OLE study. Median treatment duration was 6.7 months. Baseline median ITP duration was 8 years and median platelet count was 16 000/μL; prior treatments included thrombopoietic (TPO) agents (47%), splenectomy (35%), and rituximab (32%). Twenty-seven (18%) patients achieved a stable response with median duration of >28 months and a median platelet count of 89 000/μL. Sixty-four (44%) patients achieved an overall response (including stable responders) with a median platelet count of 63 000/μL and a median response duration of >28 months. Twenty-four of 71 (34%) patients who had failed TPO agents achieved overall responses to fostamatinib. The most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, epistaxis, and abnormal liver function tests. Most AEs were mild/moderate and resolved or were managed with dose reduction, dose interruption, and/or secondary medication. Almost half of the patients achieved an overall response, and most of these maintained their responses for >2 years. No new or increased frequency of AEs was seen at up to 31 months of treatment. ? 2019 The Authors.

"‘There’s a before and an after’: effects of a personal history of cancer on perception of cancer risks and adoption of behaviours","2019","In this article, we aim to better understand how a personal history of cancer influences perceptions of environmental risk factors for cancers and adoptions of health-related behaviours. Semi-structured individual and group interviews were conducted with French individuals with (n?=?21) and without (n?=?16) a personal history of cancer using the same topic guide. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed using a comparative approach. Our participants with and without a history of cancer tended to perceive the same environmental factors as causes of cancers, in particular pesticides and smoking. However, individuals without a history of cancer emphasised electromagnetic waves and sun exposure as causes of cancers while participants with a history of cancer emphasised unbalanced diet and stress/negative emotions. Our participants with a history of cancer tended to mention more factors than participants without. Finally, participants with a personal history of cancer all described themselves as adopting at least one behaviour mentioned as ‘healthier’, often following their cancer experience, while very few participants without a history of cancer mentioned adopting these behaviours. Participants with a history of cancer tended to be more concerned about environmental risk factors for cancers and about preventing cancers through adopting risk-reducing health-related behaviours than participants without a history of cancer. Our findings are consistent with and develop the idea that a personal experience of cancer can alter an individual’s 'experience and life world'. We also observed similarities between individuals with and without a personal history of cancer. Our contextual findings need to be confirmed by further research. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","domestic chemical; adult; aged; Article; cancer research; cancer risk; cancer survival; clinical article; diet; electromagnetic radiation; exercise; female; genetic variability; healthy lifestyle; human; male; malignant neoplasm; people by smoking status; questionnaire; semi structured interview"
"Activation of hippocampal microglia in a murine model of cancer-induced pain","2019","Introduction: Pain is a common and debilitating comorbidity of metastatic breast cancer. The hippocampus has been implicated in nociceptive processing, particularly relating to the subjective aspect of pain. Here, a syngeneic mouse model was used to characterize the effects of peripheral tumors on hippocampal microglial activation in relation to cancer-induced pain (CIP). Materials and methods: Mice were systemically treated with the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor Pexidartinib prior to intrafemoral (IF) or subcutaneous 4T1 carcinoma cell inoculation. Spontaneous and evoked nociceptive responses were quantitated throughout tumor development, and contralateral hippocampi were collected via endpoint microdissection for RNA analysis. Additionally, IF tumor-bearing animals were sacrificed on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 post 4T1 cell inoculation, and brain sections were immunofluorescently stained for Iba1, a marker of activated microglia. Results: Ablation of these neuroimmune cells with the CSF1R inhibitor Pexidartinib delayed the onset and severity of cancer-induced nociceptive behaviors in IF tumor-bearing animals, adding to the body of literature that demonstrates microglial contribution to the development and maintenance of CIP. Furthermore, in untreated IF tumor-bearing mice, nociceptive behaviors appeared to progress in parallel with microglial activation in hippocampal regions. Immuno-fluorescent Iba1+ microglia increased in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 1 hippocampal regions in IF tumor-bearing animals over time, which was confirmed at the mRNA level using relevant microglial markers. Conclusion: This is the first experimental evidence to demonstrate the effects of peripheral tumor-induced nociception on hippocampal microglial activation. The increase in hippocampal microglia observed in the present study may reflect the emotional and cognitive deficits reported by patients with CIP. ? 2019 Miladinovic et al.","binding protein; ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1; messenger RNA; pexidartinib; unclassified drug; 4T1 cell line; animal behavior; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer pain; carcinogenesis; cell activation; controlled study; dentate gyrus; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; microdissection; microglia; mouse; murine model; nociception; nonhuman; protein expression; RNA analysis"
"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Postpartum Follow-Up Testing: Challenges and Solutions","2019","One in every 4 pregnancies is affected by hyperglycemia, of which 90% is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Women with GDM are at a high risk of developing both short- and long-term complications. Various studies have shown the heightened risk of type 2 diabetes among women with GDM. Despite clear evidence from published literature about the substantial risk that GDM imposes on women after delivery, rates of postpartum follow up have been low in most parts of the world. Several reasons, such as lack of awareness among health-care professionals and patient-related barriers, such as emotional stress and adjusting to motherhood, have been cited as reasons for poor follow-up rates. To address these issues and come up with solutions to improve postpartum follow-up rates, it is important to understand these barriers both from the patient and the health-care system points of view. In this review, we have summarized some of the key issues contributing to the low postpartum follow-up rates and have discussed possible strategies to tackle them. Use of proactive reminder systems, such as postal service, telephone call, short messaging service and e-mail, recall registries for GDM and utilization of mobile health technology are some of the key strategies that have been discussed in this review. A brief note on the Women in India with GDM Strategy project, which developed a model of care for GDM in resource-constrained settings and adopted several strategies that led to a 95.8% postpartum follow up, has also been presented. ? 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association","glucose; awareness; emotional stress; follow up; gestational diabetes mellitus recall register; glucose tolerance test; high risk patient; human; maternal attitude; mobile application; mobile health technology; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; practice guideline; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; protocol compliance; puerperium; register; reminder system; Review; screening; short messaging service reminder; software; technology"
"Excipient selection for thermally stable enveloped and non-enveloped viral vaccine platforms in dry powders","2019","Two enveloped viral vectors, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus, and a non-enveloped viral vector, human adenovirus type 5, were encapsulated by spray drying to enhance thermal stability. Results with these candidates led to the hypothesis that stability performance of chosen excipients may be less virus-specific, as previously postulated in the literature, and more differentiated based on whether the virus has a lipid envelope. Spray dried samples were characterized for their thermal properties, RNA viability and in vitro viral activity after storage at 37 °C for up to 30 days or at 45 °C for up to 3 days. The enveloped viral vectors, as a group, were more thermally stable in trehalose while the non-enveloped viral vector showed higher activity with mannitol as the primary excipient in blends. Trehalose shows strong hydrogen bonds with the envelope's lipid membrane than the other carbohydrates, more effectively replacing water molecules while maintaining the fluidity of the membrane. Conversely, the small size of mannitol molecules was attributed to the more effective hydrogen bonding between water and the protein capsid of non-enveloped viral vectors. In all cases, a matrix with high glass transition temperature contributed to thermal stabilization through vitrification. This work suggests that carbohydrate stabilizer selection may be more dependent on the envelope rather than the specific viral vector, which, if universally true, will provide a guideline for future formulation development. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","carbohydrate; dextran; excipient; liposome; mannitol; trehalose; virus vaccine; virus vector; adenovirus vaccine; excipient; influenza vaccine; animal cell; Article; differential scanning calorimetry; drug stability; dry powder; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; glass transition temperature; humidity; hydrogen bond; Influenza virus; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; spray drying; thermostability; Vero cell line; Vesiculovirus; virus capsid; chemistry; desiccation; drug formulation; human; immunology; powder; procedures; transition temperature; Adenovirus Vaccines; Desiccation; Drug Compounding; Drug Stability; Excipients; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Mannitol; Powders; Transition Temperature; Trehalose; Vesiculovirus"
"Systematic Review and Quality Appraisal of Practice Guidelines for Self-Harm in Children and Adolescents","2019","This study aimed to systematically identify and appraise clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) relating to the assessment and management of suicide risk and self-harm in children and adolescents. Our research question is as follows: For young people (under 18?years old) presenting to clinical care with suicide ideation or a history of self-harm, what is the quality of up-to-date CPGs? Using the PRISMA format, we systematically identified CPGs meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, two independent raters conducted appraisals of the eligible CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument. CPGs were then classified as “poor quality,” “minimum quality,” and “high quality” using operationally defined criteria developed a priori. We identified 10 eligible CPGs published or renewed between 2005 and May 2017. Only the long-term management of self-harm CPGs produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence met “high-quality” criteria. Despite multiple options of CPGs published to choose from, only one was identified as “high quality,” where bias is adequately minimized. Clinicians are advised to direct resources to implementing the “high-quality” CPG. ? 2018 The American Association of Suicidology","adolescent; automutilation; child; human; practice guideline; procedures; risk assessment; suicide; Adolescent; Child; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Assessment; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicide"
"xCT knockdown in human breast cancer cells delays onset of cancer-induced bone pain","2019","Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C ? , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C ? has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C ? subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed.

"Prospective, multisite, international comparison of 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, multiparametric MRI, and 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-11 PET/CT in men with high-risk features and biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy: Clinical performance and patient outcomes","2019","A significant proportion of men with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after radical prostatectomy (RP) fail prostate fossa (PF) salvage radiation treatment (SRT). This study was done to assess the ability of 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FCH) PET/CT (hereafter referred to as 18F-FCH), 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-11 PET/CT (hereafter referred to as PSMA), and pelvic multiparametric MRI (hereafter referred to as pelvic MRI) to identify men who will best benefit from SRT. Methods: Prospective, multisite imaging studies were carried out in men who had rising PSA levels after RP, high-risk features, and negative/equivocal conventional imaging results and who were being considered for SRT. 18F-FCH (91/91), pelvic MRI (88/91), and PSMA (31/91) (Australia) were all performed within 2 wk. Imaging was interpreted by experienced local/central interpreters who were masked with regard to other imaging results, with consensus being reached for discordant interpretations. Expected management was documented before and after imaging, and data about all treatments and PSA levels were collected for 3 y. The treatment response to SRT was defined as a reduction in PSA levels of .50% without androgen deprivation therapy. Results: The median Gleason score, PSA level at imaging, and PSA doubling time were 8, 0.42 (interquartile range, 0.29–0.93) ng/mL, and 5.0 (interquartile range, 3.3–7.6) months. Recurrent prostate cancer was detected in 28% (25/88) by pelvic MRI, 32% (29/91) by 18F-FCH, and 42% (13/31) by PSMA. This recurrence was found within the PF in 21.5% (19/88), 13% (12/91), and 19% (6/31) and at sites outside the PF (extra-PF) in 8% (7/88), 19% (17/91), and 32% (10/31) by MRI, 18F-FCH, and PSMA, respectively (P, 0.004). A total of 94% (16/17) of extra-PF sites on 18F-FCH were within the pelvic MRI field. Intra-pelvic extra-PF disease was detected in 90% (9/10) by PSMA and in 31% (5/16) by MRI. 18F-FCH changed management in 46% (42/91), and MRI changed management in 24% (21/88). PSMA provided additional management changes over 18F-FCH in 23% (7/31). The treatment response to SRT was higher in men with negative results or disease confined to the PF than in men with extra-PF disease (18F-FCH 73% [32/44] versus 33% [3/9] [P, 0.02], pelvic MRI 70% [32/46] versus 50% [2/4] [P was not significant], and PSMA 88% [7/ 8] versus 14% [1/7] [P, 0.005]). Men with negative imaging results (MRI, 18F-FCH, or PSMA) had high (78%) SRT response rates. Conclusion: 18F-FCH and PSMA had high detection rates for extra-PF disease in men with negative/equivocal conventional imaging results and rising PSA levels after RP. These findings affected management and treatment responses, suggesting an important role for PET in triaging men being considered for curative SRT. ? 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.","fluoromethylcholine f 18; gallium HBED prostate specific membrane antigen 11 ga 68; prostate specific antigen; prostate specific membrane antigen; radioisotope; unclassified drug; adult; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; controlled study; Gleason score; high risk patient; human; human tissue; information processing; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; priority journal; prospective study; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; Review; salvage radiation treatment; treatment failure; treatment outcome; treatment response"
"Postnatal intervention for the treatment of FNAIT: a systematic review","2019","Objective: Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is associated with life-threatening bleeding. This systematic review of postnatal management of FNAIT examined transfusion of human platelet antigen (HPA) selected or unselected platelets, and/or IVIg on platelet increments, hemorrhage and mortality. Study design: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane searches were conducted until 11 May 2018. Result: Of 754 neonates, 382 received platelet transfusions (51%). HPA-selected platelets resulted in higher platelet increments and longer response times than HPA-unselected platelets. However, unselected platelets generally led to sufficient platelet increments to 30 × 109/L, a level above which intracranial hemorrhage or other life-threatening bleeding rarely occurred. Platelet increments were not improved with the addition of IVIg to platelet transfusion. Conclusion: Overall, HPA-selected platelet transfusions were more effective than HPA-unselected platelets but unselected platelets were often effective enough to achieve clinical goals. Available studies do not clearly demonstrate a benefit for addition of IVIg to platelet transfusion. ? 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.","immunoglobulin; thrombocyte antigen; bleeding; brain hemorrhage; clinical effectiveness; disease association; human; life threat; neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia; newborn; newborn mortality; platelet count; postnatal care; Review; statistical bias; systematic review; thrombocyte transfusion; treatment response"
"Boredom and homelessness: A scoping review","2019","Background: Emerging literature suggests that boredom is a frequent problem experienced by homeless persons that may influence their health and well-being. Purpose: The range and breadth of literature exploring boredom among homeless persons is unknown. We initiated this study to fill this gap in existing literature. Method: Using the method advanced by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), and furthered by Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien (2010), we carried out a scoping review to identify the range and breadth of literature exploring boredom among homeless persons. Two independent raters screened titles and abstracts and evaluated full-text articles against a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria established by all authors. A descriptive analysis and inductive narrative synthesis were performed. Findings: Our search yielded 4536 citations following the removal of duplicates. A total of 17 articles were included in our descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis. Five themes emerged from the included studies: Boredom as a feature of the homeless experience; Coping with boredom; Impact of boredom; Environment as a determinant of boredom; and Interventions for boredom. Only two of the included articles focused on boredom as a central construct, with all others identifying boredom as an experience of homeless persons while investigating related phenomena. Implications: Boredom is a critical topic of study for occupational science, and specifically as it relates to disadvantaged populations. Future research exploring the specific impacts of boredom on homeless persons, and research identifying and evaluating interventions to effectively reduce boredom in this population are needed. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Journal of Occupational Science Incorporated.","adult; article; boredom; female; homeless person; homelessness; human; male; narrative; occupation; occupational science; poverty; synthesis; systematic review"
"Embryonic Stem Cell Models of Human Brain Tumors","2019","Utilization of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model system to study highly malignant pediatric cancers has led to significant insight into the molecular mechanisms governing tumor progression and has revealed novel therapeutic targets for these devastating diseases. Here, we describe a method for generating heterogeneous populations of neural precursors from both normal and neoplastic hESCs and the subsequent injection of neoplastic human embryonic neural cells (hENs) into intracerebellar or intracranial xenograft models. Histopathologically, neural tumors derived from neoplastic hENs exhibit features similar to more aggressive medulloblastoma, the most common malignant primary pediatric brain tumor. In this chapter, we will outline the detailed methods for culturing normal and neoplastic neural precursor cells in both adherent and tumorsphere format and the full characterization of the brain tumors generated from these cells in non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD SCID) mice. ?

"A DNAzyme-Based Colorimetric Paper Sensor for Helicobacter pylori","2019","The reliable detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological samples using simple assays or devices remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a simple colorimetric paper device capable of providing specific and sensitive detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a pathogen strongly linked to gastric carcinoma, gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers, in stool samples. The sensor molecule, an RNA-cleaving DNAzyme obtained through in vitro selection, is activated by a protein biomarker from H. pylori. The colorimetric paper sensor, designed on the basis of the RNA-cleaving property of the DNAzyme, is capable of sensitive detection of H. pylori in human stool samples with minimal sample processing and provides results in minutes. It remains fully functional under storage at ambient temperature for at least 130 days. This work lays a foundation for developing DNAzyme-enabled paper-based point-of-care diagnostic devices for monitoring pathogens in complex samples. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"The association of basal insulin treatment versus standard care with outcomes in anti-GAD positive and negative subjects: A post-hoc analysis of the ORIGIN trial","2019","We compared cardiovascular and other outcomes in patients with dysglycaemia with or without anti-glutamic acid dehydrogenase (GAD) antibodies participating in the Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial. Of the 12 537 participants, 8162 had anti-GAD measured at baseline and 267 were anti-GAD positive. The effects of insulin glargine versus standard care and of n-3 fatty acids supplements versus placebo were compared by testing the interaction of the treatment effects and anti-GAD status. The effect of glargine on development of new diabetes was assessed in participants without previous diabetes at baseline. The overall incidence of outcomes did not differ between anti-GAD positive and anti-GAD negative subjects. The incidence of the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke did not differ between anti-GAD positive participants randomized to insulin glargine or to standard care, with a hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 0.80 (0.44-1.44) or in anti-GAD negative participants with a HR of 1.07 (0.96-1.20) (P for interaction = 0.20). ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","enzyme antibody; glutamate dehydrogenase antibody; insulin glargine; omega 3 acid ethyl ester; placebo; unclassified drug; autoantibody; glutamate decarboxylase; glycosylated hemoglobin; insulin; insulin glargine; adult; aged; antibody detection; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; female; glycemic control; heart infarction; human; impaired glucose tolerance; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; post hoc analysis; randomized controlled trial; supplementation; blood; glucose blood level; health care quality; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; treatment outcome; Aged; Autoantibodies; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glutamate Decarboxylase; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Glargine; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Retrospective Studies; Standard of Care; Treatment Outcome"

"Anti-Ebola therapy for patients with Ebola virus disease: A systematic review","2019","Background: Management of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has historically focused on infection prevention, case detection and supportive care. Several specific anti-Ebola therapies have been investigated, including during the 2014-2016 West African outbreak. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effect of anti-Ebola virus therapies on clinical outcomes to guide their potential use and future evaluation. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health, Cochrane Library, African Index Medicus, WHOLIS (inception-9 April 2018), and trial registries for observational studies or clinical trials, in any language, that enrolled patients with confirmed EVD who received therapy targeting Ebola virus and reported on mortality, symptom duration, or adverse effects. Results: From 11,257 citations and registered trials, we reviewed 55 full-text citations, of which 35 met eligibility criteria (1 randomized clinical trial (RCT), 8 non-randomized comparative studies, 9 case series and 17 case reports) and collectively examined 21 anti-Ebola virus agents. The 31 studies performed during the West African outbreak reported on 4.8% (1377/28616) of all patients with Ebola. The only RCT enrolled 72 patients (0.25% of all patients with Ebola) and compared the monoclonal antibody ZMapp vs. standard care (mortality, 22% vs. 37%; 95% confidence interval for risk difference, - 36 to 7%). Studies of convalescent plasma, interferon-β-1a, favipiravir, brincidofovir, artesunate-amodiaquine and TKM-130803 were associated with at least moderate risk of bias. Conclusions: Research evaluating anti-Ebola virus agents has reached very few patients with EVD, and inferences are limited by non-randomized study designs. ZMapp has the most promising treatment signal. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aciclovir; amodiaquine plus artesunate; antivirus agent; beta1a interferon; brincidofovir; favipiravir; gs 5743; immunoglobulin; moroxydine; remdesivir; tkm 130803; unclassified drug; ZMapp; amide; amodiaquine; amodiaquine, artesunate drug combination; antivirus agent; artemisinin derivative; favipiravir; monoclonal antibody; pyrazine derivative; ZMapp; blood; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; human; hypertension; mortality rate; plasma; Review; systematic review; tachypnea; vomiting; drug combination; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; Ebolavirus; factual database; isolation and purification; randomized controlled trial (topic); virology; Amides; Amodiaquine; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antiviral Agents; Artemisinins; Databases, Factual; Drug Combinations; Ebolavirus; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Pyrazines; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"

"Leveraging pragmatic clinical trial design to advance phosphate management in end-stage renal disease","2019","Purpose of reviewPhosphate lowering toward the normal range is advocated and widely practiced in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis. This approach is guided by basic science data and large observational studies that have demonstrated a consistent association between hyperphosphatemia and adverse events, including cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. There has never been a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of phosphate lowering in maintenance dialysis recipients.Recent findingsDespite several trials comparing the effect of different phosphate-binding agents on biochemical targets, no trial has evaluated whether targeting normophosphatemia using phosphate binders mediates better patient outcomes. Recent work has highlighted the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial comparing two strategies for phosphate control. We believe that this research question is optimally suited to a pragmatic trial design.SummaryThere is a pressing need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether intensive phosphate lowering confers improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. We propose a broad framework for such a trial using the principles of pragmatic trial design. The ultimate objective of such a trial will be to provide patients and clinicians with reliable and broadly applicable information on whether reducing serum phosphate toward the normal range improves patient-important outcomes. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Burden on Caregivers of Adults with Multiple Chronic Conditions: Intersectionality of Age, Gender, Education level, Employment Status, and Impact on Social Life","2019","Intersectionality analysis is the study of overlapping or intersecting social identities. Intersecting social identities may have an impact on the perception of burden by family caregivers of older persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction of social factors on the burden of caring for older adults with MCC. A total of 194 caregivers of older adults with MCC were recruited from Alberta and Ontario. Survey data were collected at two time points, six months apart. Additive and multiplicative models were analysed using a generalised linear model to determine the level of caregiver burden. Medium-high social interference (impact on social life) was associated with higher burden when adjusted for age, gender, education, and employment status. The overall results of the five-way interaction suggest that males in general had lower burden scores than females. Irrespective of their education and employment status, females had generally higher burden scores. These results add to the current body of literature, suggesting areas for further research to fill knowledge gaps, and promoting ideas for evidence-guided public health interventions that focus on caregivers. ?

"Reduced expression of synapsin II in a chronic phencyclidine preclinical rat model of schizophrenia","2019","Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. Phencyclidine (PCP)—a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist—induces symptoms indistinguishable from those of schizophrenia. A reduction of the phosphoprotein synapsin II has also been implicated in schizophrenia and has a well-known role in the maintenance of the presynaptic reserve pool and vesicle mobilization. This study assessed the behavioral and biochemical outcomes of chronic NMDA receptor antagonism in rodents and its implications for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Sprague Dawley rats received saline or chronic PCP (5?mg/kg/day) for 14?days via surgically implanted Alzet? osmotic mini-pumps. Following the treatment period, rats were tested with a series of behavioral paradigms, including locomotor activity, social interaction, and sensorimotor gating. Following behavioral assessment, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of all rats was isolated for synapsin II protein analysis. Chronic PCP treatment yielded a hyper-locomotive state (p?=?0.0256), reduced social interaction (p?=?0.0005), and reduced pre-pulse inhibition (p?<?0.0001) in comparison to saline-treated controls. Synapsin IIa (p?<?0.0001) and IIb (p?<?0.0071) levels in the mPFC of chronically treated PCP rats were reduced in comparison to the saline group. Study results confirm that rats subject to chronic PCP treatment display behavioral phenotypes similar to established preclinical animal models of schizophrenia. Reduction of synapsin II expression in this context implicates the role of this protein in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and sheds light on the longer-term consequences of NMDA receptor antagonism facilitated by chronic PCP treatment. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","phencyclidine; synapsin II; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; locomotion; male; medial prefrontal cortex; nonhuman; pathophysiology; prepulse inhibition; priority journal; protein expression; psychosocial withdrawal; rat; schizophrenia; sensory gating; social interaction"
"Characterizing the Patient Experience of CS/HIPEC Through In-Depth Interviews with Patients: Identification of Key Concepts in the Development of a Patient-Centered Program","2019","Introduction: The cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CS/HIPEC) procedure is complex, involving lengthy preparation and recovery in a heterogeneous patient group. Understanding the patient experience is essential to improving interactions with health professionals that is critical to recovery. Objective: This study sought to characterize the early recovery and return to quality of life (at 3 and 6–12?months post-surgery, respectively) in patients having undergone CS/HIPEC, through structured interviews. Methods: Two sets of interviews were conducted among 20 CS/HIPEC patients. Interviews were uploaded into QSR NVivo 10 qualitative software (QSR International, Australia) and coded by two study personnel. Interview 1 focused on initial treatment decision making and postoperative hospitalization, while interview 2 focused on recovery, supports, and return to quality of life. Results: Among the participants, 60% were female and the mean age was 57?years (range 31–71). Diagnoses included disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (n = 6), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (n = 4), colorectal adenocarcinoma (n = 6), goblet cell (n = 2), and mesothelioma (n = 2). The first interview identified common themes of perioperative psychosocial isolation, lack of direction, and the importance of an established support system. Patients requested printed and audiovisual materials focused on addressing expectations. The main findings from the second interview captured patient experiences with longer-term complications, as well as surveillance. Conclusion: Focused interviews with patients recently having undergone CS/HIPEC identified key issues that may be addressed in programs to improve the patient experience. These issues were distinctly different in relation to phase of recovery, and patient-centered programs designed with these factors in mind have the potential to enhance the recovery process. ? 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","abdominal abscess; adenocarcinoma; adult; aged; anastomosis leakage; Article; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; carcinomatous peritonitis; caregiver; clinical article; colorectal cancer; colorectal carcinoma; cytoreductive surgery; decision making; defecation habit; diet restriction; female; gastrointestinal symptom; goblet cell; health practitioner; hospitalization; human; hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy; intensive care; male; medicaid; medicare; mesothelioma; patient care; patient identification; patient information; peritoneum cancer; peritoneum mesothelioma; personal experience; postoperative care; quality of life; surgical infection; adjuvant chemotherapy; cytoreductive surgery; follow up; middle aged; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; neoplasm; pathology; patient care; peritoneum tumor; prognosis; regional perfusion; secondary; standards; survival rate; thermotherapy; Adult; Aged; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Chemotherapy, Cancer, Regional Perfusion; Combined Modality Therapy; Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient-Centered Care; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Prognosis; Survival Rate"
"A comparison of the observed and expected prevalence of HIV in persons released from Ontario provincial prisons in 2010","2019","Objective: To estimate the prevalence of HIV infection in persons released from Ontario prisons in 2010 using administrative health data, and to compare this observed prevalence with the expected prevalence based on the most recently available biological sampling data. Methods: We linked identifying data for all adults released from Ontario provincial prisons in 2010 with administrative health data, and applied a validated algorithm to determine the observed HIV prevalence. We calculated the expected HIV prevalence using 2003–2004 age stratum-specific data from a published study using salivary sampling. We calculated an indirect standardized prevalence ratio of the observed to expected prevalence and 95% confidence intervals. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to adjust for the sensitivity of the algorithm to identify persons with HIV and for undiagnosed HIV infection. Results: Of 52,313 persons released from Ontario prisons in 2010, we identified 363 persons with HIV, for an observed prevalence of 0.69%. The expected prevalence was 2.38%. Standardized for age, we found a prevalence ratio of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.17–0.77). Sensitivity analyses adjusting for the algorithm’s sensitivity and further adjusting for undiagnosed HIV infection produced standardized prevalence ratios of 0.30 and 0.38, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a high proportion of persons with HIV recently released from provincial prisons either do not know they have HIV infection or do know about their infection but are not engaged in care. Interventions are required to screen people for HIV in prison and to link persons with care following release. ? 2019, The Canadian Public Health Association.",""
"“Stay Strong, Stay Sexy, Stay Native”: Storying Indigenous youth HIV prevention activism","2019","Background: Taking Action II is a community-based participatory action research project that adopted a strengths-based approach to thinking about Indigenous youth HIV prevention activism. Eighteen diverse Indigenous youth leaders produced digital stories about Indigenizing HIV prevention during the summer of 2012 at a week-long retreat. Youth were interviewed twice: right after they created their stories and again after community screenings. In the summer of 2013, youth reunited to collaboratively analyze the themes and meanings of their stories. Seven overlapping themes emerged that demonstrated how youth see HIV in the context of their lives' and community. The stories make connections between HIV and structural violence, culture and relationships. In particular, in the context of HIV prevention, they focus on (1) the role of family and elders, (2) traditional sacred notions of sexuality, (3) the importance of education, (4) reclaiming history, (5) focusing on strength, (6) Indigenous cosmology and (7) overcoming addictions. In contrast to conventional public health messaging, youth produced stories rarely focused on individual harm reduction strategies. Instead, ideas of Indigeneity and decolonization were foregrounded as key strategies for health promotion work. ? The Author(s) 2017.",""
"Trauma- and Stressor-Related History and Symptoms Predict Distress Experienced during a Brief Mindfulness Meditation Sitting: Moving toward Trauma-Informed Care in Mindfulness-Based Therapy","2019","Objectives: The present study evaluated focused attention, affective response, and other subjective experiences during a mindfulness meditation exercise, relative to participant exposure to lifetime trauma, life stress experienced in the past year, and trauma-related symptoms experienced over the past month. Methods: Participants were recruited from a university introductory psychology course (n = 151). Meditation Breath Attention Scores (MBAS) were used to assess focused attention during a brief mindfulness meditation, and self-report questionnaires assessing subjective responses to the meditation were administered afterward. All participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing trauma exposure, life stress, and trauma-related symptoms prior to the meditation. Results: Participant history of stressful and traumatic life events and trauma- and stressor-related symptoms that were assessed prior to the meditation were found to be predictive of distress experienced during the meditation. Conclusions: We conclude that mindfulness meditation-based therapy for persons with trauma-related mental health problems should be trauma-informed.

"Pharmacomechanical Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis in Acute Femoral-Popliteal Deep Vein Thrombosis: Analysis from a Stratified Randomized Trial","2019","Background and Objectives The Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal with Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (ATTRACT) trial reported that pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) did not reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), but reduced moderate-to-severe PTS and the severity of PTS symptoms. In this analysis, we examine the effect of PCDT in patients with femoral-popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (without involvement of more proximal veins). Patients and Methods Within the ATTRACT trial, 300 patients had DVT involving the femoral vein without involvement of the common femoral or iliac veins and were randomized to receive PCDT with anticoagulation or anticoagulation alone (no PCDT). Patients were followed for 24 months. Results From 6 to 24 months, between the PCDT versus no PCDT arms, there was: no difference in any PTS (Villalta scale ? 5: risk ratio [RR] = 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.24); moderate-or-severe PTS (Villalta scale ? 10: RR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.57-1.52); severity of PTS scores; or general or disease-specific quality of life (p > 0.5 for all comparisons). From baseline to both 10 and 30 days, there was no difference in improvement of leg pain or swelling between treatment arms. From baseline to 10 days, major bleeding occurred in three versus none (p = 0.06) and any bleeding occurred in eight versus two (p = 0.032) PCDT versus no PCDT patients. Over 24 months, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 16 PCDT and 12 no PCDT patients (p = 0.24). Conclusion In patients with femoral-popliteal DVT, PCDT did not improve short- or long-term efficacy outcomes, but it increased bleeding. Therefore, PCDT should not be used as initial treatment of femoral-popliteal DVT. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.","low molecular weight heparin; rivaroxaban; anticoagulant agent; fibrinolytic agent; adult; anticoagulation; Article; blood clot lysis; carotid artery stenting; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; disease severity; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; hospitalization; human; leg pain; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; mechanical thrombectomy; middle aged; patient compliance; popliteal vein; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; sample size; Villalta scale score; adolescent; aged; bleeding; catheterization; clinical trial; compression stocking; femoral vein; fibrinolysis; fibrinolytic therapy; multicenter study; pathophysiology; popliteal vein; postthrombosis syndrome; procedures; thromboembolism; translational research; treatment outcome; vein thrombosis; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anticoagulants; Catheterization; Catheterization, Peripheral; Female; Femoral Vein; Fibrinolysis; Fibrinolytic Agents; Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Popliteal Vein; Postthrombotic Syndrome; Quality of Life; Stockings, Compression; Thromboembolism; Thrombolytic Therapy; Translational Medical Research; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thrombosis; Young Adult"
"Use of quantitative T2-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient texture features of bladder cancer and extravesical fat for local tumor staging after transurethral resection","2019","OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to determine whether quantitative T2-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) texture features of bladder cancer and extravesical fat are predictive of muscle invasive bladder cancer (category ? T2) and extravesical (category ? T3) disease after transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT). MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, 36 patients (27 men, nine women; mean age, 71 years) were identified who underwent post-TURBT MRI followed by cystectomy without intervening treatment from August 2011 through October 2016. Texture features of bladder cancer and extravesical fat adjacent to the tumor on T2-weighted and ADC images were extracted and compared between category ? T2 versus ? T3 and category T1 versus ? T2 tumors by means of Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, and ROC curves were calculated. RESULTS. Twenty-six of the 36 (72%) tumors were ? T2, and 53% (19/36) were ? T3. In multivariate analysis, bladder cancer entropy on T2-weighted images (p = 0.006; odds ratio [OR], 4.56; 95% CI, 1.49–20.41; AUC, 0.85) and ADC maps (p = 0.019; OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.13–5.31; AUC, 0.80) and extravesical fat entropy on T2-weighted images (p = 0.005; OR, 17.50; 95% CI, 3.01–200.80; AUC, 0.84) and ADC maps (p = 0.002; OR, 6.54; 95% CI, 1.90–32.40; AUC, 0.82) remained greater for ? T3 than for ? T2 tumors. In multivariate analysis, bladder cancer entropy on ADC maps (p = 0.027; OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.08–5.03; AUC, 0.76) and extravesical fat entropy on T2-weighted images (p = 0.010; OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.25–3.79; AUC, 0.78) and ADC maps (p = 0.029; OR, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.25–16.97; AUC, 0.74) remained greater for category ? T2 compared with category T1 tumors. CONCLUSION. Greater entropy of primary bladder cancers and extravesicular fat was observed in category ? T3 than in category ? T2 and in category ? T2 than in category T1 tumors. MRI texture analysis can help with local bladder cancer staging in patients who have undergone TURBT and may serve as a biomarker for higher local category bladder cancers. ?

"The natural history of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases","2019","A proportion of patients with certain types of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and ILDs associated with autoimmune diseases, develop a progressive fibrosing phenotype that shows similarities in clinical course to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Irrespective of the clinical diagnosis, these progressive fibrosing ILDs show commonalities in the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms that drive a self-sustaining process of pulmonary fibrosis. The natural history of progressive fibrosing ILDs is characterized by decline in lung function, worsening of symptoms and health-related quality of life, and early mortality. Greater impairment in forced vital capacity or diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide, and a greater extent of fibrotic changes on a computed tomography scan, are predictors of mortality in patients with fibrosing ILDs. However, the course of these diseases is heterogenous and cannot accurately be predicted for an individual patient. Data from ongoing clinical trials and patient registries will provide a better understanding of the clinical course and impact of progressive fibrosing ILDs. ? 2019 The Author(s).","allergic pneumonitis; autoimmune disease; connective tissue disease; diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; fibrosing alveolitis; forced vital capacity; gene mutation; high resolution computer tomography; human; interstitial lung disease; interstitial pneumonia; lung diffusion capacity; lung fibrosis; mortality; pathogenesis; quality of life; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; survival time; systemic sclerosis; telomere length; allergic pneumonitis; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; fibrosing alveolitis; interstitial lung disease; risk factor; trends; Alveolitis, Extrinsic Allergic; Disease Progression; Humans; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; Lung Diseases, Interstitial; Mortality; Risk Factors"
"Recent Developments in the Treatment of Depression","2019","The cognitive and behavioral interventions can be as efficacious as antidepressant medications and more enduring, but some patients will be more likely to respond to one than the other. Recent work has focused on developing sophisticated selection algorithms using machine-learning approaches that answer the question, “What works best for whom?” Moreover, the vast majority of people suffering from depression reside in low- and middle-income countries where access to either psychotherapy or medications is virtually nonexistent. Great strides have been made in training nonspecialist providers (known as task sharing) to overcome this gap. Finally, recent work growing out of evolutionary psychology suggests that antidepressant medications may suppress symptoms at the expense of prolonging the underlying episode so as to increase the risk of relapse whenever someone tries to stop. We address each of these developments and their cumulative implications. ? 2019","serotonin; serotonin uptake inhibitor; antidepressant agent; Article; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; emotionality; global health; human; low income country; machine learning; mental health care; middle income country; neurotransmission; nonhuman; personalized medicine; postnatal depression; prognosis; psychotherapy; treatment response; behavior therapy; chronic disease; depression; mental stress; procedures; psychology; trends; Antidepressive Agents; Behavior Therapy; Chronic Disease; Depression; Humans; Machine Learning; Psychotherapy; Stress, Psychological"
"The Development of an International Oncofertility Competency Framework: A Model to Increase Oncofertility Implementation","2019","Background: Despite international evidence about fertility preservation (FP), several barriers still prevent the implementation of equitable FP practice. Currently, oncofertility competencies do not exist. The aim of this study was to develop an oncofertility competency framework that defines the key components of oncofertility care, develops a model for prioritizing service development, and defines the roles that health care professionals (HCPs) play. Materials and Method: A quantitative modified Delphi methodology was used to conduct two rounds of an electronic survey, querying and synthesizing opinions about statements regarding oncofertility care with HCPs and patient and family advocacy groups (PFAs) from 16 countries (12 high and 4 middle income). Statements included the roles of HCPs and priorities for service development care across ten domains (communication, oncofertility decision aids, age-appropriate care, referral pathways, documentation, oncofertility training, reproductive survivorship care and fertility-related psychosocial support, supportive care, and ethical frameworks) that represent 33 different elements of care. Results: The first questionnaire was completed by 457 participants (332 HCPs and 125 PFAs). One hundred and thirty-eight participants completed the second questionnaire (122 HCPs and 16 PFAs). Consensus was agreed on 108 oncofertility competencies and the roles HCPs should play in oncofertility care. A three-tier service development model is proposed, with gradual implementation of different components of care. A total of 92.8% of the 108 agreed competencies also had agreement between high and middle income participants. Conclusion: FP guidelines establish best practice but do not consider the skills and requirements to implement these guidelines. The competency framework gives HCPs and services a structure for the training of HCPs and implementation of care, as well as defining a model for prioritizing oncofertility service development. Implications for Practice: Despite international evidence about fertility preservation (FP), several barriers still prevent the implementation of equitable FP practice. The competency framework gives 108 competencies that will allow health care professionals (HCPs) and services a structure for the development of oncofertility care, as well as define the role HCPs play to provide care and support. The framework also proposes a three-tier oncofertility service development model which prioritizes the development of components of oncofertility care into essential, enhanced, and expert services, giving clear recommendations for service development. The competency framework will enhance the implementation of FP guidelines, improving the equitable access to medical and psychological oncofertility care. ?

"2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation Guideline for the Screening, Monitoring, and Treatment of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis–Associated Uveitis","2019","Objective: To develop recommendations for the screening, monitoring, and treatment of uveitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods: Pediatric rheumatologists, ophthalmologists with expertise in uveitis, patient representatives, and methodologists generated key clinical questions to be addressed by this guideline. This was followed by a systematic literature review and rating of the available evidence according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as conditional or strong. Results: Due to a lack of literature with good quality of evidence, recommendations were formulated on the basis of available evidence and a consensus expert opinion. Regular ophthalmic screening of children with JIA is recommended because of the risk of uveitis, and the frequency of screening should be based on individual risk factors. Regular ophthalmic monitoring of children with uveitis is recommended, and intervals should be based on ocular examination findings and treatment regimen. Ophthalmic monitoring recommendations were strong primarily because of concerns of vision-threatening complications of uveitis with infrequent monitoring. Topical glucocorticoids should be used as initial treatment to achieve control of inflammation. Methotrexate and the monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab are recommended when systemic treatment is needed for the management of uveitis. The timely addition of nonbiologic and biologic drugs is recommended to maintain uveitis control in children who are at continued risk of vision loss. Conclusion: This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients/parents making decisions on the screening, monitoring, and management of children with JIA and uveitis, using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process with input from rheumatology and ophthalmology experts, current literature, and patient/parent preferences and values. ? 2019, American College of Rheumatology","adalimumab; glucocorticoid; infliximab; methotrexate; antirheumatic agent; glucocorticoid; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; Article; disease association; enthesitis; eye examination; human; immunosuppressive treatment; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; monitoring; ophthalmologist; outcome assessment; polyarthritis; priority journal; rheumatologist; sacroiliitis; screening; shared decision making; systemic therapy; uveitis; vision; visual impairment; complication; intraocular drug administration; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; mass screening; practice guideline; uveitis; Adalimumab; Administration, Ophthalmic; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Juvenile; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Infliximab; Mass Screening; Methotrexate; Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors; Uveitis"

"Immunotherapeutic effects of recombinant adenovirus encoding interleukin 12 in experimental pulmonary tuberculosis","2019","High dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strain H37Rv administered by intratracheal injection in BALB/c mice induce progressive tuberculosis (TB). In this model, during the first month there is a temporal control of bacillary growth, in coexistence with macrophage activation, granuloma formation and Th-1 response. Then, bacterial proliferation recommences, accompanied by progressive pneumonia and decreasing expression of protective cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α). In this model, we studied the IL-12 gene expression kinetics and cellular source. There is a rapid and progressive IL-12 expression peaking at day 14, when granulomas start their formation and numerous macrophages show strong IL-12 immunostaining, while during progressive TB there is a significant decrease of IL-12 expression and occasional macrophages showed IL-12 immunolabeling. In the second part of this study, we determined the immunotherapeutic effect of recombinant adenoviruses that codify IL-12 (AdIL-12). Intratracheal administration of only one dose of AdIL-12 one day before Mtb infection produced significant decrease of bacterial loads, lesser pneumonia and higher expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ and iNOS. When only one dose of AdIL-12 was given in healthy mice cohoused with infected mice with highly virulent and transmissible Mtb, total prevention of infection was conferred. Moreover, when AdIL-12 was administered by intranasal route in animals suffering late active TB after 2?months of infection, a very low pulmonary bacilli burdens was detected. These experimental data confirm that IL-12 is a significant cytokine in the immune protection against Mtb, and gene therapy based in adenoviruses coding this cytokine increased protective immunity and prevent Mtb transmission. ? 2018 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology","adenovirus vector; gamma interferon; inducible nitric oxide synthase; recombinant interleukin 12; tumor necrosis factor; interleukin 12; adaptive immunity; Adenoviridae; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody labeling; Article; bacterial load; controlled study; cytokine production; experimental tuberculosis; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; immunotherapy; infection prevention; innate immunity; lung homogenate; lung tuberculosis; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; nonviral gene therapy; priority journal; viral gene delivery system; virus recombinant; Adenoviridae; animal; Bagg albino mouse; gene therapy; genetics; immunology; immunotherapy; lung; lung tuberculosis; metabolism; procedures; transmission; Adenoviridae; Animals; Genetic Therapy; Immunotherapy; Interleukin-12; Lung; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"
"Impact of Tumor Size on Cancer-Specific Mortality Rate after Local Tumor Ablation in T1a Renal-Cell Carcinoma","2019","Introduction: Institutional studies suggested that tumor size (TS) might be an independent predictor of recurrence after local tumor ablation (LTA). However, limited data exist to ascertain whether a larger TS may also predispose to a worse cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rate. Materials and Methods: Patients treated with LTA for T1a nonmetastatic renal-cell carcinoma were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2015). Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) methodology, cumulative incidence plots, and multivariable competing risk regression (CRR) models before and after the 1:1 ratio propensity score (PS) adjustment were used to compare LTA for TS ?30 mm vs TS >30 mm. A comparison of cryosurgery vs thermal ablation according to TS was also performed. Results: Of 3946 LTA patients, 2974 (75.3%) patients harbored TS ?30 mm vs 972 (24.7%) harbored TS >30 mm. The latter was significantly older (median age 67 years vs 71 years, p < 0.001), compared with TS ?30 mm. No differences were recorded in annual rates over time. In unmatched CRR models, after adjustment for other-cause mortality (OCM) rate, LTA for TS >30 mm showed a worse 5-year CSM rate (hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, p < 0.001), relative to TS ?30 mm. In PS- and OCM rate-adjusted CRR models, LTA for TS >30 mm still showed a worse 5-year CSM rate (HR 2.86, p < 0.001), relative to TS ?30 mm. Thermal ablation was associated with a higher 5-year CSM rate, compared with cryosurgery (7.6% vs 3.9%, p = 0.02), but only when TS was >30 mm. Conclusions: TS >30 mm is an independent predictor of higher 5-year CSM rates in patients treated with LTA, even after adjustment for OCM rate. In consequence, when LTA is considered, it ideally should be performed for TS ?30 mm. ?

"Biomarkers of cadmium, lead and mercury exposure in relation with early biomarkers of renal dysfunction and diabetes: Results from a pilot study among aging Canadians","2019","Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb)and mercury (Hg)are known nephrotoxicants that have been associated with the risk of developing type-2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this pilot study was to explore relations between biomarkers of Cd, Pb and Hg exposure, early urinary biomarkers of renal dysfunction (kidney-injured molecule-1 (KIM-1), N-acetylglucosaminidase and retinol-binding protein (RBP))and plasma biomarkers deemed predictive of the risk of developing T2D (adiponectin, leptin, branched-chain and aromatic amino acids), among 70 participants (age range: (46–87 yrs))from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA)with normal glycemic control (glycated haemoglobin ? 6.5%)in all but four of them. Significant (p < 0.05)Spearman correlation coefficients were obtained between: plasma adiponectin and RBP (r = 0.42), urinary Cd (r = 0.32), blood Cd (r = 0.36); KIM-1 and CdU (r = 0.33)as well as HgU (r = 0.37); RBP and isoleucine (r = -0.28), leucine (r = -0.33), tyrosine (r = -0.3)and valine (r = -0.44); CdU and isoleucine and valine (r = -0.27 for both). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that some T2D-related biomarkers are confounders of associations between RBP and Hg or Cd biomarkers. Path analyses support a mediating effect of adiponectin on the relation between urinary Cd and RBP. Concluding, this pilot study originally investigated a comprehensive set of biomarkers on complex interactions between toxic metal exposure, renal function and T2D in a group of aging Canadians. Its findings warrant further investigation of longitudinal data in a greater number of participants. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","acetylglucosaminidase; adiponectin; albumin; biological marker; cadmium; creatinine; hemoglobin A1c; isoleucine; kidney injury molecule 1; lead; leucine; mercury; retinol binding protein; tyrosine; valine; biological marker; adult; aged; aging; Article; association; Canadian; clinical article; disease association; female; glomerulus filtration rate; glycemic control; human; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; male; microalbuminuria; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pilot study; priority journal; protein blood level; blood; Canada; environmental exposure; kidney disease; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; urine; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Cadmium; Canada; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Lead; Male; Mercury; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects"
"Refinements of the ICF Linking Rules to strengthen their potential for establishing comparability of health information","2019","Purpose The content of and methods for collecting health information often vary across settings and challenge the comparability of health information across time, individuals or populations. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) contains an exhaustive set of categories of information which constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable as a reference for comparing health information. Methods and results In two earlier papers, we have proposed rules for linking existing health information to the ICF. Further refinements to these existing ICF Linking Rules are presented in this paper to enhance the transparency of the linking process. The refinements involve preparing information for linking, perspectives from which information is collected and the categorization of response options. Issues regarding the linking of information not covered or unspecified within the ICF are also revisited in this paper. Conclusion: The ICF Linking Rules are valuable for enhancing comparability of health information to ensure that information is available in a consistent manner to serve as a foundation for evidence-based decision-making across all levels of health systems. The refinements presented in this paper enhance transparency in, and ultimately reliability of the process of, linking health information to the ICF.Implications for Rehabilitation The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable as a reference for comparing health information. Comparability of information is essential to ensure that the widest range of information is available in a consistent manner for any decision-maker at all levels of the health system.

"Metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery for Indigenous patients in Ontario","2019","Background: In 2013, 18% of Canadian adults had obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;30 kg/m2), compared with 25.7% of Canada's Indigenous population. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obesity, but has not been studied in Canadian Indigenous populations. Objectives: To determine the effects of bariatric surgery in the Indigenous Ontario population. Setting: Multicenter data from the publicly funded Ontario bariatric program and registry. Methods: Prospectively collected data using all surgical patients between March 2010 and 2018 was included in initial analysis and included the following postoperative outcomes: diabetes, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Demographic characteristics, baseline characteristics, and univariate outcomes were assessed using Pearson Χ2 or t tests. Multivariable regression for BMI change was used with complete case analysis and multiple imputation. Results: Of 16,629 individuals initially identified, 338 self-identified as Indigenous, 13,502 as Non-Indigenous, and 2789 omitted ethnicity and were excluded. Baseline demographic characteristics were not statistically different; rates of hypertension (P =.03) and diabetes (P &lt;.001) were higher in the Indigenous population. Univariable analysis showed similar 1-year BMI change (Indigenous: 15.8 ± 6.0 kg/m2; Non-Indigenous: 16.1 ± 5.6 kg/m2, P =.362). After adjustment, BMI change was not different between groups at 6 months (effect size =.07, 95% confidence interval ?.45 to.58, P =.803) and 1 year (effect size = ?.24, 95% confidence interval ?.93 to.45, P =.489). Rates of co-morbidities were similar at 1 year between the 2 populations, despite differences at baseline. Six-month and 1-year follow-up rates were higher in the Non-Indigenous population (P &lt;.001, P =.005, respectively). Conclusions: Weight loss and resolution of obesity-related co-morbidities are similar in Indigenous and Non-Indigenous patients. Access to surgery, patient selection, and long-term results merit further investigation. ? 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery","adult; Article; bariatric surgery; body weight change; body weight loss; clinical outcome; controlled study; disability; educational status; female; human; hypertension; indigenous people; major clinical study; male; metabolism; middle aged; morbid obesity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Ontario; priority journal; retrospective study; surgical patient"
"Periprocedural interruption of anticoagulation in patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism: An analysis of thrombotic and bleeding outcomes","2019","Essentials Patients with cancer-associated VTE frequently undergo invasive procedures. Data on the perioperative interruption of anticoagulation for cancer-associated VTE are lacking. Patients with cancer-associated VTE experience high post-operative VTE and major bleeding rates. This patient population may warrant close follow-up after invasive procedures. Background: Patients with cancer are at high risk for venous thromboembolic events. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) can lead to significant morbidity among patients with cancer, and is estimated to be one of the leading causes of death among cancer patients. Patients with cancer often require invasive procedures for biopsy or therapeutic purposes. There is a lack of data on postoperative outcomes following interruption of anticoagulation in this population. Objective: To assess 30-day postoperative thromboembolic and major bleeding complication rates following the perioperative interruption of anticoagulation in patients with cancer-associated VTE. Methods: We conducted a retrospective self-controlled case series study with patients with cancer-associated VTE undergoing perioperative interruption of anticoagulation at a dedicated tertiary-care anticoagulation clinic for invasive procedures between January 2013 and March 2018. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were the 30-day postoperative rates of VTE and major bleeding, respectively. The secondary outcomes included the 30-day rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and overall mortality. Patients undergoing multiple perioperative anticoagulation interruptions were included. Results: One hundred and forty-six patients undergoing 171 periprocedural interruptions were included in our cohort. The 30-day rates of VTE and major bleeding were both 4.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]?2.0-8.2). The 30-day rate of CRNMB was 2.9% (95%?CI?1.3-6.7) and the 30-day overall mortality rate was 0.6% (95%?CI?0.1-3.4). There were no fatal postoperative VTE or major bleeding events. Conclusions: The periprocedural interruption of anticoagulation in patients with cancer-associated VTE is associated with high postoperative rates of VTE and major bleeding. Patients with cancer-associated VTE may require closer follow-up for VTE and bleeding complications after invasive procedures. ? 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","acenocoumarol; anticoagulant agent; apixaban; dalteparin; enoxaparin; rivaroxaban; tinzaparin; warfarin; aged; anticoagulant therapy; Article; bleeding; case study; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; disease association; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; follow up; human; invasive procedure; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality; perioperative period; postoperative complication; priority journal; retrospective study; splanchnic vein thrombosis; tertiary care center; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism"
"Hypoglycemia and incident cognitive dysfunction: A post hoc analysis from the ORIGIN trial","2019","OBJECTIVE Epidemiological studies have reported a relationship between severe hypoglycemia, cognitive dysfunction, and dementia in middle-aged and older people with type 2 diabetes. However, whether severe or nonsevere hypoglycemia precedes cognitive dysfunction is unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between hypoglycemia and incident cognitive dysfunction in a group of carefully followed patients using prospectively collected data in the Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective cohort analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial included individuals with dysglycemia who had additional cardiovascular risk factors and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ?24 (N = 11,495). Severe and nonsevere hypoglycemic events were collected prospectively during a median follow-up time of 6.2 years. Incident cognitive dysfunction was defined as either reported dementia or an MMSE score of <24. The hazard of at least one episode of severe or nonsevere hypoglycemia for incident cognitive dysfunction (i.e., the dependent variable) from the time of randomization was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model after adjusting for baseline cardiovascular disease, diabetes status, treatment allocation, and a propensity score for either form of hypoglycemia. RESULTS This analysis did not demonstrate an association between severe hypoglycemia and incident cognitive impairment either before (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16; 95% CI 0.89, 1.52) or after (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.76, 1.31) adjusting for the severe hypoglycemia propensities. Conversely, nonsevere hypoglycemia was inversely related to incident cognitive impairment both before (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.52, 0.68) and after (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.51, 0.67) adjustment. CONCLUSIONS Hypoglycemia did not increase the risk of incident cognitive dysfunction in 11,495 middle-aged individuals with dysglycemia. ? 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.","adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; human; hypoglycemia; incidence; major clinical study; male; Mini Mental State Examination; post hoc analysis; prospective study; risk assessment; blood; cardiovascular disease; cognitive defect; educational status; hypoglycemia; incidence; middle aged; proportional hazards model; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; antidiabetic agent; insulin glargine; metformin; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Insulin Glargine; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"Paediatric tuberculosis among the foreign-born: Utility of the Canadian TB immigration medical surveillance programme","2019","BACKGROUND: There are few data on the utility of screening paediatric immigrants for tuberculosis (TB) in low TB burden countries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of the Canadian immigration medical examination and TB Medical Surveillance (TBMS) for detecting paediatric TB disease. DESIGN: A 10-year population-based retrospective cohort study of foreign-born children (ages 0–10 years) and adolescents (ages 11–17 years) immigrating to Ontario, Canada, using linked immigration and public health databases. RESULTS: Among 232 169 individuals (median followup of 5.7 years), active TB was diagnosed at or after immigration in 125 cases (20 children and 105 adolescents), at an overall rate of 54/100 000 (14/100 000 children, 116/100 000 adolescents). All cases originated from 34 countries. Active TB was diagnosed in 0/419 children and 10/418 adolescents referred for medical surveillance, representing only 8.0% of all cases. TBMS referrals were correlated with a previous diagnosis of TB (? = 0.8) and were driven by country of origin (e.g., hazard ratio 31.2 for the Philippines). Rates of pre-immigration TB diagnosis varied considerably among high TB burden countries. CONCLUSIONS: The current Canadian system detects little TB disease, and reveals very different rates of pre-immigration paediatric TB diagnosis in different high TB burden countries. These data provide a basis for improving TB screening strategies for immigrants to low TB burden countries. ? 2019 The Union.","Article; Bangladesh; Canadian; child; cohort analysis; disease burden; disease surveillance; female; human; immigration; India; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; medical examination; Pakistan; Philippines; population research; priority journal; public health; retrospective study; adolescent; health survey; infant; mass screening; migrant; newborn; Ontario; preschool child; procedures; program evaluation; proportional hazards model; tuberculosis; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mass Screening; Ontario; Program Evaluation; Proportional Hazards Models; Public Health Surveillance; Retrospective Studies; Tuberculosis"
"Examined and positive lymph nodes counts and lymph nodes ratio are associated with survival in major salivary gland cancer","2019","Background: We aimed to investigate the prognostic role of examined (dissected) lymph nodes (ELNs), negative LNs (NLNs), and positive (metastatic) LNs (PLNs) counts and LN ratio (LNR = PLNs/ELNs×100) in patients with major salivary gland cancer (SGC). Methods: Data were retrieved for major SGC patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2011 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Results: We have included 5446 patients with major SGC. Most patients had parotid gland cancer (84.61%). Patients having >18 ELNs, >4 PLNs, and >33.33% LNR were associated with a worse survival. Moreover, older age, male patients, grade IV, distant stage, unmarried patients, submandibular gland cancer, and received chemotherapy but not received surgery were significantly associated with a worse survival. Conclusions: We demonstrated that patients with >18 ELNs and >4 PLNs counts, and >33.33% LNR were high-risk group patients. We strongly suggest adding the ELNs and PLNs counts and/or LNR into the current staging system. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","antineoplastic agent; acinar cell carcinoma; adenoid cystic carcinoma; adult; age; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; female; gender; high risk patient; human; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mucoepidermoid tumor; overall survival; parotid gland cancer; priority journal; salivary gland cancer; submandibular gland; survival analysis; survival rate"
"Payment models in primary health care: A driver of the quantity and quality of medical laboratory utilization","2019","Physician payment models' incentives regarding many aspects of primary health care are not well understood. We focus on the case of medical laboratory utilization and examine how physicians' laboratory test ordering patterns change following a switch to a blended capitation payment model from one with fee for service enhanced with pay for performance. Also, within blended capitation, we examine differences between traditional staffing and interdisciplinary teams. Using a propensity score weighted fixed-effects specification to address selection, it is estimated that the switch to capitation leads to a short-run average of 3% fewer laboratory requisitions per patient. Patients' laboratory utilization also becomes more concentrated with the rostering physician. More importantly, using diabetes-related laboratory tests as a case study, after joining the blended model, physicians order 3% fewer inappropriate/redundant tests, and the addition of an interdisciplinary care team makes the reduction about 9%. Advances in both continuity and quality seem to be associated with blended capitation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","hemoglobin A1c; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; capitation fee; child; controlled study; female; health care quality; health care utilization; hospital personnel; human; infant; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; medical fee; newborn; patient care; primary health care; primary medical care; priority journal; propensity score"
"Discourse on culture in research on immigrant and migrant workers’ health","2019","Background: Health and safety researchers and practitioners have proposed that cultural differences help explain inequalities between foreign and native-born workers. While cultural explanations for inequalities have long been debated in other fields, there exists little critique of cultural discourses in occupational health. Methods: This article examines and discusses the discourse on culture in 107 articles on immigrant or migrant workers’ health published between 2011 and 2015. For each article, passages on culture were identified and analysed for both the context and the manner in which culture was discussed. Results: The discourse on culture was found to be generally simplistic, individualistic, and uncritical, intentionally or unintentionally supporting the worldview that workers’ “otherness” is both cause of inequalities and target for interventions. Conclusion: The article argues that empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary work is needed to document the mechanisms and pathways that underlie health and safety inequalities by foreign-born status. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","article; discourse analysis; human; immigrant; indigenous people; migrant worker; occupational health; physician; scientist; theoretical study"
"Cholinergic Differentiation of Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cell Line and Its Potential Use as an In vitro Model for Alzheimer’s Disease Studies","2019","Cholinergic transmission is critical to high-order brain functions such as memory, learning, and attention. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline associated with a specific degeneration of cholinergic neurons. No effective treatment to prevent or reverse the symptoms is known. Part of this might be due to the lack of in vitro models that effectively mimic the relevant features of AD. Here, we describe the characterization of an AD in vitro model using the SH-SY5Y cell line. Exponentially growing cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium and differentiation was triggered by the combination of retinoic acid (RA) and BDNF. Both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzymatic activities and immunocontent were determined. For mimicking tau and amyloid-β pathology, RA + BDNF-differentiated cells were challenged with okadaic acid (OA) or soluble oligomers of amyloid-β (AβOs) and neurotoxicity was evaluated. RA + BDNF-induced differentiation resulted in remarkable neuronal morphology alterations characterized by increased neurite density. Enhanced expression and enzymatic activities of cholinergic markers were observed compared to RA-differentiation only. Combination of sublethal doses of AβOs and OA resulted in decreased neurite densities, an in vitro marker of synaptopathy. Challenging RA + BDNF-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with the combination of sublethal doses of OA and AβO, without causing considerable decrease of cell viability, provides an in vitro model which mimics the early-stage pathophysiology of cholinergic neurons affected by AD. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","acetylcholinesterase; amyloid beta protein; brain derived neurotrophic factor; choline acetyltransferase; okadaic acid; retinoic acid; Alzheimer disease; Article; cell viability; cholinergic nerve cell; cholinergic synapse; controlled study; human; human cell; nerve cell differentiation; neurite; SH-SY5Y cell line"
"The 2014 Ontario Child Health Study—Methodology [L’?tude sur la sant? des jeunes Ontariens 2014 - m?thodologie]","2019","Objective: To describe the methodology of the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study (OCHS): a province-wide, cross-sectional, epidemiologic study of child health and mental disorder among 4- to 17-year-olds living in household dwellings. Method: Implemented by Statistics Canada, the 2014 OCHS was led by academic researchers at the Offord Centre for Child Studies (McMaster University). Eligible households included families with children aged 4 to 17 years, who were listed on the 2014 Canadian Child Tax Benefit File. The survey design included area and household stratification by income and 3-stage cluster sampling of areas and households to yield a probability sample of families. Results: The 2014 OCHS included 6,537 responding households (50.8%) with 10,802 children aged 4 to 17 years. Lower income families living in low-income neighbourhoods were less likely to participate. In addition to measures of childhood mental disorder assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) and OCHS Emotional Behavioural Scales (OCHS-EBS), the survey contains measures of neighbourhoods, schools, families and children, and includes administrative data held by the Ministries of Education and Health and Long-Term Care. Conclusions: The complex survey design and differential non-response of the 2014 OCHS required the use of sampling weights and adjustment for design effects. The study is available throughout Canada in the Statistics Canada Research Data Centres (RDCs). We urge external investigators to access the study through the RDCs or to contact us directly to collaborate on future secondary analysis studies based on the OCHS. ?

"XRF analysis of strontium: Exploring cellulose as a soft tissue equivalent","2019","X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a widely used method for in vivo elemental analysis. Particularly for bone, it is a non-invasive technique that provides information on composition without significant risk to the patient. XRF contributes a capability for measuring elements beneficial to human health, such as strontium. This is a proposed supplement that has been shown in clinical trials to reduce fracture risk in people diagnosed with osteoporosis. Although XRF is a viable method for quantifying bone strontium, there are still factors that constrain its effectiveness. X-ray attenuation through overlying soft tissue decreases the signal, consequently requiring correction before estimating the true concentration of strontium in bone. A correction factor can be applied to account for the reduced signal, but an accurate measurement of overlying soft tissue thickness is required. It has been shown that using the correlation between Compton peak count rate and overlying thickness can be used as an estimation of overlying tissue. Lucite is commonly used as a soft tissue substitute; however, its mean atomic number is appreciably lower than soft tissue, somewhat limiting its applicability. This study tests the feasibility of using cellulose filter papers as a substitute for overlying soft tissue to perform XRF analysis of strontium-doped hydroxyapatite bone phantoms. Mass attenuation coefficients are shown to be closer to those of soft tissue (International Commission on Radiation Units' four-component) than Lucite, and the Compton correlation is used to estimate thickness as a correction factor to quantify true strontium concentration. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",""
"Situational cues surrounding family physicians seeking external resources while self-monitoring in practice","2019","Many models of safe and effective clinical decision making in medical practice emphasize the importance of recognizing moments of uncertainty and seeking help accordingly. This is not always done effectively, but we know little about what cues prompt health professionals to call on resources beyond their own knowledge or skill set. Such information would offer guidance regarding how systems might be designed to offer better individual support. In this study, the authors explored the situational factors that are present during moments of uncertainty that lead primary care physicians to access external resources. To do so, a generic qualitative exploratory analysis was conducted on 72 narratives collected through audio recorder-based, self-observational, journaling completed by 12 purposively selected family physicians. Participants were asked to provide a detailed descriptive account of the circumstances surrounding their consultation of external resources immediately after 6 sequential patient encounters in which they felt compelled to seek such support. Thematic analysis of the transcripts was performed to better understand participants’ experiences of the social, contextual, and personal features surrounding decisions to seek support. When doing so we observed that specific features of patient encounters were routinely present when physicians decided to access external sources for help. These included medical aspects of the case (e.g., complex presentations), social aspects (e.g., the presence of another individual), and personal factors (e.g., feeling a need for reassurance). External resources were seen as an opportunity for verification, a mechanism to increase patient satisfaction, and a means through which to defend decision-making. Accessing such resources appeared to influence the physician–patient relationship for various reasons. Recognition and further study of the cues that prompt use of external information will further our understanding of physicians’ behavioural responses to challenging/uncertain situations, highlight mechanisms through which a culture of self-directed assessment seeking might be encouraged, and offer guidance regarding ways in which physicians can be encouraged to practice mindfully. Our results make it clear that reasons for which primary care physicians seek the support of external resources may be multifactorial and, therefore, one should be cautious when inferring reasons for the pursuit of such support. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","adult; article; autoregulation; clinical article; consultation; decision making; exploratory research; female; general practitioner; genetic transcription; human; male; narrative; patient safety; patient satisfaction; reassurance; self monitoring; social aspect; thematic analysis; uncertainty"

These guidelines define who are the patients at risk, how to assess nutritional status of an ICU patient, how to define the amount of energy to provide, the route to choose and how to adapt according to various clinical conditions. When to start and how to progress in the administration of adequate provision of nutrients is also described. The best determination of amount and nature of carbohydrates, fat and protein are suggested. Special attention is given to glutamine and omega-3 fatty acids. Particular conditions frequently observed in intensive care such as patients with dysphagia, frail patients, multiple trauma patients, abdominal surgery, sepsis, and obesity are discussed to guide the practitioner toward the best evidence based therapy.

"Exploring the use of fact-based and story-based learning materials for HIV/STI prevention and sexual health promotion with South Asian women in Toronto, Canada","2019","Story-based learning is well recognized as an effective strategy for adult health education. However, there is a scarcity of research on story-based health education among women in South Asian diasporic communities. To address this gap, we undertook a pilot study in Toronto to explore how South Asian women respond to the use of fact-based and story-based materials for HIV/STI prevention. A total of 78 women were recruited from across the city. We engaged nearly half of the women (n=40) using fact sheets on HIV/STIs, and the remainder (n=38) using stories written by South Asian women on HIV/STIs. Surveys and focus groups were used to explore participants' responses in terms of knowledge, attitudes and perspectives. Results indicated that both approaches were effective in increasing participants' knowledge of HIV/STIs. Participants in the fact-based sessions tended to distance themselves from the idea of personal HIV/STI risks. Participants in the story-based groups were emotionally engaged, expressing personal commitments to take a stand against HIV stigma. In summary, within-culture stories are potentially effective tools that enable women to make sense of their own life situations and contextual vulnerabilities. Story-based materials are useful for breaking the silence of taboo topics, addressing stigma and discrimination and raising awareness about collective empowerment. ? ° The Author(s) 2018.

"The sensitivity and specificity of platelet autoantibody testing in immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of a diagnostic test","2019","Essentials The diagnosis of ITP is based on a platelet count?&lt;?100?×?109?L?1 and exclusion of other causes. There are no standard tests or biomarkers to diagnose ITP. The sensitivity of platelet autoantibody testing is low (53%). The specificity is high (&gt;?90%). A positive autoantibody test can be useful to rule in ITP but a negative does not rule out ITP. Summary: Background Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. The sensitivity and specificity of platelet autoantibody tests is variable and their utility is uncertain. Objective The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of platelet autoantibody tests in the diagnosis of ITP. Methods Ovid Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched from inception until 31 May 2018. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data. Studies that reported testing results for antiplatelet autoantibodies on platelets (direct tests) or in plasma/serum (indirect tests) for 20 or more ITP patients were included. Results Pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a random effects model. Pooled estimates for the sensitivity and specificity of direct anti-platelet autoantibody testing for either anti-glycoprotein IIbIIIa or anti-glycoprotein IbIX were 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44–61%) and 93% (95% CI, 81–99%), respectively. For indirect testing, the pooled estimates for the sensitivity and specificity were 18% (95% CI, 12–24%) and 96% (95% CI, 87–100%), respectively. Conclusions Autoantibody testing in ITP patients has a high specificity but low sensitivity. A positive autoantibody test can be useful for ruling in ITP, but a negative test does not rule out ITP. ? 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","autoantibody; biological marker; fibrinogen receptor; glycoprotein Ib; antibody blood level; antiplatelet activity; Article; controlled study; data extraction; data synthesis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease marker; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; major clinical study; meta analysis; platelet count; priority journal; protein analysis; publication; quality control; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review"
"Room air for initiating term newborn resuscitation: A systematic review with meta-analysis","2019","CONTEXT: The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation prioritized to rigorously review the initial fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) during resuscitation of newborns. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the scientific summary of initial Fio2 in term and late preterm newborns (?35 weeks' gestation) who receive respiratory support at birth. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched between January 1, 1980 and August 10, 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers in 2 stages, with a Cohen's κ of 0.8 and 1.0. DATA EXTRACTION: Pairs of independent reviewers extracted data, appraised risk of bias, and assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 quasi RCTs included 2164 patients. Room air (Fio 2 0.21) was associated with a statistically significant benefit in short-term mortality compared with 100% oxygen (Fio 2 1.0) (7 RCTs; n = 1469; risk ratio [RR] = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57 to 0.94). No significant differences were observed in neurodevelopmental impairment (2 RCTs; n = 360; RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 0.77 to 2.60) or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (5 RCTs; n = 1315; RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.18). LIMITATIONS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence was low for short-term mortality and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and very low for neurodevelopmental impairment.

"Love with HIV: A Latent Class Analysis of Sexual and Intimate Relationship Experiences Among Women Living with HIV in Canada","2019","Love remains hidden in HIV research in favor of a focus on risk. Among 1424 women living with HIV in Canada, we explored (1) whether eight facets of sex and intimacy (marital status, sexual activity, physical intimacy, emotional closeness, power equity, sexual exclusivity, relationship duration, and couple HIV serostatus) may coalesce into distinct relationship types, and (2) how these relationship types may be linked to love as well as various social, psychological, and structural factors. Five latent classes were identified: no relationship (46.5%), relationships without sex (8.6%), and three types of sexual relationships—short term (15.4%), long term/unhappy (6.4%), and long term/happy (23.2%, characterized by equitable power, high levels of physical and emotional closeness, and mainly HIV-negative partners). While women in long-term/happy relationships were most likely to report feeling love for and wanted by someone “all of the time,” love was not exclusive to sexual or romantic partners and a sizeable proportion of women reported affection across latent classes. Factors independently associated with latent class membership included age, children living at home, sexism/genderism, income, sex work, violence, trauma, depression, HIV treatment, awareness of treatment’s prevention benefits, and HIV-related stigma. Findings reveal the diversity of women’s experiences with respect to love, sex, and relationships and draw attention to the sociostructural factors shaping intimate partnering in the context of HIV. A nuanced focus on promoting healthy relationships and supportive social environments may offer a more comprehensive approach to supporting women’s overall sexual health and well-being than programs focused solely on sexual risk reduction. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Harmonization of U.S., European Union, and Canadian First-in-human regulatory requirements for radiopharmaceuticals: Is this possible?","2019","In recent years, several new radiotracers and radionuclide therapies have been developed. There is a renaissance in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging today in terms of, for example, the ability to image and treat neuroendocrine and prostate malignancies. To be able to bring a new drug product from bench to bedside and assist patients while also ensuring patient safety, stringent regulations must be met. However, differences in regulatory requirements, often based on jurisdictional politics rather than scientific evidence, can hinder global cooperation, increase expense, and slow progress. In an effort to rise above these differences, nuclear medicine professional organizations, regulators, and international agencies have begun to identify commonalities in the regulations to achieve harmonization. Indeed, a more streamlined approach to radiopharmaceutical drug development across jurisdictions could be achieved through establishing harmonized requirements for preclinical studies and manufacturing standards. This paper provides an educational overview of the regulatory and submission requirements governing investigational radiopharmaceuticals for first-in-human radiopharmaceuticals across the European and North American continents. It is hoped that through ongoing collaboration, regulatory reform and harmonization can become a reality and speed access to the most up-to-date evidence-based patient care for all.

"The combined effect of cancer and cardiometabolic conditions on the mortality burden in older adults","2019","Background: The number of older people living with cancer and cardiometabolic conditions is increasing, but little is known about how specific combinations of these conditions impact mortality. Methods: A total of 22,692 participants aged 65 years and older from four international cohorts were followed-up for mortality for an average of 10 years (8,596 deaths). Data were harmonized across cohorts and mutually exclusive groups of disease combinations were created for cancer, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and diabetes at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models for all-cause mortality were used to estimate the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio and rate advancement period (RAP) (in years). Results: At baseline, 23.6% (n = 5,116) of participants reported having one condition and 4.2% (n = 955) had two or more conditions. Data from all studies combined showed that the RAP increased with each additional condition. Diabetes advanced the rate of dying by the most years (5.26 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.53-6.00), but the effect of any single condition was smaller than the effect of disease combinations. Some combinations had a significantly greater impact on the period by which the rate of death was advanced than others with the same number of conditions, for example, 10.9 years (95% CI, 9.4-12.6) for MI and diabetes versus 6.4 years (95% CI, 4.3-8.5) for cancer and diabetes. Conclusions: Combinations of cancer and cardiometabolic conditions accelerate mortality rates in older adults differently. Although most studies investigating mortality associated with multimorbidity used disease counts, these provide little guidance for managing complex patients as they age. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Multimorbidity Frameworks Impact Prevalence and Relationships with Patient-Important Outcomes","2019","OBJECTIVES: To explore how different frameworks and categories of chronic conditions impact multimorbidity (defined as two or more chronic conditions) prevalence estimates and associations with patient-important functional outcomes. DESIGN: Baseline data from a population-based cohort study. SETTING: National sample of Canadians. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 51 338 community-living adults, aged 45 to 85 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronic conditions from three commonly recognized frameworks were categorized as: (1) diseases, (2) risk factors, or (3) symptoms. Estimates of multimorbidity prevalence were compared among frameworks by age and sex. Separate weighted logistic regression models were used to explore the impact of the different frameworks and categories of chronic conditions on odds ratios (ORs) for multimorbidity for four patient-important functional outcomes: disability, social participation restriction, and self-rated physical and mental health. RESULTS: One framework included diseases and risk factors, and two frameworks included diseases, risk factors, and symptoms. The prevalence of multimorbidity differed among the frameworks, ranging from 33.5% to 60.6% having two or more chronic conditions. Including risk factors in frameworks increased prevalence estimates, while including symptoms increased prevalence estimates and associations with most patient-important outcomes. The two frameworks that included symptoms had the largest ORs for associations with disability, social participation restriction, and self-rated physical health but not self-rated mental health. Similar results were found when we compared ORs for patient-important outcome for multimorbidity based on three subframeworks: one including diseases only, one including diseases and risk factors, and one including diseases, risk factors, and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Including risk factors appeared to increase only the prevalence of multimorbidity without significantly altering relationships to outcomes. The inclusion of symptoms increased prevalence and associations with patient-important outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of considering not only the number, but also the category, of conditions included in multimorbidity frameworks, as simply counting the number of diagnoses may reduce sensitivity to outcomes that are important to individuals.

"Salicylate enhances the response of prostate cancer to radiotherapy","2019","Background: Radiotherapy (RT) is a key therapeutic modality for prostate cancer (PrCa), but RT resistance necessitates dose-escalation, often causing bladder and rectal toxicity. Aspirin, a prodrug of salicylate (SAL), has been associated with improved RT response in clinical PrCa cases, but the potential mechanism mediating this effect is unknown. SAL activates the metabolic stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits de novo lipogenesis, and protein synthesis via inhibition of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), and the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), respectively. RT also activates AMPK through a mechanism distinctly different from SAL. Therefore, combining these two therapies may have synergistic effects on suppressing PrCa. Here, we examined the potential of SAL to enhance the response of human PrCa cells and tumors to RT. Methods: Androgen-insensitive (PC3) and -sensitive (LNCaP) PrCa cells were subjected to proliferation and clonogenic survival assays after treatment with clinically relevant doses of SAL and RT. Balb/c nude mice with PC3 xenografts were fed standard chow diet or chow diet supplemented with 2.5 g/kg salsalate (SAL pro-drug dimer) one week prior to a single dose of 0 or 10 Gy RT. Immunoblotting analysis of signaling events in the DNA repair and AMPK-mTOR pathways and lipogenesis were assessed in cells treated with SAL and RT. Results: SAL inhibited proliferation and clonogenic survival in PrCa cells and enhanced the inhibition mediated by RT. Salsalate, added to diet, enhanced the anti-tumor effects of RT in PC3 tumor xenografts. RT activated genotoxic stress markers and the activity of mTOR pathway and AMPK and mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC. Interestingly, SAL enhanced the effects of RT on AMPK and ACC but blocked markers of mTOR activation. Conclusions: Our results show that SAL can enhance RT responses in PrCa. Salsalate is a promising agent to investigate this concept in prospective clinical trials of PrCa in combination with RT. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; salicylic acid; AMP-activated protein kinase kinase; MTOR protein, human; protein kinase; radiosensitizing agent; salicylic acid derivative; salsalate; target of rapamycin kinase; AMPK signaling; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cell proliferation; cell survival; clonogenic assay; controlled study; diet supplementation; DNA repair; drug effect; genotoxicity; human; human cell; immunoblotting; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipogenesis; LNCaP cell line; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; treatment response; tumor xenograft; animal; Bagg albino mouse; castration resistant prostate cancer; drug screening; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; nude mouse; oral drug administration; pathology; prostate tumor; radiation response; Administration, Oral; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Lipogenesis; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Prostatic Neoplasms; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Protein Kinases; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; Salicylates; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Multiplicative advantages of hispanic men living in hispanic enclaves: Intersectionality in colon cancer care: A research note","2019","We examined Hispanic enclave paradoxical effects on cancer care among socioeconomically vulnerable people in pre-Obamacare California. We conducted a secondary analysis of a historical cohort of 511 Hispanic and 1,753 non-Hispanic white people with colon cancer. Hispanic enclaves were neighborhoods where 40% or more of the residents were Hispanic, mostly first-generation Mexican American immigrants. An interaction of ethnicity, gender, and Hispanic enclave status was observed such that the protective effects of living in a Hispanic enclave were larger for Hispanic men, particularly married Hispanic men, than women. Risks were also exposed among other study groups: The poor, the inadequately insured, Hispanic men not residing in Hispanic enclaves, Hispanic women, and unmarried people.

"The Relationship Between the Position of Name Generator Questions and Responsiveness in Multiple Name Generator Surveys","2019","Using randomly ordered name generators, we tested the effect of name generators’ relative position on the likelihood of respondents’ declining to respond or satisficing in their response. An online survey of public health staff elicited names of information sources, information seekers, perceived experts, and friends. Results show that when name generators are asked later, they are more likely to go unanswered and respondents are more likely to respond that they do not know anyone or list fewer names. The effect of sequence was not consistent in different question types, which could be the result of the moderating effect of willingness to answer and question sensitivity. ? The Author(s) 2017.",""
"Metabolomics reveals elevated urinary excretion of collagen degradation and epithelial cell turnover products in irritable bowel syndrome patients","2019","Introduction: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the most commonly diagnosed functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder in developed countries, is characterized by chronic abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits. Objectives: Accurate and timely diagnosis is challenging as it relies on symptoms and an evolving set of exclusion criteria to distinguish it from other related GI disorders reflecting a complex etiology that remains poorly understood. Herein, nontargeted metabolite profiling of repeat urine specimens collected from a cohort of IBS patients (n = 42) was compared to healthy controls (n = 20) to gain insights into the underlying pathophysiology. Methods: An integrated data workflow for characterization of the urine metabolome with stringent quality control was developed to authenticate reliably measured (CV < 30%) and frequently detected (> 75%) metabolites using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Complementary statistical methods were then used to rank differentially excreted urinary metabolites after normalization to osmolality that were subsequently identified by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry and their electrophoretic migration behavior. Results: Our work revealed ten consistently elevated urinary metabolites in repeat samples collected from IBS patients at two different time points (q < 0.05 after age and Benjamini-Hochberg/FDR adjustment), which were associated with greater collagen degradation and intestinal mucosal turn-over processes likely due to low-grade inflammation. IBS-specific metabolites identified in urine included a series of hydroxylysine metabolites (O-glycosylgalactosyl-hydroxylysine, O-galactosyl-hydroxylysine, lysine), mannopyranosy-l-tryptophan, imidazole propionate, glutamine, serine, ornithine, dimethylglycine and dimethylguanosine. A major limitation in this retrospective case-control study was significant co-morbidity of IBS patients with other illnesses, including depression and prescribed medications as compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: This work provides new mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of IBS while also offering a convenient way to monitor patient disease progression and treatment responses to therapy based on a panel of urinary metabolites that avoids invasive blood sampling, colonoscopy and/or tissue biopsies.

"Attenuated inflammatory response of monocyte-derived macrophage from patients with BD: a preliminary report","2019","Background: Innate immune system dysfunction has been recognized as an important element in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). We aimed to investigate whether there are differences in the response of macrophages derived from patients in the early stages and late stages of BD and healthy subjects. Methods: Human monocytes purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with BD type I (n = 18)—further classified into early- and late stage BD patients according to their functioning- and from healthy individuals (n = 10) were differentiated into macrophages in vitro. Monocyte-derived macrophages (M) were exposed to IFNγ plus LPS-M(IFNγ + LPS)- or IL-4-M(IL-4)—to induce their polarization into the classical (also called M1) or alternative (also called M2) activation phenotypes, respectively; or either Mψ were not exposed to any stimuli characterizing the resting state (denominated M0). In vitro secretion of cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α, was used as an index of macrophage activity. Results: M(IFNγ + LPS) from late-stage BD patients produced less amount of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 when compared to early-stage BD patients and healthy controls. Following alternative activation, M(IL-4) derived from late-stage patients secreted less IL-6 compared to the other groups. TNFα was less secreted by all macrophage phenotypes derived from late-stage patients when compared to healthy controls only (p < 0.005). Mψ from late-stage patients exhibited lower production of IL-1β and IL-10 compared to macrophages from healthy subjects and early-stage patients respectively. Interestingly, cytokines secretion from M(IFNγ + LPS), M(IL-4) and Mψ were similar between early-stage patients and healthy controls. Conclusion: Our results suggest a progressive dysfunction in the response of peripheral innate immune cells of BD patients in the late stages of the illness. This failure in the regulation of the immune system function may be implicated in the multisystemic progression of BD. ? 2019, The Author(s).","anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; benzodiazepine; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lithium; neuroleptic agent; tumor necrosis factor; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; clinical article; cognitive bipolar rating assessment; controlled study; depression; DSM-IV; female; gene expression; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; inflammation; innate immunity; macrophage; male; mental disease assessment; middle aged; monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phenotype; polarization; priority journal; quality control; suicide attempt; Young Mania Rating Scale"
"2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation Guideline for the Treatment of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Therapeutic Approaches for Non-Systemic Polyarthritis, Sacroiliitis, and Enthesitis","2019","Objective: To develop treatment recommendations for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis manifesting as non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, or enthesitis. Methods: The Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions were developed and refined by members of the guideline development teams. A systematic review was conducted to compile evidence for the benefits and harms associated with treatments for these conditions. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. A group consensus process was conducted among the Voting Panel to generate the final recommendations and grade their strength. A Parent and Patient Panel used a similar consensus approach to provide patient/caregiver preferences for key questions. Results: Thirty-nine recommendations were developed (8 strong and 31 conditional). The quality of supporting evidence was very low or low for 90% of the recommendations. Recommendations are provided for the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologics, and intraarticular and oral glucocorticoids. Recommendations for the use of physical and occupational therapy are also provided. Specific recommendations for polyarthritis address general medication use, initial and subsequent treatment, and adjunctive therapies. Good disease control, with therapeutic escalation to achieve low disease activity, was recommended. The sacroiliitis and enthesitis recommendations primarily address initial therapy and adjunctive therapies. Conclusion: This guideline provides direction for clinicians, caregivers, and patients making treatment decisions. Clinicians, caregivers, and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients’ values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies. ? 2019, American College of Rheumatology","abatacept; adalimumab; biological product; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; glucocorticoid; golimumab; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; leflunomide; methotrexate; methylprednisolone acetate; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; rituximab; salazosulfapyridine; tocilizumab; triamcinolone acetonide; triamcinolone hexacetonide; antirheumatic agent; glucocorticoid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; Article; disease activity; enthesitis; evidence based medicine; human; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; medical society; occupational therapy; physiotherapy; polyarthritis; practice guideline; priority journal; sacroiliitis; systematic review; arthritis; enthesopathy; intraarticular drug administration; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; sacroiliitis; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis; Arthritis, Juvenile; Enthesopathy; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Injections, Intra-Articular; Occupational Therapy; Physical Therapy Modalities; Sacroiliitis; Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors"
"Tolerance doses for late adverse events after hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer on trial NRG Oncology/RTOG 0415","2019","Purpose/objective: Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) regimens for prostate cancer are emerging, but tolerance doses for late adverse events are scarce. The purpose of this study is to define dose–volume predictors for late gastrointestinal and genitourinary (GI and GU) toxicities after HRT in the multi-center NRG Oncology/RTOG 0415 low-risk prostate cancer trial (N = 521). Material/methods: Treatment in the studied HRT arm was delivered as 70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction with 3D-CRT/IMRT (N = 108/413). At a median follow-up of 5.9 years, the crude late ?Grade 2 GI and GU toxicities were 19% and 29%, respectively. For modeling, the complete HRT cohort was randomly split into training and validation (70% and 30%; preserved toxicity rates). Within training, dose–response modeling was based on dose–volume cut-points (EQD2Gy; bladder/rectum: α/β = 6 Gy/3Gy), age, acute ?Grade 2 toxicity, and treatment technique using univariate and multivariate logistic regression on bootstrapping (UVA and MVA). Candidate predictors were determined at p ? 0.05, and the selected MVA models were explored on validation where model generalizability was judged if the area under the receiver-operating curve in validation (AUC validation ) was within AUC training ± SD with p ? 0.05, and with an Hosmer–Lemeshow p-value (p HL ) &gt; 0.05. Results: Three candidate predictors were suggested for late GI toxicity: the minimum dose to the hottest 5% rectal volume (D5%[Gy]), the absolute rectal volume &lt;35 Gy, and acute GI toxicity (AUC = 0.59–0.63; p = 0.02–0.04). The two generalizable MVA models, i.e., D5%[Gy] with or without acute GI toxicity (AUC validation = 0.64, 0.65; p = 0.01, 0.03; p HL = 0.45–0.56), suggest that reducing late GI toxicity from 20% to 10% would require reducing D5%[Gy] from ?65 Gy to ?62 Gy (logistic function argument: 17+(0.24D5%[Gy])). Acute GU toxicity showed only a trend to predict late GU toxicity (AUC training = 0.57; p = 0.07). Conclusion: Late GI toxicity, following moderate HRT for low-risk prostate cancer, increases with higher doses to small rectal volumes. This work provides quantitative evidence that limiting small rectal dose ‘hotspots’ in clinical practice of such HRT regimens is likely to further reduce the associated rates of GI toxicity. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","acute toxicity; adverse event; Article; clinical target volume; conformal radiotherapy; disease severity; follow up; gastrointestinal toxicity; human; hypofractionated radiotherapy; incidence; intensity modulated radiation therapy; major clinical study; male; multicenter study (topic); planning target volume; pollakisuria; priority journal; proctitis; prostate cancer; radiation tolerance; rectum; treatment planning; urogenital tract disease"
"FAM84B promotes prostate tumorigenesis through a network alteration","2019","Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the contributions of FAM84B in prostate tumorigenesis and progression. Methods: A FAM84B mutant with deletion of its HRASLS domain (ΔHRASLS) was constructed. DU145 prostate cancer (PC) cells stably expressing an empty vector (EV), FAM84B, or FAM84B (ΔHRASLS) were produced. These lines were examined for proliferation, invasion, and growth in soft agar in vitro. DU145 EV and FAM84B cells were investigated for tumor growth and lung metastasis in NOD/SCID mice. The transcriptome of DU145 EV xenografts (n = 2) and DU145 FAM84B tumors (n = 2) was determined using RNA sequencing, and analyzed for pathway alterations. The FAM84B-affected network was evaluated for an association with PC recurrence. Results: FAM84B but not FAM84B (ΔHRASLS) increased DU145 cell invasion and growth in soft agar. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analyses revealed an interaction between FAM84B and FAM84B (ΔHRASLS), suggesting an intramolecular association among FAM84B molecules. FAM84B significantly enhanced DU145 cell-derived xenografts and lung metastasis. In comparison with DU145 EV cell-produced tumors, those generated by DU145 FAM84B cells showed a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; n = 4976). A total of 51 pathways were enriched in these DEGs, which function in the Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum processes, cell cycle checkpoints, mitochondrial events, and protein translation. A novel 27-gene signature (SigFAM) was derived from these DEGs; SigFAM robustly stratifies PC recurrence in two large PC populations (n = 490, p = 0; n = 140, p = 4e?11), and remains an independent risk factor of PC recurrence after adjusting for age at diagnosis, Gleason scores, surgical margin, and tumor stages. Conclusions: FAM84B promotes prostate tumorigenesis through a complex network that predicts PC recurrence. ?

"Objective and subjective sinonasal and pulmonary outcomes in aspirin desensitization therapy: A prospective cohort study","2019","Objective: Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) patients are challenging to manage with sinonasal and pulmonary symptoms refractory to maximal medical and surgical therapies. Our objective was to comprehensively examine objective and validated, disease-specific subjective sinonasal and pulmonary outcomes of aspirin (ASA) desensitization therapy in this patient population. Methods: Prospective cohort study at an academic tertiary center. AERD patients with a history of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prior diagnosis of asthma, and a history of ASA sensitivity were eligible for inclusion. Patients underwent ASA desensitization using an established institutional protocol and continued on a 650 mg twice daily maintenance dose. Baseline Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) responses, acoustic rhinometry, peak flow readings, and endoscopic scoring of nasal polyps were recorded prior to desensitization and after 6 months of maintenance therapy. Results: Twelve patients were recruited for participation and underwent desensitization. Eight patients continued maintenance therapy and follow up at 6 months. Prior to desensitization, patients reported bothersome sinonasal symptoms with a median SNOT-22 score of 30.0 ± 34.5 (interquartile range (IQR)). There was significant improvement after 6 months of maintenance therapy to a median SNOT-22 score of 18.5 ± 17.3 (p = 0.025, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Acoustic rhinometry, endoscopic scores, ACQ and forced expiratory volume values remained stable at 6 months. Conclusions: AERD patients may benefit from ASA desensitization with subjective sinonasal symptom improvement at 6 months and stable asthma and objective sinonasal measures. Further discussion is needed in the otolaryngology community regarding ASA desensitization in AERD management. ? 2019","acetylsalicylic acid; acetylsalicylic acid; acoustic rhinometry; adult; aged; Article; aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease; asthma; chronic rhinosinusitis; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; desensitization; endoscopy; female; human; maintenance therapy; male; medical history; nose polyp; prospective study; aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease; chronic disease; forced expiratory volume; middle aged; nose polyp; rhinitis; sinusitis; Aged; Aspirin; Asthma, Aspirin-Induced; Chronic Disease; Cohort Studies; Desensitization, Immunologic; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Polyps; Prospective Studies; Rhinitis; Rhinometry, Acoustic; Sino-Nasal Outcome Test; Sinusitis"

Methods: Data came from 283 parent-youth dyads aged 9 to 18 years. Parents and youth completed the assessments separately on 2 different occasions 7 to 14 days apart. After converting the OCHS-EBS scale scores to binary disorder classifications, we compare test-retest reliability estimates and use structural equation modelling (SEM) to compare estimates of convergent validity for the same disorders assessed by each instrument. Results: Average test-retest reliabilities based on κ were 0.71 (MINI-KID) and 0.67 (OCHS-EBS). The average β coefficients for 3 latent measures comprising the following indicators—parent perceptions of youth mental health need and impairment, diagnosis of specific disorders based on health professional communications and youth taking prescribed medication, and youth classifications of disorder based on the MINI-KID—were 0.67 (MINI-KID) and 0.69 (OCHS-EBS). Conclusion: The OCHS-EBS and MINI-KID achieve comparable levels of reliability and convergent validity for classifying child psychiatric disorder. The flexibility, low cost, and minimal respondent burden of checklists for classifying disorder make them well suited for studying disorder in the general population and screening in clinical settings. ?

"A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare long-term clinical outcomes of bioabsorbable polymer and durable polymer drug-eluting stents","2019","Aims The durable polymer (DP) of a drug-eluting stent (DES) serves no function once drug elution is complete. To ascertain the benefits of bioabsorbable polymer (BP) over DP-DESs requires a longer follow-up period, to overcome the time taken for polymer absorption. The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the safety and efficacy of BP-DES with the DP-DES over mid (2 years) to long-term (3-5 years) follow-up. Methods and results A thorough computer-based search was performed using Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases. We only included randomized controlled studies comparing clinical outcomes between BP-DESs and DP-DESs. Only studies where data were available for a minimum of 2 years were included. A separate analysis of 2-year outcomes and 3- to 5-year outcomes were conducted. Data from 6 and 8 studies were included in 3- to 5-year and 2-year follow-up, respectively. There were no differences between stent groups in cardiac mortality, stent thrombosis (ST), target lesion revascularization, target vessel failure, and reinfarction rates for either 2-year or 3- to 5-year follow-up. Subgroup analysis according to strut thickness (<100 μm, >100 μm) of BP-DES demonstrated similar results. The analyses of ST and very late ST favoured BP-DESs but did not reach statistically significant level. Conclusion There were no differences in clinical outcomes between BP-DESs and DP-DESs over mid- and long-term follow-up. ? Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

"Exploring the association between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein among stroke survivors","2019","Stroke results in low physical activity, high sedentary behavior (SB), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), which are associated with stroke recurrence. This study examined the association between physical activity, SB, and CRP in stroke. CRP data from 185 stroke survivors (Mage = 65 years) from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2009–2010 were analyzed using weighted regression analysis. There was an interaction between physical activity and SB on CRP (estimated-β = ?0.079, 95% confidence interval [?0.14, ?0.02], p = .011). SB was associated with CRP among those who did not engage in physical activity (estimated-β = 0.068, 95% confidence interval [0.02, 0.11], p = .005), but not among those who did (estimated-β = 0.0003, 95% confidence interval [?0.03, 0.03], p = .988). Physical activity and SB are important modifiable risk factors to lower the risk of recurrent stroke. These findings provide insight into the inflammatory consequences of SB after stroke, particularly among those who also do not engage in physical activity. ? 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",""
"Mitochondria and aging—the role of exercise as a countermeasure","2019","Mitochondria orchestrate the life and death of most eukaryotic cells by virtue of their ability to supply adenosine triphosphate from aerobic respiration for growth, development, and maintenance of the ‘physiologic reserve’. Although their double-membrane structure and primary role as ‘powerhouses of the cell’ have essentially remained the same for ~2 billion years, they have evolved to regulate other cell functions that contribute to the aging process, such as reactive oxygen species generation, inflammation, senescence, and apoptosis. Biological aging is characterized by buildup of intracellular debris (e.g., oxidative damage, protein aggregates, and lipofuscin), which fuels a ‘vicious cycle’ of cell/DNA danger response activation (CDR and DDR, respectively), chronic inflammation (‘inflammaging’), and progressive cell deterioration. Therapeutic options that coordinately mitigate age-related declines in mitochondria and organelles involved in quality control, repair, and recycling are therefore highly desirable. Rejuvenation by exercise is a non-pharmacological approach that targets all the major hallmarks of aging and extends both health- and lifespan in modern humans. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Effort-based decision-making is affected by overweight/obesity in major depressive disorder","2019","Background: Anhedonia and abnormalities in reward behavior are core features of major depressive disorder (MDD). Convergent evidence indicates that overweight/obesity (OW), a highly prevalent condition in MDD, is independently associated with reward disturbances. We therefore aimed to investigate the moderating effect of OW on the willingness to expend efforts for reward in individuals with MDD and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Forty-one adults (HC n = 20, MDD n = 21) completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), clinical and cognitive measures. Anthropometric parameters were assessed in all participants, and an additional evaluation of laboratorial parameters were conducted solely on those with MDD. Individuals with MDD were all on vortioxetine monotherapy (10–20 mg/day). Results: Interactions between reward magnitude, group and OW were observed (χ2 = 9.192, p = 0.010); the OW-MDD group chose the hard task significantly less than normal weight (NW)-HC (p = 0.033) and OW-HC (p = 0.034), whereas there were no differences between NW-MDD and HCs. Within individuals with MDD, the proportion of hard task choices was more strongly correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = ?0.456, p = 0.043) and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) (r = ?0.467, p = 0.038), than with depressive symptoms (r = 0.290, p = 0.214). Conclusions: OW significantly moderated the association between MDD and willingness to make efforts for rewards. These findings offer novel evidence on the potential role of metabolic factors on the basis of anhedonia, and for the heuristic models proposing a pathophysiological connection between mood and metabolic disorders. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","vortioxetine; adult; aged; anhedonia; anthropometric parameters; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical trial; cognition; comorbidity; controlled study; correlation analysis; decision making; digit symbol substitution test; female; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin resistance; major depression; male; monotherapy; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; obesity; outcome assessment; priority journal; reward; statistical analysis; task performance; trail making test"

"Clinical features related to statin-associated muscle symptoms","2019","Introduction: Statins reduce cardiovascular disease risk and are generally well tolerated, yet up to 0.5% of statin-treated patients develop incapacitating muscle symptoms including rhabdomyolysis. Our objective was to identify clinical factors related to statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Methods: Clinical and laboratory characteristics were evaluated in 748 statin-treated Caucasians (634 with SAMS and 114 statin-tolerant controls). Information was collected on statin type, concomitant drug therapies, muscle symptom history, comorbidities, and family history. Logistic regression was used to identify associations. Results: Individuals with SAMS were 3.6 times (odds ratio [OR] 3.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-6.22) more likely than statin-tolerant controls to have a family history of heart disease. Additional associations included obesity (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.18, 8.05), hypertension (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.33, 3.77), smoking (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.16, 3.74), and statin type.

"Identification of novel causal blood biomarkers linking metabolically favorable adiposity with type 2 diabetes risk","2019","OBJECTIVE Observations of a metabolically unhealthy normal weight phenotype suggest that a lack of favorable adiposity contributes to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to identify causal blood biomarkers linking favorable adiposity with type 2 diabetes risk for use in cardiometabolic risk assessments. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A weighted polygenic risk score (PRS) underpinning metabolically favorable adiposity was validated in the UK Biobank (n = 341,872) and the Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN Trial) (n = 8,197) and tested for association with 238 blood biomarkers. Associated biomarkers were investigated for causation with type 2 diabetes risk using Mendelian randomization and for its performance in predictive models for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). RESULTS Of the 238 biomarkers tested, only insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 concentration was associated with the PRS, where a 1 unit increase in PRS predicted a 0.28-SD decrease in IGFBP-3 blood levels (P < 0.05/238). Higher IGFBP-3 levels causally increased type 2 diabetes risk (odds ratio 1.26 per 1 SD genetically determined IGFBP-3 level [95% CI 1.11-1.43]) and predicted a higher incidence of MACE (hazard ratio 1.13 per 1 SD IGFBP-3 concentration [95% CI 1.07-1.20]). Adding IGFBP-3 concentrations to the standard clinical assessment of metabolic health enhanced the prediction of incident MACE, with a net reclassification improvement of 11.5% in normal weight individuals (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS We identified IGFBP-3 as a novel biomarker linking a lack of favorable adiposity with type 2 diabetes risk and a predictive marker for incident cardiovascular events. Using IGFBP-3 blood concentrations may improve the risk assessment of cardiometabolic diseases. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","biological marker; chemokine; leptin; pepsinogen I; somatomedin binding protein 3; transcription factor RUNX2; adult; Article; biobank; cohort analysis; disease association; disease classification; genetic risk score; human; incidence; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prospective study; protein blood level; risk assessment; risk factor; United Kingdom"
"Dissecting through Barriers: A Follow-up Study on the Long-Term Effects of Interprofessional Education in a Dissection Course with Healthcare Professional Students","2019","Several studies have shown significant improvements in the attitudes and perceptions of healthcare professional students toward interprofessional education (IPE) immediately following intervention with IPE courses. However, there remains little evidence on the lasting effects of IPE courses and the long-term influences of these IPE experiences are poorly documented. The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term effects of an intensive, ten-week interprofessional gross anatomy dissection course at McMaster University. Attitudes and perceptions of past participants towards interprofessional learning were evaluated, now that they have started working with other healthcare professionals outside of the IPE course setting. Thirty-four past participants who have clinical experience working in interprofessional settings or are currently working in the healthcare field completed a follow-up questionnaire consisting of a modified Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and open-ended questions. Quantitative analysis revealed a significant decrease in their attitude towards teamwork and collaboration and respect for other health professions, but a significant improvement in their understanding of roles and responsibilities compared to their results immediately after the IPE intervention. Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed several themes such as developing interprofessional competencies, developing relationships, and remembering the strengths of the IPE dissection course. The results of this study indicate that the IPE experience in anatomy was highly valued by the students and that past participants maintain a clear understanding of their scope of practice, but the reality of clinical practice may have eroded gains made in the program.

"Mechanical stress-induced mast cell degranulation activates tgf-β1 signalling pathway in pulmonary fibrosis","2019","Background The role of mast cells accumulating in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lungs is unknown. Objectives We investigated the effect of fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) on mast cells in experimental and human pulmonary fibrosis. Results In IPF lungs, mast cell numbers were increased and correlated with disease severity (control vs 60%<FVC<90%, mean difference=-222.7, 95% CI ? '386.3 to ?

In a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis model, chymase-positive and tryptase-positive mast cells accumulated in fibrotic lung. Lung tissue was decellularised and reseeded with bone marrow or peritoneum-derived mast cells; cells on fibrotic ECM released more TGF-β1 compared with normal ECM (active TGF-β1: bone marrow-derived mast cell (BMMC)-DL vs BMMC-TGF-β1 p=0.0005, peritoneal mast cell (PMC)-DL vs PMC-TGF-β1 p=0.0003, total TGF-β1: BMMC-DL vs BMMC-TGF-β1 p=0.013, PMC-DL vs PMC-TGF-β1 p=0.001).

"State of Research in the Design and Development of Emergency Response Vehicles and Equipment: A Scoping Review","2019","The current design of ambulances and paramedic equipment are not conducive of a safe and efficient work environment, and it plays a role in the poor health of paramedics. There has been discussion to improve current design standards to set the bar higher. Despite the desire to include human factors and ergonomics (HFE) into a standard, the effectiveness of HFE interventions is unclear and a systematic review of these interventions is needed prior to recommending it into the standard. The objective of this study was to review all existing English peer reviewed research to identify interventions or features of the patient compartment and associated equipment that could affect paramedics performance, health, and safety. A scoping review methodology was applied to systematically search and screen for relevant articles, and to systematically extract and chart the data. Three databases (EmBase, Scopus and PubMed) were searched and search results were screened for articles that pertained to the performance, health, and safety of paramedics within the ambulance or when using equipment. 48 relevant articles were identified. Considering the timeline of the research (predominately since 2005) and the current state of intervention development (most research still targets understanding the problem), we conclude that the overall body of research available to improve the performance, health, and safety of paramedics is limited. Evidence has improved our understanding of the ergonomic challenges faced by paramedics, but we have less evidence to inform standards or best practices. Future research efforts should fill this gap by focusing on developing, implementing and evaluating strategies to address HFE concerns within the paramedic sector. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ambulances; Emergency services; Patient treatment; Search engines; Design and Development; Emergency medical services; Emergency response; Human factors and ergonomics; Research efforts; State of research; Systematic Review; Work environments; Ergonomics"
"Parathyroid hormone-related protein induces fibronectin up-regulation in rat mesangial cells through reactive oxygen species/Src/EGFR signaling","2019","Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is known to be up-regulated in both glomeruli and tubules in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), but its role remains unclear. Previous studies show that PTHrP-induced hypertrophic response in mesangial cells (MCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tubuloepithelial cells can be mediated by TGF-β1. In the present study, although long-term PHTrP (1–34) treatment increased the mRNA and protein level of TGF-β1 in primary rat MCs, fibronectin up-regulation occurred earlier, suggesting that fibronectin induction is independent of TGF-β1/Smad signaling. We thus evaluated the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and found that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species mediates PTHrP (1–34)-induced Src kinase activation. Src phosphorylates EGFR at tyrosine 845 and then transactive EGFR. Subsequent PI3K activation mediates Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Akt and ERK1/2 discretely lead to excessive protein synthesis of fibronectin. Our study thus demonstrates the new role of PTHrP in fibronectin up-regulation for the first time in glomerular MCs. These data also provided new insights to guide development of therapy for glomerular sclerosis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","4 [4 (1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl) 5 (2 pyridinyl) 1h imidazol 2 yl]benzamide; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibronectin; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; parathyroid hormone related protein; parathyroid hormone[1-34]; protein tyrosine kinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transforming growth factor beta receptor; transforming growth factor beta1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; gene expression; glomerulosclerosis; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; male; mesangium cell; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; rat; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; transactivation; upregulation"

"Harnessing smart technology for private well risk assessment and communication","2019","Unregulated, privately owned water supplies, including groundwater wells, are relied upon extensively, particularly in rural and remote regions. While adequate stewardship behaviors (water testing, treatment, and maintenance) have been shown to decrease the incidence and frequency of faecal indicator organism (FIO) presence and, by extension, the risk of pathogenic ingress, contaminated private water supplies continue to constitute a significant public health risk. Recognizing that innovative approaches are needed to bolster well stewardship, this paper identifies and assesses 35 tools (smartphone and web-based applications) to better understand components, functionality, strengths, and weaknesses. Applications for both data collection and risk communication were identified; however, none adequately assess(ed) risk using space-, time- or source-specific inputs (local hydrogeology, climate, groundwater reliance). Well designed applications integrated with crowd-sourced data, environmental data, and models of risk provide an opportunity for enhanced stewardship of private well water resources. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",""

"Cortical thickness in major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Neuroimaging studies assessing neurobiological differences between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HC) are often hindered by small sample sizes and heterogeneity of the patient sample. We performed a comprehensive literature search for studies assessing cortical thickness between patient and control groups, including studies investigating treatment effects on cortical thickness. We identified 34 studies meeting criteria for the systematic review and used Seed-based d Mapping to meta-analyze 24 of those that met additional criteria. Analysis of the full sample of subjects (MDD = 1073; HC = 936) revealed significant thinning in the MDD group in the bilateral orbitofrontal gyrus (BA 11), left pars opercularis (BA 45) and left calcarine fissure/lingual gyrus (BA 17), as well as an area of significant thickening in the left supramarginal gyrus (BA 40). These results support other imaging modalities that report disruptions in various frontal and temporal areas in MDD and identify additional areas in all major cerebral lobes likely to be significant when parsing for biomarkers of treatment or relapse. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","antidepressant agent; anterior cingulate; calcarine sulcus; cortical thickness (brain); disease marker; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; electroconvulsive therapy; frontal cortex; human; inferior temporal cortex; lingual gyrus; major depression; meta analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; orbital cortex; pars opercularis; relapse; Review; supramarginal gyrus; systematic review; temporal cortex; brain cortex; major depression; pathology; Cerebral Cortex; Depressive Disorder, Major; Humans"
"Using magnetic resonance perfusion to stratify overall survival in treated high-grade gliomas","2019","Background: MR perfusion imaging is a relatively new technique that may aid in identifying recurrent tumor (RT) in those with radically treated high-grade gliomas (HGG). We aim to assess the relationship between dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR perfusion (DSC-MRP) and overall survival to establish a baseline for future research and to determine the utility of DSC-MRP as a clinical decision-making and prognostic tool.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Adults with pathologically confirmed HGG at the Juravinski Cancer Centre, Ontario between January 2011 and April 2014 with at least one post-treatment DSC-MRP were included. DSC-MRP was interpreted as positive or negative for tumor recurrence by experienced radiologists. The primary outcome was overall survival.Results: Sixty-one patients were enrolled. Median survival for patients with a positive DSC-MRP scan was 4.5 months compared with 10.2 months for those with a negative DSC-MRP scan (hazard ratio [unadjusted] = 2.51; 95% confidence interval = 1.10-5.67; p-value = 0.03). Multivariable modeling (adjusted) that included all pre-selected variables showed similar results.Conclusion: Survival time in patients with HGG is generally low, and almost all patients will demonstrate RT. Our data suggest a positive DSC-MRP correlates with lower overall survival and may signify the presence of highly active RT. These results generate a hypothesis that there may be a prognostic role for the use of serial DSC-MRP for tumor surveillance. More importantly, this biomarker may aid in decision making for treatment plans and palliation. ? 2019 The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences Inc.","gadobutrol; adult; Article; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; cohort analysis; contrast enhancement; controlled study; dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion; female; glioma; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; salvage therapy; survival time"
"Plasma cell-free DNA: A potential biomarker for early prediction of severe dengue","2019","Background: Considerable progress has been made in dengue management, however the lack of appropriate predictors of severity has led to huge number of unwanted admissions mostly decided on the grounds of warning signs. Apoptosis related mediators, among others, are known to correlate with severe dengue (SD) although no predictive validity is established. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) with SD, and evaluate its prognostic value in SD prediction at acute phase. Methods: This was a hospital-based prospective cohort study conducted in Vietnam. All the recruited patients were required to be admitted to the hospital and were strictly monitored for various laboratory and clinical parameters (including progression to SD) until discharged. Plasma samples collected during acute phase (6-48 h before defervescence) were used to estimate the level of cfDNA. Results: Of the 61 dengue patients, SD patients (n = 8) developed shock syndrome in 4.8 days (95% CI 3.7-5.4) after the fever onset. Plasma cfDNA levels before the defervescence of SD patients were significantly higher than the non-SD group (p = 0.0493). From the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a cut-off of > 36.9 ng/mL was able to predict SD with a good sensitivity (87.5%), specificity (54.7%), and area under the curve (AUC) (0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.88; p = 0.0493). Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that cfDNA could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker of SD. Studies with cfDNA kinetics and its combination with other biomarkers and clinical parameters would further improve the diagnostic ability for SD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cell free DNA; cell free nucleic acid; unclassified drug; biological marker; cell free nucleic acid; immunoglobulin M; adolescent; adult; Article; blood sampling; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease course; early diagnosis; female; fever; hospital; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; plasma; prediction; prognosis; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; severe dengue; shock; Viet Nam; blood; diagnostic test; hospitalization; pathophysiology; procedures; severe dengue; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; Child; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severe Dengue; Time Factors; Vietnam; Young Adult"
"Here comes the SUN: Self-assessed unmet need, worsening health outcomes, and health care inequity","2019","Utilization-based approaches have predominated the measurement of socioeconomic-related inequity in health care. This approach, however, can be misleading when preferences over health and health care are correlated with socioeconomic status, especially when the underlying focus is on equity of access. We examine the potential usefulness of an alternative approach to assessing inequity of access using a direct measure of possible barriers to access—self-reported unmet need (SUN)—which is documented to vary with socioeconomic status and is commonly asked in health surveys. Specifically, as part of an assessment of its external validity, we use Canadian longitudinal health data to test whether self-reported unmet need in one period is associated with a subsequent deterioration in health status in a future period, and find that it is. This suggests that SUN does reflect in part reduced access to needed health care, and therefore may have a role in assessing health system equity as a complement to utilization-based approaches. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","article; Canada; deterioration; external validity; health care utilization; health status; health survey; human; outcome assessment; social status; sun; validation process"
"Enzymatic Litmus Test for Selective Colorimetric Detection of C-C Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms","2019","A paper based litmus test has been developed using modulation of urease enzyme activity for detection of C-C mismatch single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by the naked eye. Urease is first inactivated with silver ions and printed onto paper microzones. Addition of DNA containing C-C mismatches reactivates urease via binding of Ag(I), allowing restoration of urease activity, hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonia, and an increase in pH, which is monitored colorimetrically using a pH indicator with a limit of detection of 11 nM DNA in 40 min. The assay system is easy to use, portable, and stable for at least 30 days at ambient temperature. To assess the versatility and practical application of the paper sensor, we used it to identify a G > C transversion present in human genomic DNA from a ductal carcinoma cell line, a mutation commonly found in breast cancer. We believe this new assay system has the potential to be a low-cost method for rapidly identifying DNA with the C-C mismatch SNP as a means of cancer screening in resource-limited areas. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Ammonia; Cell culture; Diseases; DNA; Enzyme activity; Metal ions; Nucleotides; Urea; Cancer screening; Colorimetric detection; Ductal carcinoma; Hydrolysis of ureas; Limit of detection; Low cost methods; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Urease activity; Silver compounds"
"Maternal Metabolic Complications in Pregnancy and Offspring Behavior Problems at 2?Years of Age","2019","Objectives Prenatal maternal metabolic problems such as pre-pregnancy adiposity, excess gestational weight gain, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are associated with an increased risk of psychopathology in offspring. We examined whether these exposures were linked to symptoms of emotional and behavioral problems in offspring at 2?years of age, or if associations were due to confounding variables. Methods Data from 815 mother–child pairs enrolled at the Edmonton site of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development cohort were used to examine associations between gestational metabolic complications and scores on the externalizing and internalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-1? to 5) at age two. Associations between maternal metabolic complications and offspring psychopathology were assessed before and after adjustment for gestational diet, socioeconomic status (SES), postpartum depression (PPD), prenatal smoking and breastfeeding. Results Pre-pregnancy body mass index and GDM, but not gestational weight gain, predicted more offspring externalizing and internalizing problems. However, after adjustment for confounding variables, these associations were no longer statistically significant. Post-hoc analyses revealed that gestational diet accounted for unique variance in both externalizing (semi-partial rdiet = ? 0.20, p &lt; 0.001) and internalizing (semi-partial rdiet = ? 0.16, p = 0.01) problems. PPD and SES also accounted for a similar amount of variance for both externalizing (semi-partial rPPD= 0.17, p &lt; 0.001; rses = ? 0.11, p = 0.03) and internalizing problems (semi-partial rPPD= 0.21, p &lt; 0.001; rses = ? 0.14, p = 0.004). Conclusions for Practice Since the confounding effect of gestational diet persisted after adjustment for, and was similar in magnitude to, SES and PPD, future research should consider the impact of unhealthy prenatal diets on offspring neurodevelopment. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; behavior disorder; body mass; Canada; checklist; child; child behavior; cohort analysis; complication; female; glucose blood level; human; infant; longitudinal study; male; mental disease; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prenatal exposure; preschool child; problem behavior; psychology; risk factor; Adiposity; Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Canada; Checklist; Child; Child Behavior; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Disorders; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Problem Behavior; Psychopathology; Risk Factors"
"Survival and health care use after feeding tube placement in children with neurologic impairment","2019","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Children with neurologic impairment (NI) often undergo feeding tube placement for undernutrition or aspiration. We evaluated survival and acute health care use after tube placement in this population. METHODS: This is a population-based exposure-crossover study for which we use linked administrative data from Ontario, Canada. We identified children aged 13 months to 17 years with a diagnosis of NI undergoing primary gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy tube placement between 1993 and 2015. We determined survival time from procedure until date of death or last clinical encounter and calculated mean weekly rates of unplanned hospital days overall and for reflux-related diagnoses, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. Rate ratios were estimated from negative binomial generalized estimating equation models adjusting for time and age. RESULTS: Two-year survival after feeding tube placement was 87.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.2%–89.4%) and 5-year survival was 75.8% (95% CI: 72.8%–78.4%). The adjusted rate ratio comparing weekly rates of unplanned hospital days during the 2 years after versus before tube placement was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.57–1.48). Similarly, rates of reflux-related hospital days, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits were unchanged. Unplanned hospital days were stable within subgroups, although rates across subgroups varied. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high among children with NI after feeding tube placement. However, the stability of health care use before and after the procedure suggests that the high mortality may reflect underlying fragility rather than increased risk from nonoral feeding. Further research to inform risk stratification and prognostic accuracy is needed.

"Association Between Hormone Therapy and Muscle Mass in Postmenopausal Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Importance: Hormone therapy (HT) has been suggested for protection against age-related muscle weakness in women. However, the potential for HT-associated health risks necessitates a better understanding of the direction and magnitude of the association between HT and health outcomes, such as lean body mass (LBM). Objective: To determine whether HT was associated with reduced LBM loss compared with not receiving HT among postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, AgeLine, CINAHL, and SportDiscus (searched from inception until April 25, 2018). Study Selection: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, randomized clinical trials including postmenopausal women undergoing HT and control groups of women not receiving HT were selected by 2 reviewers. Studies were included if LBM or fat-free mass were measured as an outcome. Studies with participants from hospitals, long-term care facilities, or with specific diseases were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Information regarding study characteristics and outcome measures were extracted by 1 reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was evaluated. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to abstract data and assess data quality/validity. Data were pooled using a fixed-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcome was the overall absolute change in LBM (measured in kilograms), captured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, dual-photon absorptiometry, or bioelectrical impedance analysis imaging. Results: Of 8961 studies that met selection criteria, 12 were included, with a total of 4474 recruited participants. Of the participants, mean (SD) age was 59.0 (6.1) years. Data on ethnicity were collected by 2 of the studies. Of the 22 HT intervention arms, 15 used estrogen-progesterone combination HT and 7 used estrogen-only HT. Control participants were women who received no HT at all or who received placebo. The median follow-up duration was 2 years (range, 6 months to 6 years). Seven treatment arms showed a loss of LBM, and 14 were protective. Overall, HT users lost 0.06 kg (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.18) less LBM compared with control participants, but the difference was not statistically significant (P?=?.26). The results were unchanged when stratified based on treatment type and dosage, duration of follow-up, time since menopause, study quality, and type of LBM measurement, with HT users losing between 0.06 kg more to 0.20 kg less LBM compared with control participants for all strata. The quality of evidence based on GRADE was low. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review and meta-analysis did not show a significant beneficial or detrimental association of HT with muscle mass. Although muscle retention in aging women is of crucial importance, these findings suggest that interventions other than HT should be explored.",""
"Cooking up the “gastro-citizen” through school meal programs in France and Japan","2019","School meal programs in France and Japan have become sites of bio- and gastro-politics in what amounts to a project of creating gastro-citizens. In the past fifteen years public health and education administrators have revamped school meal programs to promote nutritional health, food safety, quality, and national culinary traditions. Even though in both countries school meals are financially accessible to students of all income levels, lack of choice in terms of food options means that those who do not conform to national culinary homogeneity are denied gastro-citizenship. Such a denial, as communicated through the “gastro-politics” of school meal programs, is one more way that certain individuals are socially excluded in these societies. ? 2018, ? 2018 Association for the Study of Food and Society.",""
"Barriers to HIV care among Francophone African, Caribbean and Black immigrant people living with HIV in Canada: A protocol for a scoping systematic review","2019","Introduction Language is a social determinant of health. Addressing social determinants of health is paramount to successful progression along the HIV-care continuum. Canada is a bilingual country with French and English as official languages. There are few studies to date that have focused on the impact of being a French-speaking linguistic minority on the HIV-care continuum. The primary objective of this scoping, systematic review of literature is to evaluate existing gaps in access to HIV- care among French-speaking people living with HIV in Canada. Our primary outcome is healthcare services availability and access for French- speaking people living with HIV. Methods and analyses Our scoping, systematic review will draw on a systematic search of published literature, both quantitative and qualitative studies published on French-speaking individuals' healthcare and HIV status in Canada, with particular emphasis on the province of Ontario. We will conduct our search in MEDLINE, the Excerpta Medica Database, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, EBSCO and Google Scholar for work published between 1990 and 2018. Identified articles will be screened in duplicate and full-text articles of relevant studies will be retrieved. Data will also be extracted by two researchers working independently. Any discrepancies that arise will be resolved by consensus or by consulting a third author. Our findings will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Ethics and dissemination Our proposed research will not be conducted with human participants. We will only use secondary published data and therefore ethics approval is not required. Our findings will be disseminated as peer reviewed manuscripts at conferences and student rounds, and could be of interest to government health agencies and local HIV/AIDS service organisations. ?

"A randomized education trial of spaced versus massed instruction to improve acquisition and retention of paediatric resuscitation skills in emergency medical service (EMS) providers","2019","Aim: Resuscitation courses are typically taught in a massed format despite existing evidence suggesting skill decay as soon as 3 months after training. Our study explored the impact of spaced versus massed instruction on acquisition and long-term retention of provider paediatric resuscitation skills. Methods: Providers were randomized to receive a paediatric resuscitation course in either a spaced (four weekly sessions) or massed format (two sequential days). Infant and adult chest compressions [CC], bag mask ventilation [BMV], and intraosseous insertion [IO] performance was measured using global rating scales. Results: Forty-eight participants completed the study protocol. Skill performance improved from baseline in both groups immediately following training. 3-months post-training the infant and adult CC scores remained significantly improved from baseline testing in both the massed and spaced groups; however, the infant BMV and IO scores remained significantly improved from baseline testing in the spaced: BMV (pre, 1.8 ± 0.7 vs post-3-months, 2.2 ± 7; P = 0.005) IO (pre, 2.5 ± 1 vs post-3-months, 3.1 ± 0.5; P = 0.04) but not in the massed groups: BMV (pre, 1.6 ± 0.5 vs post-3-months, 1.8 ± 0.5; P = 0.98) IO (pre, 2.6 ± 1.1 vs post-3-months, 2.7 ± 0.2; P = 0.98). Conclusion: 3-month retention of CC skills are similar regardless of training format; however, retention of other resuscitation skills may be better when taught in a spaced format. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; article; artificial ventilation; child; clinical article; controlled study; education; emergency health service; female; human; human experiment; infant; male; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; resuscitation; skill"
"Skin mottling score and capillary refill time to assess mortality of septic shock since pre-hospital setting","2019","Objectives: The early identification of septic shock patients at high risk of poor outcome is essential to early initiate optimal treatments and to decide on hospital admission. Biomarkers are often used to evaluate the severity. In prehospital settings, the availability of biomarkers, such as lactate, is restricted. In this context, clinical tools such as skin mottling score (SMS) and capillary refill time (CRT) are more suitable. In this study, we describe prehospital SMS and CRT's ability to predict mortality of patients with septic shock initially cared in the prehospital setting by a mobile intensive care unit. Methods: Patients with septic shock who received prehospital medical care admitted to the intensive care unit were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Sixty-three patients were included. The origin of sepsis was mainly pulmonary (67%). Overall mortality reached 36%. No significant difference was observed in the duration of prehospital medical care between alive and deceased patients. Mean prehospital value of SMS was 3 ± 2 and mean prehospital value of CRT was 5 ± 1 s. A significant association was found between mortality and prehospital SMS (p = 0.02, OR[CI95] = 1.50 [1.08–2.15]) and prehospital CRT (p = 0.04, OR[CI95] = 1.53 [1.04–2.37]). After adjusting for confounding factors using propensity score, the relative risk of death was 6.58 for SMS > 2 and 2.03 for CRT > 4 s. Conclusion: In this study, we report an association between prehospital SMS and CRT, and mortality of patients with septic shock. SMS and CRT are simple tools that could be used to optimize the triage and to decide early intensive care admission. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","aged; Article; capillary refill time; clinical assessment tool; controlled study; emergency care; female; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; lung infection; major clinical study; male; medical care; mortality rate; mortality risk; observational study; population research; prediction; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; scoring system; septic shock; skin mottling score; emergency health service; France; hospitalization; intensive care; microcirculation; middle aged; mortality; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; septic shock; severity of illness index; skin; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Critical Care; Emergency Medical Services; Female; France; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Shock, Septic; Skin; Triage"
"Physical Literacy, Physical Activity and Health: Toward an Evidence-Informed Conceptual Model","2019","Physical literacy (PL) provides a powerful lens for examining movement in relation to physical activity (PA) and motor skill outcomes, environmental context, and broader social and affective learning processes. To date, limited consideration has been given to the role PL plays in promoting positive health behaviours. There is no clear conceptual framework based on existing empirical evidence that links PL to health, nor has an evidence-informed case been made for such a position. The purpose of this paper is to (1) present a conceptual model positioning PL as a health determinant, and (2) present evidence in support of PL as a health determinant, drawing on research largely from outside physical education. Viewing PL from the perspective of a multidimensional, experiential convergence process enables it to be differentiated from other models. However, parallels between our model and existing models that focus on movement competence are also drawn. Arguing from a pragmatic perspective on PL, we present evidence for positioning PL as a determinant of health from two literature sources: research on motor coordination disorders in children, and associations between motor competence, PA and health in typically developing children. Statistical modelling approaches consistent with the concept of PL are discussed. Results from these approaches—confirmatory factor analysis and cluster analysis—support the idea that measures related to motor competence, motivation and positive affect work in an integrative manner to produce differences in PA and subsequent health outcomes in children. There is increasing interest in PL, particularly in the field of public health. Presenting a model that explicitly links PL to health can lead to the generation of new research questions and the possibility of broadening impact beyond the context of physical education alone. To date, there has been little conceptual attention to what positioning PL as a determinant of health means. By providing an evidence-based model of PL as a determinant of health, we hope to further the discussion and stimulate increased empirical research in the field. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",""

"Predictors of 1-year mortality in adult lung transplant recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Upon surviving the first year post-lung transplantation, recipients can expect a median survival of 8 years. Within the first year, graft failure and multi-organ failure (possibly secondary to graft failure) are common causes of mortality. To better understand the prognosis within the first year, we plan on conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addressing the association between the patient, donor, and transplant operative factors and graft loss 1-year post-lung transplant. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register, and PubMed supplemental for non-MEDLINE records for observational studies identifying independent risk factors for early mortality (1 year) in adult lung transplant recipients. We plan on including cohort studies and secondary analyses of randomized controlled trials studying adult lung transplant recipients undergoing their first lung transplant, without any simultaneous organ transplant. We will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis that pools the effect estimates from all eligible studies to obtain a summary estimate and confidence interval for all independent non-therapeutic factors identified in the primary studies. Discussion: The results from this study may inform future guidelines on the selection of candidates and donors for transplantation and predictive model development and inform the decision-making process that the physician and patient undertake together. Furthermore, through the conduction of this review, we can identify the limitations with the current best evidence, which will encourage the need for studies with a better methodology to reassess the predictors of mortality. ? 2019 The Author(s).","all cause mortality; body mass; follow up; graft failure; graft recipient; human; lung transplantation; meta analysis; mortality; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); retransplantation; Review; risk factor; systematic review"
"Social marketing including financial incentive programs at worksite cafeterias for preventing obesity: A systematic review","2019","Background: As with food-taxation strategies, such interventions as discounted healthy menus, point-of-purchase advertisements, and sugar-free beverages for employees at worksites could help prevent obesity. This study assessed the effectiveness of food environment interventions incorporating financial incentive or social marketing strategies at workplace cafeterias, vending machines, and kiosks toward preventing obesity and improving dietary habits. Methods: We conducted searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. The study designs included were randomized control trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs. We evaluated the effectiveness of financial incentive or social marketing strategies interventions (such as discounts) on health outcomes or food intake behavior. Two reviewers independently screened the studies for inclusion. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. This protocol was published in 2014. Results: We included three trials, with a combined total of 3013 participants. There were limited available data from RCTs on changes in body weight. No eligible social marketing studies were retrieved. In some cases, a meta-analysis could not be conducted owing to differences in the analytic methods for the outcomes. Conclusions: Lack of evidence made it difficult to draw any conclusions. In future surveys, it will be necessary to conduct interventions focusing only on financial incentive intervention versus no intervention in order to determine whether the incentive strategy has a clear impact.

"The threshold model revisited","2019","Background: The threshold model represents one of the most significant advances in the field of medical decision-making, yet it often does not apply to the most common class of clinical problems, which include health outcomes as a part of definition of disease. In addition, the original threshold model did not take a decision-maker's values and preferences explicitly into account. Methods: We reformulated the threshold model by (1) applying it to those clinical scenarios, which define disease according to outcomes that treatment is designed to affect, (2) taking into account a decision-maker's values. Results: We showed that when outcomes (eg, morbidity) are integral part of definition of disease, the classic threshold model does not apply (as this leads to double counting of outcomes in the probabilities and utilities branches of the model). To avoid double counting, the model can be appropriately analysed by assuming diagnosis is certain (P?=?1). This results in deriving a different threshold—the threshold for outcome of disease (M t ) instead of threshold for probability of disease (P t ) above which benefits of treatment outweigh its harms. We found that M t ???P t , which may explain differences between normative models and actual behaviour in practice. When a decision-maker values outcomes related to benefit and harms differently, the new threshold model generates decision thresholds that could be descriptively more accurate. Conclusions: Calculation of the threshold depends on careful disease versus utility definitions and a decision-maker's values and preferences. ? 2018 The Authors Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","anticoagulant agent; placebo; rivaroxaban; accuracy; Article; bleeding; clinical outcome; clinical practice; clinical study; deep vein thrombosis; health hazard; high risk patient; human; integration; life expectancy; lung embolism; mathematical model; medical decision making; morbidity; mortality; patient preference; patient value; practice guideline; priority journal; probability; quality adjusted life year; recurrent disease; survival analysis; threshold model; venous thromboembolism; clinical decision making; evidence based medicine; health care delivery; theoretical model; Clinical Decision-Making; Delivery of Health Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; Models, Theoretical"
"Protocol for a systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis of clinical outcomes following accelerated versus conventional corneal collagen cross-linking for corneal ectasia","2019","Background: Collagen cross-linking (CXL) is an evolving procedure that enhances the biomechanical rigidity of the cornea and can slow or halt ectatic disease. CXL requires delivery of 5.4 J/cm 2 of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation to a cornea saturated with riboflavin in order to induce cross-link formation. The conventional CXL procedure achieves this fluence by exposing the cornea to a 3 mW/cm 2 UVA lamp for 30 min; however, some surgeons have proposed accelerated protocols which achieve the same fluence in a shorter period of time by using a higher power light source. Whether accelerated protocols are as effective in arresting ectasia as the established conventional procedure remains unclear. Accordingly, this study will systematically review and synthesise the evidence on accelerated CXL and compare it to the conventional approach across an array of clinical outcomes. Methods: We will search 16 electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to February 1, 2019. We will include all randomised controlled trials comparing accelerated and conventional CXL for any corneal ectatic disease. Two reviewers will independently screen search results to identify eligible articles, complete data collection, and conduct quality assessment. The quality of individual trials will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Our primary outcome will be the change in maximal keratometry (K max ) at 12 months following treatment. Additional outcomes will include: incidence of disease progression, incidence of serious adverse events, as well as change in K max at longest follow-up, mean stromal demarcation line depth, mean uncorrected distance visual acuity, mean corrected distance visual acuity, mean K max , mean endothelial cell density, mean central corneal thickness, mean spherical equivalent, mean intraocular pressure, and mean corneal power, at 12 months following treatment. We will calculate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be performed to investigate heterogeneity. We will rate the overall quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Discussion: This review will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence on accelerated and conventional CXL approaches and serve to inform clinical practice, medical device design, and future research. Evaluating variations of the CXL protocol aimed at reducing treatment duration is of critical importance and a prerequisite to expanding treatment availability to more patients.

"A review of radiation genomics: Integrating patient radiation response with genomics for personalised and targeted radiation therapy","2019","Background The success of radiation therapy for cancer patients is dependent on the ability to deliver a total tumouricidal radiation dose capable of eradicating all cancer cells within the clinical target volume, however, the radiation dose tolerance of the surrounding healthy tissues becomes the main dose-limiting factor. The normal tissue adverse effects following radiotherapy are common and significantly impact the quality of life of patients. The likelihood of developing these adverse effects following radiotherapy cannot be predicted based only on the radiation treatment parameters. However, there is evidence to suggest that some common genetic variants are associated with radiotherapy response and the risk of developing adverse effects. Radiation genomics is a field that has evolved in recent years investigating the association between patient genomic data and the response to radiation therapy. This field aims to identify genetic markers that are linked to individual radiosensitivity with the potential to predict the risk of developing adverse effects due to radiotherapy using patient genomic information. It also aims to determine the relative radioresponse of patients using their genetic information for the potential prediction of patient radiation treatment response.Methods and materials This paper reports on a review of recent studies in the field of radiation genomics investigating the association between genomic data and patients response to radiation therapy, including the investigation of the role of genetic variants on an individual's predisposition to enhanced radiotherapy radiosensitivity or radioresponse.Conclusion The potential for early prediction of treatment response and patient outcome is critical in cancer patients to make decisions regarding continuation, escalation, discontinuation, and/or change in treatment options to maximise patient survival while minimising adverse effects and maintaining patients' quality of life. ?

"The effect of distance on short-term outcomes in a regionalized, publicly funded bariatric surgery model","2019","Background: While high-volume Centers of Excellence (COE) for bariatric surgery may have improved clinical outcomes, their disparate distribution results in longer travel distances for patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate effect of distance from COE on outcomes and readmission. Methods: This was a retrospective study of all?adults,?aged 18 years or older, receiving bariatric surgery from April 2009 to March 2012 in the province of Ontario. Main outcomes included 30-day complication rates and readmission. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the impact of distance from patients’ primary residence to their bariatric COE on patient outcomes and readmissions. Results: Five thousand and seven patients were identified, two-thirds residing within 100?km of a COE with a mean distance of 117.2?km. The majority of patients did not reside within a Local Integrated Health Network (LHIN) that contained a COE, while 18.3% of patients lived in rural areas. Using multivariable adjustment, for every 10?km increase from the COE where surgery was performed, the Odds Ratio (OR) for complications was 1.00 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.99–1.01; P = 0.747]. Additionally, both residing in a LHIN without a COE, OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.87–1.40; P = 0.434), and rural status, OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.77–1.23; P = 0.821) showed no increase in risk of complication. Similarly, further distances did not influence rate of readmission, OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1.00; P = 0.077) nor did rural status OR 1.31 (95% CI 0.97–1.76; P = 0.076). Conclusion: The COE model, where a few centers in high population areas service a large geographic region, is adequate in ensuring patients that live?further away receive appropriate short-term care. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; anastomosis leakage; Article; bariatric surgery; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; coronary artery disease; deep vein thrombosis; diabetes mellitus; female; funding; gastroesophageal reflux; health care delivery; health care utilization; heart arrest; heart failure; heart infarction; hospital readmission; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; intensive care unit; kidney failure; laparoscopy; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; Ontario; pneumonia; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative ileus; postoperative thrombosis; priority journal; public health; regionalization; respiratory failure; retrospective study; risk assessment; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; rural area; short course therapy; sleep disordered breathing; sleeve gastrectomy; surgical infection; surgical mortality; treatment outcome; urinary tract infection"
"Clinical performance scores of internationally educated physical therapists during clinical education in a bridging programme","2019","Purpose: We describe the numerical ratings assigned by clinical instructors to the performance of internationally educated physical therapists (IEPTs) during their clinical internships while enrolled in a bridging programme. Method: We conducted a secondary analysis of the quantitative data for IEPT learners attending the Ontario Internationally Educated Physical Therapist Bridging Program using the Canadian Physiotherapy Assessment of Clinical Performance (ACP) tool. We extracted the scores from each IEPT’s ACP form at the midterm and final evaluations for two internships and conducted a descriptive analysis. Results: We obtained 318 data sets for 61 IEPTs. By the final point of the second internship, (1) items about communication pertaining to ethical professional relationships, conducting oneself within legal and ethical requirements, and respecting the individuality and autonomy of the client had high mean ratings; (2) most items rated achieved advanced intermediate performance and many indicated entry-level performance; and (3) most IEPTs (84%) either had high scores throughout or improved from lower scores to at least advanced intermediate performance. Conclusions: Items relating to professional conduct and effective communication in professional relationships were relatively high among the IEPTs. By the end of the second internship, most IEPTs in this bridging programme had improved their clinical performance toward or up to the entry-level standard for Canadian physiotherapists. ? 2019, University of Toronto Press Inc..

"Outcomes of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the Head and Neck Region with Regional Lymph Node Metastasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Importance: There is a need to summarize the available evidence and provide quantitative data of the most important prognostic factors for patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region with regional lymph node metastasis (McSCCHN). Objective: To undertake a PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies on the risk factors for overall survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), locoregional recurrence (LRR), and disease-specific survival (DSS) for patients with McSCCHN. Data Sources: PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched from 1946 to August 2018 for English-language articles. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials or observational studies reporting on at least 10 patients with McSCCHN; studies analyzing 1 defined risk factor; reporting OS, LRC, LRR, or DSS; and clinical follow-up of 1 year of more. For the final analysis we included risk factors that were analyzed for the same outcome in at least 3 studies. Of the 2923 articles screened, 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines were used for abstracting the data. Two reviewers independently abstracted the data. Risk of bias was estimated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. All analysis took place between January and October 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points included LRC, LRR, and DSS. Results: A total of 20 observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial were identified, representing 3534 patients (some reviewed articles reported no demographic characteristics), and were included in the analysis. Significant risk factors associated with OS were immunosuppression (hazard ratio [HR] of death, 2.66; 95% CI, 2.26-3.13), extracapsular spread (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.12-3.23), adjuvant radiotherapy (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27-0.78), lymph node ratio (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.09-3.35), and advanced age (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07). Immunosuppression (HR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.47-5.92) and adjuvant radiotherapy (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.84) were also significant risk factors for DSS. Conclusions and Relevance: Immunosuppressed patients and those with extracapsular extension have poor prognosis. Adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with an improvement in OS. These risk factors will assist with better risk stratification and may also help to inform future clinical trials.. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Lessons learned from the development and implementation of a citywide stair prompt initiative","2019","Stair climbing is a readily available form of vigorous-intensity physical activity. Evidence indicates that placing stair prompt signs at points-of-decision (e.g. near elevators and stairways) is an inexpensive, effective strategy for increasing physical activity through stair use. This article aims to share the experience of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in the outreach and implementation of a population-scale stair prompt initiative, including lessons learned from process evaluations, with other public health authorities conducting a similar program. Between May 2008 and August 2012, NYC DOHMH implemented a stair prompt initiative as one strategy in a comprehensive program to increase physical activity and healthy eating through physical improvements to NYC's buildings, streets and neighborhoods, particularly targeting facilities in underserved and low-income neighborhoods. Program evaluation was conducted using program planning documents to examine the process, and data from NYC information line call center, outreach tracking database, and site and phone audits to examine process outcomes. The initiative successfully distributed more than 30,000 stair prompts to building owners/managers of over 1000 buildings. Keys to success included multi-sector partnerships between NYC's Health Department and non-health government agencies and organizations (such as architecture and real estate organizations), a designated outreach coordinator, and outreach strategies targeting building owners/managers owning/managing multiple buildings and buildings serving underserved and at risk populations. A NYC citywide initiative successfully distributed stair prompts to the wider community to promote population-level health impacts; lessons learned may assist other jurisdictions considering similar initiatives to increase physical activity. ? 2018","architecture; Article; building; call center; city planning; government; health care planning; human; lowest income group; neighborhood; physical activity; priority journal; program evaluation; public health; real estate; stair climbing; urban health"
"Social-cue perception and mentalizing ability following traumatic brain injury: A human-robot interaction study","2019","Primary Objective: Research studies and clinical observations of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) indicate marked deficits in mentalizing—perceiving social information and integrating it into judgements about the affective and mental states of others. The current study investigates social-cognitive mechanisms that underlie mentalizing ability to advance our understanding of social consequences of TBI and inform the development of more effective clinical interventions. Research Design: The study followed a mixed-design experiment, manipulating the presence of a mentalizing gaze cue across trials and participant population (TBI vs. healthy comparisons). Methods and Procedures: Participants, 153 adults, 74 with moderate-severe TBI and 79 demographically matched healthy comparison peers, were asked to judge a humanoid robot’s mental state based on precisely controlled gaze cues presented by the robot and apply those judgements to respond accurately on the experimental task. Main Outcomes and Results: Results showed that, contrary to our hypothesis, the social cues improved task performance in the TBI group but not the healthy comparison group. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that, in specific contexts, individuals with TBI can perceive, correctly recognize, and integrate dynamic gaze cues and motivate further research to understand why this ability may not translate to day-to-day social interactions. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; Article; association; controlled study; female; gaze; human; major clinical study; male; mental capacity; mental health; perception; robotics; social cognition; task performance; traumatic brain injury; aged; association; decision making; eye fixation; human relation; middle aged; neuropsychological test; perception; psychology; psychomotor performance; robotics; social environment; traumatic brain injury; young adult; Adult; Aged; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Cues; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Judgment; Male; Mentalization; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Robotics; Social Environment; Social Perception; Young Adult"
"How do financial (dis)incentives influence health behaviour and costs? Protocol for a systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials","2019","Introduction In this era of rising healthcare costs, there is a growing interest in understanding how funding policies can be used to improve health and healthcare efficiency. Financial incentives (eg, vouchers or access to health insurance) or disincentives (eg, fines or out-of-pocket costs) affect behaviours. To date, reviews have explored the effects of financial (dis)incentives on patient health and behaviour by focusing on specific behaviours or geographical areas. The objective of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview on the use of financial (dis)incentives as a means of influencing health-related behaviour and costs in randomised trials. Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases, clinical trial registries and websites of health economic organisations for randomised controlled trials. The initial searches, which were conducted on 13 January 2018, will be updated every 12 months until the completion of data analysis. The reference lists of included studies will be manually screened to identify additional eligible studies. Two researchers will independently review titles, abstracts and full texts to determine eligibility according to a set of predetermined inclusion criteria. Data will be extracted from included studies using a form developed and piloted by the research team. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required since this is a review of published data. Results will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at relevant conferences. ? 2019 Author(s).","article; data analysis; ethics; health behavior; health care policy; human; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; scientist; systematic review"
"Genome-Wide Association Transethnic Meta-Analyses Identifies Novel Associations Regulating Coagulation Factor VIII and Von Willebrand Factor Plasma Levels","2019","Background: Factor VIII (FVIII) and its carrier protein Von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with risk of arterial and venous thrombosis and with hemorrhagic disorders. We aimed to identify and functionally test novel genetic associations regulating plasma FVIII and VWF. Methods: We meta-analyzed genome-wide association results from 46 354 individuals of European, African, East Asian, and Hispanic ancestry. All studies performed linear regression analysis using an additive genetic model and associated ?35 million imputed variants with natural log-transformed phenotype levels. In vitro gene silencing in cultured endothelial cells was performed for candidate genes to provide additional evidence on association and function. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were applied to test the causal role of FVIII and VWF plasma levels on the risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Results: We identified 13 novel genome-wide significant (P?2.5×10-8) associations, 7 with FVIII levels (FCHO2/TMEM171/TNPO1, HLA, SOX17/RP1, LINC00583/NFIB, RAB5C-KAT2A, RPL3/TAB1/SYNGR1, and ARSA) and 11 with VWF levels (PDHB/PXK/KCTD6, SLC39A8, FCHO2/TMEM171/TNPO1, HLA, GIMAP7/GIMAP4, OR13C5/NIPSNAP, DAB2IP, C2CD4B, RAB5C-KAT2A, TAB1/SYNGR1, and ARSA), beyond 10 previously reported associations with these phenotypes. Functional validation provided further evidence of association for all loci on VWF except ARSA and DAB2IP. Mendelian randomization suggested causal effects of plasma FVIII activity levels on venous thrombosis and coronary artery disease risk and plasma VWF levels on ischemic stroke risk. Conclusions: The meta-analysis identified 13 novel genetic loci regulating FVIII and VWF plasma levels, 10 of which we validated functionally. We provide some evidence for a causal role of these proteins in thrombotic events. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","blood clotting factor 8; von Willebrand factor; biological marker; blood clotting factor 8; F8 protein, human; von Willebrand factor; ABO gene; Agnostic; Article; biogenesis; blood level; C2CD4B gene; gene; gene control; gene silencing; genetic model; genome-wide association study; human; inflammation; meta analysis; phenotype; priority journal; SCARA5 gene; signal transduction; ST3GAL4 gene; STAB2 gene; STX2 gene; STXBP5 gene; blood; blood clotting; blood clotting disorder; ethnology; gene locus; genetic marker; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; Mendelian randomization analysis; peripheral occlusive artery disease; risk factor; vein thrombosis; Arterial Occlusive Diseases; Biomarkers; Blood Coagulation; Blood Coagulation Disorders, Inherited; Factor VIII; Genetic Loci; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Phenotype; Risk Factors; Venous Thrombosis; von Willebrand Factor"
"Long-term risks of stress and urgency urinary incontinence after different vaginal delivery modes","2019","Background: Although operative delivery increases the risk of immediate pelvic floor trauma, no previous studies have adequately compared directly the effects of different kinds of instrumental vaginal deliveries on stress urinary incontinence and/or urgency urinary incontinence. Objective(s): The objectives of the study were to estimate and compare the impact of different kinds of vaginal deliveries, including spontaneous, vacuum, and forceps, on stress and urgency urinary incontinence. Study Design: All women aged 20 years or older, living in 1 county in Norway were invited to participate in 2 surveys addressing stress and urgency urinary incontinence using validated questions, “Do you leak urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or lift something heavy?” and “Do you have involuntary loss of urine in connection with sudden and strong urge to void?” with response options yes or no. Incontinence data were linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. For this study, we included only women who had a history of vaginal birth(s). Case definitions for stress and urgency urinary incontinence were moderate to severe based on Sandvik Severity Index (slight, moderate, severe). We adjusted analyses for age, parity, body mass index, and time since last delivery and addressed effect modification, including an age threshold of 50 years. Results: The final analysis included 13,694 women of whom 12.7% reported stress urinary incontinence and 8.4% urgency urinary incontinence. Among women aged younger than 50 years, there was a statistically significant difference in the risk of stress urinary incontinence for forceps delivery (odds ratio, 1.42, 95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.86, absolute difference 5.0%) but not for vacuum (odds ratio, 0.80, 95% confidence interval, 0.59–1.09) when compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery. Among women aged younger than 50 years, forceps also had increased risk for stress urinary incontinence (odds ratio, 1.76, 95% confidence interval, 1.20–2.60) when compared with vacuum. There was no association of stress or urgency urinary incontinence with mode of delivery in women aged 50 years or older. Conclusion: For women aged younger than 50 years, forceps delivery is associated with significant increased long-term risk of stress urinary incontinence compared with other vaginal deliveries. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; age distribution; Article; disease severity assessment; female; forceps delivery; human; major clinical study; Norway; priority journal; Sandvik Severity Index; stress incontinence; urge incontinence; vacuum extraction; vaginal delivery; adverse event; aged; health survey; longitudinal study; middle aged; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; procedures; risk factor; stress incontinence; urge incontinence; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Norway; Pregnancy; Risk Factors; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Urinary Incontinence, Urge"
"Beyond Universal Health Care: Barriers to Breast Cancer Screening Participation in Canada","2019","Purpose: Despite well-established preventive screening guidelines for breast cancer, screening rates do not meet targets in both the United States and Canada. Although access to preventive care is an important factor toward participation, breast cancer screening rates in Canada vary despite a universal health care system. The objective of this study is to understand features within the Canadian population that potentiate screening disparities through a systematic review of the literature. Methods: A search of MEDLINE and Embase was performed to identify relevant studies published from 2005 onward. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full-text screening. Inclusion criteria were defined as studies reporting on disparities in image-based screening for breast cancer. Results: Three hundred twenty-four studies were retrieved, from which 29 studies were selected on the basis of the predetermined inclusion criteria. Population groups identified at risk for low image-based screening participation included those of low socioeconomic status, individuals with comorbidities, new immigrants and refugees, those in remote geographic locations, individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, and ethnocultural minorities. Barriers to image-based screening can be improved by targeting measures specific to these at-risk groups at the individual, organization, and policy levels. Conclusions: Multiple at-risk population groups exist for preventive cancer screening within a universal health care system. By understanding specific characteristics within these vulnerable populations, effective intervention strategies can be established to improve breast cancer preventive care. ? 2019 American College of Radiology","Article; breast cancer; Canada; Canadian; cancer screening; community participation; comorbidity; developmental disorder; geography; global health; health care; health care access; health care disparity; health care policy; high risk population; human; immigrant; intellectual impairment; minority group; practice guideline; refugee; social status; systematic review; aged; breast tumor; comparative study; early cancer diagnosis; female; middle aged; patient attitude; patient participation; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Canada; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Participation; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Universal Health Care"
"Atrial Fibrillation and Cognitive Function: JACC Review Topic of the Week","2019","Numerous vascular risk factors and vascular diseases contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia. Many studies and registries show an association of atrial fibrillation (AF) with cognitive impairment, cognitive decline, and dementia. This is true for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The assumed multifactorial mechanisms include ischemic stroke, both apparent and silent, cerebral microinfarcts, cerebral hemorrhage, and reduced cerebral blood flow. A number of retrospective observational and prospective studies support that anticoagulation in patients with AF may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. This holds for both vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) and direct oral anticoagulants. However, it still remains unproven if anticoagulation reduces cognitive decline and dementia in AF patients based on randomized trials. ? 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","anticoagulant agent; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; Alzheimer disease; anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; brain blood flow; brain hemorrhage; brain infarction; brain ischemia; cognitive defect; dementia; human; multiinfarct dementia; priority journal; Review; risk factor; risk reduction; atrial fibrillation; cognition; cognitive defect; complication; psychology; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans"
"Risk of postoperative infectious complications frommedical therapies in inflammatory bowel disease (Protocol)","2019","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),which includesCrohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic and incurable disorder characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Inflammation in UC is limited to the mucosa of the colon and rectum while Crohn's disease is associated with transmural inflammation in any portion of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, Crohn's disease is also associated with extraintestinal manifestations in areas such as the skin, joints, and eyes. Over 1.2 million individuals have a diagnosis of IBD in North America and the worldwide prevalence of this disease is projected to increase exponentially over the next decade (Kaplan 2015). he goal of IBDtreatment is to achieve remission of clinical symptoms and resolution of gut inflammation. A plethora of pharmacological and, if necessary, surgical options are available for the treatment of IBD. Traditionally, depending on the severity of inflammation and symptoms, 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators and biologic medications have been used. In recent years, biosimilars and smallmolecules have also been incorporated into the treatment algorithm for IBD. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

"Arsenic exposure and young adult's mortality risk: A 13-year follow-up study in Matlab, Bangladesh","2019","Background: Widespread arsenic contamination in underground water is a well-documented public health concern that threatens millions of lives worldwide. We investigated the risk of young-adult mortality due to high chronic exposure to arsenic through years of drinking arsenic contaminated water. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 58,406 individuals was enrolled who were 4–18 years at baseline. Since Matlab HDSS (Health and Demographic Surveillance System) has an active surveillance system, all individuals were included in the follow up. Each individual's arsenic exposure was calculated at (1) baseline As level as current exposure (2) time-weighted lifetime (average or lifetime average) and (3) cumulative arsenic exposure. Age, sex, educational attainment and SES were adjusted during the analysis. In this 13 years closed-cohort study (2003–2015), all young-adult deaths were captured through verbal autopsy (VA) using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) to define the causes. Results: Although, girls had higher values of cumulative arsenic exposure via tube well water than boys (median: 1858.5 μg/year/L vs. 1798.8 μg/year/L) but higher mortality due to cancers and due to cerebro-vascular disease, cardio-vascular disease, and respiratory disease (7.0 vs. 5.7 per 100,000 person-years and 6.4 vs. 4.2 per 100,000 person-years respectively). Higher risk of deaths among young adults (Adjusted HR: 2.7, 1.3–5.8) due to all cancers among those who were exposed to As > 138.7 compared to As ? 1.1 μg/L. For cerebro-vascular disease, cardio-vascular disease, and respiratory disease deaths, average arsenic in well water (>223.1 μg/L vs. ?90.9 μg/L) and cumulative arsenic in well water (>2711.0 μg/year/L vs. ?1013.3 μg/year/L) had 4.8 (1.8–12.8) and 5.1 (1.7–15.1) times higher risks of mortality than to those lowest exposed. Conclusion: Higher concentration of, and chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water, increases the mortality risk among the young adults, regardless of gender. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Groundwater; Occupational diseases; Potable water; Pulmonary diseases; Security systems; Toxicity; Water pollution; Active surveillance systems; Arsenic contamination; Arsenic exposure; Arsenic in drinking waters; Cardio-vascular disease; Educational attainments; Global health; International classification of disease; Arsenic; arsenic; drinking water; well water; arsenic; adult; arsenic; drinking water; groundwater pollution; mortality risk; pollution exposure; public health; toxicity; young population; adolescent; adult; age distribution; Article; Bangladesh; biosurveillance; cancer mortality; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular disease; child; cohort analysis; concentration response; controlled study; educational status; environmental exposure; female; follow up; high risk population; human; ICD-10; information processing; long term exposure; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality risk; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; respiratory tract disease; sex difference; social status; verbal autopsy; water contamination; young adult; analysis; cause of death; chemistry; epidemiology; mortality; neoplasm; toxicity; water pollutant; Bangladesh; Matlab; Adolescent; Arsenic; Bangladesh; Cause of Death; Child; Cohort Studies; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Mortality; Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Wells"
"Culturally Tailored Self-Management Interventions for South Asians With Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review","2019","Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. A high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been noted among the South Asian population, in general, and migrant South Asians. Self-management is considered a proponent to the management of diabetes. Although empirical evidence supports such interventions, little is known regarding the cultural congruency of such interventions for diverse cultural and ethnic groups, particularly South Asians. Our purpose was to determine the effectiveness of diabetes self-management education (DSME) and diabetes self-management support (DSMS), interventions on migrant South Asian's glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels and whether DSME and DSMS interventions are culturally tailored to the migrant South Asian population. In this study, a systematic review, with narrative synthesis, was conducted. Data were extracted on the study, participant, and intervention characteristics and the cultural congruity using Leininger's sunrise model. Four studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included. Overall, most (75%) of the DSME and DSMS interventions were not effective in reducing A1C levels. Specific to cultural congruity of the interventions, all studies delivered the intervention based on the participant's preferred language and incorporated culturally sensitive dietary information primarily by persons of the same cultural and ethnic background. However, little information was presented on the provision and integration of culturally congruent care. Findings highlight the importance of rethinking the way in which South Asians are labelled as a homogenous group and accounting for such differences when adapting and designing culturally tailored DSME and or DSMS interventions in clinical practice. ? 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association","hemoglobin A1c; Bangladeshi; cultural factor; diabetes education; diet; human; Indian; meta analysis; migrant; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Pakistani; Review; self care; South Asian; Sri Lankan; systematic review"
"Perceptions of older adults in Ontario, Canada on the implementation and impact of a primary care programme, Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY): A descriptive qualitative study","2019","Objectives The aim of the study was to explore the perceptions of older adults on the implementation and impact of Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY), a multicomponent primary care programme that seeks to improve care coordination for individuals through health-related goal-setting supported by trained lay volunteers who are an extension of an interprofessional team, and the use of technology to support communication among the team. Design This study used a qualitative descriptive design. Setting The setting for this study was two primary care practice sites located in a large urban area in Ontario, Canada. Participants The sample consisted of community-dwelling older adults aged 70 years and older. Participants were recruited from a convenience sample obtained from 360 clients who participated in the 12-month Health TAPESTRY randomised controlled trial. Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 32 older adults either face-to-face or by telephone. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a constant comparative approach to develop themes. Results Older adults' perceptions about the Health TAPESTRY programme included (1) the lack of a clear purpose and understanding of how information was shared among providers, (2) mixed positive and negative perceptions of goal-setting and provider follow-up after inhome visits by volunteers, (3) positive impacts such as satisfaction with the primary care team, and (4) the potential for the programme to become a regular programme and applied to other communities and groups. Conclusions Older adults living in the community may benefit from greater primary care support provided through enhanced team-based approaches. Programmes such as Health TAPESTRY facilitate opportunities for older adults to work with primary care providers to meet their self-identified needs. By exploring perceptions of clients, primary care programmes can be further refined and expanded for various populations. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"Nod1-mediated lipolysis promotes diacylglycerol accumulation and successive inflammation via PKCδ-IRAK axis in adipocytes","2019","Chronic inflammation contributes to obesity mediated metabolic disturbances, including insulin resistance. Obesity is associated with altered microbial load in metabolic tissues that can contribute to metabolic inflammation. Different bacterial components such as, LPS, peptidoglycans have been shown to underpin metabolic disturbances through interaction with host innate immune receptors. Activation of Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (Nod1) with specific peptidoglycan moieties promotes insulin resistance, inflammation and lipolysis in adipocytes. However, it was not clear how Nod1-mediated lipolysis and inflammation is linked. Here, we tested if Nod1-mediated lipolysis caused accumulation of lipid intermediates and promoted cell autonomous inflammation in adipocytes. We showed that Nod1-mediated lipolysis caused accumulation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and activation of PKCδ in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which was prevented with a Nod1 inhibitor. Nod1-activated PKCδ caused downstream stimulation of IRAK1/4 and was associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, TNFα and MCP-1. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA mediated knockdown of IRAK1/4 attenuated Nod1-mediated activation of NF-κB, JNK, and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. These results reveal that Nod1-mediated lipolysis promoted accumulation of DAG, which engaged PKCδ and IRAK1/4 to augment inflammation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","caspase recruitment domain protein 4; diacylglycerol; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; protein kinase C delta; small interfering RNA; stress activated protein kinase; tumor necrosis factor; Card4 protein, mouse; caspase recruitment domain protein 4; Ccl2 protein, mouse; cytokine; diacylglycerol; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; Irak1 protein, mouse; Irak4 protein, mouse; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; peptidoglycan; Prkcd protein, mouse; protein kinase C delta; tumor necrosis factor; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal cell; Article; controlled study; downstream processing; enzyme activation; gene knockdown; in vitro study; inflammation; lipid storage; lipolysis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; adipocyte; animal; genetics; inflammation; innate immunity; insulin resistance; lipolysis; metabolism; obesity; physiology; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Chemokine CCL2; Cytokines; Diglycerides; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Immunity, Innate; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases; Interleukin-18; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-6; Lipolysis; Mice; NF-kappa B; Nod1 Signaling Adaptor Protein; Obesity; Peptidoglycan; Protein Kinase C-delta; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
"International multiphase mixed methods study protocol to develop a patient-reported outcome instrument for children and adolescents with lower limb deformities","2019","Introduction Our recent systematic review has indicated the lack of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children and adolescents with lower limb deformities. We are developing a PRO instrument which will be applicable internationally across various countries. This manuscript describes our approach to the development of a new PRO instrument for measuring HRQOL for children and adolescents with lower limb deformities. Methods and analysis Three phases in the development of this PRO instrument are as described: (1) This phase involves the development of a conceptual framework of HRQOL and item pool that is used to inform a set of preliminary scales. We have developed a preliminary conceptual framework of HRQOL based on our systematic review. Qualitative interviews are being conducted at five sites in Canada, Ethiopia, India and the USA. An item pool will be generated from this qualitative phase. The preliminary items and scales will be sent out to children at the five participating centres. Cognitive debriefing interviews will gather detailed feedback on the items from the children. Expert opinion will be sought from clinicians from the participating centres. (2) During this phase, an international field-test study will be conducted to refine the scales and examine their psychometric properties. (3) During this phase, tests of reliability, validity and responsiveness will be conducted. Phase 1 will also involve translations and cultural adaptations. At the end of this study, we expect to produce an internationally applicable PRO instrument which is scientifically sound and clinically relevant to the lower limb deformity population. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by Research Ethics Boards for each of the participating sites. Results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. An integrated knowledge translation approach is applied to engage patients, families and clinicians from the start of the study. ? Author(s) 2019.

"Renal cell carcinoma in the Canadian Indigenous population","2019","Background Diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) might be different in Indigenous Canadians than in non-Indigenous Canadians. In this cohort study, we compared rcc presentation and treatments in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians. Methods Patients registered in the Canadian Kidney Cancer Information System treated at 16 institutions between 2011 and 2018 were included. Baseline patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics were compared between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians. The primary objective was to determine if differences in rcc stage at diagnosis were evident between the groups. The secondary objective was to determine if treatments and outcomes were different between the groups. Results During the study period, 105 of the 4529 registered patients self-identified as Indigenous. Those patients were significantly younger at the time of clinical diagnosis (57.9 ± 11.3 years vs. 62.0 ± 12.1 years, p = 0.0006) and had a family history prevalence of rcc that was double the prevalence in the non-Indigenous patients (14% vs. 7%, p = 0.004). Clinical stage at diagnosis was similar in the two groups (p = 0.61). The disease was metastatic at presentation in 11 Indigenous Canadians (10%) and in 355 non-Indigenous Canadians (8%). Comorbid conditions that could affect the management of RCC-such as obesity, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and smoking-were more common in Indigenous Canadians (p - 0.05). Indigenous Canadians experienced a lower rate of active surveillance (p = 0.01). Treatments and median time to treatments were similar in the two groups. Conclusions Compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts, Indigenous Canadian patients with rcc are diagnosed at an earlier age and at a similar clinical stage. Despite higher baseline comorbid conditions, clinical outcomes are not worse for Indigenous Canadians than for non-Indigenous Canadians. ? 2019 Multimed Inc.","adult; Article; bilateral cancer; biopsy; body mass; Canada; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer grading; cancer staging; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; death; diabetes mellitus; disease surveillance; family history; female; follow up; hazard ratio; human; indigenous people; kidney disease; kidney tumor; major clinical study; male; metastasis; metastasis resection; molecularly targeted therapy; nephrectomy; obesity; outcome assessment; palliative therapy; prevalence; prospective study; radiofrequency ablation; renal cell carcinoma; risk factor; smoking; survival rate; systemic therapy"
"Posttraumatic growth experiences and its contextual factors in women with breast cancer: An integrative review","2019","In this article, we synthesize current research that examines determinants and manifestations of posttraumatic growth (the phenomenon of posttraumatic growth can be embodied in several domains) in women with breast cancer. The findings of the integrative literature review may contribute to facilitating person-centered oncology care by raising health care professionals’ awareness and understanding of posttraumatic growth phenomenon among breast cancer survivors. The identification of factors contributing to posttraumatic growth and manifestations of posttraumatic growth are important in increasing the effectiveness of interventions in supporting women during their breast cancer journey. The methods proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) were adopted to guide this integrative review. Quality assessment was conducted using recognized critical appraisal tools relating to quantitative and qualitative studies. Four main manifestations were synthesized from the literature: new perception of self; relatedness to others; new life philosophy; and spiritual and religious growth. Personal characteristics, illness factors, cognitive processing, coping strategies, social support, religion and spirituality, the body’s role and physical activities were identified as influencing posttraumatic growth in women with breast cancer. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","breast tumor; coping behavior; female; human; psychology; religion; social support; survivor; Adaptation, Psychological; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Posttraumatic Growth, Psychological; Religion; Social Support; Spirituality; Survivors"

"COPD treatment pathways in france: a retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from general practitioners","2019","Background: Increasing availability of therapeutic options for COPD may drive new treatment pathways. This study describes COPD treatment in France, focusing on identifying initial treatment modifications in patients with COPD who either initiated long-acting bronchodilator (LABD)-based therapy or escalated to triple therapy (long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA] + long-acting β 2 -agonist [LABA] + inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]). Methods: This retrospective analysis of patients with COPD in a large general practitioner database (IQVIA Longitudinal Patient Database) in France included two cohorts: Cohort 1 – new initiators of LABD-based therapy (LAMA, LABA, LAMA + LABA, LAMA + ICS, LABA + ICS or LAMA + LABA + ICS); Cohort 2 – patients escalating to triple therapy from mono-or dual-bronchodilator-based maintenance treatment. Both cohorts were indexed on the date of initiation/escalation (January 2008–December 2013), and the first treatment modification (at class level) within the 18-month post-index observational period was described. Five mutually exclusive outcomes were defined: continuous use (no modification), discontinuation (permanent [$91 days with no restart] or temporary [$91 days with subsequent restart]), switch, and augmentation (Cohort 1 only). Exploratory analysis of Cohort 1 explored potential drivers of treatment initiation. Results: Overall, 5,065 patients initiated LABD-based therapy (Cohort 1), and 501 escalated to triple therapy (Cohort 2). In Cohort 1, 7.0% of patients were continuous users, 46.5% discontinued permanently, 28.5% discontinued temporarily, 2.8% augmented (added LAMA and/or LABA and/or ICS), and 15.2% switched therapy. In Cohort 2, 18.2% of patients were continuous users, 7.2% discontinued permanently, 27.9% discontinued temporarily, and 46.7% switched therapy. Exploratory analyses showed that time since COPD diagnosis was first recorded, preindex exacerbation events, and concomitant medical conditions were potential drivers of initial maintenance treatment choices. Conclusion: Discontinuation among new initiators of LABD-based therapy was high in France, whereas few switched or augmented treatment. In comparison, permanent discontinuation within 18 months was low in patients escalating to triple therapy. ? 2019 Meeraus et al.","beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; bronchodilating agent; corticosteroid; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; bronchodilating agent; corticosteroid; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; adult; age; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; controlled study; coughing; disease association; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; electronic medical record; exploratory research; fatigue; female; France; gender; heart disease; human; ICD-10; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; treatment duration; treatment outcome; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical decision making; clinical pathway; clinical practice; combination drug therapy; comparative study; drug combination; drug effect; drug substitution; electronic health record; factual database; general practitioner; inhalational drug administration; lung; middle aged; nebulizer; pathophysiology; time factor; Administration, Inhalation; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists; Adult; Aged; Bronchodilator Agents; Clinical Decision-Making; Critical Pathways; Databases, Factual; Drug Combinations; Drug Substitution; Drug Therapy, Combination; Electronic Health Records; Female; France; General Practitioners; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Muscarinic Antagonists; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Awareness and Understanding of HIV Non-disclosure Case Law and the Role of Healthcare Providers in Discussions About the Criminalization of HIV Non-disclosure Among Women Living with HIV in Canada","2020","In 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that people with HIV are legally obligated to disclose their serostatus before sex with a “realistic possibility” of HIV transmission, suggesting a legal obligation to disclose unless they use condoms and have a low HIV viral load (< 1500 copies/mL). We measured prevalence and correlates of ruling awareness among 1230 women with HIV enrolled in a community-based cohort study (2015–2017). While 899 (73%) participants had ruling awareness, only 37% were both aware of and understood ruling components. Among 899 aware participants, 34% had never discussed disclosure and the law with healthcare providers, despite only 5% being unwilling to do this. Detectable/unknown HIV viral load, lack of awareness of prevention benefits of antiretroviral therapy, education ? high-school and high HIV-related stigma were negatively associated with ruling awareness. Discussions around disclosure and the law in community and healthcare settings are warranted to support women with HIV. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; antiretroviral therapy; article; awareness; Canada; cohort analysis; female; health care personnel; high school; human; human experiment; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; major clinical study; prevalence; stigma; virus load"
"Accounting for health literacy and intervention preferences when reducing unhealthy snacking: Protocol for an online randomised controlled trial","2019","Introduction Health literacy describes the cognitive and social skills that individuals use to access, understand and act on health information. Health literacy interventions typically take the ?  universal precautions approach' where all consumers are presented with simplified materials. Although this approach can improve knowledge and comprehension, its impact on complex behaviours is less clear. Systematic reviews also suggest that health literacy interventions underuse volitional strategies (such as planning) that play an important role in behaviour change. A recent study found volitional strategies may need to be tailored to the participant's health literacy. The current study aims to replicate these findings in a sample of people who have diabetes and/or are overweight or obese as measured by body mass index, and to investigate the most effective method of allocating an action plan to a participant to reduce unhealthy snacking. Methods and analysis We plan to recruit approximately 2400 participants at baseline. Participants will receive one of two alternative online action plans intended to reduce unhealthy snacking (?  standard' action plan or ?  literacy-sensitive' action plan). Participants will be randomised to a method of allocation to an action plan: (1) random allocation; (2) allocation by health literacy screening tool or (3) allocation by participant selection. Primary outcome is self-reported serves of unhealthy snacks during the previous month. Multiple linear regression will evaluate the impact of health literacy on intervention effectiveness. The analysis will also identify independent contributions of each action plan, method of allocation, health literacy and participant selections on unhealthy snacking at 4-week follow-up. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (2017/793). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed international journals, conferences and updates with collaborating public health bodies (Diabetes New South Wales (NSW) & Australian Capital Territory (ACT), and Western Sydney Local Health District).

"Facilitating informed choice about non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT): A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis of women's experiences","2019","Background: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can be used to accurately detect fetal chromosomal anomalies early in pregnancy by assessing cell-free fetal DNA present in maternal blood. The rapid diffusion of NIPT, as well as the ease and simplicity of the test raises concerns around informed decision-making and the potential for routinization. Introducing NIPT in a way that facilitates informed and autonomous decisions is imperative to the ethical application of this technology. We approach this imperative by systematically reviewing and synthesizing primary qualitative research on women's experiences with and preferences for informed decision-making around NIPT. Methods: We searched multiple bibliographic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and ISI Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Our review was guided by integrative qualitative meta-synthesis, and we used a staged coding process similar to that of grounded theory to conduct our analysis. Results: Thirty empirical primary qualitative research studies were eligible for inclusion. Women preferred to learn about NIPT from their clinicians, but they expressed dissatisfaction with the quality and quantity of information provided during counselling and often sought information from a variety of other sources. Women generally had a good understanding of test characteristics, and the factors of accuracy, physical risk, and test timing were the critical information elements that they used to make informed decisions around NIPT. Women often described NIPT as easy or just another blood test, highlighting threats to informed decision-making such as routinization or a pressure to test. Conclusions: Women's unique circumstances modulate the information that they value and require most in the context of making an informed decision. Widened availability of trustworthy information about NIPT as well as careful attention to the facilitation of counselling may help facilitate informed decision-making.

"Loss of Independence After Operative Management of Femoral Neck Fractures","2019","OBJECTIVES: The FAITH trial evaluated effects of sliding hip screws versus cancellous screws in femoral neck fracture patients. Using FAITH trial data, we quantified changes in living status, use of aids, and investigated factors associated with living and walking independently 12 months after fracture. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis to quantify patients' changes in living status, use of aids, and used multivariable Cox regression analyses to determine factors associated with living and walking independently after fracture. RESULTS: Of patients who lived independently before hip fracture, 3.07% (50-80 years old) and 19.81% (>80 years old) were institutionalized 12 months after injury. Of patients who were walking independently before injury, 33.62% (50-80 years old) and 69.34% (>80 years old) required a walking aid 12 months after injury. Factors associated with higher chances of living independently included the following: being between 50 and 80 years, having a class I American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, not using a walking aid before fracture, being a nonsmoker or former smoker, and having an acceptable quality of implant placement. Factors associated with higher chances of walking without an aid included the following: being between 50 and 80 years, having a class I American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, living independently before fracture, being a nonsmoker or former smoker, having an undisplaced fracture, and not requiring revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral neck fracture patients suffer great losses of independence.

"Sex Differences in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Growth","2019","Women with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) have higher risk of acute aortic syndromes and death than men. We have shown that TAA growth is accelerated in women, helping explain the sex differences in TAA outcomes. Since aortic stiffness reflects the health of the aorta, we sought to determine the sex-specific role of aortic stiffness on TAA growth. One hundred thirty unoperated people with TAA were recruited. Maximal aneurysm size at the oldest and latest imaging studies was measured to calculate TAA growth rate. Aortic stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) using applanation tonometry. Multivariable linear regression adjusted for confounders assessed the association of cfPWV with TAA growth. Seventy-three percent of subjects were men. Mean±SD age, baseline aneurysm size, follow-up time, and cfPWV were 62.5±11.5 years, 45.3±4.0 mm, 3.3±3.0 years and 9.6±3.5 m/s, and not different based on sex. TAA growth rate was 0.96±1.00 mm/y in women and 0.45±0.58 mm/y in men ( P=0.006). In the whole group, cfPWV was independently associated with TAA growth (β±SE: 0.06±0.02, P=0.02). However, in sex-specific analyses cfPWV was independently associated with faster aneurysm growth in women (β±SE: 0.21±0.09, P=0.03), but not in men (β±SE: -0.002±0.02, P=0.94), with a significant sex×cfPWV interaction ( P<0.0001). In patients with TAA, aneurysm growth is more than twice as fast in women than men, and aortic stiffness is associated with greater TAA growth in women, but not in men. Our findings highlight greater aortic stiffness as an important correlate of TAA expansion in women.","aged; arterial stiffness; Canada; carotid artery; disease exacerbation; female; femoral artery; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; pulse wave; risk assessment; risk factor; sex factor; thoracic aorta aneurysm; time factor; Aged; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Canada; Carotid Arteries; Disease Progression; Female; Femoral Artery; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Vascular Stiffness"
"Vaccinia-based oncolytic immunotherapy Pexastimogene Devacirepvec in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after sorafenib failure: a randomized multicenter Phase IIb trial (TRAVERSE)","2019","Pexastimogene devacirepvec (Pexa-Vec) is a vaccinia virus-based oncolytic immunotherapy designed to preferentially replicate in and destroy tumor cells while stimulating anti-tumor immunity by expressing GM-CSF. An earlier randomized Phase IIa trial in predominantly sorafenib-na?ve hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit. This randomized, open-label Phase IIb trial investigated whether Pexa-Vec plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) improved OS over BSC alone in HCC patients who failed sorafenib therapy (TRAVERSE). 129 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to Pexa-Vec plus BSC vs. BSC alone. Pexa-Vec was given as a single intravenous (IV) infusion followed by up to 5 IT injections. The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (RR), time to progression (TTP) and safety. A high drop-out rate in the control arm (63%) confounded assessment of response-based endpoints. Median OS (ITT) for Pexa-Vec plus BSC vs. BSC alone was 4.2 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR, 1.19, 95% CI: 0.78–1.80; p =.428). There was no difference between the two treatment arms in RR or TTP. Pexa-Vec was generally well-tolerated. The most frequent Grade 3 included pyrexia (8%) and hypotension (8%). Induction of immune responses to vaccinia antigens and HCC associated antigens were observed. Despite a tolerable safety profile and induction of T cell responses, Pexa-Vec did not improve OS as second-line therapy after sorafenib failure. The true potential of oncolytic viruses may lie in the treatment of patients with earlier disease stages which should be addressed in future studies.

"Early Onset Allergic Proctitis in a Preterm Neonate—A Case Report and Review of the Literature","2019","Cow’s milk protein allergy/intolerance (CMPA/CMPI) is a common entity in the pediatric population with a nonspecific presentation ranging from gastrointestinal symptoms to systemic manifestations. Most infants with CMPI are term, and symptoms often appear in the week following the introduction of cow’s milk-based formula. There is typically a significant delay in the onset of milk allergy in premature infants compared to full term.

"Eosinophil-derived IL-13 promotes emphysema","2019","The inflammatory responses in chronic airway diseases leading to emphysema are not fully defined. We hypothesised that lung eosinophilia contributes to airspace enlargement in a mouse model and to emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).A transgenic mouse model of chronic type 2 pulmonary inflammation (I5/hE2) was used to examine eosinophil-dependent mechanisms leading to airspace enlargement. Human sputum samples were collected for translational studies examining eosinophilia and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-12 levels in patients with chronic airways disease.Airspace enlargement was identified in I5/hE2 mice and was dependent on eosinophils. Examination of I5/hE2 bronchoalveolar lavage identified elevated MMP-12, a mediator of emphysema. We showed, in vitro, that eosinophil-derived interleukin (IL)-13 promoted alveolar macrophage MMP-12 production. Airspace enlargement in I5/hE2 mice was dependent on MMP-12 and eosinophil-derived IL-4/13. Consistent with this, MMP-12 was elevated in patients with sputum eosinophilia and computed tomography evidence of emphysema, and also negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1?s.A mouse model of chronic type 2 pulmonary inflammation exhibited airspace enlargement dependent on MMP-12 and eosinophil-derived IL-4/13. In chronic airways disease patients, lung eosinophilia was associated with elevated MMP-12 levels, which was a predictor of emphysema. These findings suggest an underappreciated mechanism by which eosinophils contribute to the pathologies associated with asthma and COPD. Copyright ?ERS 2019.",""
"Cannabis Use in Patients Seeking Therapy for Anxiety and Related Disorders: A Descriptive Study","2019","Objectives:The present study describes patterns of cannabis use, motives for use, and the relationship between cannabis use and problematic alcohol use in a large sample of individuals seeking treatment for anxiety and related disorders at a specialized outpatient clinic in a Canadian hospital.Methods:Seven hundred ninety-six participants (n = 308 cannabis users; n = 488 cannabis nonusers) completed questionnaires examining patterns of cannabis use, severity of cannabis and alcohol use, and level of psychological distress before receiving any treatment at a specialty anxiety clinic.Results:Of the total sample, 39% reported using cannabis in the past 6 months and 43% of cannabis users endorsed using cannabis multiple times per week, primarily via smoking joints. Twenty-two percent of cannabis users exceeded the cutoff score on a validated screening tool for Cannabis Use Disorder. A significant small positive correlation was found between cannabis use severity and level of psychological distress. Commonly reported motives for use included sleep, mental health concerns, and chronic pain, suggesting that cannabis may be used to broadly manage distress. Alcohol and cannabis use severity were not significantly correlated; however, cannabis users were significantly more likely to abuse alcohol than cannabis nonusers.Conclusions:These findings are congruent with previous research that has demonstrated a positive association between anxiety symptoms and cannabis use. Cannabis use is prevalent in those seeking therapy for anxiety and related disorders and is associated with several indicators of psychological distress. These results are in line with the tension-reduction model of cannabis use. ? 2019 by the Canadian Society of Addiction Medicine.",""
"Genome-wide association study of alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) scores in 20?328 research participants of European ancestry","2019","Genetic factors contribute to the risk for developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, Inc., we performed a genome-wide association study of the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT), an instrument designed to screen for alcohol misuse over the past year. Our final sample consisted of 20?328 research participants of European ancestry (55.3% females; mean age?=?53.8, SD?=?16.1) who reported ever using alcohol. Our results showed that the ‘chip-heritability’ of AUDIT score, when treated as a continuous phenotype, was 12%. No loci reached genome-wide significance. The gene ADH1C, which has been previously implicated in AUD, was among our most significant associations (4.4?×?10 ?7 ; rs141973904). We also detected a suggestive association on chromosome 1 (2.1?×?10 ?7 ; rs182344113) near the gene KCNJ9, which has been implicated in mouse models of high ethanol drinking. Using linkage disequilibrium score regression, we identified positive genetic correlations between AUDIT score, high alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. We also observed an unexpected positive genetic correlation between AUDIT and educational attainment and additional unexpected negative correlations with body mass index/obesity and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We conclude that conducting a genetic study using responses to an online questionnaire in a population not ascertained for AUD may represent a cost-effective strategy for elucidating aspects of the etiology of AUD. ? 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction","alcohol; ADH1C gene; adult; alcohol consumption; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; alcoholism; Article; attention deficit disorder; body mass; chromosome 1; cigarette smoking; controlled study; educational status; European; female; gene; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; genetic association; genetic correlation; genome-wide association study; heritability; human; KCNJ9 gene; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obesity; phenotype; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism"
"Dental abnormalities in individuals with pathogenic germline variation in DICER1","2019","Pathogenic germline variation in the microRNA processing gene DICER1 gives rise to an autosomal dominant, tumor-predisposition disorder. Conditional deletion of Dicer1 in murine dental epithelium shows that it controls tooth patterning, size, number, and shape. The human dental phenotype of people with germline pathogenic variation in DICER1 is unknown. DICER1-carriers (n = 57) and family controls (n = 55) were evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center dental clinic as part of a comprehensive medical evaluation. Digital panoramic radiographs, bite-wing radiographs, and oral photographs were collected. A single observer, blind to DICER1 status, reviewed the dental records and determined the presence or absence of 11 dental characteristics as described in the clinic notes, radiographs, or oral photographs. Subjective phenotypes were reviewed on radiographs by two examiners (blind to DICER1 status) for the presence or absence of the dental characteristics to reduce inconsistencies. By simple association, bulbous crown, periodontitis, and taurodontism were all significant (p <.05). Logistic regression with chi-square maximum likelihood estimates showed that bulbous crown and periodontitis remained significant. Recognition of these phenotypes may aid identification of individuals and families at risk for DICER1-associated neoplasms. These findings may also guide dental care for individuals with germline DICER1 pathogenic variation. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer risk; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; dental procedure; DICER1 gene; disease association; female; gene; genetic association; genetic variation; germline mutation; heterozygote; human; major clinical study; male; medical assessment; medical record; mutational analysis; neoplasm; observational study; oral photography; panoramic radiography; periodontitis; phenotype; photography; priority journal; taurodontism; tooth disease; tooth radiography"
"A review of menopausal hormone therapy: Recalibrating the balance of benefit and risk","2019","While menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was initially marketed to women of menopausal age to prolong youth, it has endured a tumultuous history evaluating the risk-to-benefit ratio. In response to evidence that MHT may confer cardioprotective effects, 2 landmark randomized controlled trials tested this hypothesis, and both were stopped prematurely due to increased incident cancers and cardiovascular events, creating much controversy and confusion. As women and physicians grew reticent to use MHT, most symptomatic menopausal women remained untreated. Further evaluation of available data has since lent support for the “timing hypothesis,” which posits that younger women may not be at risk of adverse events following the use of MHT and may instead experience a survival advantage. Most recently, the 18-year follow-up data of postmenopausal women in the Women’s Health Institute trial did not show any change in long-term survival associated with the use of MHT at any age. More recent studies have evaluated alternative treatments for high-risk women, including lower doses and newer formulations of MHT, along with combined new therapies such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, antidepressants, and exercise therapies, which are effective in reducing vasomotor symptoms and improving menopause-specific quality of life. These alternatives provide new options to symptomatic women who are unable or unwilling to take conventional MHT and allow for more person-centered decision making strategies to support women through the menopause.

"Stability of Intracavitary Applicator Placement for HDR Brachytherapy of Cervix Cancer","2019","Introduction/Background: Cervical cancer is often treated with a combination of external beam radiation therapy and high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. An intrauterine ring and tandem applicator is used for intracavitary brachytherapy. The dose is prescribed to the high-risk clinical target volume. The goals of this study were to investigate the stability of intracavitary applicator placement during patient transfer and to evaluate the dosimetric impact of displacement. Methods: Fourteen patients with cervical cancer were analyzed. Three sets of orthogonal fluoroscopic radiographs were obtained in the high-dose-rate suite after the insertion and before treatment: pre–computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopic radiograph with patient in the lithotomy position, pre-CT fluoroscopic radiograph with patient in the legs down position, and post-CT fluoroscopic radiograph with patient in the legs down position. Applicator position after CT was compared with the pre-CT radiographs to determine if the position changed during patient transfer. The displacement was measured in the anterior-posterior, medio-lateral, and superior-inferior directions, as well as the degree of pitch, roll, and yaw. To study the impact of applicator shifts on dose to organs at risk (OARs), the ring and tandem applicator was shifted virtually in the BrachyVision treatment planning system. The OARs studied included the small bowel, sigmoid colon, rectum, and bladder. Five millimeter shifts were made in the superior-inferior, medio-lateral, and anterior-posterior direction. Three degree rotations were made in the pitch, yaw, and roll directions. Applicator shifts were analyzed in only one direction at a time. The dosimetric impact on OARs was evaluated by comparing the original and shifted/rotated plans to dose-volume histogram–based criteria. Results: The average displacements were 1.9 ± 0.5 mm laterally, 3.0 ± 0.6 mm longitudinally, and 9.5 ± 1.5 mm anterior-posterior. The average applicator rotation on the posterior-anterior radiograph was 1.0 ± 0.2° and 2.6 ± 0.6° on the lateral radiograph. Five millimeter anterior-posterior shifts had the greatest effect on dose to OARs. On average, 5 mm anterior shifts had the greatest effect on the small bowel dose, where there was a 13.7% (79.6 cGy) increase in D2cc. Five millimeter anterior shifts also affected bladder dose, with a 36.5% (141.1 cGy) increase in D2cc. Five millimeter POST shifts increased the rectal D2cc by 28.6% (168.7 cGy). Other directional shifts had negligible effects on dose. The largest effect on OAR dose arising from rotations was to the sigmoid colon, when the applicator rotated in the POST pitch direction. As a result, the dose increased by 4.7% (7.6 cGy). All other rotations had minimal impact on OAR doses. Conclusion: Patient transfer resulted in applicator shifts and rotations that had a measurable effect on dose to OARs. The displacements were the result of either a direct shift or rotation of the applicator. Additional tracking of these shifts and rotations may clarify the sources of these unwanted motions and suggest possible mitigation strategies. ? 2019","Article; bladder; brachytherapy; clinical article; clinical target volume; computer assisted tomography; dose volume histogram; dosimetry; external beam radiotherapy; female; fluoroscopy; human; lithotomy position; patient transport; priority journal; radiation dose fractionation; rectum; retrospective study; sigmoid; small intestine; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix carcinoma"
"Sustained quality improvement in outcomes of preterm neonates with a gestational age less than 29 weeks: Results from the Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality Phase 31","2019","Quality improvement initiatives in neonatology have yielded positive results; however, few programs have demonstrated sustainability. We evaluated an ongoing, national quality improvement initiative (Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality Phase 3 (EPIQ-3)) on outcomes of preterm neonates with a gestational age (GA) of 220–286 weeks (i.e., from 22 weeks and 0 days of gestation to 28 weeks and 6 days of gestation). Data from 7459 neonates admitted to 25 Canadian centers between 2013 and 2017 were studied. Trends in mortality and major morbidities were evaluated. The number of neonates with a GA of 220–236 weeks increased from 90 in 2013 to 139 in 2017 without a significant change in any other GA categories. In the entire cohort, the odds of composite outcome of mortality or any major morbidity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61–0.84) and of necrotizing enterocolitis (AOR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49–0.89) were lower in 2017 than in 2013. When calculated per year, the odds of composite outcome (AOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89–0.97) and odds of necrotizing enterocolitis (AOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.96) decreased significantly. Among the subgroup of neonates with a GA of 260–286 weeks, the odds of composite outcome (AOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.79), necrotizing enterocolitis (AOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26–0.73), and nosocomial infection (AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49–0.84) were reduced.

"Estimates of the current and future burden of melanoma attributable to ultraviolet radiation in Canada","2019","Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR)is an established cause of cutaneous melanoma. The purpose of this study was to estimate the current attributable and future avoidable burden of melanoma related to exposure to UVR and modifiable UVR risk behaviors (sunburn, sunbathing, and indoor tanning). The population attributable risk (PAR)associated with UVR in 2015 was estimated by comparing Canadian melanoma incidence rates in 2015 to estimated incidence rates of a 1920 birth cohort. Rates were adjusted for changes in reporting and ethnicity. We estimated PARs for modifiable UVR risk behaviors using Caucasian prevalence data from the Second National Sun Survey and relative risks that are generalizable to Canada from meta-analyses of relevant studies. Attributable cases apply to 98.9% of melanomas in Canada that occur in Caucasians. We also estimated the future burden of UVR risk behaviors using the potential impact fraction framework and potential reductions in prevalence of 10% to 50% from 2018 to 2042. Adult sunburn and sunbathing were associated with increased risks of melanoma of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.43)and 1.44 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.76), respectively. In 2015, we estimate that 62.3% of melanomas in Canada were attributable to exposure to UVR and that 29.7% were attributable to the combination of sunburn (7.4%), sunbathing (17.8%), and indoor tanning (7.0%). A 50% reduction in modifiable UVR behaviors could avoid an estimated 11,980 melanoma cases by 2042. Prevention strategies aimed at modifiable UVR behaviors are crucial to reduce the growing burden of melanoma in Canada. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adolescent; adult; Article; attributable risk; Canada; cancer incidence; Caucasian; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease burden; female; groups by age; high risk behavior; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; melanoma; middle aged; population research; prevalence; priority journal; radiation exposure; sex difference; sunbathing; sunburn; ultraviolet radiation; young adult"
"Ensembling Electrical and Proteogenomics Biomarkers for Improved Prediction of Cardiac-Related 3-Month Hospitalizations: A Pilot Study","2019","Background: Many risk models for predicting mortality, hospitalizations, or both in patients with heart failure have been developed but do not have sufficient discriminatory ability. The purpose of this study was to identify predictive biomarkers of hospitalizations in heart failure patients using omics-based technologies applied to blood and electrical monitoring of the heart. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 58 heart failure patients during enrollment into this study. Each patient wore a 48-hour Holter monitor that recorded the electrical activity of their heart. The blood samples were profiled for gene expression using microarrays and protein levels using multiple reaction monitoring. Statistical deconvolution was used to estimate cellular frequencies of common blood cells. Classification models were developed using clinical variables, Holter variables, cell types, gene transcripts, and proteins to predict hospitalization status. Results: Of the 58 patients recruited, 13 were hospitalized within 3 months after enrollment. These patients had lower diastolic and systolic blood pressures, higher brain natriuretic peptide levels, most had higher blood creatinine levels, and had been diagnosed with heart failure for a longer time period. The best-performing clinical model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76. An ensemble biomarker panel consisting of Holter variables, cell types, gene transcripts, and proteins had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88. Conclusions: Molecular-based analyses as well as sensory data might provide sensitive biomarkers for the prediction of hospitalizations in heart failure patients. These approaches may be combined with traditional clinical models for the development of improved risk prediction models for heart failure. ? 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society","acetylsalicylic acid; amiodarone; angiotensin receptor antagonist; apolipoprotein A2; apolipoprotein M; aryldialkylphosphatase 3; beta 2 microglobulin; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; calcium channel blocking agent; clopidogrel; creatinine; cystatin C; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; microRNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; plexin; prolactin receptor; protein; Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor; spironolactone; toll like receptor 7; unclassified drug; warfarin; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; creatinine; aged; Article; blood sampling; creatinine blood level; dendritic cell; diastolic blood pressure; electric activity; female; gene expression; health care; heart failure; Holter monitoring; hospitalization; human; light; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; monocyte count; multiple reaction monitoring; proteogenomics; proteomics; systolic blood pressure; transcriptomics; ambulatory electrocardiography; blood; blood pressure; gene expression profiling; heart failure; hospitalization; middle aged; pilot study; principal component analysis; procedures; proteogenomics; risk assessment; Aged; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Creatinine; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Pilot Projects; Principal Component Analysis; Proteogenomics; Risk Assessment"
"Development of a Prediction Tool for Exclusive Locoregional Recurrence After Radical Cystectomy in Patients With Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer","2019","Background: Limited information is available about the pattern of relapse after perioperative chemotherapy with radical cystectomy (RC) vs. RC alone in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients and Methods: Data from 1082 patients of the Retrospective International Study of Invasive/Advanced Cancer of the Urothelium database, treated from February 1990 to December 2013 at 27 centers in the United States, Europe, Israel, and Canada, were collected. Locoregional relapse was defined as any pelvic lymph node or soft tissue-only recurrences. Cumulative incidence methods were used to estimate time to locoregional relapse (TTR L ). Cox regression analyses were performed and a nomogram for 12-month locoregional relapse-free survival (RFS) was developed. The nomogram was applied to an external data set (n = 1021). Results: A total of 517 patients (47.8%) developed a relapse: 177 (16.4%) exclusive locoregional relapse. In multivariable analyses, perioperative chemotherapy was associated with longer TTR L (P &lt;.001). Other factors were nonurothelial histology (P =.013), pT-stage (P &lt;.001), and surgical margins (P &lt;.001). The concordance index of the model was 0.681 (95% bootstrapped confidence interval, 0.666-0.716). Risk group categories were obtained according to nomogram tertiles. Despite, overall, observed locoregional RFS in the validation cohort exceeding predicted results, for high-risk patients (80 points or less, lowest nomogram tertile) observed 12-month RFS was similar between development and validation cohorts (60.1% and 66.6%). The study is limited by its retrospective nature. Conclusion: In the largest study, to our knowledge, that analyzed locoregional recurrences after RC, we propose a risk prediction tool for exclusive locoregional failures that might be suitable for clinical studies. Patients best suited for adjuvant radiotherapy might be those within the lowest nomogram tertile. Prospective trials are needed to validate findings. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.We analyzed prognostic factors and developed a prediction tool for exclusive locoregional (pelvic) recurrences after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.

"What factors are associated with resilient outcomes in children exposed to social adversity? A systematic review","2019","Objectives Children exposed to social adversity-hardship as a result of social circumstances such as poverty or intergenerational trauma-are at increased risk of poor outcomes across the life course. Understanding what promotes resilient outcomes is essential for the development of evidence informed intervention strategies. We conducted a systematic review to identify how child resilience is measured and what factors are associated with resilient outcomes. Design Systematic search conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsychInfo from January 2004 to October 2018 using the keywords 'resilien? and child? in the title or abstract. Eligible studies: (1) described children aged 5-12 years; (2) identified exposure to social adversity; (3) identified resilience; and (4) investigated factors associated with resilience. Outcome measures (1) approaches to identifying resilience and (2) factors associated with resilient outcomes. Results From 1979 studies retrieved, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were moderate to high quality, with low cultural competency. Social adversity exposures included poverty, parent loss, maltreatment and war. Only two studies used a measure of child resilience; neither was psychometrically validated. Remaining studies classified children as resilient if they showed positive outcomes (eg, mental health or academic achievement) despite adversity. A range of child, family, school and community factors were associated with resilient outcomes, with individual factors most commonly investigated. The best available evidence was for cognitive skills, emotion regulation, relationships with caregivers and academic engagement. Conclusions While there is huge variation in the type and severity of adversity that children experience, there is some evidence that specific individual, relational and school factors are associated with resilient outcomes across a range of contexts. Such factors provide an important starting point for effective public health interventions to promote resilience and to prevent or ameliorate the immediate and long-term impacts of social adversity on children. ?

"Comparison of CPG's for the diagnosis, prognosis and management of non-specific neck pain: A systematic review","2019","Background: Neck pain (NP) is a very common musculoskeletal condition with potential for a high burden in disability and length of disorder. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) give recommendations to clinicians for providing optimal care for patients however best practice recommendations are often contradictory. The purpose for this review was to conduct a SR of CPGs to assess the management recommendations for NP (diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, imaging). Methods: Standard SR methodology was employed including a grey literature search (including the National Guideline Clearing House). Medline, Cinahl, Embase, ILC, Cochrane, Central, and Lilacs were searched from 1995-to March 2018. Two raters evaluated all citations and a third rater resolved any disagreements. The AGREE II was used to assess risk of bias of each CPG. Data was extracted and included CPG purpose, type of NP problem and clinical recommendations. The AGREE II critical appraisal tool was used to assess risk of bias of each CPG. Results: From 640 articles, 241 were available for screening. A total of 46 guidelines were selected. CPG's were categorized by the NP population (General NP, whiplash, interventional, headache and risk for vertebral insufficiency) and type of clinical aim (diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, imaging). Each clinical NP population had a large overlap of clinical aims presented. The CPGs were directed to a variety of clinicians that included physicians, physiotherapists and chiropractors. Results suggest heterogeneity in CPG recommendations within each clinical aim. CPG characteristics accounting for these differences are outlined. Conclusion: The majority of CPGs were developed for general NP that focused on treatment recommendations, with fewer number aimed at recommendations for diagnosis, prognosis, and outcomes. Heterogeneity of recommendations within the categories were noted as were potential factors associated with these differences, including CPG quality as assessed by the AGREE II. ? 2019 The Author(s).","chiropractor; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; disease association; disease duration; headache; human; intervention study; neck pain; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain assessment; pain severity; patient care; physician; physiotherapist; practice guideline; prognosis; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; screening; systematic review; whiplash injury; analgesia; clinical practice; comparative study; consensus; diagnostic imaging; neck pain; pain measurement; predictive value; standards; treatment outcome; Consensus; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Neck Pain; Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients with a non-sex-related CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1","2019","Aims To compare the effectiveness and safety of standard-dose rivaroxaban (20 mg o.d.) and warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with a non-sex-related CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1. Methods and results Analysis of United States Truven MarketScan claims from November 2011 to December 2016 for anticoagulant-na?ve NVAF patients with a single non-sex-related stroke risk factor assigned 1-point in the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and ?12-months of continuous medical/prescription insurance coverage prior to the qualifying oral anticoagulant dispensing. Standard-dose rivaroxaban users were 1:1 propensity score-matched to warfarin users. Patients were followed until outcome occurrence, insurance disenrollment, or end of data availability. Primary outcomes included stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding and were compared using Cox regression and reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In all, 3319 rivaroxaban users were 1:1 propensity score-matched to 3319 warfarin users. Median (interquartile range) duration of follow-up was 1.6 (0.7, 2) years and the most common qualifying stroke risk factor was hypertension (n = 4532, 68.3%). Rivaroxaban was associated with a significant reduction in the 1-year stroke or systemic embolism vs. warfarin (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.98), with no significant difference in overall major bleeding (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.44-1.26) or major bleeding subtypes (HR ranging from 0.33 to 0.78, P > 0.05 for all). Similar results were seen after extending follow-up to 2 years. Conclusions Rivaroxaban may lower the rate of stroke or systemic embolism vs. warfarin in NVAF patients with a non-sex-related CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1 without impacting major bleeding. ?

"Incorporating content related to value and cost-considerations in clinical decision-making: enhancements to medical education","2019","Although incorporating cost-considerations during healthcare decision-making is increasingly important to American patients and physicians, content related to these constructs is not routinely included in medical education. As a result, physicians are ill-equipped to consider costs. This study sought input from practicing physicians on perceived deficiencies in current teaching and recommendations for necessary content to include in medical teaching. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews utilizing a purposeful maximum variation sample of cardiologists and neonatologists practicing in diverse settings. We analyzed interviews using conventional content analysis. 18 cardiologists and 17 neonatologists participated in this study. Respondents perceived that current teaching does not impart sufficient knowledge of value and cost considerations to achieve patient-centered, high-value decision-making. They identified the following priority areas for education related to healthcare costs: the business of medicine and information about out-of-pocket patient costs, training in health research interpretation skills to critically appraise evidence, and communication skills to engage patients as partners in shared decision-making. Participants recommended a variety of teaching methods, including didactic sessions on core topics, role modeling and case studies. American physicians perceive learning needs related to the incorporation of costs into clinical decision-making that can inform curriculum development initiatives in this field. Physicians perceive knowledge of these topics and skills to be crucial to achieving patient-centered high-value care. Concomitant health system reforms supporting the needs of the patient at its center are essential to enable physicians to focus on a patient-centered approach to healthcare delivery. ? 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","adult; article; cardiologist; clinical decision making; communication skill; content analysis; curriculum development; health care delivery; human; learning; medical education; medical research; neonatologist; semi structured interview; shared decision making"
"Getting more out of meta-analyses: a new approach to meta-analysis in light of unexplained heterogeneity","2019","Background and Objectives: Meta-analyses sometimes summarize results in the presence of substantial unexplained between-study heterogeneity. As GRADE criteria highlight, unexplained heterogeneity reduces certainty in the evidence, resulting in limited confidence in average effect estimates. The aim of this paper is to provide a new clinically useful approach to estimating an intervention effect in light of unexplained heterogeneity. Methods: We used a random-effects model to estimate the distribution of an intervention-effect across various groups of patients given data derived from meta-analysis. The model provides a distribution of the probabilities of various possible effects in a new group of patients. We examined how our method influenced the conclusions of two meta-analyses. Results: In one example, our method illustrated that evidence from a meta-analysis did not support authors’ highly publicized conclusion that hypericum is as effective as other antidepressants. In the second example, our method provided insight into a subgroup analysis of the effect of ribavirin in hepatitis C, demonstrating clear important benefit in one subgroup but not in others. Conclusion: Analysing the distribution of an intervention-effect in random-effects models may enable clinicians to improve their understanding of the probability of particular-intervention effects in a new population. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","amitriptyline; antidepressant agent; Hypericum extract; interferon; placebo; ribavirin; Article; chronic hepatitis C; clinical decision making; clinical research; drug choice; drug efficacy; human; major clinical study; major depression; meta analysis (topic); patient compliance; patient decision making; priority journal; probability; random effects model; randomized controlled trial (topic); relapse; statistical model; sustained virologic response; systematic review (topic); treatment failure; treatment outcome; unspecified side effect"
"Patterns of adjuvant care and outcomes of elderly women with stage I breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery: a population-based analysis","2019","Purpose: Randomized trials studying endocrine therapy (ET) with and without radiation therapy (RT) following breast-conserving surgery (BCS) have detected differences in local recurrence (LR) but not survival among elderly women with hormone receptor positive stage I breast cancer (BC). We assembled a population-based cohort of such women to examine the use and outcomes associated with or without the administration of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or ET. Methods: Women aged ? 65?years with stage I BC treated with BCS in Ontario between 2010 and 2016, their treatments and outcomes were ascertained using deterministic linkages of administrative databases. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate risks of ipsilateral LR and of any first in-breast event, categorizing women by their treatment. Results: 5076 women were treated with BCS followed by RT + ET (n = 1964), RT alone (n = 1325), ET alone (n = 719), or no adjuvant treatment (n = 1068). Median follow-up was 5?years. LR occurred in 0.9% after adjuvant RT + ET, 1.4% after RT alone, 3.1% after ET alone, and 9.4% after BCS alone (p < 0.001). The adjusted risk of LR was increased in those who received no adjuvant therapy (HR = 13.43, CI: 7.89, 22.85), or ET alone (HR = 4.03, CI: 2.14, 7.59). The adjusted risk of any first in-breast event was greatest among those without any adjuvant therapy (HR = 7.61, 95%CI: 5.21, 11.11, p < 0.0001). Absolute and adjusted risks of any first in-breast event were comparable between those with ET alone (HR = 2.09, 95%CI: 1.27, 3.43, p = 0.0038) and those with RT alone (HR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.91, p = 0.0028). Conclusions: Older women with stage I BC who receive no adjuvant therapy have a significant absolute risk of LR and any first in-breast event, whereas the absolute risk of these events among those with either RT alone or ET alone is only slightly higher than among those treated with both. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","anastrozole; exemestane; letrozole; raloxifene; tamoxifen; tumor marker; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer surgery; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; female; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; lung embolism; major clinical study; partial mastectomy; patient compliance; priority journal; treatment outcome; adverse event; age; breast tumor; cancer staging; clinical practice; health survey; multimodality cancer therapy; partial mastectomy; pathology; patient care; postoperative care; procedures; prognosis; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Mastectomy, Segmental; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Care; Population Surveillance; Postoperative Care; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prognosis; Treatment Adherence and Compliance; Treatment Outcome"
"Evaluating the content validity of generic preference-based measures for use in Parkinson's disease","2019","Background: Generic preference-based measures are used to assess the cost-utility of different interventions in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the difficulty of using them in people with a particular health condition is that these measures may not encapsulate all of the domains that are impacted by the disease. Objective: To contribute evidence towards the content validity of generic preference-based measures in people with PD. Methods: Participants with PD were interviewed on a personalized measure of quality of life, the Patient Generated Index (PGI). The domains identified with the PGI were then categorized using the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The extent to which the generic measures (EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D, HUI II, and HUI III) included domains important to persons with PD was qualitatively evaluated. Results: The study included seventy-six participants with PD (mean age 69 years). Dexterity, the top domain nominated by participants, was only included in 1 out of 4 of the generic measures. Fatigue, another commonly reported problem, was not included in 3 out of 4 measures. Sleep, dyskinesia and bowel/bladder problems were not included in any of the measures. Conclusion: Content validity is an essential step in the evaluation of whether a questionnaire truly measures the construct it purports to measure, in this case the construct being health related quality of life (HRQL). This study evaluated the content validity of the EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D, HUI II and HUI III in people with PD, and demonstrated that several important PD specific domains are missing from these measures. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","generic drug; aged; anxiety; Article; bladder; bladder disease; cognition; content validity; controlled study; depression; dexterity test; drug preference; dyskinesia; employment; enteropathy; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; fatigue; female; functional status assessment; Health Utilities Index Mark 2; Health Utilities Index Mark 3; Hoehn and Yahr scale; household; human; International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; interview; intestine; major clinical study; male; Parkinson disease; Patient Generated Index; personality assessment; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality of life; questionnaire; self care; Short Form 6D; sleep; socialization; speech; work; World Health Organization"
"Family physicians and health advocacy","2019","Objective To examine whether family medicine residents and faculty members appreciate the full spectrum of health advocacy as described in articles published in Canadian Family Physician in 2016 and to identify the perceived challenges and enablers of advocating across the entire spectrum. Design Analysis of a subset of data from a qualitative study using semistructured interviews and focus groups. Setting University of Toronto in Ontario. Participants A total of 9 family medicine faculty members and 6 family medicine residents. Methods A subset of transcripts from a 2015 qualitative study that explored family medicine and psychiatry residents' and faculty members' understanding of the CanMEDS-Family Medicine health advocate role were reviewed, guided by interpretive descriptive methodology. Main findings Results indicated that family medicine physicians and residents were able to identify the full spectrum of advocacy described in the Canadian Family Physician articles and that they valued the role. Further, there was widespread agreement that being a health advocate was linked with their identities as health professionals. The time it takes to be a health advocate was seen as a barrier to being effective in the role, and the work was seen as extremely challenging owing to system constraints. Participants also described a gap in training relating to advocacy at the system level as a challenge. Conclusion Team-based care was seen as one of the most important enablers for becoming involved in the full spectrum of advocacy, as was time for personal reflection. ? 2019 College of Family Physicians of Canada.

"Canadian Association of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline for the Medical Management of Pediatric Luminal Crohn's Disease","2019","Background & Aims: We aim to provide guidance for medical treatment of luminal Crohn's disease in children. Methods: We performed a systematic search of publication databases to identify studies of medical management of pediatric Crohn's disease. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We developed statements through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on them. Results: The consensus includes 25 statements focused on medical treatment options. Consensus was not reached, and no recommendations were made, for 14 additional statements, largely due to lack of evidence. The group suggested corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide for mild to moderate disease). The group suggested exclusive enteral nutrition for induction therapy and biologic tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction and maintenance therapy at diagnosis or at early stages of severe disease, and for patients failed by steroid and immunosuppressant induction therapies. The group recommended against the use of oral 5-aminosalicylate for induction or maintenance therapy in patients with moderate disease, and recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy, corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, and cannabis in any role. The group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressants during initiation therapy with a biologic agent, although thiopurine combinations are not recommended for male patients. No consensus was reached on the role of aminosalicylates in treatment of patients with mild disease, antibiotics or vedolizumab for induction or maintenance therapy, or methotrexate for induction therapy. Patients in clinical remission who are receiving immunomodulators should be assessed for mucosal healing within 1 year of treatment initiation. Conclusions: Evidence-based medical treatment of Crohn's disease in children is recommended, with thorough ongoing assessments to define treatment success. ? 2019 AGA Institute and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology","antibiotic agent; budesonide; corticosteroid; immunomodulating agent; immunosuppressive agent; medical cannabis; mercaptopurine; mesalazine; methotrexate; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; gastrointestinal agent; alternative medicine; Article; biological therapy; consensus; corticosteroid therapy; Crohn disease; disease activity; drug safety; enteric feeding; gastroenterology; human; maintenance therapy; pediatrics; practice guideline; priority journal; Canada; child; Crohn disease; evidence based medicine; gastroenterology; medical society; practice guideline; procedures; standards; treatment outcome; Canada; Child; Crohn Disease; Evidence-Based Medicine; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Agents; Humans; Societies, Medical; Treatment Outcome"
"One Year of Romosozumab Followed by Two Years of Denosumab Maintains Fracture Risk Reductions: Results of the FRAME Extension Study","2019","Romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin, has the dual effect of increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. As previously reported in the pivotal FRActure study in postmenopausal woMen with ostEoporosis (FRAME), women with a T-score of ? –2.5 at the total hip or femoral neck received subcutaneous placebo or romosozumab once monthly for 12 months, followed by open-label subcutaneous denosumab every 6 months for an additional 12 months. Upon completion of the 24-month primary analysis period, eligible women entered the extension phase and received denosumab for an additional 12 months. Here, we report the final analysis results through 36 months, including efficacy assessments of new vertebral, clinical, and nonvertebral fracture; bone mineral density (BMD); and safety assessments. Of 7180 women enrolled, 5743 (80%) completed the 36-month study (2851 romosozumab-to-denosumab; 2892 placebo-to-denosumab). Through 36 months, fracture risk was reduced in subjects receiving romosozumab versus placebo for 12 months followed by 24 months of denosumab for both groups: new vertebral fracture (relative risk reduction [RRR], 66%; incidence, 1.0% versus 2.8%; p < 0.001), clinical fracture (RRR, 27%; incidence, 4.0% versus 5.5%; p = 0.004), and nonvertebral fracture (RRR, 21%; incidence, 3.9% versus 4.9%; p = 0.039). BMD continued to increase for the 2 years with denosumab treatment in both arms. The substantial difference in BMD achieved through 12 months of romosozumab treatment versus placebo was maintained through the follow-up period when both treatment arms received denosumab. Subject incidence of adverse events, including positively adjudicated serious cardiovascular adverse events, were overall balanced between groups. In conclusion, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, 12 months of romosozumab led to persistent fracture reduction benefit and ongoing BMD gains when followed by 24 months of denosumab. The sequence of romosozumab followed by denosumab may be a promising regimen for the treatment of osteoporosis. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research","denosumab; placebo; romosozumab; adult; aged; anaphylaxis; arthralgia; Article; backache; bone density; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; death; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; falling; female; femoral neck; femur fracture; fracture; human; hyperostosis; hypersensitivity; hypertension; hypocalcemia; injection site reaction; jaw osteonecrosis; limb pain; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; ossification; osteoarthritis; osteolysis; postmenopause; postmenopause osteoporosis; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; risk reduction; side effect; skin necrosis; spine fracture; treatment duration"
"Reduction in Mortality following Elective Major Hip and Knee Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","Background Systematic reviews reporting time trends in mortality following major orthopaedic surgery are few and have limitations. They reported on only a fraction (< 15%) of the available data and did not investigate potential causes of the reduction in mortality. Methods We searched PubMed for randomized trials and observational studies, published between 1950 and 2016, reporting on mortality within 3 months of elective total hip and knee replacement (THR/TKR). Mortality risks were estimated for each 5-year interval using a Poisson regression model and presented by study design and mode of prophylaxis. To estimate the mortality reduction unrelated to anti-thrombotic use, we performed a pooled analysis of four thromboprophylaxis strategies for which data spanned five decades. Results We identified 255 eligible studies, which documented 31,604 deaths among 6,293,954 patients, and found a consistent decline in mortality irrespective of study design and mode of prophylaxis. Mortality declined from 1.15% pre-1980 to 0.24% post-2000, a 78.7% relative risk reduction (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74.7-82.1%) in randomized and cohort studies. Furthermore, our data showed a 74.4% (95% CI: 68.7-79.0%) relative reduction in mortality independent of the methods of prophylaxis, thereby indicating that improvements in peri-operative care unrelated to anti-thrombotic prophylaxis played a major role in such reduction. Conclusion Mortality following elective THR/TKR has markedly declined over the past 50 years and is now low irrespective of which prophylactic agent is being used. Although anti-thrombotic prophylaxis may have contributed, other improvements in peri-operative care played a major role in the mortality reduction. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG.","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; fondaparinux; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; anticoagulation; elective surgery; follow up; hip surgery; human; knee replacement; knee surgery; meta analysis; mortality; perioperative period; priority journal; prophylaxis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk factor; surgical mortality; systematic review; total hip replacement; venous thromboembolism; elective surgery; hip replacement; lung embolism; methodology; observational study; orthopedic surgery; Poisson distribution; postoperative period; Anticoagulants; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Orthopedic Procedures; Perioperative Period; Poisson Distribution; Postoperative Period; Pulmonary Embolism; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Venous Thromboembolism"

"Mental–Physical Multimorbidity in Youth: Associations with Individual, Family, and Health Service Use Outcomes","2019","Prevalence, correlates, and outcomes of youth with comorbid mental and physical conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) were examined in this cross-sectional study. Participants were 92 youth (14.5?years [SD 2.7]; 69.6% female) and their parents. Mental disorder was assessed using structured interviews and physical health using a standardized questionnaire. Twenty-five percent of youth had multimorbidity and no child or parent demographic or health characteristics were correlated with multimorbidity. Youth with multimorbidity reported similar quality of life and better family functioning [B = ? 4.80 (? 8.77, ? 0.83)] compared to youth with mental disorder only (i.e., non-multimorbid). Youth with multimorbidity had lower odds of receiving inpatient services [OR = 0.20 (0.05, 0.85)] and shorter stays in hospital for their mental health [OR = 0.74 (0.57, 0.91)] over the past year. Family functioning was found to mediate the association between youth multimorbidity and length of stay [αβ = 0.14 (0.01, 0.27)].

"Adductor Canal Block or Local Infiltrate Analgesia for Pain Control After Total Knee Arthroplasty? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","2019","Background: Total knee arthroplasty is a treatment option for debilitating arthritis. In the postoperative period, patients experience moderate to severe pain affecting the rehabilitation, hospital stay, and patient satisfaction. This study aims at utilizing current best evidence to determine whether adductor canal block (ACB) or periarticular injection (PAI) is a better modality for managing short-term postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE, HealthStar, Emcare, and PubMed were searched for randomized controlled trials from 1946 to August 2018, for literature addressing the comparison of ACB and PAI for pain management in the setting of total knee arthroplasty. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Results: Six studies were included in our meta-analysis. When examining the combined visual analog scale (VAS) pain values for each group, analysis demonstrated greater reduction in scores for the PAI group, and the difference was statistically significant (P =.001). When comparing the VAS scores of subgroups analyzed at specific periods in time, there was a trend toward lower VAS scores in subgroups analyzed at 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively (at rest and at movement) in the PAI group. Overall opioid consumption was lower in the PAI group, with demonstrated statistical significance (P =.03). When comparing the postoperative subgroups, there was a trend toward decreased opioid use in the PAI group, with 13.25% less opioid use at 48 hours and 9.5% less opioid use at 24 hours. Conclusion: PAI could significantly improve postoperative pain and opioid consumption when compared with ACB. Additional, high-quality studies are required to further address this topic. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","opiate; local anesthetic agent; adductor canal block; analgesia; drug use; human; meta analysis; nerve block; periarticular infiltration; postoperative pain; postoperative period; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; total knee arthroplasty; visual analog scale; aged; analgesia; comparative study; innervation; intraarticular drug administration; knee; knee replacement; local anesthesia; nerve block; postoperative pain; procedures; Aged; Anesthesia, Local; Anesthetics, Local; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Humans; Injections, Intra-Articular; Knee; Nerve Block; Pain Management; Pain, Postoperative; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Visual Analog Scale"
"GRADE guidelines: 22. The GRADE approach for tests and strategies—from test accuracy to patient-important outcomes and recommendations","2019","Objectives: This article describes the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group's framework of moving from test accuracy to patient or population-important outcomes. We focus on the common scenario when studies directly evaluating the effect of diagnostic and other tests or strategies on health outcomes are not available or are not providing the best available evidence. Study Design and Setting: Using practical examples, we explored how guideline developers and other decision makers can use information from test accuracy to develop a recommendation by linking evidence that addresses downstream consequences. Guideline panels should develop an analytic framework that summarizes the actions that follow from applying a test and the consequences. Results: We describe GRADE's current thinking about the overall certainty of the evidence (also known as quality of the evidence or confidence in the estimates) arising from consideration of the often complex pathways that involve multiple tests and management options. Each link in the evidence can—and often does—lower the overall certainty of the evidence required to formulate recommendations and make decisions about tests. The frequency with which an outcome occurs and its importance will influence whether or not a particular step in the linked evidence is critical to decision-making. Conclusions: Overall certainty may be expressed by the weakest critical step in the linked evidence. The linked approach to addressing optimal testing will often require the use of decision analytic approaches. We present an example that involves decision modeling in a GRADE Evidence to Decision framework for cervical cancer screening. However, because resources and time of guideline developers may be limited, we describe alternative, pragmatic strategies for developing recommendations addressing test use. ? 2019","Article; clinical decision making; GRADE approach; human; practice guideline; priority journal; treatment outcome"
"Risk factors for early and late mortality after fenestrated and branched endovascular repair of complex aneurysms","2019","Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F-BEVAR) performed in high-risk patients to treat pararenal (PR) aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) and to identify those patients likely to benefit from this treatment. Methods: A prospective single-center review of patients treated electively for PR aneurysm and TAAA using F-BEVAR between 2004 and 2016 was performed. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality during follow-up were determined using multivariate statistical techniques and a Cox regression model including all variables that were significant on univariate analysis (P <.05). Results: There were 468 patients (median age, 71.6 years) identified, with American Society of Anesthesiologists score ?3 in 94.7%. There were 221 (47.2%) type I to type III TAAAs and 247 (52.8%) type IV and type V TAAAs and PR aneurysms, with a median diameter of 58 mm. Technical success for target vessel stenting was 99.1% (1493/1506). The 30-day mortality rate was 4.9% (23 patients). The spinal cord ischemia rate was 3.8% (18 patients). Twenty patients (4.3%) required postoperative dialysis and four patients (0.8%) long-term dialysis after discharge. Median follow-up was 29 months. Survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years was 86.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.1-89.6), 73.3% (95% CI, 68.3-77.6), and 59.6% (95% CI, 53.4-65.2), respectively. Freedom from any target vessel occlusion and freedom from secondary procedures were 96.2% (95% CI, 93.8-97.7) and 88.2% (95% CI, 84.8-90.9) at 1 year and 90.0% (95% CI, 84.5-91.9) and 70.2% (95% CI, 63.9-75.6) at 5 years, respectively. In multivariate analysis, early mortality was associated with procedure time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.007 per minute; 95% CI, 1.003-1.010; P <.001), TAAA preoperative diameter (HR, 1.053 per millimeter; 95% CI, 1.020-1.087; P =.001), and chronic kidney disease (HR, 3.139; 95% CI, 1.369-7.196; P =.007). Mortality during the first 24 months of follow-up was associated with Crawford types I to III (HR, 1.526; 95% CI, 1.061-2.196; P =.023) compared with infradiaphragmatic repairs, chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.874; 95% CI, 1.294-2.712; P <.001), and TAAA preoperative diameter (HR, 1.027 per millimeter; 95% CI, 1.010-1.044; P =.002). In addition to these risk factors, mortality after 24 months of follow-up was also associated with age at repair (HR, 1.055 per year; 95% CI, 1.021-1.090; P =.001). Conclusions: F-BEVAR performed in high-risk patients is associated with favorable outcomes. Judicious selection of patients should take into consideration the reported risk factors associated with early and late mortality. ? 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery","aged; Article; branched endovascular aneurysm repair; computed tomographic angiography; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; fenestration; follow up; high risk patient; human; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; mortality risk; priority journal; prospective study; renal artery aneurysm; risk factor; spinal cord ischemia; survival analysis; thoracoabdominal aorta aneurysm; abdominal aortic aneurysm; adverse event; blood vessel prosthesis; blood vessel transplantation; devices; diagnostic imaging; endovascular surgery; mortality; postoperative complication; retrospective study; risk assessment; thoracic aorta aneurysm; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Risk factors for diabetic kidney disease in adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes: results from the Canadian Study of Longevity in Diabetes","2019","Objectives: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We aimed to explore clinical and biochemical factors, including the achievement of American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended targets associated with DKD in people living with T1D for ?50?years. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study of 75 participants enrolled in the Canadian Study of Longevity in T1D. We explored diabetes-related complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and DKD. Study participants were dichotomized based on the achievement of ADA recommended targets as the low-target group (achieving ?4 targets, n = 31) and high-target group (achieving &gt;4 targets, n = 44). The outcome of interest was DKD defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values &lt;60/mL/min/1.73?m2 and/or 24-h albumin excretion &gt;30 mg. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for DKD with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of the 75 participants with prolonged T1D duration (45% male, mean age 66?years), 25 participants had DKD and 50 did not. There was no statistical difference between the high- and low-target groups in terms of age and body mass index. eGFR was significantly higher and the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was significantly lower in the high-target group. Older age at diagnosis of T1D and lower frequency component to high-frequency component ratio increased the odds of having DKD. Conclusions: In adults with prolonged T1D duration, older age at diagnosis and lower heart rate variability may be associated with DKD. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"The cost implication of primary prevention in the HOPE 3 trial","2019","Aims: The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 (HOPE-3) found that rosuvastatin alone or with candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) (in a subgroup with hypertension) significantly lowered cardiovascular events compared with placebo in 12 705 individuals from 21 countries at intermediate risk and without cardiovascular disease. We assessed the costs implications of implementation in primary prevention in countries at different economic levels. Methods and results: Hospitalizations, procedures, study and non-study medications were documented. We applied country-specific costs to the healthcare resources consumed for each patient. We calculated the average cost per patient in US dollars for the duration of the study (5.6 years). Sensitivity analyses were also performed with cheapest equivalent substitutes. The combination of rosuvastatin with candesartan/HCT reduced total costs and was a cost-saving strategy in United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. In contrast, the treatments were more expensive in developing countries even when cheapest equivalent substitutes were used. After adjustment for gross domestic product (GDP), the costs of cheapest equivalent substitutes in proportion to the health care costs were higher in developing countries in comparison to developed countries. Conclusion: Rosuvastatin and candesartan/HCT in primary prevention is a cost-saving approach in developed countries, but not in developing countries as both drugs and their cheapest equivalent substitutes are relatively more expensive despite adjustment by GDP. Reductions in costs of these drugs in developing countries are essential to make statins and blood pressure lowering drugs affordable and ensure their use. ? 2019 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

"Social factors in frequent callers: A description of isolation, poverty and quality of life in those calling emergency medical services frequently","2019","Background: Frequent users of emergency medical services (EMS) comprise a disproportionate percentage of emergency department (ED) visits. EDs are becoming increasingly overwhelmed and a portion of use by frequent callers of EMS is potentially avoidable. Social factors contribute to frequent use however few studies have examined their prevalence. This study aims to describe social isolation/loneliness, poverty, and quality of life in a sample of frequent callers of EMS in the Hamilton region, a southern Ontario mid-sized Canadian city. Study design: Cross-sectional quantitative study. Methods: We surveyed people who called EMS five or more times within 12 months. A mailed self-administered survey with validated tools, and focused on four major measures: demographic information, social isolation, poverty, and quality of life. Results: Sixty-seven frequent EMS callers revealed that 37-49% were lonely, 14% had gone hungry in the preceding month, and 43% had difficulties making ends meet at the end of the month. For quality of life, 78% had mobility problems, 55% had difficulty with self-care, 78% had difficulty with usual activities, 87% experienced pain/discomfort, and 67% had anxiety/depression. Overall quality adjusted life years value was 0.53 on a scale of 0 to 1. The response rate was 41.1%. Conclusions: Loneliness in our participants was more common than Hamilton and Canadian rates. Frequent EMS callers had higher rates of poverty and food insecurity than average Ontario citizens, which may also act as a barrier to accessing preventative health services. Lower quality of life may indicate chronic illness, and users who cannot access ambulatory care services consistently may call EMS more frequently. Frequent callers of EMS had high rates of social loneliness and poverty, and low quality of life, indicating a need for health service optimization for this vulnerable population. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; anxiety; catering service; chronic disease; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; demography; depression; emergency health service; female; health care delivery; hospital emergency service; human; hunger; loneliness; male; Ontario; patient attitude; poverty; psychology; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; questionnaire; social isolation; statistics and numerical data; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Depression; Emergency Medical Services; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Food Supply; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Hunger; Loneliness; Male; Ontario; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Poverty; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires"

"Use of a maternal newborn audit and feedback system in Ontario: A collective case study","2019","Background As part of a larger study examining the effectiveness of the Maternal Newborn Dashboard, an electronic audit and feedback system to improve maternal-newborn care practices and outcomes, the purpose of this study was to increase our understanding of factors explaining variability in performance after implementation of the Dashboard in Ontario, Canada. Methods A collective case study. A maximum variation sampling approach was used to invite hospitals reflecting different criteria to participate in a 1-day to 2-day site visit by the research team. The visits included: (1) semistructured interviews and focus groups with healthcare providers, leaders and personnel involved in clinical change processes; (2) observations and document review. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative content analysis was used to code and categorise the data. Results Between June and November 2016, we visited 14 maternal-newborn hospitals. Hospitals were grouped into four quadrants based on their key indicator performance and level of engagement with the Dashboard. Findings revealed four overarching themes that contribute to the varying success of sites in achieving practice change on the Dashboard key performance indicators, namely, interdisciplinary collaboration and accountability, application of formal change strategies, team trust and use of evidence and data, as well as alignment with organisational priorities and support. Conclusion The diversity of facilitators and barriers across the 14 hospitals highlights the need to go beyond a 'one size fits all' approach when implementing audit and feedback systems. Future work to identify tools to assess barriers to practice change and to evaluate the effects of cointerventions to optimise audit and feedback systems for clinical practice change is needed. ?

"Associations between methotrexate use and the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis","2019","Objective.We evaluated the associations between time-varying methotrexate (MTX) use and risk of cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. We studied an inception cohort of 23,994 patients with RA diagnosed after their 65th birthday. Multivariable Cox regression models were fit to evaluate the associations between time-varying MTX use, controlling for other risk factors, and time to CVE. Alternative models assessed the cumulative duration of MTX use over the (1) first year, (2) previous year (recent use), and (3) entire duration of followup. We also assessed whether the strength of the association varied over time. Results. Over 115,453 patient-years (PY), 3294 (13.7%) patients experienced a CVE (28.5 events per 1000 PY; 95% CI 27.6-29.5). In the multivariable analyses, the model assessing time-varying continuous use in the most recent year yielded the best fit. Increasing recent MTX use was associated with lower CVE risks (HR 0.79 for continuous use vs no use in past 12 months, 95% CI 0.70-0.88; p < 0.0001). Greater MTX use in the first year after cohort entry was also protective (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.96; p = 0.0048), but this effect decreased with increasing followup. In contrast, longer MTX use during the entire followup was not clearly associated with CVE risk (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-1.01; p = 0.1441). Conclusion.We observed about a 20% decrease in CVE associated with recent continuous MTX use. Greater MTX use in the first year of cohort entry also appeared to be important in the association between MTX and CVE risk. Copyright ? 2019.

"Comparison of Frequency of Ischemic Stroke in Patients With Versus Without Coronary Heart Disease and Without Atrial Fibrillation","2019","Recent trials of antithrombotic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have demonstrated substantial reductions in ischemic stroke. Our aim was to examine ischemic stroke risk in patients with CAD and to identify those at highest risk. We examined ischemic stroke risk in patients without atrial fibrillation who underwent coronary angiography between 2004 and 2012. Patients were stratified according to presence or absence of CAD and further stratified by extent of CAD (0 vessel disease [VD], 1 VD, 2 VD, 3 VD, and diffuse VD). End points were composites of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and systemic embolism, as well as major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, plus ischemic stroke, TIA, and systemic embolism. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated. A total of 68,829 patients were included, 25,032 had 0 VD, 4,736 had diffuse VD, 18,471 had 1 VD, 10,588 had 2 VD, and 10,002 had 3 VD. Median follow-up was 4.0 years. CAD extent was associated with an increased risk of stroke, TIA, and systemic embolism (1 VD: adjusted IRR 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90 to 1.16; diffuse VD: adjusted IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.47; 2 VD: adjusted IRR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.45; 3 VD: adjusted IRR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.55) compared with patients with 0 VD. Presence and extent of CAD were also associated with MACCE. In conclusion, CAD is associated with an increased risk of stroke, TIA, and systemic embolism and MACCE in patients without atrial fibrillation, and patients with coronary multi-VD are at highest risk and may be candidates for treatment strategies aiming at reducing ischemic stroke incidence. ? 2018","adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; comparative study; controlled study; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; embolism; female; heart death; heart infarction; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; priority journal; risk assessment; transient ischemic attack; atrial fibrillation; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; complication; coronary artery disease; Denmark; incidence; middle aged; register; risk; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Brain Ischemia; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Denmark; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Risk; Stroke"
"Sex-mismatched red blood cell transfusions and mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background and Objectives: Selection of a compatible red blood cell (RBC) unit does not include matching for donor sex. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize the evidence examining the impact of sex-mismatched RBC transfusion on recipient mortality. Materials and Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from inception up to 23 November 2018. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included in the search. Eligible studies reported on the impact of sex-matched compared to sex-mismatched RBC transfusion on recipient mortality. Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed study quality. A three-level meta-analytic model was applied to emphasize the unknown dependence among the effect sizes. Results: Five retrospective observational studies (n?=?86?737) were included; no RCTs were found. Sex-mismatched RBC transfusions were associated with a higher risk of death compared with sex-matched transfusions (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 1·13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1·02–1·24). In the subgroup of cardiovascular surgery (n?=?57?712), there was no significant increase in mortality with sex-mismatched transfusions (pooled HR: 1·08; 95% CI: 0·95–1·22). The data were prone to confounding, selection bias and reporting bias. Certainty of the evidence was very low. Conclusion: Sex-mismatched RBC transfusions were associated with an increased risk of death in this pooled analysis. However, the certainty of the evidence was very low from observational studies. The need to match donor and recipient sex for transfusions requires further investigation because of the potential widespread impact. ? 2019 International Society of Blood Transfusion","adult; article; blood safety; cardiovascular surgery; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; controlled study; effect size; Embase; erythrocyte transfusion; female; human; human cell; male; Medline; meta analysis; mortality; observational study; randomized controlled trial (topic); recipient; reporting bias; retrospective study; selection bias; systematic review; transfusion medicine; Web of Science; adverse event; erythrocyte transfusion; sex factor; Erythrocyte Transfusion; Female; Humans; Male; Observational Studies as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sex Factors"
"Effect of Addition of an Intimate Partner Violence Intervention to a Nurse Home Visitation Program on Maternal Quality of Life: A Randomized Clinical Trial","2019","Importance: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem with significant adverse consequences for women and children. Past evaluations of a nurse home visitation program for pregnant women and first-time mothers experiencing social and economic disadvantage have not consistently shown reductions in IPV. Objective: To determine the effect on maternal quality of life of a nurse home visitation program augmented by an IPV intervention, compared with the nurse home visitation program alone. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cluster-based, single-blind, randomized clinical trial at 15 sites in 8 US states (May 2011-May 2015) enrolling 492 socially disadvantaged pregnant women (?16 years) participating in a 2.5-year nurse home visitation program. Interventions: In augmented program sites (n = 229 participants across 7 sites), nurses received intensive IPV education and delivered an IPV intervention that included a clinical pathway to guide assessment and tailor care focused on safety planning, violence awareness, self-efficacy, and referral to social supports. The standard program (n = 263 participants across 8 sites) included limited questions about violence exposure and information for abused women but no standardized IPV training for nurses. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF; range, 0-400; higher score indicates better quality of life) obtained through interviews at baseline and every 6 months until 24 months after delivery. From 17 prespecified secondary outcomes, 7 secondary end points are reported, including scores on the Composite Abuse Scale, SPAN (Startle, Physiological Arousal, Anger, and Numbness), Prime-MD Patient Health Questionnaire, TWEAK (Tolerance/Worry About Drinking/Eye-Opener/Amnesia/C[K]ut Down on Drinking), Drug Abuse Severity Test, and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (physical and mental health), version 2. Results: Among 492 participants enrolled (mean age, 20.4 years), 421 (86%) completed the trial. Quality of life improved from baseline to 24 months in both groups (change in WHOQOL-BREF scores from 299.5 [SD, 54.4] to 308.2 [SD, 52.6] in the augmented program group vs from 293.6 [SD, 56.4] to 316.4 [SD, 57.5] in the standard program group). Based on multilevel growth curve analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between groups (modeled score difference, -4.9 [95% CI, -16.5 to 6.7]). There were no statistically significant differences between study groups in any of the secondary participant end points. There were no adverse events recorded in either group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among pregnant women experiencing social and economic disadvantage and preparing to parent for the first time, augmentation of a nurse home visitation program with a comprehensive IPV intervention, compared with the home visitation program alone, did not significantly improve quality of life at 24 months after delivery. These findings do not support the use of this intervention. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01372098. ? 2019 AMA.

"Application of Hereditary Renal Cell Carcinoma Risk Criteria to a Large Prospective Database","2020","Aims: To evaluate the clinical impact of the Canadian criteria for identifying patients and families at risk for hereditary renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Materials and methods: The Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria were applied to patients from 16 centres in the Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) prospective database. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who met at least one criterion. Results: Between January 2011 and May 2017, 8388 patients were entered in the database; 291 had inadequate risk data; 2827 (35%) met at least one criterion for genetic testing (at-risk population). Most (83%) met just one criterion. The criterion of non-clear cell histology contributed the largest proportion of at-risk patients (59%), followed by age ? 45 years (28%). Sixty-one patients had documentation of genetic testing, with 56 being classified at-risk (2% of at-risk). Twenty patients (35%) of the patients at risk and tested for hereditary RCC were found to harbour a germline mutation. Conclusions: Application of the Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria to a large prospective database resulted in 35% of patients being identified at risk for hereditary RCC who could qualify for genetic testing. However, the true incidence of hereditary RCC in this population is unknown as most patients did not have documented genetic testing carried out and, thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria cannot be determined. The low proportion of at-risk patients who underwent genetic testing is disappointing and highlights that there may be gaps in reporting, knowledge and/or barriers in access to genetic testing. ? 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists","adult; Article; Canada; cancer classification; cancer patient; cancer risk; controlled study; data base; family study; female; genetic screening; germline mutation; hereditary tumor syndrome; histopathology; human; major clinical study; male; medical documentation; medical information system; population genetics; population research; practice guideline; priority journal; prospective study; renal cell carcinoma; risk assessment"
"Leveraging patient-reported outcomes data to inform oncology clinical decision making: Introducing the FACE-Q Head and Neck Cancer Module","2019","Background: Existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to assess patients with head and neck cancer have methodologic and content deficiencies. Herein, the development of a PROM that meets a range of clinical and research needs across head and neck oncology is described. Methods: After development of the conceptual framework, which involved a literature review, semistructured patient interviews, and expert input, patients with head and neck cancer who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were recruited by their surgeon. The FACE-Q Head and Neck Cancer Module was completed by patients in the clinic or was sent by mail. Rasch measurement theory analysis was used for item selection for final scale development and to examine reliability and validity. Scale scores for surgical defect and adjuvant therapy were compared with the cohort average to assess clinical applicability. Results: The sample consisted of 219 patients who completed the draft scales. Fourteen independently functioning scales were analyzed. Item fit was good for all 102 items, and all items had ordered thresholds. Scale reliability was acceptable (person separation index was >0.75 for all scales; Cronbach α values were >.87 for all scales; test-retest ranged from 0.86 to 0.96). The scales performed well in a clinically predictable way, demonstrating functional and psychosocial differences across disease sites and with adjuvant therapy. Conclusions: The scales forming the FACE-Q Head and Neck Cancer Module were found to be clinically relevant and scientifically sound. This new PROM now is validated and ready for use in research and clinical care. ? 2018 American Cancer Society","adult; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer center; cancer patient; clinical assessment tool; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; FACE-Q Head and Neck Cancer Module; female; functional assessment; head and neck cancer; human; major clinical study; male; medical expert; medical information; middle aged; oncology; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; Rasch analysis; rating scale; scoring system; semi structured interview; social psychology; surgeon; test retest reliability; validity; young adult; age distribution; aged; clinical decision making; head and neck tumor; patient satisfaction; patient-reported outcome; psychology; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Clinical Decision-Making; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Adverse Childhood Experiences and Amygdalar Reduction: High-Resolution Segmentation Reveals Associations With Subnuclei and Psychiatric Outcomes","2019","The aim of the present study was 2-fold: (1) to utilize improved amygdala segmentation and exploratory factor analysis to characterize the latent volumetric structure among amygdala nuclei and (2) to assess the effect of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on amygdalar morphometry and current psychiatric symptoms. To investigate these aims, structural (T1) MRI and self-report data were obtained from 119 emerging adults. Regression analysis showed that higher ACE scores were related to reduced volume of the right, but not the left, amygdalar segments. Further, exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-factor structure, basolateral and central-medial nuclei of the right amygdala. Stractual equation modeling analyses revealed that higher ACE scores were significantly related to a reduced volume of the right basolateral and central-medial segments. Furthermore, reduction in the right basolateral amygdala was associated with increased anxiety, depressive symptoms, and alcohol use. This association supports an indirect effect between early adversity and psychiatric problems via reduced right basolateral amygdalar volume. The high-resolution segmentation results reveal a latent structure among amygdalar nuclei, which is consistent with prior work conducted in nonhuman mammals. These findings extend previous reports linking early adversity, right amygdala volume, and psychopathology. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"The hidden cost of an extensive preoperative work-up: predictors of attrition after referral for bariatric surgery in a universal healthcare system","2020","Background: Bariatric surgery is in high demand and patients generally undergo an extensive work-up process to maximize the success of surgery, especially in universal healthcare systems. Although valuable, this work-up process can lead to attrition before surgery. Therefore, we aim to assess patient and health system factors associated with attrition after bariatric surgery referral in a universal healthcare system. Methods: This was a population-based study of all patients aged ? 18 referred for bariatric surgery in Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2015. Primary outcome was patients who dropped out of bariatric surgery after referral. Predictors of attrition after referral included patient demographics, clinical, institutional, and socioeconomic variables. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were estimated by multilevel logistic regression models. Results: From 17,703 patients that were referred for bariatric surgery, 4122 patients dropped after the initial referral. Male patients, increasing age, and longer wait times for surgery were significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with higher odds of attrition. Additionally, smoker status, immigration status, unemployment, and disability were significant factors (P < 0.0001) predicting attrition. Patients who lived in lowest income quintile neighborhoods, when compared to those from the richest neighborhoods, had significantly higher odds of attrition (P = 0.02). Sleep apnea was associated with lower odds of attrition while diabetes and heart failure both with higher odds of attrition. Conclusion: Even in a universal healthcare system, there are various factors that could lead to increased odds of attrition before bariatric surgery. Clear disparities exist for certain marginalized populations. Further studies are warranted to ensure equitable utilization of bariatric surgery for all patients. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; bariatric surgery; Canada; clinical outcome; controlled study; disability; female; health care system; heart failure; human; immigration; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; obesity; patient referral; people by smoking status; priority journal; retrospective study; sleep disordered breathing; unemployment"
"Molecular Pathogenesis of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus","2019","Purpose of Review: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 and is listed in the World Health Organization’s blueprint of priority diseases that need immediate research. Camels are reservoirs of this virus, and the virus spills over into humans through direct contact with camels. Human-to-human transmission and travel-associated cases have been identified as well. Limited studies have characterized the molecular pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. Most studies have used ectopic expression of viral proteins to characterize MERS-CoV and its ability to modulate antiviral responses in human cells. Studies with live virus are limited, largely due to the requirement of high containment laboratories. In this review, we have summarized current studies on MERS-CoV molecular pathogenesis and have mentioned some recent strategies that are being developed to control MERS-CoV infection. Recent Findings: Multiple antiviral molecules with the potential to inhibit MERS-CoV infection by disrupting virus-receptor interactions are being developed and tested. Although human vaccine candidates are still being developed, a candidate camel vaccine is being tested for efficacy. Combination of supportive treatment with interferon and antivirals is also being explored. Summary: New antiviral molecules that inhibit MERS-CoV and host cell receptor interaction may become available in the future. Additional studies are required to identify and characterize the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV EMC/2012 and other circulating strains. An effective MERS-CoV vaccine, for humans and/or camels, along with an efficient combination antiviral therapy may help us prevent future MERS cases. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",""
"Factors that influence Canadian internal medicine residents’ choice to pursue a rheumatology career","2019","In Canada, little is known about residents’ self-confidence to diagnose/treat musculoskeletal (MSK) disease and factors affecting pursuit of a rheumatology career. Our study explored these factors. An online survey (descriptive cross-sectional design) was distributed to Canadian postgraduate year (PGY) 1 and 2 internal medicine (IM) residents. Questions probed self-confidence in rheumatology and factors influencing subspecialty career choice. Frequencies were determined and responses compared between PGY-1 and PGY-2 using univariate statistical analyses. Fifty-four IM residents completed the survey. PGY-2 residents were statistically more certain in subspecialty decidedness and had higher levels of self-confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease and perform a physical exam. “Quality of life” was the most encouraging factor for a rheumatology career choice followed by “job opportunities” and “previous clinical exposure.” Although 50% of PGY-1 residents had completed a rheumatology clinical rotation, 76% indicated that increased knowledge would affect rheumatology career choice. Only 38% were interested in novel rheumatology education. No difference in rheumatology exposure, rheumatology clinical rotation completion year, or rheumatology career choice was observed. Our research confirms findings from similar United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) studies that suggest that increased MSK knowledge positively influences residents’ confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease. Our study differs with Canadian PGY-1 and PGY-2 IM residents by evaluating self-confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease separately from self-confidence to perform a physical exam. Significant differences between first and second year trainees suggest types/quality of rheumatology experiences (e.g., case complexity, diagnostic problem-solving competency) may affect self-confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease factors and rheumatology career choice. ? 2018, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).","Article; Canada; decision making; experience; female; human; male; musculoskeletal disease; physical examination; physician attitude; postgraduate education; priority journal; professional knowledge; quality of life; resident; rheumatology; clinical competence; cross-sectional study; education; internal medicine; medical education; musculoskeletal disease; questionnaire; self concept; statistics and numerical data; Canada; Career Choice; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internal Medicine; Internship and Residency; Male; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Quality of Life; Rheumatology; Self Concept; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Dulaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes (REWIND): a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial","2019","Background: Three different glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk with high glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentrations. We assessed the effect of the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events when added to the existing antihyperglycaemic regimens of individuals with type 2 diabetes with and without previous cardiovascular disease and a wide range of glycaemic control. Methods: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done at 371 sites in 24 countries. Men and women aged at least 50 years with type 2 diabetes who had either a previous cardiovascular event or cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned (1:1) to either weekly subcutaneous injection of dulaglutide (1·5 mg) or placebo. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated random code with stratification by site. All investigators and participants were masked to treatment assignment. Participants were followed up at least every 6 months for incident cardiovascular and other serious clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of the composite endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (including unknown causes), which was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01394952. Findings: Between Aug 18, 2011, and Aug 14, 2013, 9901 participants (mean age 66·2 years [SD 6·5], median HbA1c 7·2% [IQR 6·6–8·1], 4589 [46·3%] women) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive dulaglutide (n=4949) or placebo (n=4952). During a median follow-up of 5·4 years (IQR 5·1–5·9), the primary composite outcome occurred in 594 (12·0%) participants at an incidence rate of 2·4 per 100 person-years in the dulaglutide group and in 663 (13·4%) participants at an incidence rate of 2·7 per 100 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·79–0·99; p=0·026). All-cause mortality did not differ between groups (536 [10·8%] in the dulaglutide group vs 592 [12·0%] in the placebo group; HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·80–1·01; p=0·067). 2347 (47·4%) participants assigned to dulaglutide reported a gastrointestinal adverse event during follow-up compared with 1687 (34·1%) participants assigned to placebo (p&lt;0·0001). Interpretation: Dulaglutide could be considered for the management of glycaemic control in middle-aged and older people with type 2 diabetes with either previous cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors.

"Children’s Mental Health Need and Expenditures in Ontario: Findings from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study [Besoins et d?penses de sant? mentale des enfants en Ontario : r?sultats de l’?tude sur la sant? des jeunes Ontariens 2014]","2019","Objective: To estimate the alignment between the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS) expenditures for children’s mental health services and population need, and to quantify the value of adjusting for need in addition to population size in formula-based expenditure allocations. Two need definitions are used: “assessed need,” as the presence of a mental disorder, and “perceived need,” as the subjective perception of a mental health problem. Methods: Children’s mental health need and service contact estimates (from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study), expenditure data (from government administrative data), and population counts (from the 2011 Canadian Census) were combined to generate formula-based expenditure allocations based on 1) population size and 2) need (population size adjusted for levels of need). Allocations were compared at the service area and region level and for the 2 need definitions (assessed and perceived). Results: Comparisons were made for 13 of 33 MCYS service areas and all 5 regions. The percentage of MCYS expenditure reallocation needed to achieve an allocation based on assessed need was 25.5% at the service area level and 25.6% at the region level. Based on perceived need, these amounts were 19.4% and 27.2%, respectively. The value of needs-adjustment ranged from 8.0% to 22.7% of total expenditures, depending on the definition of need. Conclusion: Making needs adjustments to population counts using population estimates of children’s mental health need (assessed or perceived) provides additional value for informing and evaluating allocation decisions. This study provides much-needed and current information about the match between expenditures and children’s mental health need. ?

"Key attributes of integrated community-based youth service hubs for mental health: A scoping review","2019","Background: Community-based, integrated youth service hubs have the potential to address some of the longstanding issues with mental health services for youth, including problems with access and system fragmentation. Better understanding of these approaches, particularly efforts to create a single point of entry to comprehensive, evidence-based services through youth service hubs, is needed to help guide future implementation and evaluation. This scoping review identifies the key principles and characteristics of these models of care, as well as the state of the literature, particularly with regard to implementation and replicability. Method: Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched for material from 2001 to 2019, with diverse search terms capturing the concept of ""integrated"" or ""one-stop shop"" youth mental health services. Title/abstract and full text review were conducted, as well as additional focused searching. After screening 4891 texts at the title/abstract level and 496 at the full-text level, 110 documents were included for data extraction. Results: Several integrated care hub models for youth mental health services and related frameworks were identified internationally, largely in high-income countries. Common principles included an emphasis on rapid access to care and early intervention, youth and family engagement, youth-friendly settings and services, evidence-informed approaches, and partnerships and collaboration. Program characteristics also revealed similarities (e.g., providing evidence-informed or evidence-based services in youth-friendly spaces), with some differences (e.g., care coordination methods, types of service providers), potentially attributable to lack of available information about key ingredients. Outcome research was limited, with few rigorous evaluations of youth outcomes. Moreover, sufficient information for replication, community evaluation of feasibility or actual implementation was rarely provided. Conclusion: Internationally, integrated youth service hubs were found to share common key principles, while providing comprehensive services to youth with mental health difficulties. There is a great need for common language and measurement framework to facilitate replication, rigorous evaluation of outcomes, knowledge exchange, and dissemination of findings. ? 2019 The Author(s).","anxiety; behavior disorder; borderline state; cognitive behavioral therapy; community care; counseling; disease severity; distress syndrome; family planning; health care access; health care policy; health care quality; health promotion; high risk patient; human; integrated health care system; mental health; mindfulness; mood disorder; patient satisfaction; peer group; personal experience; primary medical care; priority journal; problem solving; psychoeducation; psychosis; psychosocial rehabilitation; reproductive health; Review; risk assessment; sexual health; smoking cessation; social competence; social media; telemedicine"
"A Seat at the Table: Designing an Activity-Based Community Advisory Committee With People Living With HIV Who Use Drugs","2019","Recently, scholars have begun to critically interrogate the way community participation functions discursively within community-based participatory research (CBPR) and raise questions about its function and limits. Community advisory committees (CACs) are often used within CBPR as one way to involve community members in research from design to dissemination. However, CACs may not always be designed in ways that are accessible for communities experiencing the intersections of complex health issues and marginalization. This article draws on our experience designing and facilitating Research Rec’—a flexible, and activity-based CAC for a project about the acute-care hospital stays of people living with HIV who use drugs. Using Research Rec’ as a case study, we reflect on ethical, methodological, and pedagogical considerations for designing and facilitating CACs for this community. We discuss how to critically reflect on the design and facilitation of advisory committees, and community engagement processes in CBPR more broadly. ?

"Effects of Trypanocidal Treatment on Echocardiographic Parameters in Chagas Cardiomyopathy and Prognostic Value of Wall Motion Score Index: A BENEFIT Trial Echocardiographic Substudy","2019","Background: Serial echocardiographic studies in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy are scarce. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether therapy with benznidazole modifies the progression of cardiac impairment and to identify baseline echocardiographic parameters related to prognosis. Methods: A prospective substudy was conducted in 1,508 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy randomized to benznidazole or placebo, who underwent two-dimensional echocardiography at enrollment, 2 years, and final follow-up (5.4 years). Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV wall motion score index (WMSI), indexed left atrial volume, and chamber dimensions were collected and correlated to all-cause death and a composite hard outcome using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: At enrollment, most patients had normal chamber dimensions, and 70.5% had preserved LV ejection fractions. During follow-up, all chamber dimensions increased similarly in both treatment arms. LV ejection fraction was comparably reduced (55.7 ± 12.7% to 52.1 ± 14.6% vs 56.3 ± 12.7% to 52.8 ± 14.1%) and LV WMSI similarly increased (1.31 ± 0.41 to 1.49 ± 0.03 and 1.27 ± 0.38 to 1.51 ± 0.03) for the benznidazole and placebo groups, respectively (P >.05). A higher baseline LV WMSI was identified in subjects who died compared with those alive at final echocardiography (1.76 ± 0.517 vs 1.271 ± 0.393, P <.0001). There was a significant (P <.0001) graded increase in the risk for the composite outcome with worsening LV WMSI (hazard ratios, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.69–3.06] and 6.42 [95% CI, 4.94–8.33]) and also of death (hazard ratios, 2.45 [95% CI, 1.62–3.71] and 8.99 [95% CI, 6.3–12.82]) for 1 < LV WMSI < 1.5 and LV WMSI > 1.5, respectively. Both LV WMSI and indexed left atrial volume remained independent predictors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Trypanocidal treatment had no effect on echocardiographic progression of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy over 5.4 years. Despite normal global LV systolic function, regional wall motion abnormalities and indexed left atrial volume identified patients at higher risk for hard adverse clinical outcomes. ? 2018 American Society of Echocardiography","benznidazole; placebo; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular parameters; Chagas cardiomyopathy; controlled study; echocardiography; female; follow up; heart left atrium; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle wall motion; human; major clinical study; male; prognosis; prospective study; two dimensional echocardiography; wall motion score index"
"Use of gabapentin in the treatment of substance use and psychiatric disorders: A systematic review","2019","Objective: Gabapentin (GBP) is an anticonvulsant medication that is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS) and posttherapeutic neuralgia. GBP is commonly prescribed off-label for psychiatric disorders despite the lack of strong evidence. However, there is growing evidence that GBP may be effective and clinically beneficial in both psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. This review aimed to perform a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed published literature on the efficacy of GBP in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. Methods: This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE literature databases were screened and filtered by using specific search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The full texts of selected studies were subsequently retrieved and reviewed. The search terms generated 2,604 results from the databases. After excluding all duplicates, 1,088 citations were left. Thereafter, we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria; a total of 54 papers were retained for detailed review. Results: This literature review concludes that GBP appears to be effective in the treatment of various forms of anxiety disorders. It shows some effectiveness in bipolar disorder as an adjunctive therapeutic agent, while the evidence for monotherapy is inconclusive. In substance use disorders, GBP is effective for acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) with mild to moderate severity; it reduces cravings, improves the rate of abstinence, and delays return to heavy drinking. GBP may have some therapeutic potential in the treatment of opioid addiction and cannabis dependence, but there is limited evidence to support its use. No significant benefit of GBP has been conclusively observed in the treatment of OCD, PTSD, depression, or cocaine and amphetamine abuse. Conclusion: GBP appears to be effective in some forms of anxiety disorders such as preoperative anxiety, anxiety in breast cancer survivors, and social phobia. GBP has shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence. However, the literature suggests that GBP is effective as an adjunctive medication rather than a monotherapy. More clinical trials with larger patient populations are needed to support gabapentin's off-label use in psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. It is worth noting that numerous clinical studies that are discussed in this review are open-label trials, which are inherently less rigorously analyzed. Therefore, more extensive investigations are required to examine not only the efficacy of GBP, but also its safety and tolerance.

"Prognostic accuracy of the Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS) and the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) among hospitalized patients assessed by a rapid response team","2019","Background: Rapid response teams (RRTs) respond to hospitalized patients experiencing clinical deterioration and help determine subsequent management and disposition. We sought to evaluate and compare the prognostic accuracy of the Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS) and the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) for prediction of in-hospital mortality following RRT activation. We secondarily evaluated a subgroup of patients with suspected infection. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data (2012-2016) of consecutive RRT patients from two hospitals. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We calculated the number needed to examine (NNE), which indicates the number of patients that need to be evaluated in order to detect one future death. Results: Five thousand four hundred ninety-one patients were included, of whom 1837 (33.5%) died in-hospital. Mean age was 67.4 years, and 51.6% were male. A HEWS above the low-risk threshold (? 5) had a sensitivity of 75.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.9-77.9) and specificity of 67.6% (95% CI 66.1-69.1) for mortality, with a NNE of 1.84. A NEWS2 above the low-risk threshold (? 5) had a sensitivity of 84.5% (95% CI 82.8-86.2), and specificity of 49.0% (95% CI: 47.4-50.7), with a NNE of 2.20. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.75-0.77) for HEWS and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.71-0.74) for NEWS2. Among suspected infection patients (n = 1708), AUROC for HEWS was 0.79 (95% CI 0.76-0.81) and for NEWS2, 0.75 (95% CI 0.73-0.78). Conclusions: The HEWS has comparable clinical accuracy to NEWS2 for prediction of in-hospital mortality among RRT patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; comorbidity; female; Hamilton Early Warning Score; hospital mortality; hospital patient; human; low risk population; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; mortality rate; National Early Warning Score 2; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognostic assessment; prospective study; rapid response team; retrospective study; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; area under the curve; hospitalization; intensive care unit; methodology; middle aged; nonparametric test; Ontario; organization and management; prognosis; proportional hazards model; receiver operating characteristic; rescue personnel; statistical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Area Under Curve; Emergency Responders; Female; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Statistics, Nonparametric"
"Persistence of symptoms after cognitive therapies is associated with childhood trauma: A six months follow-up study","2019","This study aims to assess the effect of childhood trauma on the outcomes of brief cognitive therapies for major depressive disorder. This is a follow-up clinical study nested in a randomized clinical trial of cognitive therapies. Sixty-one patients were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and six-month follow-up. The study showed that brief cognitive therapies improved depressive and anxious symptoms at post-intervention and six-month follow-up. Higher childhood trauma scores at baseline were significantly associated with higher severity of depressive and anxious symptoms at six-month follow-up. Longer courses of psychotherapy may be needed to improve the long-lasting effects of traumatic experiences. ? 2019","adult; anxiety; Article; childhood trauma; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; depression; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; Hamilton Anxiety Scale; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; major clinical study; male; narrative therapy; priority journal; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial; symptom; treatment duration; treatment outcome; childhood trauma survivor; cognitive behavioral therapy; major depression; middle aged; procedures; psychology; short term psychotherapy; treatment outcome; Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Anxiety; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychotherapy, Brief; Treatment Outcome"
"Cannabis-Associated Asthma and Allergies","2019","Inhalation of cannabis smoke is its most common use and the pulmonary complications of its use may be the single most common form of drug-induced pulmonary disease worldwide. However, the role of cannabis consumption in asthma patients and allergic clinical situations still remains controversial. To review the evidence of asthma and allergic diseases associated with the use of marijuana, we conducted a search of English, Spanish, and Portuguese medical using the search terms asthma, allergy, marijuana, marihuana, and cannabis. Entries made between January 1970 and March 2017 were retrieved. Several papers have shown the relationship between marijuana use and increase in asthma and other allergic diseases symptoms, as well as the increased frequency of medical visits. This narrative review emphasizes the importance to consider cannabis as a precipitating factor for acute asthma and allergic attacks in clinical practice. Although smoking of marijuana may cause respiratory symptoms, there is a need for more studies to elucidate many aspects in allergic asthma patients, especially considering the long-term use of the drug. These patients should avoid using marijuana and be oriented about individual health risks, possible dangers of second-hand smoke exposure, underage use, safe storage, and the over smoking of marijuana. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","cannabis; allergen; cannabis; medical cannabis; plant antigen; street drug; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic rhinitis; allergy; anaphylaxis; asthma; cannabis smoking; cannabis use; clinical practice; contact urticaria; disease association; drug eruption; eczema; food allergy; health hazard; human; passive smoking; respiratory tract disease; Review; systematic review; asthma; global health; health care delivery; hypersensitivity; immunology; prevalence; Allergens; Antigens, Plant; Asthma; Cannabis; Delivery of Health Care; Global Health; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Marijuana Smoking; Medical Marijuana; Prevalence; Street Drugs"
"Resumption of anticoagulant therapy after anticoagulant-related gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Introduction: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is permanently discontinued in up to 50% of patients following a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. A previous meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of thromboembolism and death, and a non-statistically significant increased risk of re-bleeding associated with resumption. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to determine the risks of recurrent GI bleeding, thromboembolism, and death in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not. Materials and methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for new references from January 2014 to September 2017. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies involving adults with OAC-related GI bleeding were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's ROBINS-I tool. Pooled relative risk (RR) ratios were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: We identified 12 observational studies involving 3098 patients. There was an increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48, I 2 = 0%, 11 studies), and a reduced risk of thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68, I 2 = 59.8%, 9 studies) and death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70, I 2 = 71.8%, 8 studies) in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not. Eleven studies were judged to be at serious risk of bias due to confounding. Conclusions: Resuming OAC after OAC-related GI bleeding appears to be associated with an increase in recurrent GI bleeding, but a reduction in thromboembolism and death. Further prospective data are needed to identify patients for whom the net clinical benefit favours OAC resumption and the optimal timing of resumption. ? 2019","anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; Article; death; follow up; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; human; meta analysis; mortality; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; systematic review; thromboembolism; aged; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; male; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anticoagulants; Female; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Male"
"Using digital health to support best practices: Impact of MRI ordering guidelines embedded within an electronic referral solution","2019","Background: Between 2003 and 2012, the number of MRIs performed in Canada more than doubled to 1.7 million [1]. According to a 2010 Health Council of Canada report nearly 30% of MRIs were inappropriately ordered [2]. The use of diagnostic imaging referral guidelines has been shown to improve the appropriateness of imaging orders [3, 4]. Objectives: To identify the number of unnecessary pre-consult MRIs ordered for patients with knee pain. As well, the impact that new evidence-based clinical decision support (DS) guidelines embedded within the referral form has had on the number of unnecessary MRIs was investigated. Methods: This study employed a retrospective design approach. Charts of all knee pain patients over the age of 55 who were referred for consultation to the 5 participating orthopedic surgeons during the study period were reviewed by three medical students. Results: 270 patient charts were included in this study. MRI was ordered for 60 patients with only 56.7% having had a prior X-ray. Of the 60 ordered MRIs, 50 (84%) were considered inappropriate, while only 10 (16%) were appropriate. Our results were compared to previous results of a quality improvement study implemented at the same clinic. A substantial reduction of 12% in the number of pre-consult MRIs and a 5% increase in the number of ordered X-rays before consultation was demonstrated. Conclusion: This work highlights the impact of including DS tools within an electronic referral form to support clinical best practices. ? 2019 American Psychological Association Inc.

"Prognostic Accuracy of the HEART Score for Prediction of Major Adverse Cardiac Events in Patients Presenting With Chest Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Objective: The HEART score has been proposed for emergency department (ED) prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). We sought to summarize all studies assessing the prognostic accuracy of the HEART score for prediction of MACE in adult ED patients presenting with chest pain. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception through May 2018 and included studies using the HEART score for the prediction of short-term MACE in adult patients presenting to the ED with chest pain. The main outcome was short-term (i.e., 30-day or 6-week) incidence of MACE. We secondarily evaluated the prognostic accuracy of the HEART score for prediction of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI). Where available, accuracy of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score was determined. Results: We included 30 studies (n = 44,202) in analysis. A HEART score above the low-risk threshold (?4) had a sensitivity of 95.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]?= 93.3%–97.5%) and specificity of 44.6% (95% CI?= 38.8%–50.5%) for MACE. A high-risk HEART score (?7) had a sensitivity of 39.5% (95% CI?= 31.6%–48.1%) and specificity of 95.0% (95% CI?= 92.6%–96.6%) for MACE, whereas a TIMI score above the low-risk threshold (?2) had a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI?= 80.2%–92.8%) and specificity of 48.1% (95% CI?= 38.9%–57.5%) for MACE. A high-risk TIMI score (?6) was 2.8% sensitive (95% CI?= 0.8%–9.6%), but 99.6% (95% CI?= 98.5%–99.9%) specific for MACE. A HEART score ? 4 had a sensitivity of 95.0% (95% CI?= 87.2%–98.2%) for prediction of mortality and 97.5% (95% CI?= 93.7%–99.0%) for prediction of MI. Conclusions: The HEART score has excellent performance for prediction of MACE (particularly mortality and MI) in chest pain patients and should be the primary clinical decision instrument used for the risk stratification of this patient population. ? 2018 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","troponin T; blood clot lysis; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; Cochrane Library; Embase; emergency ward; heart infarction; high risk patient; human; major adverse cardiac event; Medline; meta analysis; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; quality control; Review; Scopus; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; thorax pain; Web of Science; adult; aged; female; heart infarction; hospital emergency service; incidence; male; middle aged; mortality; organization and management; predictive value; procedures; risk assessment; thorax pain; Adult; Aged; Chest Pain; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Assessment"
"Computer-aided detection for breast cancer screening in clinical settings: Scoping review","2019","Background: With the growth of machine learning applications, the practice of medicine is evolving. Computer-aided detection (CAD) is a software technology that has become widespread in radiology practices, particularly in breast cancer screening for improving detection rates at earlier stages. Many studies have investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CAD, but its implementation in clinical settings has been largely overlooked. Objective: The aim of this scoping review was to summarize recent literature on the adoption and implementation of CAD during breast cancer screening by radiologists and to describe barriers and facilitators for CAD use. Methods: The MEDLINE database was searched for English, peer-reviewed articles that described CAD implementation, including barriers or facilitators, in breast cancer screening and were published between January 2010 and March 2018. Articles describing the diagnostic accuracy of CAD for breast cancer detection were excluded. The search returned 526 citations, which were reviewed in duplicate through abstract and full-text screening. Reference lists and cited references in the included studies were reviewed. Results: A total of nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles showed that there is a tradeoff between the facilitators and barriers for CAD use. Facilitators for CAD use were improved breast cancer detection rates, increased profitability of breast imaging, and time saved by replacing double reading. Identified barriers were less favorable perceptions of CAD compared to double reading by radiologists, an increase in recall rates of patients for further testing, increased costs, and unclear effect on patient outcomes. Conclusions: There is a gap in the literature between CAD's well-established diagnostic accuracy and its implementation and use by radiologists. Generally, the perceptions of radiologists have not been considered and details of implementation approaches for adoption of CAD have not been reported. The cost-effectiveness of CAD has not been well established for breast cancer screening in various populations. Further research is needed on how to best facilitate CAD in radiology practices in order to optimize patient outcomes, and the views of radiologists need to be better considered when advancing CAD use. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Quality of Life in Patients with Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Hypofractionated vs Conventional Radiotherapy: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial","2019","Importance: Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) would be more convenient for men with low-risk prostate cancer and cost less than conventional radiotherapy (CRT) as long as HRT is noninferior to CRT in terms of survival and quality of life (QOL) is not found to be worse. Objective: To assess differences in QOL between men with low-risk prostate cancer who are treated with HRT vs CRT. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, men with low-risk prostate cancer were enrolled from sites within the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trials Network in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. Interventions: Random assignment to CRT (73.8 Gy in 41 fractions over 8.2 weeks) or to HRT (70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks). Main Outcomes and Measures: Quality of life was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite questionnaire measuring bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal domains; the 25-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist measuring anxiety and depression; and the EuroQol-5 Dimension questionnaire measuring global QOL. All data were collected at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 60 months. Change scores were compared between treatment arms using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A significance level of.0125 to adjust for multiple comparisons was used for an overall 2-sided type 1 error of.05. Clinical significance was determined for the Expanded Prostate Index Composite change scores by an effect size of 0.5. Results: Of 1092 patients analyzable for the primary end point, 962 (mean [SD] age, 66.6 [7.4] years) consented to the QOL component. No statistically significant differences with regard to baseline characteristics nor any of the QOL baseline domains were measured between arms. There were no differences in change score between arms with respect to any of the Expanded Prostate Index Composite questionnaire domain scores except at 12 months when the HRT arm had a larger decline than the CRT arm in the bowel domain (mean score, -7.5 vs -3.7, respectively; P<.001), but it did not reach clinical significance (effect size = 0.29). There were no differences between arms at any time point for the Hopkins Symptom Checklist nor EuroQol-5 Dimension questionnaire. Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with HRT is noninferior to CRT in men with low-risk prostate cancer in terms of disease-free survival and, as shown in the present study, in prostate cancer-specific (eg, bowel, bladder, sexual) and general QOL, as well as in anxiety and depression. This study provides evidence to affirm that HRT is a practice standard for men with low-risk prostate cancer.

"Host-Specific Adaptive Diversification of Crohn's Disease-Associated Adherent-Invasive Escherichia coli","2019","Crohn's disease is associated with adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), but the factors promoting AIEC colonization are unclear. Elhenawy et al. show that murine host-to-host transmission selects for adaptive diversification of AIEC, with enhanced bacterial motility and acetate metabolism. E. coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients similarly exhibit these adaptive features. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease influenced by bacteria. Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is associated with CD, yet the adaptations facilitating AIEC gut colonization are unknown. AIEC isolates exhibit high genetic diversity, suggesting strains evolve independently across different gut environments. We tracked the adaptive evolution of AIEC in a murine model of chronic colonization across multiple hosts and transmission events. We detected evolved lineages that outcompeted the ancestral strain in the host through independent mechanisms. One lineage was hypermotile because of a mobile insertion sequence upstream of the master flagellar regulator, flhDC, which enhanced AIEC invasion and establishment of a mucosal niche. Another lineage outcompeted the ancestral strain through improved use of acetate, a short-chain fatty acid in the gut. The presence of hypermotile and acetate-consuming lineages discriminated E. coli isolated from CD patients from healthy controls, suggesting an evolutionary trajectory that distinguishes AIEC from commensal E. coli. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","acetic acid; flagellin; short chain fatty acid; adherent invasive Escherichia coli; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterial flagellum; bacterial transmission; bacterium isolation; clinical article; controlled study; convergent evolution; Crohn disease; disease association; Escherichia coli; female; gene insertion sequence; host interaction; host pathogen interaction; human; human tissue; intestinal dysmotility; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; priority journal; species invasion; adaptation; animal; C57BL mouse; Caco-2 cell line; classification; Crohn disease; disease model; disease transmission; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli infection; gastrointestinal tract; genetic variation; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Caco-2 Cells; Crohn Disease; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Genetic Variation; Humans; Mice, Inbred C57BL"
"Score Distributions of the Balance Outcome Measure for Elder Rehabilitation (BOOMER) in Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Vertebral Fracture","2019","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the Balance Outcome Measure for Elder Rehabilitation (BOOMER) in community-dwelling women 65 years and older with vertebral fracture and to describe score distributions and potential ceiling and floor effects. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of baseline data from the Build Better Bones with Exercise randomized controlled trial using the BOOMER. A total of 141 women with osteoporosis and radiographically confirmed vertebral fracture were included. Concurrent validity and internal consistency were assessed in comparison to the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Normality and ceiling/floor effects of total BOOMER scores and component test items were also assessed. Exploratory analyses of assistive aid use and falls history were performed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Tests for concurrent validity demonstrated moderate correlation between total BOOMER and SPPB scores. The BOOMER component tests showed modest internal consistency. Substantial ceiling effect and nonnormal score distributions were present among overall sample and those not using assistive aids for total BOOMER scores, although scores were normally distributed for those using assistive aids. The static standing with eyes closed test demonstrated the greatest ceiling effects of the component tests, with 92% of participants achieving a maximal score. CONCLUSIONS: While the BOOMER compares well with the SPPB in community-dwelling women with vertebral fractures, researchers or clinicians considering using the BOOMER in similar or higher-functioning populations should be aware of the potential for ceiling effects.",""
"CONSORT extension for reporting N-of-1 trials for traditional Chinese medicine (CENT for TCM): Recommendations, explanation and elaboration","2019","Background: N-of-1 trial is a desired and appropriate approach to assessing the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions. There have been an increasing number of N-of-1 trials for TCM published. However, a lack of preferred reporting guidance led in the general poor reporting quality of these trials. Due to the unique characteristics of TCM, the working group developed this CONSORT Extension for reporting N-of-1 Trials for Traditional Chinese Medicine (CENT for TCM) to assist TCM researchers in reporting N-of-1 trials for TCM. Methods: We registered CENT for TCM at the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network (available at equator-network.org). The development was a comprehensive process through collection of the initial reporting items, two-round scientific Delphi consensus survey with 17 panelists, revision and formation of the final reporting checklist. Results: The checklist includes 25 items within six domains, eight items in which were extended and elaborated on the items of the CENT 2015 checklist. Explanation of the items were listed adequately considering the nature of TCM, introducing the concept of TCM syndrome differentiation and TCM interventions. Conclusions: CENT for TCM can be used to assess the completeness of the reporting of N-of-1 trials for TCM. The working group expect that CENT for TCM could be a practical tool to enhance the comprehensiveness and transparency of the design, implementation and reporting of N-of-1 trials for TCM. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article; Chinese medicine; Chinese medicine intervention; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial (topic); clinical trial protocol; conceptual framework; consensus; Delphi study; health survey; information processing; methodology; patient safety; practice guideline; standardization; traditional Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation; checklist; Chinese medicine; human; methodology; research; Checklist; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Research Design; Research Report"
"Robust Method for High-Throughput Screening of Fatty Acids by Multisegment Injection-Nonaqueous Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry with Stringent Quality Control","2019","High-throughput screening methods for fatty acid (FA) determination are urgently needed due to their critical biochemical roles in human health while serving as biomarkers of habitual diet and chronic disease risk assessment. Herein, we introduce multisegment injection-nonaqueous-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-NACE-MS) as a multiplexed separation platform for analysis of more than 20 nonesterified FAs in human serum or plasma. Optimization of experimental conditions was required to overcome major technical hurdles in MSI-NACE-MS prior to a rigorous method validation and intermethod comparison with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Following a simple methyl-tert-butyl ether extraction, seven serum extracts were analyzed directly by MSI-NACE-MS within a single run (<4 min/sample) under negative ion mode detection that incorporates stringent measures for quality control, including batch correction adjustment. Overall, excellent technical variance (RSD = 10%) and good mutual agreement was demonstrated for 12 nonesterified FAs consistently measured in 50 serum samples analyzed independently by MSI-NACE-MS and GC/MS within the same laboratory (mean bias = 24%, n = 600). Also, total hydrolyzed plasma FAs using MSI-NACE-MS was compared to mean concentrations reported from a NIST standard reference material as an interlaboratory method validation (mean bias = 15%, n = 20). Accurate prediction of ion migration behavior in CE also supports structural elucidation of FAs in conjunction with high resolution MS. For the first time, we demonstrate that MSI-NACE-MS offers a rapid yet robust platform for direct quantification of circulating FAs using volume-restricted blood specimens that expands metabolome coverage to encompass anionic classes of lipids as required for large-scale epidemiological studies. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","Body fluids; Capillary electrophoresis; Chromatographic analysis; Diagnosis; Drug products; Fatty acids; Gas chromatography; Health risks; Mass spectrometry; Negative ions; Risk assessment; Throughput; Epidemiological studies; Experimental conditions; Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry; High throughput screening; High throughput screening methods; Methyl tert butyl ether; Non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis; Structural elucidation; Quality control"
"Women's freedom of movement and participation in psychosocial support groups: Qualitative study in northern India","2019","Background: Depression, the world's leading cause of disability, disproportionately affects women. Women in India, one of the most gender unequal countries worldwide, face systemic gender disadvantage that significantly increases the risk of common mental disorders. This study's objective was to examine the factors influencing women's participation in psychosocial support groups, within an approach where community members work together to collectively strengthen their community's mental health. Methods: This community-based qualitative study was conducted from May to July 2016, across three peri-urban sites in Dehradun district, Uttarakhand, Northern India. Set within an NGO-run mental health project, data were collected through focus group discussions with individuals involved in psychosocial support groups including women with psychosocial disabilities as well as caregivers (N = 10, representing 59 women), and key informant interviews (N = 8) with community members and mental health professionals. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: The principal barrier to participating in psychosocial support groups was restrictions on women's freedom of movement. Women in the community are not normally permitted to leave home, unless going to market or work, making it difficult for women to leave their home to participate in the groups. The restrictions emanated from the overall community's attitude toward gender relations, the women's own internalized gender expectations, and most significantly, the decision-making power of husbands and mothers-in-law. Other factors including employment and education shaped women's ability to participate in psychosocial support groups; however, the role of these additional factors must be understood in connection to a gender order limiting women's freedom of movement. Conclusions: Mental health access and gender inequality are inseparable in the context of Northern India, and women's mental health cannot be addressed without first addressing underlying gender relations. Community-based mental health programs are an effective tool and can be used to strengthen communities collectively; however, attention towards the gender constraints that restrict women's freedom of movement and their ability to access care is required. To our knowledge, this is the first study to clearly document and analyze the connection between access to community mental health services in South Asia and women's freedom of movement. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; Asia; attitude; decision making; depression; employment; family; female; freedom; gender identity; human; human relation; India; information processing; mental disease; mental health; mental health service; patient participation; psychology; qualitative research; self help; social participation; spouse; statistics and numerical data; women's health; Adult; Asia; Attitude; Community Mental Health Services; Decision Making; Depression; Employment; Family; Female; Focus Groups; Freedom; Gender Identity; Humans; India; Interpersonal Relations; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Patient Participation; Qualitative Research; Self-Help Groups; Social Participation; Spouses; Women's Health"
"Cannabis Legalization in Canada: The Public Health Approach We Did Not Get","2019","Objectives:The reader will understand the successes and shortfalls of the government's stated intention to take ""a public health approach"" to cannabis legalization.Method:Aspects of a public health approach to cannabis legalization were identified from the drug policy literature and from advice provided to government by health policy organizations. These aspects were compared to the output of federal legislation to identify successes and shortfalls.Results:Public health input had some influence on legislation. However, the legislation compromised a public health approach on critical issues such as industry models, minimum age for use, product promotion practices, product types, consumer protection, and holding industry accountable to regulatory provisions.Conclusions:Cannabis legalization can be improved to better reflect a public health priority. Given that legalization will be a process and not a solitary event, this article will be relevant tohealthcare providers and public health authorities who wish to advocate with various levels of government to mitigate the harms andinternational audiences observing the Canadian experiment. ? 2019 by the Canadian Society of Addiction Medicine.",""
"Living strategies for disability in men ageing with HIV in Ontario, Canada: a longitudinal qualitative study","2019","OBJECTIVES: To examine the living strategies used by older men living with HIV to deal with the episodic nature of disability and associated uncertainty, over time. DESIGN: Qualitative longitudinal study in which men living with HIV were interviewed on four occasions over 20 months. SETTING: Men were recruited from HIV community organisations in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: 14 men with a median age of 57.5 years and median time since diagnosis of 21.5 years. RESULTS: Five themes depict the living strategies used to deal with the episodic nature of disability and uncertainty over time. Actively engaging in problem-solving by prioritising and modifying activities and avoiding stress, advocating for support, being positive and future oriented, engaging in healthy pursuits and providing social support to others helped men to mitigate their disability. By following participants over time, we were able to gather insights into triggers of episodes of disability, and perceptions of the success of implementing their living strategies and avoiding uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Participants used living strategies to deal with uncertainty and mitigate episodes of disability over time. This study supports the importance of programmes that promote self-management for older men living with HIV through helping them identify triggers of disability, set realistic goals and problem-solve. These may help build self-efficacy, increase sense of control, and decrease feelings of uncertainty and episodes of disability. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

"Effects of exercise interventions on cardiovascular health in individuals with chronic, motor complete spinal cord injury: Protocol for a randomised controlled trial [Cardiovascular Health/Outcomes: Improvements Created by Exercise and education in SCI (CHOICES) Study]","2019","Introduction Recent studies demonstrate that cardiovascular diseases and associated complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Abnormal arterial stiffness, defined by a carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) ?10 m/s, is a recognised risk factor for heart disease in individuals with SCI. There is a paucity of studies assessing the efficacy of conventional training modalities on arterial stiffness and other cardiovascular outcomes in this population. Therefore, this study aims to compare the efficacy of arm cycle ergometry training (ACET) and body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) on reducing arterial stiffness in individuals with chronic motor complete, high-level (above the sixth thoracic segment) SCI. Methods and analysis This is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, clinical trial. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) into either ACET or BWSTT groups. Sixty participants with chronic (>1 year) SCI will be recruited from three sites in Canada (Vancouver, Toronto and Hamilton). Participants in each group will exercise three times per week up to 30 min and 60 min for ACET and BWSTT, respectively, over the period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure will be change in arterial stiffness (cfPWV) from baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include comprehensive assessments of: (1) cardiovascular parameters, (2) autonomic function, (3) body composition, (4) blood haematological and metabolic profiles, (5) cardiorespiratory fitness and (6) quality of life (QOL) and physical activity outcomes. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months (only QOL and physical activity outcomes). Statistical analyses will apply linear-mixed modelling to determine the training (time), group (ACET vs BWSTT) and interaction (time × group) effects on all outcomes. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from all three participating sites. Primary and secondary outcome data will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and widely disseminated. Trial registration number NCT01718977; Pre-results. Trial status Recruitment for this study began on January 2013 and the first participant was randomized on April 2013. Recruitment stopped on October 2018. ?

"Effect of Patient-Centered Transitional Care Services on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for Heart Failure: The PACT-HF Randomized Clinical Trial","2019","Importance: Health care services that support the hospital-to-home transition can improve outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Objective: To test the effectiveness of the Patient-Centered Care Transitions in HF transitional care model in patients hospitalized for HF. Design, Setting, and Participants: Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial of 2494 adults hospitalized for HF across 10 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from February 2015 to March 2016, with follow-up until November 2016. Interventions: Hospitals were randomized to receive the intervention (n = 1104 patients), in which nurse-led self-care education, a structured hospital discharge summary, a family physician follow-up appointment less than 1 week after discharge, and, for high-risk patients, structured nurse homevisits and heart function clinic care were provided to patients, or usual care (n = 1390 patients), in which transitional care was left to the discretion of clinicians. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were hierarchically ordered as composite all-cause readmission, emergency department (ED) visit, or death at 3 months; and composite all-cause readmission or ED visit at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were B-PREPARED score for discharge preparedness (range: 0 [most prepared] to 22 [least prepared]); the 3-Item Care Transitions Measure (CTM-3) for quality of transition (range: 0 [worst transition] to 100 [best transition]); the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) for quality of life (range: 0 [dead] to 1 [full health]); and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY; range: 0 [dead] to 0.5 [full health at 6 months]). Results: Among eligible patients, all 2494 (mean age, 77.7 years; 1258 [50.4%] women) completed the trial. There was no significant difference between the intervention and usual care groups in the first primary composite outcome (545 [49.4%] vs 698 [50.2%] events, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% CI, 0.83-1.19]) or in the second primary composite outcome (304 [27.5%] vs 408 [29.3%] events, respectively; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.73-1.18]). There were significant differences between the intervention and usual care groups in the secondary outcomes of mean B-PREPARED score at 6 weeks (16.6 vs 13.9; difference, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.37-3.92]; P <.001); mean CTM-3 score at 6 weeks (76.5 vs 70.3; difference, 6.16 [95% CI, 0.90-11.43]; P =.02); and mean EQ-5D-5L score at 6 weeks (0.7 vs 0.7; difference, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.11]; P =.02) and 6 months (0.7 vs 0.6; difference, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01-0.12]; P =.02). There was no significant difference in mean QALY between groups at 6 months (0.3 vs 0.3; difference, 0.00 [95% CI,-0.02 to 0.02]; P =.98). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with HF in Ontario, Canada, implementation of a patient-centered transitional care model compared with usual care did not improve a composite of clinical outcomes. Whether this type of intervention could be effective in other health care systems or locations would require further research.

"Early Clinical Outcomes of Hybrid Arch Frozen Elephant Trunk Repair With the Thoraflex Hybrid Graft","2019","Background: Hybrid aortic arch surgery has evolved to include several technical variations, with most including an off-label use of a conventional thoracic endograft. We describe the early clinical outcomes of the Thoraflex Hybrid graft (Vascutek, Glasgow, Scotland) specifically designed for the treatment of complex arch and proximal descending aortic disease. Methods: Between January 2014 and April 2017, 40 consecutive patients (66 ± 14 years of age, 45% women) underwent hybrid aortic arch and frozen elephant trunk repair with the multibranched Thoraflex Hybrid graft at 9 Canadian centers. Surgical indications included transverse arch or proximal descending aortic aneurysm in 100%, acute dissection in 10%, chronic dissection in 43%, and acute aortic rupture in 1 patient. Antegrade cerebral perfusion and moderate hypothermia (24.3 ± 1.8°C) were employed in all cases. Results: All 40 device implants were successful. The 30-day or in-hospital mortality was 5%. Stroke and transient neurological deficits occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively. Two (5%) patients experienced transient spinal cord ischemia—there were no instances of permanent paraplegia. Mean follow-up was 550 ± 328 days and late complications included type A aortic dissection in 1 patient, type B dissection in 2 patients, and further distal endografting in 2 patients. Survival at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years was 95%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. Conclusions: Hybrid aortic arch and frozen elephant trunk repair with the Thoraflex Hybrid graft appears to be associated with good clinical outcomes, despite being early in the learning curve with this graft. Further investigation with this device is warranted to establish its role within the variations of hybrid arch repair. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","polyethylene terephthalate; aged; aortic aneurysm; aortic arch surgery; aortic dissection; aortic rupture; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; brain perfusion; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; delirium; descending aorta; elephant; female; follow up; frozen elephant trunk technique; heart arrhythmia; hospital mortality; human; hybrid; hypothermia; male; paraplegia; priority journal; recurrent laryngeal nerve injury; reoperation; sepsis; spinal cord ischemia; surgical technique; survival; treatment indication; treatment outcome; trunk; blood vessel prosthesis; blood vessel transplantation; cohort analysis; dissecting aneurysm; endovascular surgery; middle aged; mortality; stent; survival rate; thoracic aorta aneurysm; time factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aneurysm, Dissecting; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Cohort Studies; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Stents; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Attitudes of emergency department physicians and nurses toward implementation of an early warning score to identify critically ill patients: Qualitative explanations for failed implementation","2019","Background Sepsis, a common, time-sensitive condition, is sometimes not identified at emergency department (ED) triage. The use of early warning scores has been shown to improve sepsis-related screening in other settings.Objectives Our objective was to elucidate nurse and physician perceptions with the Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS) in combination with the Canadian Triage Acuity Scale.Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nurses, resident physicians and attending physicians to explore perceived feasibility, utility, comfort, barriers, successes, opportunities and accuracy. A constructivist grounded theory approach was used. Transcripts were coded into thematic coding trees.Results The twelve participants did not value the HEWS in the ED because they felt it was not helpful in identifying critically ill patients. We identified five themes; knowledge of sepsis and HEWS, utility of HEWS in emergency triage, utility of HEWS at the bedside, utility in communicating acuity and deterioration, and feasibility and accuracy of data collection. We also found 9 barriers and 7 enablers to the use of early warning score in the ED.Conclusions In our emergency departments, we identified potential barriers to implementation of an early warning score. A pre-existing expertise and lexicon related to critically ill patients lessens the perceived utility of an EWS in the ED. Understanding these cultural barriers needs to be addressed through change theory and implementation science. Copyright ?

"Near-infrared mapping with indocyanine green is associated with an increase in oncological margin length in minimally invasive segmentectomy","2019","Background: Near-infrared fluorescence mapping with indocyanine green dye is a recent advancement in minimally invasive segmental resection. This technique has not yet been reproduced, validated, or objectively evaluated in a large prospective case series. We hypothesized that near-infrared fluorescence mapping is associated with an increased oncological margin distance from the tumor, over and above the best judgment of the surgeon. Methods: This was a phase 2 prospective cohort trial in patients who are undergoing robotic segmentectomy for lung tumors <3 cm. The predicted intersegmental plane was first identified by consensus between 2 thoracic surgeons. The true plane was then mapped by indocyanine green injection. A 7-item binary rating scale was used for the evaluation of feasibility, reproducibility, and added oncological margin distance from the tumor. The margin distance between the tumor and the true plane was compared with the margin distance between the tumor and the predicted plane. Results: Fifty-three patients were enrolled between September 2016 and May 2018 and 31 patients (58.4%) received the planned operation with indocyanine green mapping. In 74.2% of cases (23 out of 31), a score of 7 out of 7 was achieved, indicating the true intersegmental plane identified by indocyanine green mapping was different than the predicted plane identified by the surgeon. In 61.2% (19 out of 31) of those cases, the mean additional margin distance from the tumor to the staple line attributable to the indocyanine green mapping was 2.41 ± 1.6 cm. The overall complication rate was 18.5% (10 out of 53) and there were no deaths. Conclusions: Near-infrared fluorescence mapping in robotic segmentectomy is associated with increased oncological margin length, over and above the best judgment of the surgeon, in the majority cases where it is used. ? 2019 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery","indocyanine green; aged; Article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; fluorescence imaging; human; lung metastasis; lung parenchyma; lung resection; major clinical study; male; minimally invasive surgery; near infrared fluorescence mapping; non small cell lung cancer; operation duration; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; prospective study; robot assisted surgery; segmentectomy; surgical margin; surgical technique; thoracotomy"
"Priority setting for maternal, newborn and child health in Uganda: A qualitative study evaluating actual practice","2019","Background: Despite continued investment, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) indicators in low and middle income countries have remained relatively poor. This could, in part, be explained by inadequate resources to adequately address these problems, inappropriate allocation of the available resources, or lack of implementation of the most effective interventions. Systematic priority setting and resource allocation could contribute to alleviating these limitations. There is a paucity of literature that follows through MNCH prioritization processes to implementation, making it difficult for policy makers to understand the impact of their decision-making on population health. The overall objective of this paper was to describe and evaluate priority setting for maternal, newborn and child health interventions in Uganda. Methods: Fifty-four key informant interviews and a review of policies and media reports were used to describe priority setting for MNCH in Uganda. Kapiriri and Martin's conceptual framework was used to evaluate priority setting for MNCH. Results: There were three main prioritization exercises for maternal, newborn and child health in Uganda. The processes were participatory and were guided by explicit tools, evidence, and criteria, however, the public and the districts were insufficiently involved in the priority setting process. While there were conducive contextual factors including strong political support, implementation was constrained by the presence of competing actors, with varying priorities, an unequal allocation of resources between child health and maternal health interventions, limited financial and human resources, a weak health system and limited institutional capacity. Conclusions: Stronger institutional capacity at the Ministry of Health and equitable engagement of key stakeholders in decision-making processes, especially the public, and implementers, would improve understanding, satisfaction and compliance with the priority setting process. Availability of financial and human resources that are appropriately allocated would facilitate the implementation of well-developed policies. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; conceptual framework; controlled study; decision making; exercise; female; human; interview; low income country; maternal welfare; newborn; population health; qualitative research; satisfaction; Uganda; child; child health; health care organization; health care planning; health services research; maternal child health care; organization and management; pregnancy; qualitative research; Uganda; Child; Child Health; Female; Health Care Rationing; Health Priorities; Health Services Research; Humans; Infant Health; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health; Maternal-Child Health Services; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Uganda"
"Exposure to parental psychopathology and offspring's risk of suicide-related thoughts and behaviours: A systematic review","2019","Aims. The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify and synthesise analytic studies examining the association between exposure to parental psychopathology in childhood and the nature of subsequent suicide-related thoughts (SRT) and suicide-related behaviour (SRB) (severity of ideation, planned/unplanned attempts/lethality) and to describe the direction, and magnitude of associations. The secondary objective was to determine if the associations from the primary objective differ by the type(s) and timing of parental psychopathology, sex/gender of the parent and child and is mediated by child psychiatric symptoms and family functioning.Methods. A systematic review was conducted using guidelines from the PRISMA statement. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, psycINFO, Web of Science and grey literature sources were searched by two reviewers to March, 2017. Studies were included if they examined any parental psychopathology (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria or equivalent) or SRT or SRB and offspring SRT or SRB occurring from birth <25 years of age.Results. Out of 10 231 studies identified, 54 were included for review. Studies were clinically and methodologically heterogeneous with none at low risk of bias (ROB). Nine studies with moderate ROB indicated a significantly increased risk of offspring SRT, suicide attempts (SA) and suicide among those exposed to maternal SA and suicide in childhood or adolescence. In the remaining 45 studies with higher ROB this association persisted. Several studies (67%) did not confirm that the exposure occurred in the offspring's childhood or adolescence. Findings were suggestive of a mediating effect of offspring psychiatric symptoms, however, few studies examined mediation and effect modification of contextual variables.Conclusions. Offspring exposed to maternal SA are at an increased risk of these same behaviours early in life. Prospective attention to the types and timing of maternal and paternal psychopathology and the intermediate pathways to offspring SRT and SRB onset is needed and could have implications for informing modifiable targets for early intervention and prevention. ? 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Article; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; disease association; disease severity; exposure; family functioning; gender; human; mental disease; progeny; risk factor; sex; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; systematic review; adolescent; adult; adult child; child; child of impaired parents; child parent relation; female; male; mental disease; psychology; sex factor; Adolescent; Adult; Adult Children; Child; Child of Impaired Parents; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Psychopathology; Sex Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted"
"Neuroimaging findings as predictors of treatment outcome of psychotherapy in anxiety disorders","2019","Anxiety disorders are the largest group of mental disorders and a leading cause of impairment, implicating in high costs for health systems and society. Effective pharmacological and psychological treatments are available, but a significant fraction of these patients does not respond adequately to these treatments. The objective of this study is to identify neuroimaging findings that could predict response to psychotherapy in anxiety disorders. Methods: The authors reviewed psychotherapy clinical trials with neuroimaging conducted with patients with anxiety disorders. A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE database through PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration's Clinical Trials Register (CENTRAL), PsycINFO and Thomson Reuters's Web of Science. Results: From the studies included in this review, 24 investigated anxiety disorder patients, and findings in the amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula predicted response to psychotherapy in social anxiety disorder. Findings in ACC, hippocampus, insula, dlPFC, amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus (iFG) predicted response to psychotherapy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Limitations: There was great heterogeneity between the included studies regarding neuroimaging techniques and the tasks performed during functional neuroimaging. Conclusion: Neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormalities in hippocampus, amygdala, iFG, uncus and areas linked with emotional regulation (dlPFC and ACC), predict a good outcome to psychotherapy in anxiety disorders. ? 2018","acceptance and commitment therapy; agoraphobia; amygdala; anterior cingulate; anxiety disorder; attention bias modification; brain region; clinical effectiveness; cognitive behavioral therapy; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; functional neuroimaging; generalized anxiety disorder; hippocampus; human; inferior frontal gyrus; insula; intermethod comparison; neuroimaging; panic; predictor variable; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; treatment outcome; treatment response; anxiety disorder; diagnostic imaging; neuroimaging; predictive value; procedures; psychology; psychotherapy; treatment outcome; trends; Anxiety Disorders; Humans; Neuroimaging; Predictive Value of Tests; Psychotherapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome"
"Development and Validation of a Nipple-Specific Scale for the BREAST-Q to Assess Patient-Reported Outcomes following Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy","2019","BACKGROUND: Nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction has become increasingly popular for prophylactic and therapeutic indications. Patient-reported outcomes instruments such as the BREAST-Q provide important information regarding patient satisfaction and aesthetic and functional outcomes. However, a validated patient-reported outcomes scale specifically addressing nipple-related outcomes following nipple-sparing mastectomy is not currently available. METHODS: The authors developed a new scale measuring nipple outcomes by adapting nipple reconstruction questions from the BREAST-Q breast reconstruction module. Patients completed the questions using the think-aloud method and underwent semistructured cognitive interviews to discuss their nipple-sparing mastectomy experience to elicit new concepts. Interviews were coded and additional questions were added based on this analysis after receiving additional input from a multidisciplinary group of breast cancer providers. The final scale was distributed electronically to a larger group with solicitation for any issues that were not addressed in the question set. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the initial questionnaire. Analysis of the cognitive interviews identified nipple sensation, position, projection, scarring, symmetry, and surgical expectations as key content areas. After revising the questionnaire, an additional 35 patients completed it electronically. All respondents felt the questions were clear and no additional issues needed to be addressed. Feedback was used to clarify the instructions for how to respond to the questions if bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy had been performed. CONCLUSIONS: Through qualitative patient interviews and adaptation of existing BREAST-Q questions, appropriate nipple-focused questions were developed to assess outcomes following nipple-sparing mastectomy. Incorporating these questions into patient-reported outcomes assessment of patients undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy can help improve future techniques and optimize outcomes.","adult; aged; breast tumor; conservative treatment; esthetics; female; human; mastectomy; middle aged; nipple; patient satisfaction; patient-reported outcome; procedures; quality of life; reproducibility; sensation; validation study; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Esthetics; Female; Humans; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Nipples; Organ Sparing Treatments; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Sensation"
"Systemic Exposure of Rituximab Increased by Ibrutinib: Pharmacokinetic Results and Modeling Based on the HELIOS Trial","2019","Introduction: In the HELIOS trial, bendamustine/rituximab (BR) plus ibrutinib (BR-I) improved disease outcomes versus BR plus placebo in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Here, we describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) observations, along with modeling to further explore the interaction between ibrutinib and rituximab. Methods: 578 subjects were randomized to ibrutinib or placebo with BR (6?cycles). Ibrutinib PK samples and tumor measurements were obtained from all subjects; a subset was evaluated for bendamustine and rituximab PK. Population rituximab PK was assessed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Results: Dose-normalized plasma concentration-time bendamustine data were comparable between the arms. Systemic rituximab exposure was higher with BR-I versus BR; mean trough serum concentrations were 2- to 3-fold higher in the first three cycles and 1.2- to 1.7-fold higher subsequently. No relevant safety differences were observed. In the modeling, including treatment arm as a categorical covariate and tumor burden as a continuous time-varying covariate on overall rituximab clearance significantly improved fitting of the data. Conclusions: BR-I led to higher dose-normalized systemic rituximab exposure versus BR and more rapid steady-state achievement. The modeling data suggest that rituximab disposition is, at least in part, target mediated. Determining the clinical significance of these findings requires further assessments.

"Diagnosis of elevated intracranial pressure in critically ill adults: Systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","To summarise and compare the accuracy of physical examination, computed tomography (CT), sonography of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), and transcranial Doppler pulsatility index (TCD-PI) for the diagnosis of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in critically ill patients. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Six databases, including Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed, from inception to 1 September 2018. Study selection criteria English language studies investigating accuracy of physical examination, imaging, or non-invasive tests among critically ill patients. The reference standard was ICP of 20 mm Hg or more using invasive ICP monitoring, or intraoperative diagnosis of raised ICP. Data extraction Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool. Summary estimates were generated using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model. Results 40 studies (n=5123) were included. Of physical examination signs, pooled sensitivity and specificity for increased ICP were 28.2% (95% confidence interval 16.0% to 44.8%) and 85.9% (74.9% to 92.5%) for pupillary dilation, respectively; 54.3% (36.6% to 71.0%) and 63.6% (46.5% to 77.8%) for posturing; and 75.8% (62.4% to 85.5%) and 39.9% (26.9% to 54.5%) for Glasgow coma scale of 8 or less. Among CT findings, sensitivity and specificity were 85.9% (58.0% to 96.4%) and 61.0% (29.1% to 85.6%) for compression of basal cisterns, respectively; 80.9% (64.3% to 90.9%) and 42.7% (24.0% to 63.7%) for any midline shift; and 20.7% (13.0% to 31.3%) and 89.2% (77.5% to 95.2%) for midline shift of at least 10 mm. The pooled area under the ROC (AUROC) curve for ONSD sonography was 0.94 (0.91 to 0.96). Patient level data from studies using TCD-PI showed poor performance for detecting raised ICP (AUROC for individual studies ranging from 0.55 to 0.72). Conclusions Absence of any one physical examination feature is not sufficient to rule out elevated ICP. Substantial midline shift could suggest elevated ICP, but the absence of shift cannot rule it out. ONSD sonography might have use, but further studies are needed. Suspicion of elevated ICP could necessitate treatment and transfer, regardless of individual non-invasive tests. Registration PROSPERO CRD42018105642. ? Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"Optimization of rifampin coating on covered Dacron endovascular stent grafts for infected aortic aneurysms","2019","Objective: In the treatment of an infected aorta, open repair and replacement with a rifampin-impregnated Dacron vascular graft decrease the risk of prosthetic graft infections, with several protocols available in the literature. We hypothesize that the same holds true for endovascular aneurysm repair, and after studying and optimizing rifampin solution concentration and incubation period to maximize the coating process of rifampin on Dacron endovascular stent grafts (ESGs), we propose a rapid real-time perioperative protocol. Methods: Several prepared rifampin solutions, including a negative control solution, were used to coat multiple triplicate sets of Dacron endovascular aortic stent grafts at different but set incubation periods. Rifampin elution from the grafts was studied by spectroscopic analysis. Once an optimized solution concentration and incubation time were determined, the elution of rifampin over time from the graft and the graft's surface characteristics were studied by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Results: All coated ESGs with any concentration of prepared rifampin solution, regardless of incubation time, immediately demonstrated a visible bright orange discoloration and subsequently after elution procedures returned to the original noncolored state. At the 25-minute incubation time (standard flush), there was no statistical difference in the amount of rifampin coated to the ESGs with 10-mg/mL, 30-mg/mL, and 60-mg/mL solutions (0.06 ± 0.01, 0.07 ± 0.05, and 0.044 ± 0.01, respectively; P >.05). This was also true for a 10-minute incubation time (express flush) of 10-mg/mL and 60-mg/mL rifampin solution concentrations (0.04 ± 0.007 and 0.066 ± 0.014, respectively; P =.22). The elution-over-time of coated rifampin ESG, although not statistically significant, did seem to plateau and to reach a steady state by 50 hours and was confirmed by surface characteristics using atomic force microscopy. Conclusions: Having studied two variables of rifampin coating techniques to Dacron ESGs, the authors propose a rapid real-time perioperative coating protocol by using a 10-mg/mL rifampin solution for a 10-minute incubation period. As rifampin loosely binds to Dacron ESGs by weak intermolecular forces, a rifampin-coated ESG would need to be inserted in a timely fashion to treat the diseased aorta and to deliver its antibiotic affect. A rapid perioperative coating protocol followed by immediate deployment makes our proposed technique especially useful in an urgent and unstable clinical scenario. Clinical Relevance: In the treatment of an infected aorta, open repair with rifampin-impregnated vascular grafts has been described to minimize the risk of prosthetic graft infections, with several protocols available in the literature. We hypothesize that the same holds true for endovascular aneurysm repair. After studying and optimizing several variables to maximize the coating process of rifampin on Dacron endovascular stent grafts (ESGs), we propose a standardized rapid real-time perioperative protocol especially useful in an urgent and unstable clinical scenario. To further provide greater personalized patient care, future directions to ESG coating may include coating with a broader spectrum antibiotic (eg, piperacillin and tazobactam) as well as testing of antibiotic-coated ESG elution properties in vivo with animal models. ? 2017","polyethylene terephthalate; rifampicin; sodium chloride; antiinfective agent; biocompatible coated material; rifampicin; aortic aneurysm; Article; atomic force microscopy; controlled study; elution; endovascular aneurysm repair; graft infection; human; incubation time; infected aneurysm; priority journal; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; aortic aneurysm; blood vessel prosthesis; blood vessel transplantation; chemistry; comparative study; devices; drug release; endovascular surgery; infected aneurysm; kinetics; materials testing; microbiology; prosthesis design; stent; surface property; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Aneurysm, Infected; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Aortic Aneurysm; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Drug Liberation; Endovascular Procedures; Kinetics; Materials Testing; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Prosthesis Design; Rifampin; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Stents; Surface Properties"
"Maternal and child factors associated with bone length traits in children at 3?years of age","2019","Background: Exposure to sub-optimal maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy has been linked to inadequate in utero bone growth with potential for post-natal deficits, but reported findings are inconsistent. Possible reasons include measurement error in assessing bone length/height, or lack of adjustment for confounding variables such as maternal/infant diet, physical activity and season of birth. The objective of this study was to determine the maternal and child factors associated with bone length traits in children at 3 years of age as part of a longitudinal follow-up of a pregnancy cohort. Methods: Mother-child dyads enrolled in the Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In early Life study were included. Maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Anthropometry, physical activity by questionnaire and dietary assessment by food frequency questionnaire were completed for mothers during pregnancy (27–40 weeks gestation) and for children at 3 years with diet by 3-day food records (Nutritionist Pro). Whole body bone mineral density in mother and child (n = 473) was measured by dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA) at the 3 year visit. A software program was developed using MATLAB to derive bone length measurements from whole body DXA images using 8 long bones of each child. Association between maternal and child variables with offspring bone length was assessed using unadjusted and adjusted multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: In the final adjusted multivariate regression model, factors associated with child bone length were maternal height (p = 0.05), child birth length (p = 0.005) and child weight z-score at 3 years (p < 0.001). No association was observed between maternal serum 25(OH)D concentrations in pregnancy (of which 77% were in normal range) and child bone length. Conclusion: In healthy Canadian mothers and their children, the factors associated with child bone length achieved at 3 years of age appear to be related to genetic traits rather than environmental exposures. Measures of the length of long bones in children using DXA scans may have provided a more accurate assessment of bone length than whole body height measures. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","25 hydroxyvitamin D; anthropometry; Article; birth weight; body height; bone density; bone length; bone mineral; child; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis software; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; follow up; food frequency questionnaire; genetic association; genetic trait; gestational age; human; image analysis; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; long bone; longitudinal study; male; maternal child health care; nutritional assessment; physical activity; pregnancy; preschool child; vitamin blood level"

"Nutritional Considerations for Sport Participation in Children and Adolescents With Obesity","2019","There is a high prevalence of children with obesity who are participating in sports. Appropriate nutritional considerations are important to optimize health and training adaptations. This review focuses on macronutrient recommendations and their effect on weight management and/or benefits for athletic training for children ages 5 to 18 years. Equal distribution of protein intake throughout the day (~25-30 g/meal) and during postexercise recovery is recommended. Special attention should be given to increasing protein intake during breakfast because it is often the meal with the least protein intake. Both postexercise recommendations for protein (~0.3 g/kg of body weight) and carbohydrate (~1.0-1.2 g/kg/h) were not determined in children with obesity, and require future verification. Individual carbohydrate needs of training to meet fuel costs are recommended, but ~200 to 500 g/day of carbohydrate may be required depending on a child’s level of sport participation and competition. Fat intake should follow general recommendations to meet the accepted macronutrient distribution range in children (25% to 35%) and reduce saturated fat intake. No evidence suggests that additional dietary fat modifications would improve training adaptations in children. Longitudinal studies are required to further our understanding of age and sex effects and confirm the appropriate quantity of macronutrients for active children with obesity. ? 2018 The Author(s).",""
"A guidance was developed to identify participants with missing outcome data in randomized controlled trials","2019","Background and Objectives: In order for authors of systematic reviews to address missing data in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), they need to first identify the number of trial participants with missing data. The objective of this study was to provide guidance for authors of systematic reviews on how to identify participants with missing outcome data in reports of RCTs. Methods: Guidance statements were informed by a review of studies addressing the topic of missing data and an iterative process of feedback and refinement, through meetings involving experts in health research methodology and authors of systematic reviews. Results: The proposed guidance includes (1) definitions of key terms, (2) 19 categories of participants described in RCT reports and who might have missing data, and (3) a flowchart on how to judge the outcome data missingness for each category. The judgment of missingness relies on how trial authors report on the categories and handle them in their analyses. Practically, for their primary analysis, systematic review authors should choose how to identify participants with missing outcome data (i.e., use either “definitely missing data” or “total possible missing data”), then select a method for handling missing data in meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses should be undertaken to explore consistency with competing options for classifying patients as having missing data. Conclusion: Adopting the proposed guidance will help promote transparency and consistency regarding how missing data are managed in systematic reviews. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; article; decision making; female; human; male; medical research; meta analysis; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); sensitivity analysis; systematic review"
"Patient coping and expectations predict recovery after major orthopaedic trauma","2019","Background:: Persistent post-surgical pain and associated disability are common after a traumatic fracture repair. Preliminary evidence suggests that patients' beliefs and perceptions may influence their prognosis. Methods: We used data from the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds trial to determine, in 1560 open fracture patients undergoing surgical repair, the association between Somatic PreOccupation and Coping (captured by the SPOC questionnaire) and recovery at 1 yr. Results: Of the 1218 open fracture patients with complete data available for analysis, 813 (66.7%) reported moderate to extreme pain at 1 yr. The addition of SPOC scores to an adjusted regression model to predict persistent pain improved the concordance statistic from 0.66 to 0.74, and found the greatest risk was associated with high (?74) SPOC scores [odds ratio: 5.63; 99% confidence interval (CI): 3.59–8.84; absolute risk increase 40.6%; 99% CI: 30.8%, 48.6%]. Thirty-eight per cent (484 of 1277) reported moderate to extreme pain interference at 1 yr. The addition of SPOC scores to an adjusted regression model to predict pain interference improved the concordance statistic from 0.66 to 0.75, and the greatest risk was associated with high SPOC scores (odds ratio: 6.06; 99% CI: 3.97–9.25; absolute risk increase: 18.3%; 95% CI: 11.7%, 26.7%). In our adjusted multivariable regression models, SPOC scores at 6 weeks post-surgery accounted for 10% of the variation in short form-12 physical component summary scores and 14% of short form-12 mental component summary scores at 1 yr. Conclusions: Amongst patients undergoing surgical repair of open extremity fractures, high SPOC questionnaire scores at 6 weeks post-surgery were predictive of persistent pain, reduced quality of life, and pain interference at 1 yr.

"Impact of Adopting Population Pharmacokinetics for Tailoring Prophylaxis in Haemophilia A Patients: A Historically Controlled Observational Study","2019","Background Performing individual pharmacokinetics (PK) studies in clinical practice can be simplified by adopting population PK-based profiling on limited post-infusion samples. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of population PK in tailoring prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia A. Patients and Methods Individual weekly treatment plans were developed considering predicted plasma factor activity levels and patients' lifestyle. Patients were trained using a visual traffic-light scheme to help modulate their level of physical activity with respect to factor infusions timing. Annualized joint bleeding rate (ABJR), haemophilia-specific quality of life questionnaire for adults (Haemo-QoL-A) and factor utilization were measured for 12 months before and after tailoring, compared within patients and analysed separately for those previously on prophylaxis (P), situational prophylaxis (SP) or on-demand (OD). Results Sixteen patients previously on P, 10 on SP and 10 on OD were enrolled in the study. The median (lower, upper quartile) ABJR changed from 2.0 (0, 4.0) to 0 (0, 1.6) for P (p = 0.003), from 2.0 (2.0, 13.6) to 3.0 (1.4, 7.2) for SP (p = 0.183) and from 16.0 (13.0, 25.0) to 2.3 (0, 5.0) for OD (p = 0.003). The Haemo-QoL-A total score improved for 58% of P, 50% of SP and 29% of OD patients. Factor utilization (IU/kg/patient/year) increased by 2,400 (121; 2,586) for P, 1,052 (308; 1,578) for SP and 2,086 (1,498; 2,576) for OD. One of 138 measurements demonstrated a factor activity level below the critical threshold of 0.03 IU/mL while the predicted level was above the threshold. Conclusion Implementing tailored prophylaxis using a Bayesian forecasting approach in a routine clinical practice setting may improve haemophilia clinical outcomes. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

"The social impact of early psychological maturity in adolescents with cancer","2019","Objective: There is a growing need to assess the long-term quality of life (QOL) of pediatric oncology patients since many children now survive their disease. This paper highlights the subjective perspectives of pediatric cancer patients and specifically explores how experiencing cancer at a young age impacts adolescents in the areas of social functioning, peer relationships, and QOL. The findings emerged from a qualitative research study that explored how pediatric oncology patients ascribe meaning to their illness. Methods: Study participants were recruited from four Canadian academic pediatric hospitals. In this study, we used an interpretative description approach. Semistructured interviews were completed, transcribed verbatim, and coded through the method of constant comparison. Results: A total of 37 children and adolescents (n?=?19 female; 51%) participated. The majority of participants were diagnosed with leukemia (n?=?16; 43%) or lymphoma (n?=?9; 24%). Sixty-two percent of participants were adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18?years (n?=?23). Data illustrated a unique adolescent experience, which has been reported as a subset of the original population. Adolescent participants noted an accelerated experience of maturation, which invited reflections of gratitude as well as feelings of isolation and disconnect from peers. Participants were saddened to have “missed out” on normative parts of childhood. Conclusion: Findings highlighted experiences of accelerated maturity that prompted adverse social outcomes for adolescent participants, which impacted their QOL. Future research is needed to explore the intersection of accelerated maturity attributed to illness, social functioning, and QOL. Peer support through technology engagement is suggested for this population. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adolescent; Article; Canada; cancer patient; child; childhood; female; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; maturity; pediatric hospital; peer group; population research; qualitative research; quality of life; semi structured interview; social behavior; coping behavior; human relation; neoplasm; psychology; quality of life; self concept; social adaptation; social change; social support; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Canada; Child; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Neoplasms; Peer Group; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Self Concept; Social Adjustment; Social Change; Social Support"
"A Psychometric Assessment of the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ-5) and Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale-Screen (GSIS-screen) in Middle-Aged and Older Men","2020","Objectives. To investigate the psychometric properties of the five-item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ-5) and the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale-Screen (GSIS-Screen, submitted) among community-residing middle-aged and older men. Methods. The SBQ-5 and GSIS-Screen were administered to 93 men, 55 years or older, who participated in an eligibility assessment (Time 1) for an upstream psychological intervention study to prevent the onset of suicide ideation among men struggling to transition to retirement. Eligible participants later completed the full GSIS and measures of depression and hopelessness at a pre-group assessment (Time 2). Results. The SBQ-5 was positively associated with the GSIS-Screen at the eligibility assessment. Internal consistency for both measures was low but acceptable. Time 1 scores on both screens predicted suicide ideation at Time 2, controlling for the intervening time lag and for baseline cognitive and physical functioning. Only the GSIS-Screen uniquely predicted future depression and hopelessness ratings. Conclusions. The SBQ-5 and the GSIS-Screen have acceptable psychometric properties among middle-aged and older community-residing men; the GSIS-Screen is more closely associated with later-life suicide risk factors. Clinical Implications. Brief screening tools may be of use in effectively identifying suicide ideation in community-residing middle-aged and older men. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.",""
"Global, regional, and national burden of neurological disorders, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","2019","Background: Neurological disorders are increasingly recognised as major causes of death and disability worldwide. The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders. Methods: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach. Findings: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247–308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million [8·8–9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34–44] and DALYs by 15% [9–21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26–30] and DALYs by 27% [24–31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6–46·1]), migraine (16·3% [11·7–20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0–12·1]), and meningitis (7·9% [6·6–10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 [1·05–1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8–35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8–17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable). Interpretation: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

"Metabolic perturbations from step reduction in older persons at risk for sarcopenia: Plasma biomarkers of abrupt changes in physical activity","2019","Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function, which may be accelerated during periods of physical inactivity. Declines in skeletal muscle and functionality not only impacts mobility but also increases chronic disease risk, such as type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to measure adaptive metabolic responses to acute changes in habitual activity in a cohort of overweight, pre-diabetic older adults (age = 69 ± 4 years; BMI = 27 ± 4 kg/m2, n = 17) when using non-targeted metabolite profiling by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Participants completed two weeks of step reduction (&lt;1000 steps/day) followed by a two week recovery period, where fasting plasma samples were collected at three time intervals at baseline, after step reduction and following recovery. Two weeks of step reduction elicited increases in circulatory metabolites associated with a decline in muscle energy metabolism and protein degradation, including glutamine, carnitine and creatine (q &lt; 0.05; effect size &gt; 0.30), as well as methionine and deoxycarnitine (p &lt; 0.05; effect size ? 0.20) as compared to baseline. Similarly, decreases in uremic toxins in plasma that promote muscle inflammation, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid, as well as oxoproline, a precursor used for intramuscular glutathione recycling, were also associated with physical inactivity (p &lt; 0.05; effect size &gt; 0.20). Our results indicate that older persons are susceptible to metabolic perturbations due to short-term step reduction that were not fully reversible with resumption of normal ambulatory activity over the same time period. These plasma biomarkers may enable early detection of inactivity-induced metabolic dysregulation in older persons at risk for sarcopenia not readily measured by current imaging techniques or muscle function tests, which is required for the design of therapeutic interventions to counter these deleterious changes in support of healthy ageing. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Incidence of Brain Metastases in Nonmetastatic and Metastatic Breast Cancer: Is There a Role for Screening?","2020","Background: Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend against screening breast cancer patients for asymptomatic brain metastases. Because brain metastases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality from breast cancer, we undertook a literature review to ascertain whether there might be a role for brain metastases screening in high-risk patient subgroups. Materials and Methods: A literature search was conducted on the OvidSP platform in the MedLine database, using MeSH terms and subject headings related to breast cancer, brain metastases, and incidence. The search was conducted without language or publication restrictions, and included articles indexed from January 1, 2006 to June 10, 2018. Experimental and observational studies that reported the incidence of brain metastases in patients with nonmetastatic or metastatic breast cancer were included. Results: One hundred seventy studies were identified, with 33 included in the final analysis. Among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients, incidence of brain metastases as site of first recurrence per year of median follow-up ranged from 0.1% to 3.2%. Although incidence of brain metastases was much higher among the metastatic breast cancer population overall, it was particularly high among metastatic HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) and triple-negative populations, ranging between 22% and 36% for the former, and 15%-37% for the latter in the absence of screening. Conclusion: In patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer, screening for asymptomatic brain metastases cannot currently be justified. However, due to the high incidence of brain metastases among patients with metastatic HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer, studies to determine the value of screening for brain metastases should be undertaken in these subgroups. ? 2019",""
"Canadian consensus statement: enhanced recovery after surgery in bariatric surgery","2020","Background: In Canada, bariatric surgery continues to remain the most effective treatment for severe obesity and its comorbidities. As the number of bariatric surgeries continues to grow, the need for consensus guidelines for optimal perioperative care is imperative. In colorectal surgery, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols were created for this purpose. The objective of this review is to develop evidence-based ERAS guidelines for bariatric surgery. Methods: A literature search of the MEDLINE database was performed using ERAS-specific search terms. Recently published articles with a focus on randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included. Quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated using the GRADE assessment system. Results: Canadian bariatric surgeons from six provinces and ten bariatric centers performed a review of the evidence surrounding ERAS in bariatric surgery and created consensus guidelines for 14 essential ERAS elements. Our main recommendations were (1) to encourage participation in a presurgical weight loss program; (2) to abstain from tobacco and excessive alcohol; (3) low-calorie liquid diet for at least 2?weeks prior to surgery; (4) to avoid preanesthetic anxiolytics and long-acting opioids; (5) unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin prior to surgery; (6) antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin ± metronidazole; (7) reduced opioids during surgery; (8) surgeon preference regarding intraoperative leak testing; (9) nasogastric intubation needed only for Veress access; (10) to avoid abdominal drains and urinary catheters; (11) to prevent ileus by discontinuing intravenous fluids early; (12) postoperative analgesia with acetaminophen, short-term NSAIDS, and minimal opioids; (13) to resume full fluid diet on first postoperative day; (14) early telephone follow-up with full clinic follow-up at 3–4?weeks. Conclusions: The purpose of addressing these ERAS elements is to develop guidelines that can be implemented and practiced clinically. ERAS is an excellent model that improves surgical efficiency and acts as a common perioperative pathway. In the interim, this multimodal bariatric perioperative guideline serves as a common consensus point for Canadian bariatric surgeons. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Emergency Department Presentations and Youth Suicide: A Case-Control Study [Pr?sentations au service d'urgence et suicide des adolescents : une ?tude cas-t?moin]","2019","Objective: We estimate associations between emergency department (ED) diagnoses and suicide among youth to guide ED care. Method: This ED-based case-control study used data from the Office of the Chief Coroner and all EDs in Ontario, Canada. Cases (n = 697 males and n = 327 females) were aged 10 to 25 years who died by suicide in Ontario between April 2003 and March 2014, with an ED contact in the year before their death. Same-aged ED-based controls were selected during this time frame. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Among youth diagnosed with a mental health problem at their most recent ED contact (41.9% cases, 5% controls), suicide was elevated among nonfatal self-inflicted: ‘other’ injuries, including hanging, strangulation, and suffocation in both sexes (aORs > 14); cut/pierce injuries in males (aOR > 5); poisonings in both sexes (aORs > 2.2); and mood and psychotic disorders in males (aORs > 1.7). Among those remaining, ‘undetermined’ injuries and poisonings in both sexes (aORs > 5), ‘unintentional’ poisonings in males (aOR = 2.1), and assault in both sexes (aORs > 1.8) were significant. At least half of cases had ED contact within 106 days. Conclusions: The results highlight the need for timely identification and treatment of mental health problems. Among those with an identified mental health problem, important targets for suicide prevention efforts are youth with self-harm and males with mood and psychotic disorders. Among others, youth with unintentional poisonings, undetermined events, and assaults should raise concern. ?

"Prediction of Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Patients at High Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Using a Recently Validated Algorithm","2019","Background: The prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is 1 of 250 in the general population and approximately 1 of 125 in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), yet only a minority are diagnosed. The diagnostic criteria for FH rely on a point system using low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), family history, cutaneous manifestations, and molecular diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of FH in the Relating Evidence to Achieve Cholesterol Targets (REACT) registry. Methods: Patients were enrolled as ASCVD (n = 86) or FH (n = 109) and with an LDL-C level > 3.0 mmol/L despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. FH was diagnosed clinically using a validated clinical application integrating an imputation for baseline (untreated) LDL-C levels. Results: There were 109 men and 86 women with a mean age of 63 ± 12 years. Diabetes (29.7%), hypertension (62.1%), smoking (37.9%), and family history of premature ASCVD (59.5%) were common. On-treatment LDL-C was 4.26 ± 0.94 mmol/L. On the basis of the dose and type of statin ± ezetimibe, imputed baseline LDL-C was 7.04 ± 2.90 mmol/L. A diagnosis of probable/definite FH was found in 54.7%, 49.5%, and 61.5% of patients according to the Simon Broome, Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, and the new Canadian FH definition, respectively. Of note, 40% of patients in the ASCVD inclusion subgroup had probable or definite FH. Conclusions: Our study reveals that a substantial proportion of patients with ASCVD whose LDL-C levels are > 3.0 mmol/L despite maximally tolerated statins have heterozygous FH. Clinicians should consider using the recently described algorithm to assess the possibility of FH in this high-risk population. ? 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society","atorvastatin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; rosuvastatin; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; cardiovascular risk; coronary artery atherosclerosis; diabetes mellitus; drug tolerability; familial hypercholesterolemia; family history; female; high risk population; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; prediction; risk factor; smoking; treatment outcome; validation study"
"Early Clinical Exposure to Geriatric Psychiatry and Medical Students’ Interest in Caring for Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial","2019","Objective: In the next 25 years, the population aged 65 and older will nearly double in many countries, with few new doctors wishing to care for older adults. The authors hypothesize that early clinical exposure to elderly patient care could increase student interest in caring for older adults during their future career. Methods: The authors conducted a pragmatic medical education randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the Jewish General Hospital and the Douglas Mental Health Institute, McGill University, in Montreal, Canada. Third-year medical students undergoing their mandatory 16-week half-time clerkship rotation in psychiatry were randomly assigned to the equivalent of 2–4 weeks of full-time exposure to clinical geriatric psychiatry (n = 84). Results: Being randomly assigned to geriatric psychiatry exposure (n = 44 of 84) was associated with increased “comfort in working with geriatric patients and their families” at 16-week follow-up (59.1% versus 37.5%, χ2 (1) = 3.9; p = 0.05). However, there was no significant association found between geriatric psychiatry exposure and change “in interest in caring for older adults,” or change in “interest in becoming a geriatric psychiatrist.” Conclusion: The results of this pragmatic education RCT suggest that exposing third-year medical students to 2–4 weeks of geriatric psychiatry did not increase their interest to care for older adults or become a geriatric psychiatrist. However, it did increase their comfort level in working with older adults and their families. However, more research is necessary to identify potential interventions that could inspire and increase medical student interest in caring for older adults as part of their future careers. ? 2019","aged; article; Canada; career; comfort; controlled study; female; follow up; general hospital; geriatric patient; gerontopsychiatry; human; major clinical study; male; medical education; medical student; mental health; psychiatrist; randomized controlled trial; rotation"
"Measurement properties of the SF-MPQ-2 neuropathic qualities subscale in persons with CRPs: Validity, responsiveness, and Rasch analysis","2019","Objectives. The purpose of this study was to conduct classical psychometric evaluation and Rasch analysis on the Neuropathic Qualities subscale of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 utilizing scores from persons with complex regional pain syndrome to consider reliability and person separation, validity (including unidimensionality), and responsiveness in this population. Methods. Secondary analysis of longitudinal data from persons with acute complex regional pain syndrome was utilized for analysis of the psychometric properties and fit to the Rasch model of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale. We followed an iterative process of Rasch analysis to evaluate and address data fitting challenges. Results. Repeated measures from 59 persons meeting the Budapest criteria were used for analysis. Both item-total correlations and unidimensionality analyses supported theoretical construct validity; all convergent construct validity hypotheses were also supported. Responsiveness was demonstrated comparing baseline and one-year data at d ? 0.92, with a standardized response mean of 0.97. Data were able to fit the Rasch model, but all Neuropathic Qualities items had disordered thresholds that required rescoring. Additionally, local dependency and differential item function were addressed by “bundling,” suggesting that no further item reduction would be possible. Conclusions. This study provided preliminary support for the validity and responsiveness of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale in persons with complex regional pain syndrome. Rasch analysis further endorses use of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale as a “stand-alone” measure for neuropathic features, but with substantial background data transformations. Replication with larger samples is recommended to increase confidence in these findings. ? 2018 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

"Special Article: 2018 American College of Rheumatology/National Psoriasis Foundation Guideline for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis","2019","Objective: To develop an evidence-based guideline for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF). Methods: We identified critical outcomes in PsA and clinically relevant PICO (population/intervention/comparator/outcomes) questions. A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for PsA. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A voting panel, including rheumatologists, dermatologists, other health professionals, and patients, achieved consensus on the direction and the strength of the recommendations. Results: The guideline covers the management of active PsA in patients who are treatment-naive and those who continue to have active PsA despite treatment, and addresses the use of oral small molecules, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i), IL-17 inhibitors, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib). We also developed recommendations for psoriatic spondylitis, predominant enthesitis, and treatment in the presence of concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, or serious infections. We formulated recommendations for a treat-to-target strategy, vaccinations, and nonpharmacologic therapies. Six percent of the recommendations were strong and 94% conditional, indicating the importance of active discussion between the health care provider and the patient to choose the optimal treatment. Conclusion: The 2018 ACR/NPF PsA guideline serves as a tool for health care providers and patients in the selection of appropriate therapy in common clinical scenarios. Best treatment decisions consider each individual patient situation. The guideline is not meant to be proscriptive and should not be used to limit treatment options for patients with PsA. ? 2018, American College of Rheumatology","abatacept; adalimumab; apremilast; brodalumab; certolizumab pegol; cyclosporine; etanercept; golimumab; infliximab; ixekizumab; leflunomide; methotrexate; salazosulfapyridine; secukinumab; tofacitinib; ustekinumab; antirheumatic agent; biological product; immunosuppressive agent; Article; dermatologist; diabetes mellitus; drug use; enthesitis; evidence based practice; health care personnel; health care quality; health practitioner; human; inflammatory bowel disease; massage; medical decision making; methodology; occupational therapy; physiotherapy; practice guideline; psoriatic arthritis; rheumatologist; rheumatology; smoking cessation; spondylitis; systematic review; treatment outcome; vaccination; weight loss program; clinical decision making; combination drug therapy; practice guideline; procedures; psoriatic arthritis; rheumatology; United States; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Biological Products; Clinical Decision-Making; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Rheumatology; Treatment Outcome; United States"
"Green template-free synthesis and characterization of mesoporous alumina as a high value-added product in aluminum black dross recycling strategy","2019","Aluminum black dross (ABD) is a solid waste of aluminum smelting process that causes serious environmental and public health problems. In addition, it imposes significant disposal costs to the aluminum industry. In this study, synthesis and characterization of mesoporous alumina (MA) from the ABD using a novel recycling procedure consisting of leaching at low temperature (85 °C) and atmospheric pressure, co-precipitation, separation through selective dissolution, re-precipitation, aging and finally calcination at 600 °C for 2 h. No hard or soft template was used during the formation of the gel. The as-synthesized MA had a specific surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of 123–162 m2/g, 0.37 cm3/g and 10.6 nm, respectively which were obtained by nitrogen sorption analysis. The as-synthesized MA possessed more than 98% purity. Its XRD pattern exhibited the characteristic peaks of gamma, eta, theta, and delta phase alumina. FESEM and TEM analyses revealed nanoscale morphology of the as-synthesized MA; having crystal size of ?11 nm. The TGA analysis showed that the as-synthesized MA is thermally stable and exhibits only ?5 wt% mass loss for heating from 30 to 800 °C. The characterization of solid residue at the end of the proposed process proved that it contains mainly silica phase which can alternatively be reused as filling agent or aggregate in concrete materials applications. It is quite clear that the process of production of MA from the ABD is feasible and practical and provides a novel mitigation to the environmental problems of the ABD. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Atmospheric pressure; Magnesium printing plates; Morphology; Nanostructured materials; Precipitation (chemical); Recycling; Silica; Synthesis (chemical); Temperature; Characteristic peaks; Environmental problems; Inorganic materials; Nanoscale morphology; Oxide materials; Selective dissolution; Synthesis and characterizations; Value added products; Aluminum"
"Anticonvulsants for behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia: Protocol for a systematic review","2019","Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are present in a majority of patients with dementia contributing to increased morbidity, health care costs, and caregiver burden. While there are no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for these symptoms, off-label use of medications such as antipsychotics have been shown to have significant adverse effects including increased mortality. The goal of this review is to examine the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of BPSD. Methods: We will systematically search for randomized trials of anticonvulsants compared to placebo or other treatments such as antidepressants and antipsychotics from the following sources: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID SP) in Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations (latest version), EMBASE, clinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry. The studies will be limited to those published in English but the study location can be worldwide. We will include studies pertaining to individuals with dementia and symptoms of BPSD. The primary outcomes will be behavioral change as measured by validated scales and secondary outcomes will include caregiver burden, quality of life, placement in long term care facility, serious adverse effects, and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Two sets of reviewers will independently screen select and extract data. We will narratively describe the major findings and conclusions from individual studies. Patients who are prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for other indications, including seizures, will be excluded. Outcomes of interest will include a change in a validated scale that measures BPSD, serious adverse events, and caregiver quality of life outcomes. If the data are found to be appropriate for a meta-analysis, we will use a random effects model to compute summary estimates of treatment effects. Discussion: This is a protocol for a systematic review addressing the anticonvulsant group of medications as a whole, and as such, our results will inform current clinical practice in the use of anticonvulsants for BPSD. It will also help clinicians and policy makers compare the efficacy of anticonvulsants compared to antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as identify areas which will need further study. ? 2019 The Author(s).","anticonvulsive agent; carbamazepine; gabapentin; lamotrigine; levetiracetam; neuroleptic agent; oxcarbazepine; phenobarbital; phenytoin; placebo; pregabalin; topiramate; valproic acid; zonisamide; behavior change; behavior disorder; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; caregiver burden; Clinical Global Impression scale; Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory; dementia; geriatric assessment; health care cost; human; information processing; long term care; mental disease; meta analysis; Mini Mental State Examination; morbidity; mortality; neuropsychiatric inventory; off label drug use; outcome assessment; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review"
"Impact of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on global cigarette consumption: Quasi-experimental evaluations using interrupted time series analysis and in-sample forecast event modelling","2019","Objective To evaluate the impact of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) on global cigarette consumption. Design Two quasi-experimental impact evaluations, using interrupted time series analysis (ITS) and in-sample forecast event modelling. Setting and population 71 countries for which verified national estimates of cigarette consumption from 1970 to 2015 were available, representing over 95% of the world's cigarette consumption and 85% of the world's population. Main outcome measures The FCTC is an international treaty adopted in 2003 that aims to reduce harmful tobacco consumption and is legally binding on the 181 countries that have ratified it. Main outcomes were annual national estimates of cigarette consumption per adult from 71 countries since 1970, allowing global, regional, and country comparisons of consumption levels and trends before and after 2003, with counterfactual control groups modelled using pre-intervention linear time trends (for ITS) and in-sample forecasts (for event modelling). Results No significant change was found in the rate at which global cigarette consumption had been decreasing after the FCTC's adoption in 2003, using either ITS or event modelling. Results were robust after realigning data to the year FCTC negotiations commenced (1999), or to the year when the FCTC first became legally binding in each country. By contrast to global consumption, high income and European countries showed a decrease in annual consumption by over 1000 cigarettes per adult after 2003, whereas low and middle income and Asian countries showed an increased annual consumption by over 500 cigarettes per adult when compared with a counterfactual event model. Conclusions This study finds no evidence to indicate that global progress in reducing cigarette consumption has been accelerated by the FCTC treaty mechanism. This null finding, combined with regional differences, should caution against complacency in the global tobacco control community, motivate greater implementation of proven tobacco control policies, encourage assertive responses to tobacco industry activities, and inform the design of more effective health treaties. ?

"Prone Compared With Lithotomy for Abdominoperineal Resection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Background: Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is the primary surgical approach to low rectal cancers. Both prone and lithotomy patient positioning during the perineal dissection are currently acceptable approaches. There is no consensus on whether patient positioning has an impact on operative and oncologic outcomes. The aim of this review was to compare the perioperative and long-term oncologic outcomes between prone and lithotomy patient positioning. Materials and methods: Search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases was performed. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they compared prone and lithotomy positioning for the perineal portion of APR for rectal cancer in one of the primary outcomes. Quality of included studies was assessed using Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Results: Nine studies with 888 patients in the prone group and 897 in the lithotomy group were included. Compared with lithotomy position, prone position had a significantly lower perforation rate (risk ratio: 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32 to 0.79, P = 0.003) and rates of positive circumferential resection margin involvement (risk ratio: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44 to 1.00, P = 0.05). Prone position also had a significantly shorter operative time than lithotomy position (mean difference: ?45.20 min, 95% CI: ?63.03 to -27.36, P < 0.00001). Positioning did not affect 5-y overall survival or local and distal recurrence. Conclusions: Prone positioning may lead to lower rates of perforation and circumferential resection margin involvement in APR. In addition, it may lead to shorter operative time. Larger randomized studies are required to confirm the results of this review and examine the difference in long-term outcomes. ? 2019","body position; confidence interval; human; lithotomy; meta analysis; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; overall survival; priority journal; rectum abdominoperineal resection; Review; risk assessment; systematic review; comparative study; operation duration; perineum; postoperative complication; prone position; rectum tumor; supine position; Humans; Operative Time; Perineum; Postoperative Complications; Prone Position; Rectal Neoplasms; Supine Position"
"Seasonality patterns of internet searches on mental health: Exploratory infodemiology study","2019","Background: The study of seasonal patterns of public interest in psychiatric disorders has important theoretical and practical implications for service planning and delivery. The recent explosion of internet searches suggests that mining search databases yields unique information on public interest in mental health disorders, which is a significantly more affordable approach than population health studies. Objective: This study aimed to investigate seasonal patterns of internet mental health queries in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Weekly data on health queries in Ontario from Google Trends were downloaded for a 5-year period (2012-2017) for the terms ""schizophrenia,"" ""autism,"" ""bipolar,"" ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""OCD"" (obsessive-compulsive disorder), and ""suicide."" Control terms were overall search results for the terms ""health"" and ""how."" Time-series analyses using a continuous wavelet transform were performed to isolate seasonal components in the search volume for each term. Results: All mental health queries showed significant seasonal patterns with peak periodicity occurring over the winter months and troughs occurring during summer, except for ""suicide."" The comparison term ""health"" also exhibited seasonal periodicity, while the term ""how"" did not, indicating that general information seeking may not follow a seasonal trend in the way that mental health information seeking does. Conclusions: Seasonal patterns of internet search volume in a wide range of mental health terms were observed, with the exception of ""suicide."" Our study demonstrates that monitoring internet search trends is an affordable, instantaneous, and naturalistic method to sample public interest in large populations and inform health policy planners. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Retention in care and virological failure among adult HIV+ patients on second-line ART in Rwanda: a national representative study","2019","Background: Currently, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this challenge, outcomes of second-line protease inhibitor (PI) based ART in Rwanda were assessed. Methods: A two-stage cluster sampling design was undertaken. 49 of 340 health facilities linked to the open-source electronic medical record (EMR) system of Rwanda were randomly sampled. Data sampling criteria included adult HIV positive patients with documented change from first to second-line ART regimen. Retention in care and treatment failure (viral load above 1000 copies/mL) were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models. Results: A total of 1688 patients (60% females) initiated second-line ART PI-based regimen by 31st December 2016 with a median follow-up time of 26 months (IQR 24-36). Overall, 92.5% of patients were retained in care; 83% achieved VL ? 1000 copies/ml, 2.8% were lost to care and 2.2% died. Defaulting from care was associated with more recent initiation of ART- PI based regimen, CD4 cell count ?500 cells/mm3 at initiation of second line ART and viral load > 1000 copies/ml at last measurement. Viral failure was associated with younger age, WHO stage III&IV at ART initiation, CD4 cell count ?500 cells/mm3 at switch, atazanavir based second-line ART and receiving care at a health center compared to hospital settings. Conclusions: A high proportion of patients on second-line ART are doing relatively well in Rwanda and retained in care with low viral failure rates. However, enhanced understandings of adherence and adherence interventions for less healthy individuals are required. Routine viral load measurement and tracing of loss to follow-up is fundamental in resource limited settings, especially among less healthy patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).","abacavir; atazanavir plus ritonavir; lamivudine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; tenofovir; zidovudine; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; atazanavir; adolescent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; body mass; CD4 lymphocyte count; controlled study; disease classification; female; follow up; health care access; health care facility; health service; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; nonhuman; observational study; outcome assessment; retention in care; retrospective study; Rwanda; treatment failure; treatment outcome; tuberculosis; underweight; virology; virus load; aged; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; treatment failure; virology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anti-HIV Agents; Atazanavir Sulfate; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Retention in Care; Rwanda; Treatment Failure; Viral Load"
"Understanding the Complexity of Diabetes and Urinary Incontinence in Older Adults Receiving Home Care Services: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study","2019","Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very prevalent problem for older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving home care services. However, the complexities of living with UI and T2DM and providing nursing care for older adults in the home care context have received very little research attention. This article describes a protocol for a convergent, mixed methods research design study to address this knowledge and practice gap. The objectives of the proposed study are to (a) determine the prevalence and correlates of UI in older adults living with T2DM receiving home care services, (b) explore the experiences of older adults living with T2DM and UI receiving home care services, (c) explore the experiences of home care nurses caring for this population, and (d) converge the multiple data sources to provide a deeper understanding of the problem and implications for provision of home care services to this population. The research methods are informed by a model of clinical complexity. The quantitative strand will involve descriptive and inferential analysis of standardized home care assessment data (interRAI) to determine the prevalence and correlates of UI in older adults with T2DM receiving home care services. Interpretive description methods will be used in the qualitative strand, and interviews will be conducted with older adults and home care nurses. The findings will be converged to inform a better understanding of the complexity of living with these chronic conditions for older adults receiving home care services and generate implications for complex intervention development. This protocol highlights methodological insights in utilizing mixed methods research to inform intervention design. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"How do Canadian media report climate change impacts on health? A newspaper review","2019","Research on climate change media coverage is growing. Few studies, however, have investigated how the media portrays climate change impacts on human health. This review, therefore, presents a quantitative spatiotemporal analysis of Canadian newspaper coverage of climate change impacts on health between 2005 and 2015. Using the ProQuest? and Eureka? databases, a multiphase systematic review strategy was employed to identify relevant English and French articles from two national and six regional high-circulation newspapers. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from 145 articles and analyzed to characterize the range, extent, and nature of climate-health newspaper coverage in Canada and to compare these characteristics by region and over time. Coverage varied by region, with the highest proportion of climate-health coverage in Northern Territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut). Over time, there was a decreasing publication frequency trend. Almost all articles described negative climate change impacts on health, with a predominant focus on infectious and chronic noninfectious diseases; however, less than half of the articles discussed climate change solutions. These trends suggest that current media coverage might not drive widespread public support for policies and actions needed to protect against projected climate-health risks. Consequently, as climate change continues to challenge human health, increasing media emphasis on climate change impacts on human health, as well as a shift toward enabling and empowering climate change communication, in which viable mitigation and adaptation options are emphasized, could help to spur action to reduce climate change health risks. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Digital storage; Health; Health risks; Newsprint; Public risks; Climate change impact; Media coverage; Newspaper review; Northern territories; Public support; Qualitative data; Spatiotemporal analysis; Systematic Review; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; health impact; literature review; media role; public health; trend analysis; Canada; Nunavut; Yukon Territory"
"A cross-country survey of attitudes toward childbirth technologies and interventions among university students","2019","Problem & aim: Cultural beliefs that equate birth technology with progress, safety and convenience contribute to widespread acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions. Little is known about attitudes towards childbirth technology and interventions among the next generation of maternity care users and whether attitudes vary by country, age, gender, childbirth fear, and other factors. Methods: Data were collected via online survey in eight countries. Students who had never had children, and who planned to have at least one child were eligible to participate. Findings: The majority of participants (n = 4569) were women (79.3%), and the median age was 22 years. More than half of students agreed that birth technology makes birth easier (55.8%), protects babies from harm (49.1%) and that women have a right to choose a medically non-indicated cesarean (50.8%). Respondents who had greater acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions were from countries with higher national caesarean birth rates, reported higher levels of childbirth fear, and were more likely to report that visual media or school-based education shaped their attitudes toward birth. Positive attitudes toward childbirth technology and interventions were also associated with less confidence in knowledge of birth, and more common among younger and male respondents. Discussion/conclusion: Educational strategies to teach university students about pregnancy and birth in ways that does not frighten them and promotes critical reflection about childbirth technology are needed. This is especially true in countries with high rates of interventions that reciprocally shape culture norms, attitudes, and expectations. ? 2018 Australian College of Midwives","adult; article; cesarean section; child; controlled study; education; expectation; fear of childbirth; female; gender; human; infant; major clinical study; male; maternal care; pregnancy; university student; young adult; adolescent; attitude to health; birth; fear; obstetric delivery; psychology; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; student; university; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude to Health; Cesarean Section; Delivery, Obstetric; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Parturition; Pregnancy; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult"
"Health Care While Homeless: Barriers, Facilitators, and the Lived Experiences of Homeless Individuals Accessing Health Care in a Canadian Regional Municipality","2019","Persons struggling with housing remain significantly disadvantaged when considering access to health care. Effective advocacy for their needs will require understanding the factors which impact their health care, and which of those most concern patients themselves. A qualitative descriptive study through the lens of a transformative framework was used to identify barriers and facilitators to accessing health care as perceived by people experiencing homelessness in the regional municipality of Niagara, Canada. In-person, semi-structured interviews with 16 participants were completed, and inductive thematic analysis identified nine barriers and eight facilitators. Barriers included affordability, challenges finding primary care, inadequacy of the psychiatric model, inappropriate management, lack of trust in health care providers, poor therapeutic relationships, systemic issues, and transportation and accessibility. Facilitators included accessibility of services, community health care outreach, positive relationships, and shelters coordinating health care. Knowledge of the direct experiences of marginalized individuals can help create new health policies and enhance the provision of clinical care. ?

"Factors Associated With Opioid Use in Long-term Cancer Survivors","2019","Purpose: To evaluate factors associated with opioid use in patients with cancer surviving more than five years without recurrence. We evaluated exposures of opioid use before cancer diagnosis, opioid use between cancer diagnosis and five-year anniversary, surgeries, and chemotherapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked provincial administrative data. Patients were aged 24–70 years and eligible for government-funded pharmacare. The index date was the five-year anniversary from diagnosis. Patients were accrued between 2010 and 2015. The main outcome was opioid prescription rate after index date. The main exposures were opioid use before diagnosis, opioid use between diagnosis and index, surgeries, and chemotherapy. A negative binomial regression model was used to estimate relative rates (RR) of opioid use after index date. Results: Our cohort included 7431 individuals. The overall crude prescription rate after the index date was 2 per person-year. The factor most strongly associated with a higher rate of opioid use after index was continuous opioid use between diagnosis and index (RR 46.1, 95% confidence interval 34.8–61.2). Opioid use before diagnosis was also a factor (RR = 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.44–2.19). A history of depression, comorbidity, and more than two years of diabetes were also associated with higher risk of post–index date opioid use. Significant interactions were identified between prior opioid use and opioid use between diagnosis and index. Most prescriptions are from family physicians. Conclusion: Patients who use opioids continuously between diagnosis and index date are at increased risk of continued use after five years of survival. Safe and appropriate pain management is an important survivorship issue. ? 2019 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","antineoplastic agent; opiate; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer surgery; cancer survivor; cohort analysis; comorbidity; depression; diabetes mellitus; drug use; female; follow up; human; male; malignant neoplasm; medical history; outcome assessment; prescription; prostate cancer; retrospective study"
"Effect of probiotic interventions on depressive symptoms: A narrative review evaluating systematic reviews","2019","Depression is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses and is often associated with various other medical disorders. Since the 1980s, the primary pharmacological treatment has been antidepressants, but due to the recent discovery of the association between the gut microbiome and mental health, probiotics have been proposed as an adjunctive or alternate treatment. In this narrative review, we aim to provide a holistic perspective by synthesizing and evaluating existing evidence, discussing key biological mechanisms, exploring the history of probiotic use, and appreciating the influence of modern diet on mental health. Five online databases were searched for relevant studies up to December 2017. Systematic reviews that included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of depressive symptoms were included. Seven systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Three of these reviews conducted meta-analyses, out of which, two concluded that probiotics improved depressive symptoms in the sample population. Out of the four reviews that conducted qualitative analysis, three reviews concluded that probiotics have the potential to be used as a treatment. Due to the differences in clinical trials, a definitive effect of probiotics on depressive symptoms cannot be concluded. Nonetheless, probiotics seem to potentially produce a significant therapeutic effect for subjects with pre-existing depressive symptoms. Further studies are warranted for definitive conclusions. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Spontaneous spatial navigation circuitry in schizophrenia spectrum disorders","2019","Spatial memory is core to wayfinding and everyday memory. Interestingly, individuals with schizophrenia using spatial navigation strategies (cognitive mapping)are impaired, whereas those using response-based (e.g., single-landmark)strategies show relatively intact memory performance. We observed abnormal brain communication in schizophrenia participants who used a spatial strategy during a virtual-reality navigation task, particularly between temporal and frontal brain regions. In contrast, schizophrenia participants using a response strategy recruited similar brain systems to healthy participants, but to a greater extent to support memory performance. These findings highlight that strategy use is an important consideration for understanding memory systems and navigation in schizophrenia. ? 2019","adult; Article; brain region; caudate nucleus; clinical article; controlled study; electroencephalogram; female; frontal cortex; hippocampus; human; male; memory; mental performance; priority journal; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; spatial orientation; temporal lobe"
"Tool for the Meaningful Consideration of Language Barriers in Qualitative Health Research","2020","Individuals who experience language barriers are largely excluded as participants from health research, resulting in gaps in knowledge that have implications for the development of equitable policies, tools, and strategies. Drawing on the existing literature and on their collective experience conducting occupational health research in contexts of language barriers, the authors propose a tool to assist qualitative researchers and representatives from funding agencies and ethics review boards with the meaningful consideration of language barriers in research. There remain gaps and debates with respect to the relevant ethical and methodological guidance set forth by funding agencies and institutions and proposed in the scientific literature. This article adds to knowledge in this area by contributing our experiences, observations, and recommendations, including around the issue of conducting research in contexts of more or less linguistic diversity. ?

"Accuracy of a Popular Online Symptom Checker for Ophthalmic Diagnoses","2019","Importance: Because more patients are presenting with self-guided research of symptoms, it is important to assess the capabilities and limitations of these available health information tools. Objective: To determine the accuracy of the most popular online symptom checker for ophthalmic diagnoses. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a cross-sectional study, 42 validated clinical vignettes of ophthalmic symptoms were generated and distilled to their core presenting symptoms. Cases were entered into WebMD symptom checker by both medically trained and nonmedically trained personnel blinded to the diagnosis. Output from the symptom checker, including the number of symptoms, ranking and list of diagnoses, and triage urgency were recorded. The study was conducted on October 13, 2017. Analysis was performed between October 15, 2017, and April 30, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Accuracy of the top 3 diagnoses generated by the online symptom checker. Results: The mean (SD) number of symptoms entered was 3.6 (1.6) (range, 1-8). The median (SD) number of diagnoses generated by the symptom checker was 26.8 (21.8) (range, 1-99). The primary diagnosis by the symptom checker was correct in 11 of 42 (26%; 95% CI, 12%-40%) cases. The correct diagnosis was included in the online symptom checker's top 3 diagnoses in 16 of 42 (38%; 95% CI, 25%-56%) cases. The correct diagnosis was not included in the symptom checker's list in 18 of 42 (43%; 95% CI, 32%-63%) cases. Triage urgency based on the top diagnosis was appropriate in 7 of 18 (39%; 95% CI, 14%-64%) emergent cases and 21 of 24 (88%; 95% CI, 73%-100%) nonemergent cases. Interuser variability for the correct diagnosis being in the top 3 listed was at least moderate (Cohen κ = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95). Conclusions and Relevance: The most popular online symptom checker may arrive at the correct clinical diagnosis for ophthalmic conditions, but a substantial proportion of diagnoses may not be captured. These findings suggest that further research to reflect the real-life application of internet diagnostic resources is required. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Development of a point of care system for automated coma prognosis: A prospective cohort study protocol","2019","Introduction Coma is a deep state of unconsciousness that can be caused by a variety of clinical conditions. Traditional tests for coma outcome prediction are based mainly on a set of clinical observations. Recently, certain event-related potentials (ERPs), which are transient electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to auditory, visual or tactile stimuli, have been introduced as useful predictors of a positive coma outcome (ie, emergence). However, such tests require the skills of clinical neurophysiologists, who are not commonly available in many clinical settings. Additionally, none of the current standard clinical approaches have sufficient predictive accuracies to provide definitive prognoses. Objective The objective of this study is to develop improved machine learning procedures based on EEG/ERP for determining emergence from coma. Methods and analysis Data will be collected from 50 participants in coma. EEG/ERP data will be recorded for 24 consecutive hours at a maximum of five time points spanning 30 days from the date of recruitment to track participants' progression. The study employs paradigms designed to elicit brainstem potentials, middle-latency responses, N100, mismatch negativity, P300 and N400. In the case of patient emergence, data are recorded on that occasion to form an additional basis for comparison. A relevant data set will be developed from the testing of 20 healthy controls, each spanning a 15-hour recording period in order to formulate a baseline. Collected data will be used to develop an automated procedure for analysis and detection of various ERP components that are salient to prognosis. Salient features extracted from the ERP and resting-state EEG will be identified and combined to give an accurate indicator of prognosis. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (project number 4840). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at scientific conferences.

"Stroke Outcomes in the COMPASS Trial","2019","Background: Strokes were significantly reduced by the combination of rivaroxaban plus aspirin in comparison with aspirin in the COMPASS trial (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies). We present detailed analyses of stroke by type, predictors, and antithrombotic effects in key subgroups. Methods: Participants had stable coronary artery or peripheral artery disease and were randomly assigned to receive aspirin 100 mg once daily (n=9126), rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily (n=9117), or rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin (n=9152). Patients who required anticoagulation or had a stroke within 1 month, previous lacunar stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage were excluded. Results: During a mean follow-up of 23 months, fewer patients had strokes in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group than in the aspirin group (83 [0.9% per year] versus 142 [1.6% per year]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.76; P<0.0001). Ischemic/uncertain strokes were reduced by nearly half (68 [0.7% per year] versus 132 [1.4% per year]; HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.68; P<0.0001) by the combination in comparison with aspirin. No significant difference was noted in the occurrence of stroke in the rivaroxaban alone group in comparison with aspirin: annualized rate of 0.7% (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65-1.05). The occurrence of fatal and disabling stroke (modified Rankin Scale, 3-6) was decreased by the combination (32 [0.3% per year] versus 55 [0.6% per year]; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.89; P=0.01). Independent predictors of stroke were prior stroke, hypertension, systolic blood pressure at baseline, age, diabetes mellitus, and Asian ethnicity. Prior stroke was the strongest predictor of incident stroke (HR, 3.63; 95% CI, 2.65-4.97; P<0.0001) and was associated with a 3.4% per year rate of stroke recurrence on aspirin. The effect of the combination in comparison with aspirin was consistent across subgroups with high stroke risk, including those with prior stroke. Conclusions: Low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin is an important new antithrombotic option for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with clinical atherosclerosis.

"Management of endocrine disease: Hypoparathyroidism in pregnancy: Review and evidence-based recommendations for management","2019","Purpose: Review calcium homeostasis in pregnancy and provide evidence-based best practice recommendations for the management of hypoparathyroidism in pregnancy. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from January 2000 to April 1, 2018. A total of 65 articles were included in the final review. Conclusions: During pregnancy, calcitriol levels increase by two- to-three-fold resulting in enhanced intestinal calcium absorption. The renal filtered calcium load increases leading to hypercalciuria. PTHrP production by the placenta and breasts increases by three-fold, and this may lower the doses of calcium and calcitriol required during pregnancy in mothers with hypoparathyroidism. The literature however describes a wide variation in the required doses of calcium and calcitriol during pregnancy in hypoparathyroid mothers, with some women requiring higher doses of calcitriol, whereas others require lower doses. Close monitoring is necessary as hypercalcemia in the mother may suppress the fetal parathyroid gland development. Also hypocalcemia in the mother is harmful as it may result in secondary hyperparathyroidism in the fetus. This may be associated with demineralization of the fetal skeleton and the development of intrauterine fractures. Inadequate treatment of hypoparathyroidism may also result in uterine contractions and an increased risk of miscarriage. Treatment targets during pregnancy are to maintain a low normal serum calcium. Calcium, calcitriol and vitamin D supplements are safe during pregnancy. Close monitoring of the mother with a multidisciplinary team is advised for optimal care. If calcium homeostasis is well controlled during pregnancy, most women with hypoparathyroidism have an uncomplicated pregnancy and give birth to healthy babies. ? 2019 European Society of Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.","calcitriol; calcium; vitamin D; calcitriol; calcium; calcium absorption; calcium blood level; calcium homeostasis; demineralization; evidence based practice; fracture; human; hypercalcemia; hypercalciuria; hypocalcemia; hypoparathyroidism; mother; parathyroid gland; pregnancy; priority journal; Review; secondary hyperparathyroidism; spontaneous abortion; uterus contraction; vitamin supplementation; blood; female; hypocalcemia; hypoparathyroidism; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; vitamin D deficiency; Calcitriol; Calcium; Female; Humans; Hypocalcemia; Hypoparathyroidism; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Vitamin D Deficiency"
"The burden of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in the era of antibiotic resistance","2019","Introduction: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a significant global health problem and leading cause of death and hospitalization in both the US and abroad. Increasing macrolide resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pathogens results in a greater disease burden, along with changing demographics and a higher preponderance of comorbid conditions. Areas covered: This review summarizes current data on the clinical and economic burden of CAP, with particular focus on community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Incidence, morbidity and mortality, and healthcare costs for the US and other regions of the world are among the topics covered. Major factors that are believed to be contributing to the increased impact of CABP, including antimicrobial resistance, the aging population, and the incidence of comorbidities are discussed, as well as unmet needs in current CABP management. Expert commentary: The clinical and economic burden of CABP is staggering, far-reaching, and expected to increase in the future as new antibiotic resistance mechanisms emerge and the world’s population ages. Important measures must be initiated to stabilize and potentially decrease this burden. Urgent needs in CABP management include the development of new antimicrobials, adjuvant therapies, and rapid diagnostics. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; aging; antibiotic resistance; bacterial pneumonia; community acquired bacterial pneumonia; community acquired pneumonia; comorbidity; disease burden; economic aspect; health care cost; human; morbidity; mortality; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Review; Streptococcus pneumoniae; bacterial pneumonia; community acquired infection; cost of illness; incidence; Streptococcus infection; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Community-Acquired Infections; Cost of Illness; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Incidence; Pneumonia, Bacterial; Streptococcal Infections"
"Patterns of seasonal and pandemic influenza-associated health care and mortality in Ontario, Canada","2019","Background: Mathematical and statistical models are used to project the future time course of infectious disease epidemics and the expected future burden on health care systems and economies. Influenza is a particularly important disease in this context because it causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. In order to forecast health care utilization during epidemics - and the effects of hospitalizations and deaths on the contact network and, in turn, on transmission dynamics - modellers must make assumptions about the lengths of time between infection, visiting a physician, being admitted to hospital, leaving hospital, and death. More reliable forecasts could be be made if the distributions of times between these types of events (""delay distributions"") were known. Methods: We estimated delay distributions in the province of Ontario, Canada, between 2006 and 2010. To do so, we used encrypted health insurance numbers to link 1.34 billion health care billing records to 4.27 million hospital inpatient stays. Because the four year period we studied included three typical influenza seasons and the 2009 influenza pandemic, we were able to compare the delay distributions in non-pandemic and pandemic settings. We also estimated conditional probabilities such as the probability of hospitalization within the year if diagnosed with influenza. Results: In non-pandemic [pandemic] years, delay distribution medians (inter-quartile ranges) were: Service to Admission 6.3 days (0.1-17.6 days) [2.4 days (-0.3-13.6 days)], Admission to Discharge 3 days (1.4-5.9 days) [2.6 days (1.2-5.1 days)], Admission to Death 5.3 days (2.1-11 days) [6 days (2.6-13.1 days)]. (Service date is defined as the date, within the year, of the first health care billing that included a diagnostic code for influenza-like-illness.) Among individuals diagnosed with either pneumonia or influenza in a given year, 19% [16%] were hospitalized within the year and 3% [2%] died in hospital. Among all individuals who were hospitalized, 10% [12%] were diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during the year and 5% [5%] died in hospital. Conclusion: Our empirical delay distributions and conditional probabilities should help facilitate more accurate forecasts in the future, including improved predictions of hospital bed demands during influenza outbreaks, and the expected effects of hospitalizations on epidemic dynamics. ? 2019 The Author(s).","forecasting; health insurance; hospitalization; human; influenza; mortality; Ontario; pandemic; probability; season; theoretical model; Forecasting; Hospitalization; Humans; Influenza, Human; Insurance, Health; Models, Theoretical; Ontario; Pandemics; Probability; Seasons"
"Risk of venous and arterial thrombosis in non-surgical patients receiving systemic tranexamic acid: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid (TXA)are commonly used as adjunctive therapies to prevent and treat excessive bleeding. In non-surgical settings, TXA is known to reduce bleeding related mortality. However, impact of TXA use on thrombosis is uncertain. Methods: We systematically searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases from January 1985 to August 2018. Studies with the following characteristics were included: (i)RCT design; (ii)compared systemic (oral or intravenous)TXA for prevention or treatment of bleeding for non-surgical indications and placebo or no TXA, and (iii)reported thrombotic events or mortality. A Mantel-Haenzel, random-effects model was used to calculate risk ratios, and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Our search identified 22 studies representing 49,538 patients. Those receiving TXA had a significantly lower risk of death from any cause (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.87–0.98; I2 = 0%). There was no significant increase in the risk of stroke (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.68–1.78; I2 = 31%), myocardial infarction (RR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.43–1.84; I2 = 46%), pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.75–1.26; I2 = 0%), or deep vein thrombosis (RR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.70–1.41; I2 = 0%)from use of TXA. The results were similar when restricted to studies at low risk of bias. Conclusions: In our systematic review and meta-analysis, the use of tranexamic acid reduced all-cause mortality without increased risk of venous or arterial thrombotic complications. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","tranexamic acid; all cause mortality; artery thrombosis; Article; bleeding; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; deep vein thrombosis; heart infarction; human; lung embolism; meta analysis; mortality rate; priority journal; risk reduction; systematic review; treatment indication; vein thrombosis"
"Vaccine strategies for prevention of community-acquired pneumonia in Canada Who would benefit most from pneumococcal immunization?","2019","Objective To describe the burden of pneumococcal disease and associated risk factors in the Canadian adult population, delineate available pneumococcal vaccines and associated efficacy and effectiveness data, and review current pneumococcal vaccine recommendations and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) prevention strategies in Canada. Quality of evidence Pneumococcal vaccination guidelines from the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization in 2013 and 2016 constitute level III evidence for CAP prevention in the Canadian adult population. Main message It is recommended that immunosuppressed adults of all ages receive the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (grades A and B recommendations). In 2016, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization also recommended that all adults aged 65 years and older receive PCV13 (grade A recommendation) on an individual basis, followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (grade B recommendation). This update is based on a large clinical study that demonstrated PCV13 efficacy against vaccine-type CAP in this population. Conclusion Physicians should focus on improving pneumococcal vaccination rates among adults, which remain low. Vaccination with PCV13 should also be considered for adults with chronic conditions, whose baseline risk is often higher than that for healthy individuals aged 65 years and older. ? 2019 College of Family Physicians of Canada.

"Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline","2019","Background: The purpose of this guideline is to optimize evaluation and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Methods: A multidisciplinary panel identified and prioritized five clinical questions. The panel performed systematic reviews of available studies (up to July 2018) and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework to develop recommendations. All panel members discussed and approved the recommendations. Recommendations: After considering the overall very low quality of the evidence, the panel made five conditional recommendations. We suggest that: 1) clinicians use a serum bicarbonate level,27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when suspicion for OHS is not very high (,20%) but to measure arterial blood gases in patients strongly suspected of having OHS, 2) stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airway pressure (PAP), 3) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than noninvasive ventilation be offered as the first-line treatment to stable ambulatory patients with OHS and coexistent severe obstructive sleep apnea, 4) patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2–3 mo), and 5) patients with OHS use weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25% to 30% of body weight to achieve resolution of OHS (which is more likely to be obtained with bariatric surgery). Conclusions: Clinicians may use these recommendations, on the basis of the best available evidence, to guide management and improve outcomes among patients with OHS.

"Answering Huxley: ""now"" students take a ""then"" exam","2019","Twenty-eight undergraduate students in a health sciences program volunteered for an exercise in the history of examinations. They had completed a second-year course in anatomy and physiology in which they studied modern texts and took standard contemporary exams. For this historical ""experiment,"" students studied selected chapters from two 19th century physiology texts (by Foster M. A Textbook of Physiology, 1895; and Broussais FJV. A Treatise on Physiology Applied to Pathology, 1828). They then took a 1-h-long exam in which they answered two essay-type questions set by Thomas Henry Huxley for second-year medical students at the University of London in 1853 and 1857. These were selected from a question bank provided by Dr. P. Mazumdar (University of Toronto). A questionnaire probed their contrasting experiences. Many wrote thoughtful, reflective comments on the exercise, which not only gave them an insight into the difficulties faced by students in the past, but also proved to be a valuable learning experience (average score: 8.6?±?1.6 SD).","education; health student; human; medical profession; physiology; procedures; psychology; Educational Measurement; Health Occupations; Humans; Physiology; Students, Health Occupations"
"Survival after Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in Metastatic Non-clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients: A Population-based Study","2019","Background: The benefit of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CNT) for cancer-specific mortality (CSM)-free survival is unclear in contemporary metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (non-ccmRCC) patients. Objective: To assess the role of CNT in non-ccmRCC patients. Design, setting, and participants: Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2001–2014), we identified patients with non-ccmRCC. Intervention: CNT versus no CNT in non-ccmRCC patients. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Multivariable logistic regression, cumulative incidence, competing-risks regression models, incremental survival benefit (ISB), conditional survival, and landmark analyses were performed. Sensitivity analyses focused on histological subtypes and most contemporary patients (2010–2014). Results and limitations: Of 851 patients with non-ccmRCC, 67.6% underwent CNT. In multivariable logistic regression, year of diagnosis in contemporary (p < 0.001) and intermediate (p = 0.008) tertiles, as well as age ?75 yr (p < 0.001) yielded lower CNT rates. Cumulative incidence showed 2-yr CSM of 52.6% versus 77.7%, respectively, after CNT versus no CNT. CSM after CNT versus no CNT was invariably lower in all histologic subtypes and in contemporary patients. Multivariable competing-risks regression models predicting CSM favored CNT (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.38, confidence interval: 0.30–0.47, p < 0.001) in all patients and in all subgroups defined by histologic subtypes (HR: 0.14–0.43, all p ? 0.02), as well as in contemporary patients (HR: 0.32, p < 0.001). The ISB analyses yielded statistically significant and clinically meaningful CSM-free survival benefit of +3 mo after CNT versus no CNT in individuals with observed CSM-free survival ?24 mo. The 2-yr CSM-free survival increased from baseline of 46.1% versus 19.4% (Δ = 26.7%, p < 0.001) to 70.3% versus 54.4% (Δ = 15.9%, p = 0.005) after CNT versus no CNT, in patients that survived 12 mo, respectively. Landmark analyses rejected bias favoring CNT. Data were retrospective. Conclusions: CSM is lower after CNT for non-ccmRCC in all histologic subtypes and in contemporary patients except for unproven ISB in collecting duct patients. This observation should encourage greater CNT consideration in non-ccmRCC. Patient summary: Cytoreductive nephrectomy appears to improve survival in metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, but it is used infrequently. ? 2017 European Association of UrologyCytoreductive nephrectomy reduces cancer-specific mortality in all histologic subtypes and in contemporary metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients; however, it might be performed too rarely. ? 2017 European Association of Urology","adult; age; aged; Article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer registry; clinical effectiveness; cytoreductive surgery; female; histology; human; major clinical study; male; metastatic non clear cell renal cell carcinoma; mortality rate; nephrectomy; population research; renal cell carcinoma; retrospective study; sensitivity analysis; survival rate; treatment outcome; trend study; tumor volume"
"Population-based trend analysis of voiding cystourethrogram ordering practices in a single-payer healthcare system before and after the release of evaluation guidelines","2019","Introduction: While voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)is a widely-accepted test, it is invasive and associated with radiation exposure. Most cases of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)are low-grade and unlikely to be associated with acquired renal scarring. To select patients at greatest risk, in 2011 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)published guidelines for evaluation of children ages 2 - 24 months with urinary tract infections (UTIs). Similarly, in 2010 the Society for Fetal Urology (SFU)published guidelines for patients with hydronephrosis. Herein a prospectively-collected database was queried through the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), exploring trends in VCUG ordering within the Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP), which guarantees universal access to care. Material and methods: A dedicated ICES analyst extracted data on all patients younger than 18 years in Ontario, Canada, with billing codes for VCUG and ICD-9 codes for VUR, from 2004-2014. The baseline characteristics included patient age, gender, geographic region, specialty of ordering provider and previous diagnoses of UTI and/or antenatal hydronephrosis to determine the indication for ordering the test. Of these, patients were subsequently incurred OHIP procedure codes for endoscopic injection or ureteral reimplantation. Patients who had a VCUG in the setting of urethral trauma, posterior urethral valves, and neurogenic bladder were excluded. Results and discussion: Trend analysis demonstrated that the total number of VCUGs ordered in the province has decreased over a decade (Figure 1), with a concurrent decrease in VUR diagnosis. On multivariate regression analysis, the decrease in VCUG ordering could not be explained by changes in population demographics or other baseline patient variables. Most VCUGs obtained per year were ordered by pediatricians or family physicians (mean 2,022+523.8), compared with urologists and nephrologists (mean 616+358.3). Interestingly, while the rate of VCUG requests decreased, the annual number of surgeries performed for VUR (endoscopic or open)did not show a significant reduction over time. Conclusions: We present a large population-based analysis in a universal access to care system, reporting a decreasing trend in the number of cystograms and differences by primary care versus specialist providers. While it is reassuring to see practice patterns favorably impacted by guidelines, it is also encouraging to note that the number of surgeries has remained stable. This suggests that patients at risk continue to be detected and offered surgical correction. These data confirm previous institution-based assessments and affirm changes in VCUG ordering independent of variables not relevant to the healthcare system, such as the insurance status. ? 2019 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company","Article; child; cystourethrography; data base; female; health care access; health care system; human; ICD-9; major clinical study; male; population research; practice guideline; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; trend study; voiding cystourethrogram"
"Surgical outcomes of VRAM versus gracilis flaps for the reconstruction of pelvic defects following oncologic resection ?","2019","PURPOSE: Pelvic reconstruction following abdominoperineal resection or pelvic exenteration is associated with signification surgical site morbidity. Immediate pelvic reconstruction with a muscle flap is now the gold standard, associated with reduced perineal morbidity compared to primary closure alone. 2,3 The purpose of the present study was to directly compare outcomes of VRAM and gracilis flap pelvic reconstruction following oncologic resection. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review was performed of 88 patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection or pelvic exenteration and immediate pelvic reconstruction, either with a VRAM (N = 61) or Gracilis flap (N = 27). Electronic medical records were analyzed for patient demographics, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes. Mortality, minor complication rate, major complication rate and time to complete wound healing was compared between groups. RESULTS: Overall, there was no significant difference in the minor complication rate (44% gracilis vs 48% VRAM, p = 0.8), major complication rate (19% gracilis vs 13% of VRAM, p = 0.53), 30-day mortality (0% VRAM vs 0% gracilis, p = 1.0) and median time to complete wound healing (68 days vs 67 days, p = 0.19) between the gracilis and VRAM groups. Muscle-only gracilis flaps had a significantly reduced healing time compared to musculocutaneous gracilis flaps (48 days vs 85 days, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The workhorse flap in pelvic reconstruction remains the VRAM. While previous studies have alluded to the inferiority of thigh based flaps compared to the VRAM, we demonstrate here that pelvic reconstruction with the gracilis flap can be performed with comparable donor and recipient complication rates and similar time to complete wound healing as the VRAM. ? 2019","adult; anus cancer; Article; cancer surgery; clinical outcome; comparative study; Crohn disease; electronic medical record; endometrium cancer; female; gracilis flap; graft failure; graft necrosis; hematoma; human; infection; jejunum cancer; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; ovary cancer; pelvis exenteration; perianal paget disease; postoperative complication; preoperative radiotherapy; priority journal; rectum abdominoperineal resection; rectum cancer; retrospective study; seroma; surgical technique; urethral cancer; uterine cervix cancer; vertical rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap; vulva cancer; wound dehiscence; wound healing; clinical trial; free tissue graft; gracilis muscle; middle aged; neoplasm; pelvis; procedures; reconstructive surgery; rectus abdominis muscle; transplantation; Female; Free Tissue Flaps; Gracilis Muscle; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Pelvis; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rectus Abdominis"
"In Vitro Self-Renewal Assays for Brain Tumor Stem Cells","2019","Early development of human organisms relies on stem cells, a population of non-specialized cells that can divide symmetrically to give rise to two identical daughter cells, or divide asymmetrically to produce one identical daughter cell and another more specialized cell. The capacity to undergo cellular divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state is termed self-renewal and is responsible for the maintenance of stem cell populations during development. In addition, self-renewal plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of developed organism through replacement of defective cells. Similar to their non-malignant counterparts, it has been postulated that tumor cells follow a differentiation hierarchy, with the least differentiated cells termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) at the apex. These tumor stem cells possess the ability to self-renew, have a higher capacity to initiate tumor growth when xenografted into an animal model, and can recapitulate the cell heterogeneity of the tumor they originate from. Hence, further investigation of mechanisms governing the self-renewal in cancer can lead to development of novel therapies targeting CSCs. In this chapter, we described the soft agar assay and the limiting dilution assay (LDA) as two easy-to-implement and inexpensive assays to measure the stemness properties of brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). These techniques constitute useful tools for the preclinical evaluation of therapeutic strategies targeting BTSCs clonogenicity. ?

"Clinical disease activity and endoscopic severity correlate poorly in children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease","2019","Background and Aims: Treatment goals in Crohn's disease (CD) have evolved to target mucosal healing. There is now a drive to determine if noninvasive measures can adequately identify the attainment and persistence of this goal. Currently, data describing the relationship between clinical indices and endoscopic appearance in pediatric CD are sparse. Our aim was to compare endoscopic severity with the weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) in children with newly diagnosed CD. Methods: All children aged ?17 years newly diagnosed with CD enrolled in an inception cohort at sites of the Canadian Children Inflammatory Bowel Disease Network were eligible. Clinical disease activity at presentation was evaluated by the wPCDAI and conventional biochemical parameters. Severity of disease at ileocolonoscopy was assessed by the simple endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD), with segmental subscores noted. We evaluated the association of SES-CD and disease activity markers using the Pearson test of correlation, the Spearman rank coefficient, and linear regression models. Results: Two hundred eighty patients from 11 centers were included in the analysis. The median wPCDAI score was 60 (interquartile range, 40-80; 53% severe). Median SES-CD was 16 (interquartile range 10-22; 51% severe). The wPCDAI correlated weakly with SES-CD (r =.39, P <.001). Examination of the individual components that contribute to the wPCDAI demonstrated weak correlation with the SES-CD for all items apart from stooling (moderate correlation, r =.50, P <.001). Routine blood tests did not correlate well with the SES-CD. In regression models, variation in clinical symptoms accounted for most of the variation in both the wPCDAI and SES-CD, with no additional benefit from routine blood tests. Conclusions: In children with newly diagnosed CD, wPCDAI correlates poorly with endoscopic disease activity. As treatment paradigms evolve to target mucosal healing, clinical markers should not be used in isolation to determine disease activity. ? 2019","adolescent; Article; assessment of humans; blood analysis; blood biochemistry; Canada; Canadian; chemical parameters; child; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation coefficient; Crohn disease; digestive system disease assessment; disease marker; disease severity; female; gastrointestinal endoscopy; human; ileocolonoscopy; inflammatory bowel disease; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index; priority journal; prospective study; school child; scoring system; simple endoscopic score for CD; symptom; colon; colonoscopy; Crohn disease; digestive tract endoscopy; ileum; intestine mucosa; pathology; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; statistical model; Adolescent; Child; Colon; Colonoscopy; Crohn Disease; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Female; Humans; Ileum; Intestinal Mucosa; Linear Models; Male; Severity of Illness Index"
"Patient-Reported Outcomes and Endoscopic Appearance of Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","2019","Background & Aims: We aimed to evaluate the association of the patient-reported outcomes for rectal bleeding and stool frequency among patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in endoscopic remission. Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies reporting the association of patient-reported outcomes (the patient-reported components of the Mayo score: rectal bleeding and stool frequency) and endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1). We performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy using the hierarchical bivariate method. Results: Our meta-analysis consisted of 5 studies comprising 2132 participants. A rectal bleeding subscore of 0 identified patients in endoscopic remission with a pooled sensitivity value of 81% (95% CI, 73%–86%), a specificity value of 68% (95% CI, 61%–75%), a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 2.5 (95% CI, 2.2–3.0), and a negative LR of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.22–0.37). A stool frequency subscore of 0 identified patients in endoscopic remission with a pooled sensitivity value of 40% (95% CI, 25%–58%), a specificity value of 93% (95% CI, 86%–97%), a positive LR of 6.0 (95% CI, 3.7–9.7), and negative LR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50–0.82). A combined rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscore of 0 identified patients in endoscopic remission with a pooled sensitivity value of 36% (95% CI, 22%–54%), a specificity value of 96% (95% CI, 91%–98%), a positive LR or 8.4 (95% CI, 5.5–12.8), and a negative LR or 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53–0.84). Conclusions: In a meta-analysis of 5 studies, we found that most patients with UC and normal rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores have attained endoscopic remission. Many patients in endoscopic remission from UC have no rectal bleeding. Normal stool frequency associates with endoscopic remission, but many patients have abnormal stool frequencies despite endoscopic remission. These results should be carefully considered given the high heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals for some outcomes. ? 2019 AGA Institute","bivariate analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; endoscopic remission; endoscopy; feces analysis; human; likelihood ratio; Mayo endoscopic subscore; Mayo score; patient-reported outcome; predictive value; prospective study; rating scale; rectal bleeding subscore; rectum hemorrhage; remission; Review; scoring system; statistical model; sttol frequency; systematic review; ulcerative colitis"
"How Do Older Adults Decide to Visit the Emergency Department? Patient and Caregiver Perspectives","2019","Seniors account for a high number of emergency department (ED) visits, yet little is known about how they decide to visit the ED. This paper reports on the results of surveys completed by 264 seniors who visited the ED and their caregivers and interviews with a subset (N = 51) of survey respondents, aimed at understanding how they decide to visit the ED. Although older adults rely on others to help them decide whether to visit the ED, only a small proportion consult healthcare providers in doing so. Opportunities exist for enhancing seniors' decision-making process regarding ED visits and access to community-based healthcare to avoid ED visits.

"Patterned cellulose nanocrystal aerogel films with tunable dimensions and morphologies as ultra-porous scaffolds for cell culture","2019","Aerogel films are interesting as coatings due to their unique properties including high surface area, sorption capacity and insulating properties. To date, silica-based aerogel films have been most widely explored due to their ultrahigh surface areas and well-known chemistry. However, the fragile nature of silica aerogels coupled with the limited control over film thickness and dimensions when using traditional deposition techniques limits their use in applications requiring films with good mechanical stability (e.g., in flexible devices). To address these challenges, we present a pressure-aided freeze casting method to pattern, on a variety of substrates (e.g., glass or flexible polyethylene terephthalate), mechanically robust aerogel films composed of covalently cross-linked cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with controlled dimensions and internal morphology. To accomplish this, a film of the desired aerogel thickness was deposited on the substrate and a mold with the specific shape for the aerogel was fabricated by xurography (>1 mm lateral dimensions, 7-85 μm thickness) or photolithography (2-500 μm lateral dimensions, 3 μm thickness). An aqueous gel of reactive CNCs or CNCs with poly(oligoethylene-glycol-methacrylate) was drop cast onto the substrate, and pressure was applied so that the gel adopted the mold shape. The gel was subsequently frozen and lyophilized, and the mold was lifted off the substrate, leaving behind patterned porous aerogel films, which were first explored as cell culture scaffolds. Human prostate cancer cells strongly adhered to the aerogels, where individual cells could be isolated on small aerogel arrays while cell clusters were obtained on larger arrays. This system has potential applications in studying single-cell phenotype and developing miniaturized cell-based assays. The simplicity of this freeze casting and lift-off patterning technique makes it attractive for the fabrication of cellulose-nanocrystal-based aerogels with a variety of compositions for applications requiring materials with high surface area, low density, and good mechanical stability. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Casting; Cell culture; Cells; Cellulose; Cellulose derivatives; Cellulose films; Crosslinking; Diseases; Mechanical stability; Microporous materials; Molds; Morphology; Nanocrystals; Plastic bottles; Scaffolds (biology); Silica; Silica gel; Substrates; Cell scaffold; flexible; Freeze Casting; Hierarchically porous; Micro patterning; POEGMA; Aerogels; Bottles; Casting; Cells; Cellulose Derivatives; Diseases; Molds; Plastic Containers"
"Interferon-β induced in female genital epithelium by HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 via Toll-like-receptor 2 pathway acts to protect the mucosal barrier","2019","More than 40% of HIV infections occur via female reproductive tract (FRT) through heterosexual transmission. Epithelial cells that line the female genital mucosa are the first line of defense against HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted pathogens. These sentient cells recognize and respond to external stimuli by induction of a range of carefully balanced innate immune responses. Previously, we have shown that in response to HIV-1 gp120, the genital epithelial cells (GECs) from upper reproductive tract induce an inflammatory response that may facilitate HIV-1 translocation and infection. In this study, we report that the endometrial and endocervical GECs simultaneously induce biologically active interferon-β (IFNβ) antiviral responses following exposure to HIV-1 that act to protect the epithelial tight junction barrier. The innate antiviral response was directly induced by HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 and addition of gp120 neutralizing antibody inhibited IFNβ production. Interferon-β was induced by gp120 in upper GECs through Toll-like receptor 2 signaling and required presence of heparan sulfate on epithelial cell surface. The induction of IFNβ was dependent upon activation of transcription factor IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). The IFNβ was biologically active, had a protective effect on epithelial tight junction barrier and was able to inhibit HIV-1 infection in TZM-bl indicator cells and HIV-1 replication in T cells. This is the first report that recognition of HIV-1 by upper GECs leads to induction of innate antiviral pathways. This could explain the overall low infectivity of HIV-1 in the FRT and could be exploited for HIV-1 prophylaxis. ? 2018, The Chinese Society of Immunology and The University of Science and Technology of China, All rights reserved.","beta interferon; glycoprotein gp 120; heparan sulfate; interferon regulatory factor 3; toll like receptor 2; adult; Article; cell surface; controlled study; cytokine production; embryo; endometrium; epithelium cell; female; female genital system; genital epithelial cell; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; human tissue; innate immunity; nonhuman; T lymphocyte; tight junction; TLR signaling; uterine endocervix; virus replication"
"Severe Maternal Morbidity in Canada: Temporal Trends and Regional Variations, 2003-2016","2019","Objective: This study sought to quantify temporal trends and provincial and territorial variations in severe maternal morbidity (SMM) in Canada. Methods: The study used data on all hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Qu?bec) from 2003 to 2016 to examine temporal trends and from 2012 to 2016 to study regional variations. SMM was identified using diagnosis and intervention codes. Contrasts among periods and regions were quantified using rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Temporal changes were also assessed using chi-square tests for trend (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1). Results: The study population included 3 882 790 deliveries between 2003 and 2016 and 1 418 545 deliveries between 2012 and 2016. Severe hemorrhage rates increased from 44.8 in 2003 to 62.4 per 10 000 deliveries in 2012 (P for trend <0.0001) and then declined to 41.8 per 10 000 deliveries in 2016 (P for trend <0.0001). Maternal intensive care unit admission and sepsis rates decreased between 2003 and 2016, whereas rates of stroke, severe uterine rupture, hysterectomy, obstetric embolism, shock, and assisted ventilation increased. Rates of composite SMM in 2012-2016 were higher in Newfoundland and Labrador (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.04–1.26), Nova Scotia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03–1.19), New Brunswick (RR1.22; 95% CI 1.13–1.32), Manitoba (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.03–1.15), Saskatchewan (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09–1.22), the Yukon (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.35–2.25), and Nunavut (RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.46–2.11) compared with the rest of Canada, whereas rates were lower in Alberta and British Columbia. Conclusion: This surveillance report helps inform clinical practice and public health policy for improving maternal health in Canada. ? 2019","adult; Alberta; Article; assisted ventilation; bleeding; British Columbia; Canada; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; embolism; female; health survey; hospital admission; human; hysterectomy; intensive care unit; major clinical study; Manitoba; maternal morbidity; maternal welfare; New Brunswick; Newfoundland and Labrador; Nova Scotia; Nunavut; obstetric delivery; public policy; regional variation; Saskatchewan; sepsis; severe maternal morbidity; shock; temporal trend; trend study; uterus rupture; Yukon"
"Dynamic angiogenic switch as predictor of response to chemotherapy-bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer","2019","Background: Previous studies have shown that metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients treated with bevacizumab, experience variation in the plasma levels of angiogenesis growth factors and related cytokines, called angiogenic switch (AS). The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between AS and the clinical response during standard chemotherapy-bevacizumab treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1 mCRC were eligible. Patients received treatment with standard dose capecitabine plus either oxaliplatin or irinotecan and bevacizumab for 6 cycles. Initial treatment was followed by maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus capecitabine until progression. Plasma levels of angiogenic-related cytokines (hepatocyte growth factor, placental growth factor, macrophage chemoattractant protein-3, MM-9, eotaxin, basic fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin 18) were prospectively analyzed at baseline and every 8 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: A total of 71 patients were enrolled. AS was observed in 45 patients (63.4%), 28 of whom experienced AS at the first evaluation after treatment start. Disease control, which includes partial/complete response and stable disease, was seen in 96% of AS patients (43/45), but only in 15/26 (58%) for the remaining patients without evidence of AS (P<0.001). The median PFS of AS patients was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval, 8.6-15.8) versus 8.3 months for patients without AS (95% confidence interval, 5.6-16.4; P=0.04). Conclusions: Chemotherapy plus Bevacizumab combination in mCRC patients results in dynamic changes in plasma cytokines, which is associated with better disease control and longer PFS. These new findings support continuing studying AS as a potential marker of angiogenesis inhibitor effectiveness. ? Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Adiponectin—consideration for its role in skeletal muscle health","2019","Adiponectin regulates metabolism through blood glucose control and fatty acid oxidation, partly mediated by downstream effects of adiponectin signaling in skeletal muscle. More recently, skeletal muscle has been identified as a source of adiponectin expression, fueling interest in the role of adiponectin as both a circulating adipokine and a locally expressed paracrine/autocrine factor. In addition to being metabolically responsive, skeletal muscle functional capacity, calcium handling, growth and maintenance, regenerative capacity, and susceptibility to chronic inflammation are all strongly influenced by adiponectin stimulation. Furthermore, physical exercise has clear links to adiponectin expression and circulating concentrations in healthy and diseased populations. Greater physical activity is generally related to higher adiponectin expression while lower adiponectin levels are found in inactive obese, pre-diabetic, and diabetic populations. Exercise training typically restores plasma adiponectin and is associated with improved insulin sensitivity. Thus, the role of adiponectin signaling in skeletal muscle has expanded beyond that of a metabolic regulator to include several aspects of skeletal muscle function and maintenance critical to muscle health, many of which are responsive to, and mediated by, physical exercise. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Hormone replacement therapy and opioid tapering for opioid-induced hypogonadism among patients with chronic noncancer pain: A systematic review","2019","Objective. To systematically review evidence addressing the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and opioid tapering for opioid-induced hypogonadism among patients with chronic noncancer pain. Study Design. Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Methods. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO through August 2017. Eligible studies enrolled 10 patients with chronic noncancer pain and opioid-induced hypogonadism and reported the effect of TRT or opioid tapering on a patient-important outcome collected 14 days after treatment. Pairs of reviewers independently screened for eligible studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. Results. Of 666 abstracts reviewed, five studies including one RCT (N 5 84) and four observational studies (N 5 157) were eligible. No studies explored the effect of opioid tapering for opioid-induced hypogonadism. Very low-quality evidence found that TRT was associated with improvements in pain (median reduction of 2 points on the 11-point numerical rating scale for pain; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 –1.4 to –2.6; minimally important difference [MID] 5 2 points), and emotional functioning (mean increase of 9 points on the 100-point SF-36 Mental Component Summary score; 95% CI 5 4.40 to 13.60; MID 5 5 points). Low-quality evidence suggested that TRT had no effect on sleep quality, sexual function, physical functioning, role functioning, or social functioning; very low-quality evidence suggested no association with depressive symptoms. Conclusions. Low-quality to very low-quality evidence suggests that TRT may improve pain and emotional functioning, but not other outcomes, in chronic noncancer pain patients with opioid-induced hypogonadism. ? 2018 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

"Oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy (PACE): a systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and safety","2019","Background: Oral immunotherapy is an emerging experimental treatment for peanut allergy, but its benefits and harms are unclear. We systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of oral immunotherapy versus allergen avoidance or placebo (no oral immunotherapy) for peanut allergy. Methods: In the Peanut Allergen immunotherapy, Clarifying the Evidence (PACE) systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, Latin American &amp; Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WHO's Clinical Trials Registry Platform, US Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicines Agency databases from inception to Dec 6, 2018, for randomised controlled trials comparing oral immunotherapy versus no oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy, without language restrictions. We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias independently in duplicate. Main outcomes included anaphylaxis, allergic or adverse reactions, epinephrine use, and quality of life, meta-analysed by random effects. We assessed certainty (quality) of evidence by the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019117930. Results: 12 trials (n=1041; median age across trials 8·7 years [IQR 5·9–11·2]) showed that oral immunotherapy versus no oral immunotherapy increased anaphylaxis risk (risk ratio [RR] 3·12 [95% CI 1·76–5·55], I2=0%, risk difference [RD] 15·1%, high-certainty), anaphylaxis frequency (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2·72 [1·57–4·72], I2=0%, RD 12·2%, high-certainty), and epinephrine use (RR 2·21 [1·27–3·83], I2=0%, RD 4·5%, high-certainty) similarly during build-up and maintenance (pinteraction=0·92). Oral immunotherapy increased serious adverse events (RR 1·92 [1·00–3·66], I2=0%, RD 5·7%, moderate-certainty), and non-anaphylactic reactions (vomiting: RR 1·79 [95%CI 1·35–2·38], I2=0%, high-certainty; angioedema: 2·25 [1·13–4·47], I2=0%, high-certainty; upper tract respiratory reactions: 1·36 [1·02–1·81], I2=0%, moderate-certainty; lower tract respiratory reactions: 1·55 [0·96–2·50], I2=28%, moderate-certainty). Passing a supervised challenge, a surrogate for preventing out-of-clinic reactions, was more likely with oral immunotherapy (RR 12·42 [95% CI 6·82–22·61], I2=0%, RD 36·5%, high-certainty). Quality of life was not different between groups (combined parents and self report RR 1·21 [0·87–1·69], I2=0%, RD 0·03%, low-certainty). Findings were robust to IRR, trial sequential, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: In patients with peanut allergy, high-certainty evidence shows that available peanut oral immunotherapy regimens considerably increase allergic and anaphylactic reactions over avoidance or placebo, despite effectively inducing desensitisation. Safer peanut allergy treatment approaches and rigorous randomised controlled trials that evaluate patient-important outcomes are needed.

"Accuracy of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System in Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Image Analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma or Overall Malignancy—A Systematic Review","2019","Background & Aims: The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) categorizes observations from imaging analyses of high-risk patients based on the level of suspicion for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and overall malignancy. The categories range from definitely benign (LR-1) to definitely HCC (LR-5), malignancy (LR-M), or tumor in vein (LR-TIV) based on findings from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, the actual percentage of HCC and overall malignancy within each LI-RADS category is not known. We performed a systematic review to determine the percentage of observations in each LI-RADS category for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging that are HCCs or malignancies. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus databases from 2014 through 2018 for studies that reported the percentage of observations in each LI-RADS v2014 and v2017 category that were confirmed as HCCs or other malignancies based on pathology, follow-up imaging analyses, or response to treatment (reference standard). Data were assessed on a per-observation basis. Random-effects models were used to determine the pooled percentages of HCC and overall malignancy for each LI-RADS category. Differences between categories were compared by analysis of variance of logit-transformed percentage of HCC and overall malignancy. Risk of bias and concerns about applicability were assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. Results: Of 454 studies identified, 17 (all retrospective studies) were included in the final analysis, consisting of 2760 patients, 3556 observations, and 2482 HCCs. The pooled percentages of observations confirmed as HCC and overall malignancy, respectively, were 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 92%–96%) and 97% (95% CI 95%–99%) for LR-5, 74% (95% CI 67%–80%) and 80% (95% CI 75%–85%) for LR-4, 38% (95% CI 31%–45%) and 40% (95% CI 31%–50%) for LR-3, 13% (95% CI 8%–22%) and 14% (95% CI 9%–21%) for LR-2, 79% (95% CI 63%–89%) and 92% (95% CI 77%–98%) for LR-TIV, and 36% (95% CI 26%–48%) and 93% (95% CI 87%–97%) for LR-M. No malignancies were found in the LR-1 group. The percentage of HCCs and overall malignancies confirmed differed significantly among LR groups 2–5 (P <.00001). Patient selection was the most frequent factor that affected bias risk, because of verification bias and case–control study design. Conclusions: In a systematic review, we found that increasing LI-RADS categories contained increasing percentages of HCCs and overall malignancy based on reference standard confirmation. Of observations categorized as LR-M, 93% were malignancies and 36% were confirmed as HCCs. The percentage of HCCs found in the LR-2 and LR-3 categories indicate the need for a more active management strategy than currently recommended. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

"You can dance if you want to: A case of Sydenham's chorea","2019","Isolated motor disturbances in the paediatric population are uncommon presentations to the emergency department. Choreiform movements have a broad differential diagnosis and may present insidiously with progressive worsening of asymmetric clumsiness, hypotonia and dysarthria. The incidence of Sydenham's chorea (SC) caused by acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is very rare in developed countries. We report a previously healthy, vaccinated 9-year old male who presented to our ED with intermittent and progressive right sided clumsiness for four weeks. Physical examination findings showed dysdiadokinesis and dysmetric movements of the right side, which varied in intensity and were less pronounced on serial re-examination during the same ED visit. Basic bloodwork, MRI and MRA/V showed no abnormalities, and the patient was discharged home with urgent neurology follow-up. He re-presented to our ED four days later with worsening gait and inability to hold a pencil at school. He was subsequently diagnosed with chorea by the neurology team. The cause of chorea was later determined to be SC, and the patient's throat swab came back positive for group A-beta hemolytic strep (GAS) infection. We explore current literature regarding the various presentations of ARF, differential considerations in acute chorea, and diagnostic studies needed to determine the etiology of acute chorea. With the low incidence of chorea in developed nations, this diagnosis can be easily overlooked. We highlight the importance of this diagnosis, as well as primary and secondary treatment in ARF. ? 2019","antistreptolysin; penicillin derivative; Article; case report; child; chorea minor; clinical article; developmental coordination disorder; disease course; dysdiadochokinesis; dyskinesia; dysmetria; echocardiography; emergency ward; follow up; gait; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; male; mitral valve regurgitation; motor dysfunction; motor function test; nonhuman; priority journal; school child; slurred speech; Streptococcus pyogenes; throat culture; viral upper respiratory tract infection"
"Longitudinal trajectories and reference centiles for the impact of health conditions on daily activities of children with cerebral palsy","2019","Aim: First, to describe the impact of health conditions on daily activities over time in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and to create age-specific reference centiles. Second, to determine the amount of change typical over a 1-year period, across Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels. Method: A prospective, cohort design, with five assessments over 2 years, involved 708 children with a confirmed diagnosis of CP participating in the On Track Study (396 males, 312 females; mean age 6y [SD 2y 7mo]; range 18mo–12y at first assessment; 32.1% in GMFCS level I, 22.7% in GMFCS level II, 11.2% in GMFCS level III, 18.2% in GMFCS level IV, 15.7% in GMFCS level V). The impact of health conditions on daily activities was assessed using the Child Health Conditions Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models and quantile regression. Results: Linear longitudinal trajectories describe the relatively stable impact of health conditions over time for each functional level for children aged 2 years to 12 years, with the lowest scores (least impact) in GMFCS level I and the highest scores (highest impact) in GMFCS level V. Centiles were created for children in each GMFCS level. A system to interpret the magnitude of change over time in centiles was developed. Interpretation: Longitudinal trajectories of co-occurring health conditions assist with understanding children's prognoses. Centiles assist in understanding a child's experience relative to children in similar GMFCS levels. Guidelines are provided to determine if children are progressing ‘as expected’, ‘better than expected’ or ‘more poorly than expected’ in regard to the impact of health conditions on daily activities. What this paper adds: For children with cerebral palsy, the mean impact of health conditions on daily activities is relatively stable. Significant intraindividual and interindividual variability for the impact of health conditions exists, which complicates prognosis. Centiles enable interpretation of the impact of health conditions relative to Gross Motor Function Classification System level. ? 2018 Mac Keith Press","Article; caregiver; cerebral palsy; child; child health; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; daily life activity; female; Gross Motor Function Classification System; human; infant; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; motor development; physical examination; practice guideline; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; age; cerebral palsy; child development; motor performance; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; time factor; Activities of Daily Living; Age Factors; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Time Factors"
"Use of a qualification phantom for PET brain imaging in a multicenter consortium: A collaboration between the pediatric brain tumor consortium and the SNMMI clinical trials network","2019","The purpose of this study was to assess image quality and quantitative brain PET across a multicenter consortium. Methods: All academic centers and children’s hospitals in the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) scanned a phantom developed by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Clinical Trials Network (SNMMI CTN) for the validation of brain PET studies associated with clinical trials. The phantom comprises 2 separate, fillable sections: a resolution/uniformity section and a clinical simulation section. The resolution/uniformity section is a cylinder 12.7 cm long and 20 cm in diameter; spatial resolution is evaluated subjectively with 2 sets of rods (hot and cold) of varying diameter (4.0, 5.0, 6.25, 7.81, 9.67, and 12.2 mm) and spacing (twice the rod diameter). The clinical simulation section simulates a transverse section of midbrain with ventricles and gray and white matter compartments. If properly filled, hot rods have a 4:1 target-to-background ratio, and gray–to–white matter sections have a 4:1 ratio. Uniformity and image quality were evaluated using the SUV in a small volume of interest as well as subjectively by 2 independent observers using a 4-point scale. Results: Eleven PBTC sites scanned the phantom on 13 PET scanners. The phantom’s complexity led to suboptimal filling, particularly of the hot rod section, in 5 sites. The SUV in the uniformity section was within 10% of unity on only 5 of 13 scanners, although 12 of 13 were subjectively judged to have very good to excellent uniformity. Four of 6 hot rods were discernable by all 13 scanners, whereas 3 of 6 cold rods were discernable by only 5 scanners. Four of 13 scanners had a gray–to–white matter ratio between 3.0 and 5.0 (4.0 is truth); however, 11 of 13 scanners were subjectively judged to have very good or excellent image quality. Conclusion: Eleven sites were able to image a powerful phantom developed by the SNMMI CTN that evaluated image uniformity, spatial resolution, and image quality of brain PET. There was considerable variation in PET data across the PBTC sites, possibly resulting from variations in scanning across the sites due to challenges in filling the phantom.

"Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy and Drug Discovery Platform Using Human Sensory Neurons Converted Directly from Adult Peripheral Blood","2019","Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a disorder damaging the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and represents one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy, negatively impacting the quality of life of patients to the extent of withdrawing life-saving chemotherapy dose or duration. Unfortunately, the pathophysiological effects of PN are poorly understood, in part due to the lack of availability of large numbers of human sensory neurons (SNs) for study. Previous reports have demonstrated that human SNs can be directly converted from primitive CD34+ hematopoietic cells, but was limited to a small-scale product of SNs and derived exclusively from less abundant allogenic sources of cord or drug mobilized peripheral blood (PB). To address this shortcoming, we have developed and report detailed procedures toward the generation of human SN directly converted from conventionally drawn PB of adults that can be used in a high-content screening platform for discovery-based studies of chemotherapy agents on neuronal biology. In the absence of mobilization drugs, cryogenically preserved adult human PB could be induced to (i)SN via development through expandable neural precursor differentiation. iSNs could be transferable to high-throughput procedures suitable for high-content screening applicable to neuropathy for example, alterations in neurite morphology in response to chemotherapeutics. Our study provides the first reported platform using adult PB-derived iSNs to study peripheral nervous system-related neuropathies as well as target and drug screening potential for the ability to prevent, block, or repair chemotherapy-induced PN damage.

"Outcomes of hospitalized hematologic oncology patients receiving rapid response system activation for acute deterioration","2019","Background: Patients with hematologic malignancies who are admitted to hospital are at increased risk of deterioration and death. Rapid response systems (RRSs) respond to hospitalized patients who clinically deteriorate. We sought to describe the characteristics and outcomes of hematologic oncology inpatients requiring rapid response system (RRS) activation, and to determine the prognostic accuracy of the SIRS and qSOFA criteria for in-hospital mortality of hematologic oncology patients with suspected infection. Methods: We used registry data from two hospitals within The Ottawa Hospital network, between 2012 and 2016. Consecutive hematologic oncology inpatients who experienced activation of the RRS were included in the study. Data was gathered at the time of RRS activation and assessment. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Logistical regression was used to evaluate for predictors of in-hospital mortality. Results: We included 401 patients during the study period. In-hospital mortality for all included patients was 41.9% (168 patients), and 145 patients (45%) were admitted to ICU following RRS activation. Among patients with suspected infection at the time of RRS activation, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria had a sensitivity of 86.9% (95% CI 80.9-91.6) and a specificity of 38.2% (95% CI 31.9-44.8) for predicting in-hospital mortality, while Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) criteria had a sensitivity of 61.9% (95% CI 54.1-69.3) and a specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 87.1-94.7). Factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality included transfer to ICU after RRS activation (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.56, 95% CI 2.12-5.97) and a higher number of RRS activations (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.63-3.69). Factors associated with improved survival included active malignancy treatment at the time of RRS activation (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86) and longer hospital length of stay (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.87). Conclusions: Hematologic oncology inpatients requiring RRS activation have high rates of subsequent ICU admission and mortality. ICU admission and higher number of RRS activations are associated with increased risk of death, while active cancer treatment and longer hospital stay are associated with lower risk of mortality. Clinicians should consider these factors in risk-stratifying these patients during RRS assessment. ? 2019 The Author(s).","acute disease; adult; Article; Canada; cancer prognosis; controlled study; deterioration; female; hematologic malignancy; hospital mortality; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; infection; intensive care unit; length of stay; low risk population; major clinical study; male; mortality risk; outcome assessment; patient transport; prediction; priority journal; rapid response team; sensitivity and specificity; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; survival rate; systemic inflammatory response syndrome"
"Who is in and who is out? A qualitative analysis of stakeholder participation in priority setting for health in three districts in Uganda","2019","Stakeholder participation is relevant in strengthening priority setting processes for health worldwide, since it allows for inclusion of alternative perspectives and values that can enhance the fairness, legitimacy and acceptability of decisions. Low-income countries operating within decentralized systems recognize the role played by sub-national administrative levels (such as districts) in healthcare priority setting. In Uganda, decentralization is a vehicle for facilitating stakeholder participation. Our objective was to examine district-level decision-makers' perspectives on the participation of different stakeholders, including challenges related to their participation. We further sought to understand the leverages that allow these stakeholders to influence priority setting processes. We used an interpretive description methodology involving qualitative interviews. A total of 27 district-level decision-makers from three districts in Uganda were interviewed. Respondents identified the following stakeholder groups: politicians, technical experts, donors, non-governmental organizations (NGO)/civil society organizations (CSO), cultural and traditional leaders, and the public. Politicians, technical experts and donors are the principal contributors to district-level priority setting and the public is largely excluded. The main leverages for politicians were control over the district budget and support of their electorate. Expertise was a cross-cutting leverage for technical experts, donors and NGO/CSOs, while financial and technical resources were leverages for donors and NGO/CSOs. Cultural and traditional leaders' leverages were cultural knowledge and influence over their followers. The public's leverage was indirect and exerted through electoral power. Respondents made no mention of participation for vulnerable groups. The public, particularly vulnerable groups, are left out of the priority setting process for health at the district. Conflicting priorities, interests and values are the main challenges facing stakeholders engaged in district-level priority setting. Our findings have important implications for understanding how different stakeholder groups shape the prioritization process and whether representation can be an effective mechanism for participation in health-system priority setting. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; budget; human; interview; leadership; low income country; non-governmental organization; public figure; qualitative analysis; stakeholder engagement; Uganda; organization"
"Patient-reported symptoms following mastectomy alone or lumpectomy plus radiation for early stage breast cancer: a cohort study","2019","Purpose: Studies examining symptom differences between surgeries for breast cancer patients rarely incorporate the effects of adjuvant treatment choice. We sought to understand differences in patient-reported symptoms between lumpectomy plus radiation and mastectomy in the year following surgery. Methods: This cohort study used linked administrative datasets. The exposure was defined as lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy. The outcomes of moderate-to-severe (score ? 4) patient-reported symptoms were obtained using the Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS). Line plots were created to determine symptom trajectories in the 12 months following surgery, and the relationships between surgery and each of the nine symptoms were assessed using multivariable analyses. Clinical significance was determined as a difference of 10%. Results: Of 13,865 Stage I–II breast cancer patients diagnosed 2007–2015, 11,497 underwent lumpectomy plus radiation and 2368 underwent mastectomy. Symptom trajectories were similar for all nine symptoms until approximately 5?months postoperatively when they diverged and mastectomy symptoms started becoming more severe. On multivariable analyses, patients undergoing mastectomy were at an increased risk of reporting moderate-to-severe depression (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09–1.30), lack of appetite (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03–1.20), and shortness of breath (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04–1.15) compared to those undergoing lumpectomy plus radiation. Conclusions: Even with the addition of adjuvant radiation, patients who are treated with lumpectomy fare better in three of nine patient-reported symptoms. Further examination of these differences will assist in better shared decision-making regarding surgical treatments. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; adverse event; aged; breast tumor; cancer staging; cohort analysis; comparative study; depression; dyspnea; female; human; mastectomy; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; multivariate analysis; partial mastectomy; pathology; patient-reported outcome; procedures; psychology; self report; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Combined Modality Therapy; Depression; Dyspnea; Female; Humans; Mastectomy; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Self Report; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Exploring regional variations in the cross-cultural, international implementation of the Patient Reported Outcomes Burdens and Experience (PROBE) study","2019","Background: The Patient Reported Outcomes Burdens and Experience (PROBE) study has developed and validated the PROBE questionnaire for assessing patient-reported outcomes in people with haemophilia and participants without bleeding disorders. Objective: To explore the regional variations in the international implementation of the PROBE questionnaire. Methods: Data were collected from participants in four regions (Western Pacific, South America, North America and Europe). Participants were able to choose English or translated versions of the PROBE questionnaire into their first language. We used analysis of variance methods and multivariable regression to determine the relative contribution of the variance explained by region controlling for haemophilia diagnosis, age group and levels of educations. We also explored interactions between region and the other components. Results: We used 862 questionnaires from 14 countries. Mean age of participants was 40.03?years (standard deviation 13.89), and 73.67% were male. After adjusting, region contributed 0.44%-7.98% of the variance component in subitem scores and 0.26% in the PROBE score. Years of education contributed 0.34% in the PROBE score. Age and haemophilia diagnosis contributed 3.42% and 22.42% of the PROBE score. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the PROBE questionnaire is valid to implement for assessing health status among patients with haemophilia and participants without bleeding disorders across regions. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; age; Article; controlled study; cultural anthropology; education; English (language); Europe; female; geographic names; geography; health status; hemophilia; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; North America; Patient Reported Outcomes Burdens and Experience questionnaire; personal experience; priority journal; questionnaire; scoring system; South America; validity; Western Pacific; young adult; cultural factor; ethnology; hemophilia A; international cooperation; patient-reported outcome; questionnaire; Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Hemophilia A; Humans; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Cost-effectiveness of the implementation of a transitional discharge model for community integration of psychiatric clients: Practice insights and policy implications","2019","Transitions in care are vulnerable periods for individuals with mental health illness. A network of therapeutic relationships during transitional period assists in discharge planning and recovery. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the implementation of the transitional discharge model (TDM), an intervention for community integration of clients with mental health illness. This study used a participatory action research design to evaluate TDM implementation in nine hospitals across Ontario, Canada. The study enrolled 370 participants from participating hospitals. The analyses compared data on readmissions, length of stay, and hospitals spending that were collected at three points in time: prior and after four and eight months of TDM implementation. Corresponding results indicated no statistically significant differences in pre and post-intervention readmission means. The average length of stay, in eight months following the implementation, decreased by 9.8 days; however, results showed no statistically significant difference between pre and post-intervention median length of stay (mean rank = 6.63 vs. 5.64), Z = ?0.585, p = 0.592). Additionally, comparisons of implementation cost to hospital spending found a total savings of $3,392,810. In addition to cost-savings to the health care system as demonstrated by reduced length of stay, TDM implementation provides cost-effective supports to help keep clients in the community and out of the hospital. As such, TDM implementation provides mental health practice and policy one of the unique opportunities for effective discharge of clients from hospital to community mental health services, through early discharge planning and connecting clients to community peer support system. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",""
"High-throughput and comprehensive drug surveillance using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry","2019","New analytical methods are urgently needed to enable high-throughput, yet comprehensive drug screening, given an alarming opioid and prescription drug crisis in public health. Conventional urine drug testing based on a two-tier immunoassay screen followed by a gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method are expensive and prone to bias while being limited to targeted panels of known drugs of abuse (DoA). Herein, we outline an improved method for drug surveillance that allows for the resolution and detection of an expanded panel of DoA and their metabolites when using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Multiplexed separations of ten urine samples with a quality control by CE (< 3 min/sample) in conjunction with full-scan data acquisition using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) under positive ion mode detection allows for the identification and quantification of DoA above recommended cut-off levels. An excellent resolution of drug isomers and isobars, including background interferences, are achieved when using MSI-CE-MS with an electrokinetic spacer between sample segments, where accurate mass/molecular formula together with the comigration of a matching deuterated internal standard and the detection of one or more bio-transformed metabolites facilitate DoA identification over a wider detection window. Additionally, urine samples can be analyzed directly without enzyme deconjugation for the rapid screening without complicated sample workup. MSI-CE-MS enables the surveillance of a broad spectrum of DoA that is required for the treatment monitoring of high-risk patients, including confirming prescribed drug adherence, revealing illicit drug use/ substitution, and evaluating optimal dosage regimes as required for new advances in precision medicine. ? 2019 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.",""
"The role of support and sustainability elements in the adoption of an online self-management support system for chronic illnesses","2019","The direct cost of treating chronic disease in Canada has risen to an average of 58% of healthcare spending. Thus, more attention is being directed to technologically supported health self-management and lifestyle change, to help patients mitigate and manage their own conditions. This study investigates how support elements (decision support and education)and sustainability elements (rewards systems), can help to motivate patients to adopt proposed technologies. A proposed model was tested using data collected from two potential user groups: 198 online and 83 in-person, using an identical survey. Although the system was built and ready to use at the time this study was conducted, in order to keep the experience of both groups identical, a video simulation (of the system)was used to familiarize both groups of users with the system. The study reveals that: individual perceptions on usability, ease of use, and hedonic motivation were influenced by the proposed support elements. Support elements enhance user perceptions of usability and ease of use, while sustainability elements positively affect user motivations, thus encouraging their decisions to adopt and use the technology. The study implies that, for better success at helping patients to self-manage their health, special attention should be paid to support and sustainability elements. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; aged; chronic disease; decision support system; diabetes mellitus; female; heart failure; human; information processing; Internet; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; medical information; middle aged; Note; online system; patient education; perception; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; reliability; self care; simulation; social support; very elderly; young adult"
"Confronting Medicine’s Dichotomies: Older Adults’ Use of Interpretative Repertoires in Negotiating the Paradoxes of Polypharmacy and Deprescribing","2020","To address the risks associated with polypharmacy, health care providers are investigating the feasibility of deprescribing programs as part of routine medical care to reduce medication burden to older adults. As older adults are enrolled in these programs, they are confronted with two dominant and legitimate accounts of medications, labeled the medication paradox: medications keep you healthy but they might be making you sick. We investigated how the medication paradox operates in the lives of older adults. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted and analyzed with older adults aged 70+ to identify the various paradoxes that seniors live through regarding their medications and the narratives that they engage to negotiate these contradictions. Older adults were found to have established interpretative repertoires to make sense of the incongruent narratives of the medication paradox. In this article, we demonstrate older adults’ efforts to carve out their unique place in the dichotomized institution of medicine. ?

"Risk Factors for Unplanned Dialysis Initiation: A Systematic Review of the Literature","2019","Background: Unplanned dialysis initiation is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objective: To determine common definitions and patient risk factors for unplanned dialysis. Design: Systematic review. Setting: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2018. Patients: Studies that included incident chronic dialysis patients or patients with CKD that cited a definition or examined risk factors for unplanned dialysis were included. Measurements: Definitions and criteria for unplanned dialysis reported across studies. Patient characteristics associated with unplanned dialysis. Methods: Two reviewers independently extracted data using a standardized data abstraction form and assessed study quality using a modified New Castle Ottawa Scale. Results: From 2797 citations, 48 met eligibility criteria. Reported definitions for unplanned dialysis were variable. Most publications cited dialysis initiation under emergency conditions and/or with a central venous catheter. The association of patient characteristics with unplanned dialysis was reported in 26 studies, 18 were retrospective and 21 included incident dialysis patients. The most common risk factors in univariate analyses were (number of studies) increased age (n = 7), cause of kidney disease (n = 6), presence of cardiovascular disease (n = 7), lower serum hemoglobin (n = 9), lower serum albumin (n = 10), higher serum phosphate (n = 6), higher serum creatinine or lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis initiation (n = 7), late referral (n = 5), lack of dialysis education (n = 6), and lack of follow-up in a predialysis clinic prior to dialysis initiation (n = 5). A minority of studies performed multivariable analyses (n = 10); the most common risk factors were increased age (n = 4), increased comorbidity score (n = 3), late referral (n = 5), and lower eGFR at dialysis initiation (n = 3). Limitations: Comparison of results across studies was limited by inconsistent definitions for unplanned dialysis. High-quality data on patient risk factors for unplanned dialysis are lacking. Conclusions: Well-designed prospective studies to determine modifiable risk factors are needed. The lack of a consensus definition for unplanned dialysis makes research and quality improvement initiatives in this area more challenging. ?

"Special Article: 2018 American College of Rheumatology/National Psoriasis Foundation Guideline for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis","2019","Objective: To develop an evidence-based guideline for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF). Methods: We identified critical outcomes in PsA and clinically relevant PICO (population/intervention/comparator/outcomes) questions. A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for PsA. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A voting panel, including rheumatologists, dermatologists, other health professionals, and patients, achieved consensus on the direction and the strength of the recommendations. Results: The guideline covers the management of active PsA in patients who are treatment-naive and those who continue to have active PsA despite treatment, and addresses the use of oral small molecules, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i), IL-17 inhibitors, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib). We also developed recommendations for psoriatic spondylitis, predominant enthesitis, and treatment in the presence of concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, or serious infections. We formulated recommendations for a treat-to-target strategy, vaccinations, and nonpharmacologic therapies. Six percent of the recommendations were strong and 94% conditional, indicating the importance of active discussion between the health care provider and the patient to choose the optimal treatment. Conclusion: The 2018 ACR/NPF PsA guideline serves as a tool for health care providers and patients in the selection of appropriate therapy in common clinical scenarios. Best treatment decisions consider each individual patient situation. The guideline is not meant to be proscriptive and should not be used to limit treatment options for patients with PsA. ? 2018, American College of Rheumatology","abatacept; antirheumatic agent; biological product; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 23; live vaccine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; adalimumab; etanercept; glucocorticoid; golimumab; immunosuppressive agent; infliximab; ixekizumab; monoclonal antibody; piperidine derivative; pyrimidine derivative; pyrrole derivative; secukinumab; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor; ustekinumab; Article; combination drug therapy; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; disease activity; enthesitis; evidence based practice; health care personnel; human; inflammatory bowel disease; monotherapy; patient care; practice guideline; priority journal; psoriatic arthritis; vaccination; body weight loss; diabetes mellitus; enthesopathy; evidence based medicine; exercise; inflammatory bowel disease; medical society; occupational therapy; physiotherapy; psoriatic arthritis; rheumatology; smoking cessation; spondylitis; Abatacept; Adalimumab; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus; Enthesopathy; Etanercept; Evidence-Based Medicine; Exercise; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Infliximab; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-17; Interleukin-23; Occupational Therapy; Physical Therapy Modalities; Piperidines; Pyrimidines; Pyrroles; Rheumatology; Smoking Cessation; Societies, Medical; Spondylitis; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Ustekinumab; Weight Loss"

"Clinical experience of patients referred to a multidisciplinary cardio-oncology clinic: An observational cohort study","2019","Introduction Cardiovascular disease is the 2nd leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. Cardio-oncology clinics (cocs) have emerged to address the issue; however, there is a paucity of data about the demographics and clinical outcomes of patients seen in the coc setting. Methods Cancer patients referred to The Ottawa Hospital coc were included in this retrospective observational study. Data collected were patient demographics, cancer type and stage, reason for referral, cardiac risk factors, cardiac assessments and treatment, and clinical outcomes. Results Between 2008 and 2015, 779 patients (516 women, 66%; 263 men, 34%) were referred to the coc. Median age of the patients at cancer diagnosis was 60 years (range: 18-90 years). The most frequent reasons for referral were decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (33%), pre-chemotherapy assessment (14%), and arrhythmia (14%). Treatment with cardiac medication was given in 322 patients (41%), 181 (56%) of whom received more than 2 cardiac medications, with 57 (18%) receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), 46 (14%) receiving an acei and a beta-blocker, and 38 (12%) receiving a beta-blocker. Of 163 breast cancer patients, 129 (79%) were able to complete targeted therapy with COC co-management. Most of the 779 patients (n = 643, 83%) were alive at the time of the last data collection. Conclusions This cohort study is one of the largest to report characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients referred to a coc. Collaboration between oncologists and cardiologists resulted in completion of cancer therapy in most patients. Ongoing analysis of referral patterns, management plans, and patient outcomes will help to guide the cardiac care of oncology patients, ultimately optimizing cancer and cardiac outcomes alike. ? 2019 Multimed Inc.","beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; doxorubicin; epirubicin; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer therapy; cardiac imaging; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; diastolic heart failure; digestive system cancer; echocardiography; female; heart death; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle failure; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; oncology; patient referral; pericardial effusion; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; urogenital tract cancer"
"A mechanistic cohort study evaluating cognitive impairment in women treated for breast cancer","2019","Some women report cognitive impairment after adjuvant chemotherapy (CTh) for breast cancer. Here we explore cognitive function, and underlying mechanisms with blood tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Women treated for early breast cancer were recruited to three groups based on self-reported cognitive symptoms (CS) using FACT-Cog scores. CTh?+?CS+ (n?=?44) had received chemotherapy and self-reported cognitive symptoms; CTh?+?CS- (n?=?52) had chemotherapy but did not report cognitive problems; CTh- (n?=?30) had not received chemotherapy. Clinical and computer-based neuropsychological tests were performed. Blood tests included 10 cytokines, sex hormones, coagulation factors, and apolipoprotein-E genotype. fMRI (n?=?101) was performed while subjects performed an n-back memory task. Participants had median age 50 (range: 29–60) years and were a median of 17?months post-diagnosis. On clinical neuropsychological tests 19% had cognitive impairment using Global Deficit Score, and 36% using International Cancer and Cognition Task Force criteria with no significant differences in cognitive impairment rates between groups. CTh?+?CS+ had significantly more fatigue, anxiety/depression and poorer quality-of-life than other groups. There was no association between FACT-Cog and neuropsychological scores. There were significant differences in frontal and parietal regions on fMRI scans: CTh- showed hyperactivation compared to chemotherapy-treated groups, CTh?+?CS+ had more frontal activation than CTh?+?CS-. Elevated IL-1, IL-2 were associated weakly and IL-8 more strongly with neuropsychological impairment (rho?>?0.20). There were no differences in global cognitive impairment between groups. Cognitive symptoms were associated with fatigue and anxiety/depression, but not with objective cognitive impairment. fMRI scans differed among the three groups. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","antineoplastic agent; apolipoprotein E4; interleukin 1; interleukin 2; interleukin 8; antineoplastic agent; biological marker; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; amygdala; anxiety; Article; blood analysis; breast cancer; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; clinical article; cognition; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; fatigue; female; frontal cortex; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Cognitive Function; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; heterozygote; human; memory test; neuropsychological test; occipital lobe; parietal cortex; primary motor cortex; priority journal; putamen; quality of life; self report; blood; brain; breast tumor; cancer survivor; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; self evaluation; short term memory; Adult; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers; Brain; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Diagnostic Self Evaluation; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests"
"Intraductal adaptation of the 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer reveals effects of the epithelial microenvironment on tumor progression and metastasis","2019","Background: Low success rates in oncology drug development are prompting re-evaluation of preclinical models, including orthotopic tumor engraftment. In breast cancer models, tumor cells are typically injected into mouse mammary fat pads (MFP). However, this approach bypasses the epithelial microenvironment, potentially altering tumor properties in ways that affect translational application. Materials and Methods: Tumors were generated by mammary intraductal (MIND) engraftment of 4T1 carcinoma cells. Growth, histopathology, and molecular features were quantified. Results: Despite growth similar to that of 4T1 MFP tumors, 4T1 MIND tumors exhibit distinct histopathology and increased metastasis. Furthermore, >6,000 transcripts were found to be uniquely up-regulated in 4T1 MIND tumor cells, including genes that drive several cancer hallmarks, in addition to two known therapeutic targets that were not up-regulated in 4T1 MFP tumor cells. Conclusion: Engraftment into the epithelial microenvironment generates tumors that more closely recapitulate the complexity of malignancy, suggesting that intraductal adaptation of orthotopic mammary models may be an important step towards improving outcomes in preclinical drug screening and development. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Telephone triage in midwifery practice: A cross-sectional survey","2019","Background: Childbearing women commonly access maternity services via the telephone. A midwife receiving these calls listens to the woman's concerns and then triages women according to their assessment. This may result in the provision of advice and instruction over the telephone or inviting the woman into the health service for further assessment. Midwives are responsible for all care and advice given to women, including via the telephone. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences and practices of midwives regarding their management of telephone triage. Design: A cross-sectional survey. Setting and participants: Purposive non-probabilistic sampling of currently practising midwife members of professional organisations was used to recruit participants. From this, 242 midwives responded and 230 returned valid surveys were used in data analysis. Methods: Participant demographics, telephone triage processes, skills, educational preparation, confidence and anxiety levels, and external factors that influence midwives’ management of telephone triage were collected via an on-line survey. Descriptive statistics and further analyses were conducted to explore relationships between variables. Results: Eighty-three percent of midwives respond to 2–5 telephone calls per shift, with only 11.7% (n = 24) of midwives reporting that this is included in their workloads. Telephone triage is frequently managed in environments with distractions. Most midwives (84%; n = 177) report receiving no training in this skill. Confidence in performing telephone triage was reported, with higher confidence levels related to midwives’ increased years of experience (p < 0.05) and age (p < 0.01). Anxiety related to managing telephone triage has been experienced by 73% (n = 151) of midwives, with this being greater in midwives with less years of experience. Anxiety is reported less by midwives in rural or remote settings compared to metropolitan or regional (p < 0.05) settings in this study. A variety of standards and aids to guide practice, and document calls are utilised in a range of ways. Conclusion: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study conducted to explore midwives’ practises in telephone triage. The findings suggest the need for appropriate environments to conduct telephone calls and the inclusion of telephone triage in midwifery workloads. In addition, consistent education and processes are required to reduce anxiety and support midwives provision of this service to women. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; cross-sectional study; emergency health service; female; human; male; middle aged; midwife; nurse midwife; nurse patient relationship; pregnancy; procedures; professional competence; questionnaire; telephone; Victoria; workload; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Midwifery; Nurse Midwives; Nurse-Patient Relations; Pregnancy; Professional Competence; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telephone; Triage; Victoria; Workload; Young Adult"
"Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies","2019","Background: Among singleton pregnancies, gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with adverse outcomes. In twin pregnancies, this association may be attenuated, given the higher rate of prematurity and the a priori increased risk of some of these complications. Objective: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that gestational diabetes mellitus is less likely to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in twin compared with singleton gestations. Methods: This retrospective cohort study comprised all twin and singleton live births in Ontario, Canada, 2012–2016. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between women with vs without gestational diabetes mellitus, analyzed separately for twin and singleton births. Adjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were generated using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for maternal age, nulliparity, smoking, race, body mass index, preexisting hypertension, and assisted reproductive technology. Results: A total of 270,843 women with singleton (n = 266,942) and twin (n = 3901) pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. In both the twin and singleton groups, gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with (adjusted risk ratio, [95% confidence interval]) cesarean delivery (1.11 [1.02–1.21] and 1.20 [1.17–1.23], respectively) and preterm birth at &lt;37 0/7 weeks (1.21 [1.08–1.37] and 1.48 [1.39–1.57]) and at &lt;34 0/7 weeks (1.45 [1.03–2.04] and 1.25 [1.06–1.47]). In singletons, but not twins, gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with gestational hypertension (1.66 [1.55–1.77]) and preeclampsia. With respect to neonatal outcomes, gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with birthweight greater than the 90th percentile in both twins and singletons, with the risk being 2-fold higher in twins (2.53 [1.52-4.23] vs 1.18 [1.13-1.23], respectively, P =.004). Gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with jaundice in both twins (1.56 [1.10–2.21]) and singletons (1.49 [1.37–1.62) but was associated with the following complications only in singletons: neonatal intensive care unit admission (1.44 [1.38–1.50]), respiratory morbidity (1.09 [1.02–1.16]), and neonatal hypoglycemia (3.20 [3.01–3.40]). Conclusion: In contrast to singleton pregnancies, gestational diabetes mellitus in twins was not associated with hypertensive complications and certain neonatal morbidities. Still, the current study highlights that gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with some adverse pregnancy outcomes including accelerated fetal growth also in twin pregnancies. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; adverse outcome; Article; birth weight; body mass; Canada; cesarean section; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; human; hypertension; hypoglycemia; jaundice; major clinical study; maternal age; morbidity; newborn disease; newborn intensive care; nullipara; preeclampsia; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; priority journal; race; retrospective study; smoking; twin pregnancy; child health; comparative study; maternal welfare; Ontario; pregnancy; prematurity; procedures; prognosis; risk assessment; stillbirth; young adult; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cohort Studies; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Infant Health; Maternal Age; Maternal Health; Ontario; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnancy, Twin; Premature Birth; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Stillbirth; Young Adult"
"Nurses’ integrity and coping strategies: An integrative review","2019","Introduction: Integrity is one of the core values in nursing that needs to be maintained by nurses in practice. However, the complexity in the nursing milieu can pose threats to integrity. An understanding of the common threats and coping strategies might assist nurses in preserving integrity in everyday practice. Aims and objectives: To review and synthesis the concept of integrity in nursing and identify common threats and coping strategies. Methods: Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review method was implemented. A search was performed in Scopus, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Proquest Health and Medical electronic databases published in English between 2000–2017. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility for inclusion. Methodological appropriateness for the included studies was assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme. The constant comparative method of grounded theory was used to analyse and synthesise data from seven peer-reviewed articles. Results: Two major conceptions of integrity were identified. These included the sense of wholeness with regard to personal–professional concerns and ethical–moral conducts. Five entities, self, patients, teamwork and work culture, the nature of work, and organisation, were identified as interweaving elements that may induce threats to integrity. When integrity is threatened, nurses use two key strategies to survive: adjusting and compensating. An emergent framework to facilitate understanding of nurses’ threats to integrity is discussed. Conclusions: A threat to nurses’ integrity takes form when there is an unmitigated gap between a nurse's expectation and reality. While the expectation comes from within the nurse, the reality materialises out of the complex interplays that occur in the healthcare workforce. Maintaining integrity demands a continual strive to balance personal expectations, professional concerns and nursing realities. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; Cinahl; conception; constant comparative method; coping behavior; Embase; expectation; female; grounded theory; human; male; Medline; morality; nurse patient relationship; nursing practice; PsycINFO; Scopus; skill; synthesis; systematic review; teamwork; workforce; medical ethics; nurse; organizational culture; psychology; Adaptation, Psychological; Ethics, Nursing; Grounded Theory; Humans; Nurses; Organizational Culture"
"Poverty, Neighbourhood Antisocial Behaviour, and Children’s Mental Health Problems: Findings from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study [Pauvret?, comportement antisocial du quartier et probl?mes de sant? mentale des enfants : r?sultats de l'?tude sur la sant? des jeunes Ontariens 2014]","2019","Objectives: To determine if levels of neighbourhood poverty and neighbourhood antisocial behaviour modify associations between household poverty and child and youth mental health problems. Methods: Data come from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study—a provincially representative survey of 6537 families with 10,802 four- to 17-year-olds. Multivariate multilevel modelling was used to test if neighbourhood poverty and antisocial behaviour interact with household poverty to modify associations with children’s externalizing and internalizing problems based on parent assessments of children (4- to 17-year-olds) and self-assessments of youth (12- to 17-year-olds). Results: Based on parent assessments, neighbourhood poverty, and antisocial behaviour modified associations between household poverty and children’s mental health problems. Among children living in households below the poverty line, levels of mental health problems were 1) lower when living in neighbourhoods with higher concentrations of poverty and 2) higher when living in neighbourhoods with more antisocial behaviour. These associations were stronger for externalizing versus internalizing problems when conditional on antisocial behaviour and generalized only to youth-assessed externalizing problems. Conclusion: The lower levels of externalizing problems reported among children living in poor households in low-income neighbourhoods identify potential challenges with integrating poorer households into more affluent neighbourhoods. More important, children living in poor households located in neighbourhoods exhibiting more antisocial behaviour are at dramatically higher risk for mental health problems. Reducing levels of neighbourhood antisocial behaviour could have large mental health benefits, particularly among poor children. ?

"Mindfulness for the Mental Health and Well-Being of Post-Secondary Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","High levels of distress in post-secondary students, alongside the real or perceived barriers to accessing services, highlight the need for evidence-based, accessible, and brief interventions for students such as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). This systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to determine the effectiveness of MBIs for mental health outcomes in post-secondary students. We searched OVID MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsychInfo, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, Proquest Dissertations, and OpenGrey. When possible, data were pooled using a random-effects model. Effect estimates were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and then back-transformed into common scales of measurement. This review includes 41 randomized controlled trials reported in 49 studies. When comparing to a passive control, MBIs appear to reduce symptoms of depression [SMD ? 0.49 (95% CI ? 0.68, ? 0.30)], anxiety [SMD ? 0.53 (95% CI ? 0.78, ? 0.29)], and perceived stress [SMD -0.39 (95% CI -0.50, -0.27)] post-intervention (low-quality evidence). These findings were similar for shorter compared to longer interventions, although mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appeared to be the most effective for depression and anxiety. This review found no differential effects of MBIs compared to active comparators for depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or perceived stress (low-quality evidence). Overall, MBIs of at least 2?weeks in duration appear to be a better alternative than no intervention for students with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Potential quality indicators for seriously ill home care clients: A cross-sectional analysis using Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care (RAI-HC) data for Ontario","2019","Background: Currently, there are no formalized measures for the quality of home based palliative care in Ontario. This study developed a set of potential quality indicators for seriously ill home care clients using a standardized assessment. Methods: Secondary analysis of Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care data for Ontario completed between 2006 and 2013 was used to develop quality indicators (QIs) thought to be relevant to the needs of older (65+) seriously ill clients. QIs were developed through a review of the literature and consultation with subject matter experts in palliative care. Serious illness was defined as a prognosis of less than 6 months to live or the presence of severe health instability. The rates of the QIs were stratified across Ontario's geographic regions, and across four common life-limiting illnesses to observe variation. Results: Within the sample, 14,312 clients were considered to be seriously ill and were more likely to experience negative health outcomes such as cognitive performance (OR = 2.77; 95% CI: 2.66-2.89) and pain (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.53-1.64). Twenty subject matter experts were consulted and a list of seven QIs was developed. Indicators with the highest overall rates were prevalence of falls (50%) prevalence of daily pain (47%), and prevalence of caregiver distress (42%). The range in QI rates was largest across regions for prevalence of caregiver distress (21.5%), the prevalence of falls (16.6%), and the prevalence of social isolation (13.7%). Those with some form of dementia were most likely to have a caregiver that was distressed (52.6%) or to experience a fall (53.3%). Conclusion: Home care clients in Ontario who are seriously ill are experiencing high rates of negative health outcomes, many of which are amenable to change. The RAI-HC can be a useful tool in identifying these clients in order to better understand their needs and abilities. These results contribute significantly to the process of creating and validating a standardized set of QIs that can be generated by organizations using the RAI-HC as part of normal clinical practice. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aged; Article; caregiver; clinical assessment tool; clinical outcome; cognitive defect; controlled study; critical illness; critically ill patient; cross-sectional study; dementia; disease severity; distress syndrome; falling; female; geography; health care need; human; major clinical study; male; medical expert; Ontario; pain; palliative therapy; prevalence; prognosis; quality control; Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care; secondary analysis; social isolation; validation study; devices; health care quality; home care; procedures; psychometry; standards; statistics and numerical data; trends; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Ontario; Palliative Care; Psychometrics; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Quality of Health Care"
"Non-invasive blood glucose measurement of 95% certainty by pressure regulated Mid-IR","2019","To fight against diabetes mellitus, from which more than 400 million people suffer in the world, the patients have to puncture their fingers 4–5 times a day for the blood glucose level checks when using a glucometer, causing invasive pain and the risk of infection. Therefore, non-invasive method has been urged for blood glucose monitoring, among which the mid-infrared spectroscopy (Mid-IR) response of interstitial fluid was found to be promising. However, despite the prolonged effort, the accuracy still falls below the FDA's requirement. To break this barrier which lasted for almost three decades, we discovered the finger contact pressure playing a critical role during the measurement, where the Mid-IR reading could be affected significantly by a small change of the finger posture. In addition, the Mid-IR absorption level was also found to be highly associated with individual, revealing the necessity of adjusting the calibration correlation for each patient. By imposing a certain contact pressure monitored by a pressure transducer, we were able to achieve over 95% certainty from the Mid-IR measurement of glucose concentration and 100% comparability to the “true” glucose concentration for the first time, which was mainly attributed to the morphological change of finger tissue under pressure. The previous works resulted in only about 70% accuracy on average, barely hitting 80 + %, whereas ours reaches 95%, finally exceeding the requirement of FDA. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blood; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Infrared spectroscopy; Medical problems; Noninvasive medical procedures; Pressure; Sensors; Blood glucose measurements; Blood glucose monitoring; Glucose concentration; In-vivo; Mid-infrared spectroscopy; Midinfrared; Morphological changes; Non-invasive; Glucose; analysis; blood glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus; glucose blood level; human; infrared spectrophotometry; pressure; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Pressure; Spectrophotometry, Infrared"
"Health-related quality of life of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder","2019","Background: Although Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is primarily a motor disorder, it can also impact emotional and psychosocial functioning of children with this condition. Evidence suggests that children with DCD experience lower quality of life than their peers, but few studies have explicitly examined the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these children. Aims: To: (1) describe HRQOL of children with DCD compared to typically-developing children; (2) compare HRQOL from the perspectives of children with DCD and their parents; and (3) explore predictors of HRQOL for children with DCD. Methods: Data from the KidScreen-52 and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire were collected from 50 children with DCD [Mean(SD) age: 9.8 (1.2) years] and their parents and compared to normative data. Results: Children with DCD and their parents report significantly lower HRQOL compared to published norms. Caregivers have a significantly lower perception of their child's HRQOL than their child's self-report in many domains. Parents of children with DCD report that their children experience significantly more emotional and behavioral disturbances compared to norms. Poor motor function and attentional difficulties predict HRQOL. Conclusion and implications: DCD appears to contribute to lower perceived HRQOL. Findings inform therapeutic targets for children with DCD, beyond motor skill intervention. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article; attention deficit disorder; attention disturbance; behavior disorder; child; clinical article; comparative study; conduct disorder; controlled study; cross-sectional study; developmental coordination disorder; emotional disorder; female; human; KidScreen 52; male; motor performance; peer group; psychological well-being; quality of life; quality of life assessment; school child; self concept; self report; social behavior; social norm; social status; strengths and difficulties questionnaire; bullying; child parent relation; health status; mental health; pathophysiology; psychology; psychomotor disorder; school; social class; social environment; social support; Bullying; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Motor Skills Disorders; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Quality of Life; Schools; Self Concept; Social Class; Social Environment; Social Support"
"NOACs only for those who cannot tolerate a VKA: where is the evidence?","2019","The 2016 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines recommend non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in preference to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. A recent report from the Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre (KCE) raised concerns about the results of the phase 3 randomised trials that led to the approval of the NOACs for this indication and concluded that NOACs should only be used for patients who fail or cannot undergo treatment with a vitamin K antagonist because they cannot achieve stable INR values. Evidence from community-based studies suggests that NOACs are often not optimally used; however, our critical review of the randomised trial data provides no support for the concerns raised by the Belgian KCE about the trials. Furthermore, the results of observational studies involving more than 700,000 participants replicate those of the randomised trials, indicating that the benefits of NOACs seen in the trials can be readily translated to patient care. Due to their superior convenience and safety, NOACs also have the potential to reduce undertreatment of atrial fibrillation patients. ? 2018, ? 2018 Belgian Society of Cardiology.","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; apixaban; dabigatran; edoxaban; idarucizumab; non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant; prothrombin; prothrombin complex; rivaroxaban; unclassified drug; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; vitamin K group; anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; cost effectiveness analysis; drug safety; drug tolerability; efficacy parameters; human; international normalized ratio; mortality; patient care; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); practice guideline; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; antagonists and inhibitors; atrial fibrillation; Belgium; cardiology; cerebrovascular accident; complication; medical society; oral drug administration; practice guideline; Administration, Oral; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Belgium; Cardiology; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical; Stroke; Vitamin K"
"Inhibition of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase by Phosphorylation or the Inhibitor ND-654 Suppresses Lipogenesis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma","2019","The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rapidly increasing due to the prevalence of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but the molecular triggers that initiate disease development are not fully understood. We demonstrate that mice with targeted loss-of-function point mutations within the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation sites on acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1 Ser79Ala) and ACC2 (ACC2 Ser212Ala) have increased liver de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and liver lesions. The same mutation in ACC1 also increases DNL and proliferation in human liver cancer cells. Consistent with these findings, a novel, liver-specific ACC inhibitor (ND-654) that mimics the effects of ACC phosphorylation inhibits hepatic DNL and the development of HCC, improving survival of tumor-bearing rats when used alone and in combination with the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. These studies highlight the importance of DNL and dysregulation of AMPK-mediated ACC phosphorylation in accelerating HCC and the potential of ACC inhibitors for treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.Effective therapies are needed for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lally et al. report that fructose consumption and the genetic activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) increase hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and liver carcinogenesis.

"Early Unplanned Readmissions After Admission to Hospital With Heart Failure","2019","Hospital readmissions remain a continued challenge in the care of patients with heart failure (HF). This study aims to examine the rates, temporal trends, predictors and causes of 30-day unplanned readmissions after admission with HF. Patients hospitalized with a primary or secondary diagnosis of HF in the U.S. Nationwide Readmission Database were included. We examined the incidence, trends, predictors and causes of unplanned all-cause readmissions at 30-days. A total of 2,635,673 and 8,342,383 patients were included in the analyses for primary and secondary diagnoses of HF, respectively. The 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 15.1% for primary HF and 14.6% for secondary HF. Predictors of readmission in primary HF included renal failure (OR 1.27 (1.25 to 1.28)), cancer (OR 1.26 (1.22 to 1.29)), receipt of circulatory support (OR 2.81 (1.64 to 4.81)) and discharge against medical advice (OR 2.29 (2.20 to 2.39)). In secondary HF, the major predictors were receipt of circulatory support (OR 1.43 (1.12 to 1.84)) and discharge against medical advice (OR 2.01 95%CI (1.95 to 2.07)). In primary HF 52.4% of patients were readmitted for a noncardiac cause while for secondary HF 73.9% were readmitted for a noncardiac cause. For secondary HF, the strongest predictor of readmission was discharge against medical advice (OR 2.06 95%CI 2.01 to 2.12, p < 0.001). Early unplanned readmissions are common among patients hospitalized with HF, and a majority of readmissions are due to causes other than HF. Our results highlight the need to better manage comorbidities in patients with HF. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","aged; Article; assisted circulation; cohort analysis; comorbidity; female; heart failure; hospital cost; hospital discharge; hospital patient; hospital readmission; human; incidence; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; priority journal; treatment refusal; United States"

"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC/ISOO/ASCO clinical practice guideline","2019","PURPOSE To provide guidance regarding best practices in the prevention and management of medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in patients with cancer. METHODS Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) and ASCO convened a multidisciplinary Expert Panel to evaluate the evidence and formulate recommendations. Guideline development involved a systematic review of the literature and a formal consensus process. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies of the prevention and management of MRONJ related to bone-modifying agents (BMAs) for oncologic indications published between January 2009 and December 2017. Results from an earlier systematic review (2003 to 2008) were also included. RESULTS The systematic review identified 132 publications, only 10 of which were randomized controlled trials. Recommendations underwent two rounds of consensus voting. RECOMMENDATIONS Currently, MRONJ is defined by (1) current or previous treatment with a BMA or angiogenic inhibitor, (2) exposed bone or bone that can be probed through an intraoral or extraoral fistula in the maxillofacial region and that has persisted for longer than 8 weeks, and (3) no history of radiation therapy to the jaws or metastatic disease to the jaws. In patients who initiate a BMA, preventive care includes comprehensive dental assessments, discussion of modifiable risk factors, and avoidance of elective dentoalveolar surgery (ie, surgery that involves the teeth or contiguous alveolar bone) during BMA treatment. It remains uncertain whether BMAs should be discontinued before dentoalveolar surgery. Staging of MRONJ should be performed by a clinician with experience in the management of MRONJ. Conservative measures comprise the initial approach to MRONJ treatment. Ongoing collaboration among the dentist, dental specialist, and oncologist is essential to optimal patient care. ? 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.","bisphosphonic acid derivative; alveolar bone; alveoloplasty; Article; cancer patient; dental health; dental procedure; dental surgery; diabetes mellitus; doctor patient relationship; drug withdrawal; elective surgery; evidence based practice; health care cost; health disparity; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; jaw osteonecrosis; low level laser therapy; medical terminology; mouth hygiene; multidisciplinary team; oral fistula; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; systematic review; tobacco use; tooth extraction; treatment duration; treatment response"
"Axe the fax: What users think of electronic referral","2019","Long wait times for elective services are seen as one of the major challenges for Canadian healthcare. Canadians report that they wait longer for specialists than citizens in other countries. The main reason for this is that the referral process is poorly coordinated and leads to delays in care. Electronic referral (eReferral) is seen as a potential means of improving the referral process and enabling faster access to care. There is the potential for national implementation of eReferral in Canada to help achieve this aim. However, existing initiatives have encountered challenges with user adoption and users have continued to use fax. A validated tool was used to survey both users of fax as well as users of eReferral. These two groups of users were then compared. Most family physicians using fax were satisfied overall with the process. This highlighted how challenging any change of this engrained technology will be. There were, however, some significant areas were eReferral was superior to fax. This included response time, the overall quality of referral information, completeness of the information, the timeliness of the information, and the format and layout. There is an opportunity to leverage these findings to support the adoption of eReferral and help reduce wait times. ? 2019 American Psychological Association Inc.

"Equity and impact: Ontario's infant rotavirus immunization program five years following implementation. A population-based cohort study","2019","Background: Ontario implemented a publicly-funded rotavirus (RV) immunization program in 2011. Our objectives were to evaluate its impact on hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) five years after implementation. Methods: We performed a population-based longitudinal retrospective cohort study to identify hospitalizations and ED visits for RV-AGE and overall AGE in all age groups using ICD-10 codes between August 1, 2005 and March 31, 2016. A negative binomial regression model that included the effect of time was used to calculate rates, rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AGE before and after the program's implementation, after adjusting for age, seasonality and secular trends. We examined the seasonality of RV-AGE hospitalizations among children under five before and after the program and explored its equity impact. Results: Following program implementation, RV-AGE hospitalizations and ED visits among children under five years declined by 76% (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.20–0.28) and 68% (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21–0.50), respectively. In addition, hospitalizations and ED visits for overall AGE declined by 38% (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.59–0.65) and 26% (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.73–0.76), respectively, among children under age five. Significant reductions in both outcomes were also found across a range of age-strata. In the pre-program period, the mean monthly hospitalization rate for RV-AGE among children residing in the most marginalized neighbourhoods was 33% higher than those residing in the least marginalized (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17–1.52), this disparity was not evident in the program period (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69–1.32). We found no evidence of a seasonal shift in rotavirus pediatric hospitalizations. Interpretation: The introduction of routine infant rotavirus immunization has had a substantial population impact in Ontario. Our study confirms herd effects and suggests the program may have reduced previous inequities in the burden of pediatric rotavirus hospitalizations. ? 2019","Rotavirus vaccine; acute gastroenteritis; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; child; child hospitalization; cohort analysis; emergency ward; health care disparity; health care planning; health equity; hospitalization; human; immunization; infant; infantile gastroenteritis; major clinical study; middle aged; nonhuman; observational study; Ontario; population research; preschool child; priority journal; program impact; retrospective study; risk reduction; Rotavirus infection; seasonal variation"
"Condition-Specific Pamphlets to Improve End-of-life Communication in Long-term Care: Staff Perceptions on Usability and Use","2019","Objectives: This article reports findings on the usability and staff use of 5 condition- specific pamphlets of high prevalence in long-term care (LTC): dementia, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, and frailty. The pamphlets were created in response to residents', families', and staff's recommendations for activating early reflections and communication about end-of-life care. Design: A mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative) survey design was used. Step 1 collected survey data on the usability of the pamphlets. Step 2 collected survey data on pamphlet use. Settings and Participants: Two nurses with specialized palliative care training, 2 resident/family representatives, 10 condition-specific specialists, and 33 LTC palliative leads reviewed the pamphlets for usability prior to distribution. A total of 178 LTC home staff in 4 participating LTC homes reported on pamphlet use. Measures: Specialists and resident/family representatives were asked to provide open comments and LTC home palliative leads were asked to complete a survey on the accuracy, readability, and relevance of the pamphlets. After 6 months of distribution, all staff in participating LTC homes were asked to complete a survey on pamphlet use, usefulness, and comfort with distribution. Results: The pamphlets were reportedly accurate, relevant, and easy to understand. Following 6 months of availability, most staff in LTC had read the pamphlets, found the information useful, and planned to share them. However, half of the staff questioned their role in pamphlet distribution and most had not distributed them. Regulated staff (ie, staff affiliated with a regulated profession) expressed more comfort sharing the pamphlets than care aides and support staff. Conclusions/Implications: Condition-specific pamphlets appear to hold promise in providing residents and families with relevant information that may activate early reflections and conversations about end-of-life care. However, structured implementation strategies, training, and discussions are required to improve staff comfort with distribution and explore roles in distribution and follow-up. ? 2018 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","adult; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; communication skill; consultation; controlled study; dementia; family counseling; female; follow up; frailty; health survey; heart failure; home care; human; interpersonal communication; kidney failure; long term care; male; medical information; medical specialist; palliative therapy; patient comfort; prevalence; publication; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; reading; residential care; staff training; terminal care; treatment indication"
"Beyond stereotypes of cerebral palsy: Exploring the lived experiences of young Canadians","2019","Background: Health for people with cerebral palsy (CP) must extend beyond physical impairments to include social, environmental, and psychological factors that are rarely captured by quantitative research alone. This qualitative study sought to explore the lived experience of young people with CP with their physical, mental, and emotional health in the context of a larger longitudinal Canadian study focusing on brain function, physical and mental health, and well-being. Methods: An integrated research team (including people with CP or other impairments, clinicians, and researchers) was formed to study participant-identified research needs. A purposive sample of 16 people with CP (seven female), aged 17–29, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I–V, participated in three focus groups that were conceptualized and analysed using interpretive description methodology. Results: This study reports the experiences of people with CP across GMFCS levels and identifies some consequences of growing up with the condition: physical and mental health issues, importance of meaningful participation, impact of the environment, and identity formation. Participants shared challenges related to accessibility, healthcare, social/environmental supports, relationships, and sustainable employment. Discussion: Body structure and function challenges impact participation in activities of daily living, threatening participants' ability to form positive identities and live meaningful lives. People with CP desire to work but may require additional training, accommodation, and support to do so. Environmental conditions, including relationships, supportive people, and accessibility, shape participants' health, well-being, and social/civic engagement. This study confirms the need for improved care for adults with CP, including multidisciplinary adult health team(s) and community services. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Effect of coronary anatomy and myocardial ischemia on long-term survival in patients with stable ischemic heart disease","2019","Background: The severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and of ischemia are evaluated to guide therapy, but their relative prognostic importance remains uncertain. Accordingly, we sought to clarify their association with long-term survival in the COURAGE trial (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation). Methods and Results: Survival data from after the original trial period ended was obtained at 15 Veterans Affairs sites and 13 of 18 United States non-Veterans Affairs sites. Date of death was obtained from the Veterans Affairs system-wide Corporate Data Warehouse and the National Death Index. Of the original 2287 patients in COURAGE, 1370 (60%) had both stress perfusion imaging and quantitative coronary angiography available, with extended survival evaluated in 767 subjects. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and a Cox proportional-hazards model adjusted for baseline differences. There were 369 all-cause deaths during a median follow-up of 7.9 years (range, 0-15 years). The number of coronary arteries diseased predicted survival (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09-1.43), whereas severity of ischemia did not (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.80-1.22). Percutaneous coronary intervention did not offer a survival advantage over optimal medical therapy (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77-1.16) and there was no interaction between therapeutic strategy and number of coronary arteries diseased or severity of ischemia. In fully adjusted models, the number of coronary arteries diseased was not associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: In univariate analysis, the number of coronary arteries diseased predicted long-term mortality, but severity of ischemia did not. Adjusted for baseline variables, neither assessment approach predicted mortality. Overall, there was no survival benefit from percutaneous coronary intervention in any subset defined by either angiographic or ischemic severity. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","cardiovascular agent; adult; Article; body weight control; cardiac patient; cardiovascular mortality; cause of death; coronary angiography; coronary artery; data warehouse; disease severity; exercise; female; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle revascularization; human; ischemic heart disease; lifestyle modification; long term survival; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; nutritional counseling; percutaneous coronary intervention; predictive value; priority journal; quantitative analysis; scintigraphy; secondary prevention; smoking cessation; United States"
"Relationships between atherosclerosis and plasma antioxidant micronutrients or red blood cell polyunsaturated fatty acids in people living with HIV","2019","Background: People living with human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (PLWH) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Diet-related factors may contribute. The aim of this pilot study was to determine, in PLWH, the relationship between atherosclerosis assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and (A) plasma antioxidant micronutrients and oxidative stress or (B) red blood cell polyunsaturated fatty acids (RBC PUFA), particularly long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). Methods: (A) In a cross-sectional study, subjects had CIMT evaluated by high resolution carotid artery ultrasound. Plasma was collected for vitamin C, measured by spectrophotometry; and alpha-and gamma-tocopherol, retinol, and malondialdehyde—a marker of oxidative stress—using high pressure liquid chromatography and fluorescence spectrophotometry. (B) In a prospective cohort study, other subjects had RBC PUFA measured at baseline, using gas chromatography, and CIMT assessed at baseline and repeated after 2 years. Clinical data was also collected. Results: (A) 91 PLWH participated. Only alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels were positively correlated with CIMT. In a multivariate analysis, age and systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with CIMT with gamma-tocopherol near significance (p = 0.053). (B) 69 PLWH participated. At baseline, docosahexaenoic acid (n-3 PUFA) and the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid to arachidonic acid (n-6 PUFA) were significantly and negatively correlated with CIMT. However, a multivariate analysis failed to detect a significant relationship either at baseline or 2 years after. Conclusion: In addition to age and systolic blood pressure, atherosclerosis assessed by CIMT might be associated with higher serum gamma-tocopherol levels. There was a non-significant association between CIMT and RBC n-3 PUFA or the ratio of n-3 to n-6 PUFA. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"Impact of delisting high-strength opioid formulations from a public drug benefit formulary on opioid utilization in Ontario, Canada","2019","Purpose: High-strength opioid formulations were delisted (removed) from Ontario's public drug formulary in January 2017, except for palliative patients. We evaluated the impact of this policy on opioid utilization and dosing. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study among patients receiving publicly funded, high-strength opioids from August 2016 to July 2017. The primary outcome measure was weekly median daily opioid dose (in milligrams of morphine or equivalent; MME) of (1) publicly funded and (2) all opioid prescriptions irrespective of funding source, evaluated using interrupted time series analyses and stratified by palliative care status. Results: Following policy implementation, the weekly median daily dose of publicly funded opioids decreased immediately among non-palliative patients by 10 MME (95% confidence limit [CL], ?16.8 to ?3.1) from a pre-intervention dose of 424.5 MME (95% CL, 417.8-431.2) and fell gradually among palliative patients by 3.9 MME per week (95% CL, ?5.5 to ?2.3) from a pre-intervention dose of 450.1 MME (95% CL, 432.5-467.7). In contrast, among all opioid prescriptions, gradual reductions in weekly median daily doses were observed only for non-palliative patients, which decreased by 0.7 MME per week (95% CL, ?1.3 to ?0.2) from a pre-intervention dose of 426.2 MME (95% CL, 420.9-431.5). Conclusion: The delisting of publicly-funded, high-strength opioids was accompanied by changes in funding source and small reductions in the weekly median daily doses dispensed. Although observed dose reductions of less than 1 MME weekly are likely not clinically relevant, safety implications of these changes require further monitoring. ? 2019 The Authors Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","opiate; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Canada; child; cohort analysis; drug formulary; drug utilization; female; funding; health care policy; human; infant; long term survival; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; newborn; outcome assessment; palliative therapy; prescription; priority journal; time series analysis"
"Dural-Based Marginal Zone Lymphoma in a Patient with Sarcoidosis","2019","Background: Primary dural-based lymphoma is a rare disease entity. It has been hypothesized that patients with sarcoidosis are at increased risk of developing lymphoma, an association known as “sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome,” although dural disease has not yet been reported in the literature. Case Description: Here we report the first case of dural-based lymphoma in a 60-year-old man with a history of sarcoidosis, in keeping with sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome. His dural-based tumor was surgically resected. Pathology examination revealed a marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Subsequent neural and systemic staging confirmed a localized lymphoma. The patient received local radiotherapy to control leptomeningeal disease. Conclusions: Given the association between sarcoidosis and lymphoma, we suggest lymphoma to be considered as one of the top differentials for a dural-based mass lesion in patients with sarcoidosis. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; cancer staging; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; dizziness; dural based marginal zone lymphoma; headache; human; human tissue; leptomeninx; lung biopsy; lung function test; lung nodule; male; marginal zone lymphoma; middle aged; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; sarcoidosis; sleep disordered breathing; thorax radiography; tumor localization; walking difficulty; complication; diagnostic imaging; dura mater; marginal zone lymphoma; sarcoidosis; Dura Mater; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone; Male; Middle Aged; Sarcoidosis"
"International comparison of cosmetic outcomes of breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy for women with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast","2020","Purpose: To assess the cosmetic impact of breast conserving surgery (BCS), whole breast irradiation (WBI) fractionation and tumour bed boost (TBB) use in a phase III trial for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. Materials and methods: Baseline and 3-year cosmesis were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Cosmetic Rating System and digital images in a randomised trial of non-low risk DCIS treated with postoperative WBI +/? TBB. Baseline cosmesis was assessed for four geographic clusters of treating centres. Cosmetic failure was a global score of fair or poor. Cosmetic deterioration was a score change from excellent or good at baseline to fair or poor at three years. Odds ratios for cosmetic deterioration by WBI dose-fractionation and TBB use were calculated for both scoring systems. Results: 1608 women were enrolled from 11 countries between 2007 and 2014. 85–90% had excellent or good baseline cosmesis independent of geography or assessment method. TBB (16 Gy in 8 fractions) was associated with a >2-fold risk of cosmetic deterioration (p < 0.001). Hypofractionated WBI (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions) achieved statistically similar 3-year cosmesis compared to conventional WBI (50 Gy in 25 fractions) (p ? 0.18). The adverse impact of a TBB was not significantly associated with WBI fractionation (interaction p ? 0.30). Conclusions: Cosmetic failure from BCS was similar across international jurisdictions. A TBB of 16 Gy increased the rate of cosmetic deterioration. Hypofractionated WBI achieved similar 3-year cosmesis as conventional WBI in women treated with BCS for DCIS. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; aged; Article; brachytherapy; breast radiotherapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; computer assisted tomography; dosimetry; female; geography; human; intraductal carcinoma; major clinical study; multicenter study; odds ratio; partial mastectomy; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; prospective study; radiation dose fractionation; radiotherapy dosage"
"Patient values and preferences regarding continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and artificial pancreas in adults with type 1 diabetes: A systematic review of quantitative and qualitative data","2019","Objective: We produced, through a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative evidence, a synthesis of the issues of importance (values and preferences) to adult patients with type 1 diabetes regarding treatment with automated insulin delivery systems. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from the inception of each database through September 2018. We included studies examining patient values and preferences for outcomes related to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or artificial pancreas treatment. We compiled structured summaries of the results and assessed the relative importance of each outcome. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment Development, and Evaluation) and CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approaches provided the structure for the evaluation of the quality of evidence and confidence in the findings. A mixed-methods result-based convergent design provided the structure for integration and presentation of results. Results: We reviewed 1665 unique citations; 19 studies (8 quantitative and 11 qualitative) proved eligible. Glycemic control is the key attribute that drives patients' preference. Reduction of glycemic variability and decreased incidence of hypoglycemia and chronic complications proved of intermediate importance and were ranked similarly to components of treatment burden, including the size and appearance of devices, cost, ease of use, and the embarrassment of public use. Conclusions: Clinician guidance may play a crucial role in determining patient values and preferences (for instance, patients' priority in glucose control rather than avoiding diabetic complications). Our results provide guidance for clinicians in discussing preferred insulin delivery systems with patients with type 1 diabetes. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","insulin; insulin; adult; Article; chronic disease; cost; devices; disease burden; drug delivery system; embarrassment; glycemic control; human; hypoglycemia; incidence; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin infusion; patient preference; priority journal; systematic review; artificial pancreas; blood; glucose blood level; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Infusion Systems; Pancreas, Artificial; Patient Preference"
"Prevalence of venous thromboembolism after lung surgery in China: A single-centre, prospective cohort study involving patients undergoing lung resections without perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis","2019","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common postoperative complication. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of VTE after major thoracic surgery ranges from 2.3% to 15%. However, there have been no such data from China so far. To evaluate the incidence of postoperative VTE, we conducted a single-centre, prospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients who underwent lung resections between July 2016 and March 2017 were enrolled in this study. None of the patients received any prophylaxis perioperatively. All patients were screened for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) using non-invasive duplex lower-extremity ultrasonography 30 days before surgery and within 30 days after surgery and before discharge. Chest tomography, pulmonary embolism protocol was carried out if patients had one of the following conditions: (i) typical symptoms of pulmonary embolism, (ii) high Caprini score (>9 points) and (iii) newly diagnosed postoperative DVT. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-two patients undergoing lung surgery were enrolled, including 115 benign and 147 malignant disease cases. The procedures included 84 sublobar lung resections, 161 lobectomies, 5 pneumonectomies and 12 mixed procedures. The overall postoperative incidence of VTE was 11.5% (30 of 262). Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with DVT (80.0%) and 6 with DVT + pulmonary embolism (20.0%). None of the patients diagnosed with VTE had obvious symptoms of VTE. The median time for VTE detection was 5 days postoperatively. The incidence of VTE was 7.0% in patients with benign lung diseases and 15.0% in those with malignant lung diseases (P < 0.05). Using the Caprini risk assessment model, 63 cases were scored as low risk, 179 as moderate risk and 20 as high risk, and each group had an incidence of postoperative VTE of 0%, 12.3% (22 of 179) and 40.0% (8 of 20), respectively (P < 0.05). In patients with lung cancer, 98% were moderate or high risk, and only 3 patients were scored in the low risk category. The incidence of VTE in patients at moderate risk and high risk was 12.0% and 36.8%, respectively, while it was 0 in low-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: The following conclusions were drawn: (i) the overall incidence of postoperative VTE after lung surgery without VTE prophylaxis is substantial; (ii) lower-extremity ultrasonography was helpful in detecting asymptomatic DVT in symptomatic or high-risk patients; and (iii) VTE prophylaxis should be considered as a mandatory part of perioperative care. ? 2018.

"Effects of Dose Rate on the Reproductive Cell Death and Early Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Different Human Epithelium-Derived Cells Exposed to Gamma Rays","2019","Dose rate is one of the most varied experimental parameters in radiation biology research. In this study, effects of dose rates on the radiation responses of 2 different types of human epithelium-derived cells, immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT), and colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53?/?) were systematically studied. Cells were γ-irradiated at one of the 4 dose rates (24.6, 109, 564, and 1168 mGy/min) to a total dose of 0.5 to 2 Gy. Clonogenic survival and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured to assess the levels of reproductive cell death and damage to mitochondrial physiology, respectively. It was found that clonogenic survival was similar at all 4 tested dose rates in the 3 cell lines. The loss of MMP occurred at all tested dose rates in all 3 cell lines except for one case where the MMP increased in HCT116 p53+/+cells after exposure to 0.5 Gy at 24.6 mGy/min. In HCT116 cells, the loss of MMP was the most severe at high dose/dose rate combination exposure and when p53 was expressed. In contrast, no effect in dose rate was observed with HaCaT cells as the reduction level of MMP was similar at the tested dose rates. ?

"No changes in corticospinal excitability, biochemical markers, and working memory after six weeks of high-intensity interval training in sedentary males","2019","A single bout of aerobic exercise modulates corticospinal excitability, intracortical circuits, and serum biochemical markers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). These effects have important implications for the use of exercise in neurorehabilitation. Here, we aimed to determine whether increases in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) induced by 18 sessions of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) over 6?weeks were accompanied by changes in corticospinal excitability, intracortical excitatory and inhibitory circuits, serum biochemical markers and working memory (WM) capacity in sedentary, healthy, young males. We assessed motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) both at rest and during tonic contraction, intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We also examined serum levels of BDNF, IGF-1, total and precursor (pro) cathepsin B (CTSB), as well as WM capacity. Compared to pretraining, CRF was increased and ICF reduced after the HIIT intervention, but there were no changes in corticospinal excitability, SICI, BDNF, IGF-1, total and pro-CTSB, and WM capacity. Further, greater CRF gains were associated with larger decreases in total and pro-CTSB and, only in Val/Val carriers, with larger increases in SICI. Our findings confirm that HIIT is efficacious in promoting CRF and show that corticospinal excitability, biochemical markers, and WM are unchanged after 18 HIIT bouts in sedentary males. Understanding how aerobic exercise modulates M1 excitability is important in order to be able to use exercise protocols as an intervention, especially in rehabilitation following brain injuries. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Prevalence of Pre-Pregnancy Diabetes, Obesity, and Hypertension in Canada","2019","Objective: Pre-existing diabetes mellitus (D), obesity (O), and chronic hypertension (H) can each alter the natural course of pregnancy, especially when they cluster together. Because the prevalence of various combinations of D, O, and H is unknown, the current study was undertaken. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study included 506 483 singleton and twin live birth and stillbirth deliveries in Ontario, occurring at ?20 weeks gestation. All hospital births from 2012 to 2016 were identified in the Better Outcomes Registry and Network information system. The prevalence per 1000 births (95% confidence interval [CI]) of D, O, and H and their combinations were calculated. Prevalence estimates were stratified by twin and singleton gestations, maternal age, parity, and ethnicity (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2). Results: During the study period, 5493 women (10.8 per 1000 births; 95% CI 10.6–11.1) had D, 90,177 (178.2; 95% CI 177.0–179.3) had O, and 5667 (11.2; 95% CI 10.9–11.5) had H. The prevalence per 1000 of DO was 4.8, DH 1.0, and OH 5.5, whereas 359 women (0.71 per 1000) had all three. D and H each linearly increased with rising maternal age, along with their combinations, and to some degree with higher parity. The combination of O and H was highest among women of Black ancestry (14.5 per 1000) and lowest among those of Asian ancestry (3.0 per 1000). Conclusion: D, O, and H are common conditions in pregnancy, both alone and in various combinations. These data can be used to assess the impact of each state on perinatal health. ? 2019 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Soci?t? des obst?triciens et gyn?cologues du Canada.","adult; Article; Asian; Black person; Canada; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; ethnic difference; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; maternal age; middle aged; obesity; parity; pregnancy; prevalence; twin pregnancy; young adult"
"Host–Microbe Interplay in the Cardiometabolic Benefits of Dietary Polyphenols","2019","Polyphenols are nonessential phytonutrients abundantly found in fruits and vegetables. A wealth of data from preclinical models and clinical trials consistently supports cardiometabolic benefits associated with dietary polyphenols in murine models and humans. Furthermore, a growing number of studies have shown that specific classes of polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins (PACs)and ellagitannins, as well as the stilbenoid resveratrol, can alleviate several features of the metabolic syndrome. Moreover, mounting evidence points to the gut microbiota as a key mediator of the health benefits of polyphenols. In this review we summarize recent findings supporting the beneficial potential of polyphenols against cardiometabolic diseases, with a focus on the role of host–microbe interactions. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Food Safety Education Needs of High-School Students: Leftovers, Lunches, and Microwaves","2019","BACKGROUND: We explored priority areas of food safety education needed by high-school students within Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We analyzed transcripts from semistructured interviews with 20 experts in food safety, food safety education in youth, and high-school education in Ontario. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify priority food safety education needs. RESULTS: We identified 4 priority action areas for food safety education targeting students: how to safely do the things they typically do with food; how to keep themselves and their kitchens clean and safe; how microorganisms grow and how they can result in foodborne disease; and how to keep food out of the “danger zone” 4°C to 60°C (40° F to 140° F). The results indicate that students need specific education around the use of microwaves, consumption of convenience meals, preparing and handling foods at school events, and safe transportation of food for lunches, school trips, and sporting events. CONCLUSIONS: High-school students need food safety education specific to their usual interactions with food, including the foods, tools, and settings students regularly encounter. Delivery of food safety education should emphasize sequences of safe food-handling behaviors for specific food interactions, such as reheating a meal in the microwave, rather than traditional food safety concepts, such as temperature abuse. ? 2019, American School Health Association",""

Overall, 578 patients were randomized 1:1 to either ibrutinib (420 mg daily) or placebo, in combination with 6 cycles of BR, followed by ibrutinib or placebo alone. Median follow-up was 34.8 months (range: 0.1–45.8). Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for ibrutinib+BR, versus 14.3 months for placebo+BR (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI], 0.206 [0.159–0.265]; P < 0.0001); 36-month PFS rates were 68.0% versus 13.9%, respectively. The results are consistent with the primary analysis findings (HR = 0.203, as assessed by independent review committee, with 17-month median follow-up). Median overall survival was not reached in either arm; HR (95% CI) for ibrutinib+BR versus placebo: 0.652 (0.454–0.935; P = 0.019). Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative response rates were 26.3% for ibrutinib+BR and 6.2% for placebo+BR (P < 0.0001). Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (including grades 3–4) were generally consistent with the initial HELIOS report.

"Peripheral artery endothelial function responses to altered shear stress patterns in humans","2019","New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What is the effect of altered shear stress pattern, with or without concurrent neurohumoral and metabolic activation, on the acute endothelial function response assessed via brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation? What is the main finding and its importance? Despite generating distinctive shear stress patterns (i.e. increases in anterograde only, anterograde only with neurohumoral and metabolic activation, and both anterograde and retrograde), similar acute improvements were observed in the brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation response in all conditions, indicating that anterograde and/or turbulent shear stress might be the essential element to induce acute increases in endothelial function. Abstract: Endothelial function is influenced by both the direction and the magnitude of shear stress. Acute improvements in endothelial function have mostly been attributed to increased anterograde shear, whereas results from many interventional models in humans suggest that enhancing shear stress in an oscillatory manner (anterograde and retrograde) might be optimal. Here, we determined the acute brachial artery shear stress (SS) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) responses to three shear-altering interventions [passive heat stress (HEAT), mechanical forearm compression (CUFF) and handgrip exercise (HGEX)] and examined the relationship between changes in oscillatory shear index (OSI) and changes in FMD. During separate visits, 10 young healthy men (22?±?3?years old) underwent 10?min of HEAT, CUFF or HGEX in their left forearm. Anterograde and retrograde SS, Reynolds number, OSI and FMD were assessed at rest and during/after each intervention. Anterograde SS increased during all interventions in a stepwise manner (P?&lt;?0.05 between interventions), with the change in HGEX (?37.7?±?12.2?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05)?&gt;?CUFF (?25.1?±?11.9?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05)?&gt;?HEAT (?14.5?±?7.9?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05). Retrograde SS increased during CUFF (??19.6?±?4.3?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05). Anterograde blood flow was turbulent (i.e. Reynolds number???|2000|) during all interventions (P?&lt;?0.05). The relative FMD improved after all interventions (P?=?0.01), and there was no relationship between ?OSI and ?FMD. We elicited changes in SS profiles including increased anterograde SS (HEAT and HGEX) and both increased anterograde and retrograde SS (CUFF); regardless of the SS pattern, FMD improved to the same extent. These findings suggest that the presence of anterograde and/or turbulent SS might be the key to optimizing endothelial function in acute assessment protocols. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Assessing Organizational Supports for Evidence-Based Decision Making in Local Public Health Departments in the United States: Development and Psychometric Properties of a New Measure","2019","Context: Fostering evidence-based decision making (EBDM) within local public health departments and among local health department (LHD) practitioners is crucial for the successful translation of research into public health practice to prevent and control chronic disease. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify organizational supports for EBDM within LHDs and determine psychometric properties of a measure of organizational supports for EBDM in LHDs. Design: Cross-sectional, observation study. Setting: Local public health departments in the United States. Participants: Local health department practitioners (N = 376) across the United States participated in the study. Main Outcome Measures: Local health department practitioners completed a survey containing 27 items about organizational supports for EBDM. Most items were adapted from previously developed surveys, and input from researchers and practitioners guided survey development. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test and refine the psychometric properties of the measure. Results: The final solution included 6 factors of 22 items: awareness of EBDM (3 items), capacity for EBDM (7 items), resources availability (3 items), evaluation capacity (3 items), EBDM climate cultivation (3 items), and partnerships to support EBDM (3 items). This factor solution achieved acceptable fit (eg, Comparative Fit Index = 0.965). Logistic regression models showed positive relationships between the 6 factors and the number of evidence-based interventions delivered. Conclusions: This study identified important organizational supports for EBDM within LHDs. Results of this study can be used to understand and enhance organizational processes and structures to support EBDM to improve LHD performance and population health. Strong measures are important for understanding how LHDs support EBDM, evaluating interventions to improve LHD capacity, and to guide programmatic and policy efforts within LHDs. ? 2019.

"Urinary hydroxypyrene determination for biomonitoring of firefighters deployed at the Fort McMurray wildfire: an inter-laboratory method comparison","2019","Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (OH-Pyr) is widely used for biomonitoring human exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from air pollution and tobacco smoke. However, there have been few rigorous validation studies reported to ensure reliable OH-Pyr determination for occupational health and risk assessment. Herein, we report an inter-laboratory method comparison for urinary OH-Pyr when using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on urine specimens collected from firefighters (n = 42) deployed at the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire. Overall, there was good mutual agreement in urinary OH-Pyr quantification following enzyme deconjugation with an average bias of 39% with no significant deviation from linearity (slope = 1.36; p > 0.05), whereas technical precision (< 12%) and average recovery (> 85%) were acceptable when using a stable-isotope internal standard. Faster analysis times (4?min) were achieved by LC-MS/MS without chemical derivatization, whereas lower detection limits (0.64?ng/L, S/N = 3) was realized with solid-phase extraction prior to GC-HRMS. A median creatinine normalized OH-Pyr concentration of 128?ng/g was measured for firefighters that were below the recommended biological exposure index due to delays between early stages of emergency firefighting and urine sample collection. Similar outcomes were also measured for 3-hydroxyphenanthrene and 9-hydroxyfluorene that were positively correlated with urinary OH-Pyr (p < 0.05), implying similar uptake, distribution, and liver biotransformation processes. Optimal specimen collection strategies post-deployment together with standardized protocols for OH-PAH analysis are critical to accurately evaluate smoke exposure in firefighters, including experimental conditions to ensure quantitative enzyme hydrolysis of urine samples.

"Treatment of bleeding complications in patients on anticoagulant therapy","2019","Anticoagulant therapy is often refrained from out of fear of hemorrhagic complications. The most frequent type of major bleeding is gastrointestinal, but intracranial hemorrhage has the worst prognosis. Management of these complications in patients on anticoagulants should follow the same routines as for nonanticoagulated patients, as described here with the previously mentioned bleeds as examples. In addition, for life-threatening or massive hemorrhages, reversal of the anticoagulant effect is also crucial. Adequate reversal requires information on which anticoagulant the patient has taken and when the last dose was ingested. Laboratory data can be of some help, but not for all anticoagulants in the emergency setting. This is reviewed here for the different types of anticoagulants: vitamin K antagonists, heparins, fondaparinux, thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Specific antidotes for the latter are becoming available, but supportive care and nonspecific support for hemostasis with antifibrinolytic agents or prothrombin complex concentrates, which are widely available, should be kept in mind. ? 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.","andexanet alfa; anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; fondaparinux; heparin; idarucizumab; protamine sulfate; prothrombin complex; recombinant blood clotting factor 7a; thrombin inhibitor; tranexamic acid; vitamin K group; anticoagulant agent; antithrombin; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; heparin; vitamin K group; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; bleeding; brain hemorrhage; drug antagonism; drug mechanism; early intervention; emergency health service; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; hemodialysis; human; international normalized ratio; nonhuman; plasma; priority journal; Review; bleeding; disease management; Anticoagulants; Antithrombins; Disease Management; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Hemorrhage; Heparin; Humans; Vitamin K"
"Complex abdominal wall hernias as a barrier to quality of life in cancer survivors","2019","Background: Many cancer survivors live with postoperative complex abdominal wall hernias (CAWHs). However, the impact of CAWHs on their quality of life is unknown, and few descriptions of patient experiences exist. We performed a qualitative study to explore cancer survivors’ experience with CAWHs before and after repair. Methods: Patients waiting to undergo CAWH repair or who had completed the surgery in the previous 18 months were identified from a single surgeon’s practice in CAWH at a tertiary care centre. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the electronic patient record. An in-depth semistructured interview guide was developed by experts in CAWH and qualitative methodology. Interviews were conducted in March 2013. We used comparative analysis techniques and coding strategies to identify themes. Results: Ten preoperative and 12 postoperative participants were interviewed. The average age of the participants was 64 years in both groups, with an even sex distribution. The most frequently diagnosed cancer in both groups was colorectal cancer. Participants’ views were organized into 5 themes: 1) unable to return to normal life, 2) sense of abandonment, 3) experiencing fear and distress, 4) preoperative: desperate for help and 5) postoperative: “getting my life back.” Conclusions: Our findings show the all-encompassing impact of a CAWH on the life of cancer survivors. They strongly suggest that hernia management should be viewed as an integral part in the continuum of cancer treatment to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors with hernias. ? 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors",""
"Pan-Canadian standards for cancer surgery","2019","About the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer: The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) is an independent organization funded by the federal government to accelerate action on cancer control for all Canadians. As the steward of the Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control (the Strategy), the Partnership works with Canada’s cancer community to take action to ensure fewer people get cancer, more people survive cancer and those living with the disease have a better quality of life. This work is guided by the Strategy, which was refreshed for 2019 to 2029, and will help drive measurable change for all Canadians affected by cancer. The Strategy includes 5 priorities that will tackle the most pressing challenges in cancer control as well as distinct First Nations, Inuit and M?tis Peoples–specific priorities and actions reflecting Canada’s commitment to reconciliation. A specific action in the Strategy calls for reducing the differences in practice and service delivery by setting standards for high-quality care and promoting their adoption. The CPAC will oversee the implementation of the priorities in collaboration with organizations and individuals on the front lines of cancer care: the provinces and territories; health care professionals; people living with cancer and those who care for them; First Nations, Inuit and M?tis communities; governments and organizations; and its funder, Health Canada.

"Biparametric vs multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of prostate cancer in treatment-na?ve patients: a diagnostic test accuracy systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Objective: To perform a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic review and meta-analysis comparing multiparametric (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], and dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE] imaging) magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and biparametric (DWI and T2WI) MRI (bpMRI) in detecting prostate cancer in treatment-na?ve patients. Methods: The Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE) were searched to identify relevant studies published after 1 January 2012. Articles underwent title, abstract, and full-text screening. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients with suspected prostate cancer, bpMRI and/or mpMRI as the index test(s), histopathology as the reference standard, and a DTA outcome measure. Methodological and DTA data were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. DTA metrics were pooled using bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess for heterogeneity. Results: From an initial 3502 studies, 31 studies reporting on 9480 patients (4296 with prostate cancer) met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis; 25 studies reported on mpMRI (7000 patients, 2954 with prostate cancer) and 12 studies reported on bpMRI DTA (2716 patients, 1477 with prostate cancer). Pooled summary statistics demonstrated no significant difference for sensitivity (mpMRI: 86%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 81–90; bpMRI: 90%, 95% CI 83–94) or specificity (mpMRI: 73%, 95% CI 64–81; bpMRI: 70%, 95% CI 42–83). The summary receiver operating characteristic curves were comparable for mpMRI (0.87) and bpMRI (0.90). Conclusions: No significant difference in DTA was found between mpMRI and bpMRI in diagnosing prostate cancer in treatment-na?ve patients. Study heterogeneity warrants cautious interpretation of the results. With replication of our findings in dedicated validation studies, bpMRI may serve as a faster, cheaper, gadolinium-free alternative to mpMRI. ? 2019 The Authors BJU International ? 2019 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer therapy; diagnostic accuracy; diffusion weighted imaging; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; histopathology; human; meta analysis; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; priority journal; prostate cancer; Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies; receiver operating characteristic; Review; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review"
"Integrating early palliative care into routine practice for patients with cancer: A mixed methods evaluation of the INTEGRATE Project","2019","Objective: With increasing evidence from controlled trials on benefits of early palliative care, there is a need for studies examining implementation in real-world settings. The INTEGRATE Project was a 3-year real-world project that promoted early identification and support of patients with cancer who may benefit from palliative care. This study assesses feasibility, stakeholder experiences, and early impact of the INTEGRATE Project. Methods: The INTEGRATE Project was implemented in four cancer centers in Ontario, Canada, and consisted of interdisciplinary provider education and an integrated care model. Providers used the Surprise Question to identify patients for inclusion. A mixed methods evaluation of INTEGRATE was conducted using descriptive data, interviews with providers and managers, and provider surveys. Results: A total of 760 patients with cancer (lung, glioblastoma, head and neck, gastrointestinal) were included. Results suggest improvement in provider confidence to deliver palliative care and to initiate the Advanced Care Planning (ACP) conversation. The majority of patients (85%) had an ACP or goals of care (GOC) conversation initiated within a mean time to conversation of 5-46?days (SD 20-93) across centers. A primary care report was transmitted to family doctors 48-100% of the time within a mean time to transmission of 7-54?days (SD 9-27) across centers. Enablers and barriers influencing success of the model were also identified. Conclusions: A standardized model for the early introduction of palliative care for patients with cancer can be integrated into the routine practice of oncology providers, with appropriate education, integration into existing clinical workflows, and administrative support. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article; behavior change; general practitioner; glioblastoma; head and neck cancer; health care delivery; human; interview; lung cancer; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; medical education; nurse practitioner; oncologist; palliative therapy; patient care; primary medical care; registered nurse"
"Rationale, design, and baseline participant characteristics in the MRI and cognitive substudy of the cardiovascular outcomes for people using anticoagulation strategies trial","2019","Background: Covert vascular disease of the brain manifests as infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, and microbleeds on MRI. Their cumulative effect is often a decline in cognition, motor impairment, and psychiatric disorders. Preventive therapies for covert brain ischemia have not been established but represent a huge unmet clinical need. Aims: The MRI substudy examines the effects of the antithrombotic regimens in COMPASS on incident covert brain infarcts (the primary outcome), white matter hyperintensities, and cognitive and functional status in a sample of consenting COMPASS participants without contraindications to MRI. Methods: COMPASS is a randomized superiority trial testing rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid plus acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid against acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg per day for the combined endpoint of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death in individuals with stable coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T2*-weighted, and FLAIR images were obtained close to randomization and near the termination of assigned antithrombotic therapy; biomarker and genetic samples at randomization and one month, and cognitive and functional assessment at randomization, after two years and at the end of study. Results: Between March 2013 and May 2016, 1905 participants were recruited from 86 centers in 16 countries. Of these participants, 1760 underwent baseline MRI scans that were deemed technically adequate for interpretation. The mean age at entry of participants with interpretable MRI was 71 years and 23.5% were women. Coronary artery disease was present in 90.4% and 28.1% had peripheral artery disease. Brain infarcts were present in 34.8%, 29.3% had cerebral microbleeds, and 93.0% had white matter hyperintensities. The median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 26 (interquartile range 23–28). Conclusions: The COMPASS MRI substudy will examine the effect of the antithrombotic interventions on MRI-determined covert brain infarcts and cognition. Demonstration of a therapeutic effect of the antithrombotic regimens on brain infarcts would have implications for prevention of cognitive decline and provide insight into the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive decline. ? 2018 World Stroke Organization.","acetylsalicylic acid; rivaroxaban; anticoagulant agent; rivaroxaban; aged; anticoagulation; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain infarction; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; controlled study; coronary artery disease; female; functional status; heart death; heart infarction; human; major clinical study; male; Montreal cognitive assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); white matter; brain; brain infarction; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; cognitive defect; magnetic resonance angiography; middle aged; pathology; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Aged; Anticoagulants; Brain; Brain Infarction; Brain Ischemia; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Rivaroxaban; Stroke; Treatment Outcome"
"Perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in prostate cancer surgery","2019","Purpose: To describe a patient and procedure specific approach to selecting Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for men who undergo radical prostatectomy. Methods: We performed a literature search and narrative review of VTE after radical prostatectomy. We describe the current paradigm of perioperative thromboprophylaxis and underlying rationale. Relevant findings from the European Association of Urology thromboprophylaxis guidelines are interpreted and summarized. Results: The use of extended post-operative thromboprophylaxis for patients who undergo radical prostatectomy is appropriate when the risk of symptomatic VTE outweighs the risk of major bleeding. Patient and procedure factors impact VTE risk. Patient risk can be stratified as low, moderate or high based on 4 factors; age > 75, BMI > 35, VTE in a first degree relative, and personal history of VTE. Procedure risk of VTE and bleeding can be stratified by modality of surgery (open, laparoscopic, robotic) and extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy. Using these factors, patients at the lowest risk for VTE will have an expected incidence of VTE of 0.4–0.8% and those at highest risk from 1.5 to 15.7%. Incidence of major bleeding ranges from 0.4 to 1.4%. These ranges emphasize the need to consider the net benefit for each specific patient. Use of mechanical prophylaxis is supported by weaker evidence but has fewer harms and is likely reasonable for most patients. Conclusion: Many patients who undergo radical prostatectomy will benefit from extended post-operative thromboprophylaxis. Risk of thrombosis is likely higher with open approach and extended lymph node dissection. The net benefit of treatment should be considered using patient- and procedure-specific criteria. When the net benefit is negligible or possibly harmful no pharmacological thromboprophylaxis should be used. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",""
"To screen or not to screen? Exploring the value of parent mental health screening in children’s rehabilitation services","2019","Purpose: Parents of children with disabilities are at increased risk of mental health challenges, yet it is unclear whether parent mental health screening should be considered in the context of children’s rehabilitation. Methods: A nonsystematic narrative review was conducted guided by a framework for assessing the effectiveness of proposed health screening programs. Screening for the purpose of recommending further assessments and/or psychosocial supports and services was considered. The potential harms and benefits of mental health screening for parents of children with disability were examined considering relevant contextual factors. Results and conclusions: While best evidence in the form of a randomized controlled trial in this population does not yet exist, there was evidence to suggest that parent mental health is an important factor in promoting child and family health and well-being and deserves consideration in the practice of family-centered care. If appropriate referral pathways and resources are developed, children’s rehabilitation service providers may be in an advantageous position to provide parent mental health screening.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Parents of children with disabilities are at increased risk for depression, stress, and anxiety. Service providers may be well placed to identify mental health concerns through screening. Contextual factors to consider before initiating screening include level of evidence for screening, whether screening would reach target clients, and whether additional supports are available. Children’s rehabilitation service providers can be family-centered by attending to parent mental health needs, with the potential to improve the health, development, and well-being of the whole family. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"“I think I am worth it. I can give up committing suicide”: Pathways to recovery for Chinese-Canadian women with a history of suicidal behaviour","2019","This qualitative study explored the experiences and patterns of recovery of Chinese-born women living in Canada with a history of suicidal behaviour. It explores a number of dimensions of recovery including clinical, existential, functional, physical, and social. The women described engaging in “survival” recovery in the short term and “thriving” recovery in the long term, with survival strategies extending into the thriving phase of recovery during their complex path to it. The survival recovery phase included accessing culturally sensitive mental health care and obtaining social and instrumental support to help ensure safety, manage stress, and treat psychiatric symptoms. The thriving phase of recovery was described as involving six components: developing an explanatory model with their health care provider; undertaking a process of narrative reflection and prioritizing self-care; engaging in interdisciplinary care team support; engaging the support of family and friends; exploring spiritual and existential supports; and creating goals for the future and a sense of mastery. Through these six avenues, the women began to experience a sense of self-efficacy and agency that improved their ability to cope with stress and pressure, leading to building a life with meaning. The interviews provided insights into how clinical care can be improved and how practitioners can implement a more recovery-oriented approach to practice. ?

"Reliability of transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of afferent inhibition","2019","Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-latency afferent inhibition (LAI) are well-known transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms used to probe the sensorimotor system. To date, there is a paucity of research examining the reliability of these neurophysiological measures. This information is required to validate the utility of afferent inhibition as a biomarker of neural function. The goal of this study was to quantify the absolute reliability, relative reliability, and smallest detectable change (SDC) of SAI and LAI using a test-retest paradigm. 30 healthy individuals (20.9 ± 2.5 years) participated in two sessions (intersession interval of ~7 days). Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEMeas), and SDC. The results show that LAI and SAI had poor-to-moderate relative reliability as determined by the ICC, with digital nerve LAI displaying the highest relative reliability (highest ICC with smallest confidence interval). The %SEMeas indicated a large amount of measurement error in all measures of afferent inhibition, with LAI exhibiting more measurement error than SAI. The SDC was large at the individual level (SDCindiv), but analyses showed that the SDC is significantly reduced at the group-level (SDCgroup). Our results indicate that digital nerve LAI is the most reliable outcome to differentiate between individuals within a sample. Further, results suggest that SAI and LAI are not appropriate indicators of individual neurophysiological change across time but can reliably detect changes in group-averaged data providing sample sizes are sufficient. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; human; human experiment; human tissue; male; measurement error; nerve; quantitative analysis; reliability; sample size; transcranial magnetic stimulation"
"The relationship between maternal body mass index and pregnancy outcomes in twin compared with singleton pregnancies","2020","Objecive: Women with twins have an a priori increased risk for many of the complications associated with maternal obesity. Thus, the impact of maternal obesity in twins may differ from that reported in singletons. In addition, given the increased metabolic demands in twin pregnancies, the impact of maternal underweight may be greater in twin compared with singleton gestations. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that the relationship between maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and adverse pregnancy outcomes differ between twin and singleton gestations. Methods: This was a retrospective population-based study of all women who had a singleton or twin hospital birth in Ontario, Canada, between April 2012 and March 2016. Data were obtained from the Better Outcomes Registry &amp; Network (BORN) Ontario. The relationship between maternal BMI category and pregnancy complications was assessed separately in twin and singleton gestations. The primary outcome was a composite variable that included any of the following complications: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth before 320/7 weeks. Relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for adverse outcomes for each BMI category as defined by WHO (using normal weight category as reference) were generated using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for maternal age, nulliparity, smoking, previous preterm birth, and fetal sex. Results: A total of 487,870 women with singleton (n = 480,010) and twin (n = 7860) pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. The risk of the composite primary outcome, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and cesarean delivery increased with high maternal BMI in both singleton and twin gestations, but these associations were weaker in twin compared with singleton gestations (association of BMI ? 40.0 kg/m2 with primary outcome: aRR = 3.10, 95%-CI 2.96–3.24 in singletons compared with aRR = 1.74, 95%-CI 1.37–2.20 in twins). In singleton pregnancies the risk of preterm birth at &lt; 320/7 weeks increased with maternal BMI, mainly due to an increased risk of provider-initiated preterm birth. In twin gestations, however, underweight (but not overweight or obesity) was associated with the greatest risk of preterm birth at &lt; 32 weeks (aRR 1.67, 95%-CI 1.17–2.37), mainly due to an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth (aRR 2.10, 95%-CI 1.44–3.08). Conclusion: In healthy women with twin pregnancies, underweight is associated with the greatest risk for preterm birth, while the association of maternal obesity with adverse pregnancy outcomes is weaker than that observed in singletons. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Article; birth weight; body mass; cesarean section; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; maternal obesity; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; priority journal; retrospective study; singleton pregnancy; twin pregnancy; underweight"
"Re-evaluation of the linear no-threshold (LNT) model using new paradigms and modern molecular studies","2019","The linear no-threshold (LNT) model is currently used to estimate low dose radiation (LDR) induced health risks. This model lacks safety thresholds and postulates that health risks caused by ionizing radiation is directly proportional to dose. Therefore even the smallest radiation dose has the potential to cause an increase in cancer risk. Advances in LDR biology and cell molecular techniques demonstrate that the LNT model does not appropriately reflect the biology or the health effects at the low dose range. The main pitfall of the LNT model is due to the extrapolation of mutation and DNA damage studies that were conducted at high radiation doses delivered at a high dose-rate. These studies formed the basis of several outdated paradigms that are either incorrect or do not hold for LDR doses. Thus, the goal of this review is to summarize the modern cellular and molecular literature in LDR biology and provide new paradigms that better represent the biological effects in the low dose range. We demonstrate that LDR activates a variety of cellular defense mechanisms including DNA repair systems, programmed cell death (apoptosis), cell cycle arrest, senescence, adaptive memory, bystander effects, epigenetics, immune stimulation, and tumor suppression. The evidence presented in this review reveals that there are minimal health risks (cancer) with LDR exposure, and that a dose higher than some threshold value is necessary to achieve the harmful effects classically observed with high doses of radiation. Knowledge gained from this review can help the radiation protection community in making informed decisions regarding radiation policy and limits. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","apoptosis; cancer inhibition; cancer risk; cell cycle arrest; DNA damage; epigenetics; genomics; health hazard; human; immunostimulation; ionizing radiation; linear no threshold model; memory; molecular mechanics; mutational analysis; nonhuman; radiation dose distribution; radiation exposure; radiation protection; radiological parameters; Review; senescence; radiation dose; radiation response; risk assessment; statistical model; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Humans; Linear Models; Models, Statistical; Radiation Dosage; Risk Assessment"
"Prostaglandin E2 inhibits profibrotic function of human pulmonary fibroblasts by disrupting Ca2+ signaling","2019","We have shown that calcium (Ca2+) oscillations in human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPFs) contribute to profibrotic effects of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and that disruption of these oscillations blunts features of pulmonary fibrosis. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exerts antifibrotic effects in the lung, but the mechanisms for this action are not well defined. We thus sought to explore interactions between PGE2 and the profibrotic agent TGF-β in pulmonary fibroblasts (PFs) isolated from patients with or without idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). PGE2 inhibited TGF-β-promoted [Ca2+] oscillations and prevented the activation of Akt and Ca2+/calmodulindependent protein kinase-II (CaMK-II) but did not prevent activation of Smad-2 or ERK. PGE2 also eliminated TGF-β-stimulated expression of collagen A1, fibronectin, and β-smooth muscle actin and reduced stress fiber formation in the HPFs. RNA sequencing revealed that HPFs preferentially express EP2 receptors relative to other prostanoid receptor subtypes: EP2 expression is ~10-fold higher than that of EP2 receptors; EP2 and EP2 receptors are barely detectable; and EP2-receptor expression is ~3.5-fold lower in PFs from IPF patients than in normal HPFs. The inhibitory effects of PGE2 on synthetic function and stress fiber formation were blocked by selective EP2 or EP2 antagonists and mimicked by selective EP2 or EP2 agonists, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin, all of which elevate cellular cAMP concentrations. We conclude that PGE2, likely predominantly via EP2 receptors, interferes with Ca2+ signaling, CaMK-II activation, and Akt activation in IPF-HPFs and HPFs treated with TGF-β. Moreover, a decreased expression of EP2 receptors in pulmonary fibroblasts from IPF patients may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disease. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","alpha smooth muscle actin; calcium; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; collagen type 1; fibronectin; forskolin; isobutylmethylxanthine; mitogen activated protein kinase; prostaglandin E2; prostanoid receptor; RNA; Smad2 protein; transforming growth factor beta; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; mitogen activated protein kinase; prostaglandin E receptor 2; prostaglandin E2; protein kinase B; Smad2 protein; SMAD2 protein, human; transforming growth factor beta; aged; Article; calcium signaling; controlled study; female; fibrosing alveolitis; human; human cell; human tissue; lung fibroblast; lung fibrosis; male; oscillation; priority journal; protein expression; RNA sequence; biosynthesis; calcium signaling; cell culture; drug effect; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; lung; lung fibrosis; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Calcium Signaling; Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2; Cells, Cultured; Dinoprostone; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP2 Subtype; Smad2 Protein; Transforming Growth Factor beta"
"Polyphenolic natural products and natural product–inspired steroidal mimics as aromatase inhibitors","2019","The discovery of biologically active polyphenolic natural products, including chalcones, stilbenes, flavanones, and isoflavones as steroidal mimics has proven to be a subject of considerable importance in medicine. Some of these natural compounds have been shown to modulate key human metabolic processes via steroidal hormone receptors, or to inhibit crucial enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of steroidal hormones themselves. Isoflavone polyphenolics such as genistein are well known for this “phytoestrogenic” biological activity. This review focuses on the ability of select polyphenolics and their synthetic derivatives to function as steroidal mimics in the inhibition of the enzyme aromatase, thereby lowering production of endogenous estrogen growth hormones. The discovery of potent, natural product–based aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as hit compounds has led to the introduction of steroidal-based irreversible inhibitors, such as exemestane and reversible AIs such as anastrozole and letrozole, now standard therapy in the treatment of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer and other hormone related indications. Pursuit of this strategy over the last few decades has been largely successful although complications and challenges remain. This review highlights the aromatase activity of natural stilbenes, chalcones, and flavanones and synthetically inspired versions thereof and draws attention to new and under-investigated areas within each class worthy of pursuit. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","anastrozole; antineoplastic agent; aromatase; aromatase inhibitor; chalcone derivative; chalconoid derivative; estrogen receptor; exemestane; flavanone derivative; flavonoid; letrozole; natural product; polyphenol derivative; stilbene derivative; stilbenoid derivative; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; drug potency; drug synthesis; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; human; nonhuman; Review"
"Barriers to Referral for Palliative Radiotherapy by Physicians: A Systematic Review","2019","Aims: Palliative radiotherapy (PRT) can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life, but remains underutilised, possibly due to lack of referrals. We conducted a systematic review to study barriers impeding referral for PRT. Materials and methods: We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE to identify published studies of physician barriers to PRT referral. Data were synthesised using the percentage of respondents to the surveys in these studies who identified a given factor as a significant barrier to PRT referral. Barriers were categorised using a conceptual framework for radiotherapy access described by Sundaresan et al. (Aust Health Rev 40 (1), 2016, 11–18.) Results: EMBASE and MEDLINE searches returned 364 distinct papers. Of these, 11 papers (reporting on 12 cohorts of survey respondents) met the study inclusion criteria. All used a cross-sectional survey design. Seven cohorts included mainly family physicians, one surveyed mostly radiation oncologists, one surveyed hospice professionals and one surveyed members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Radiation Oncology and the American Academy of Hospice Palliative Medicine. Many factors were identified as strongly influencing referral decisions. Only two cohorts of respondents were asked whether patient wishes influence referrals, but most (78–82%) respondents in these cohorts agreed that it was an important influence. Other important barriers included functional status (five cohorts asked, cited as a strong influence by 53–78% of respondents), short life expectancy (three, 44–59%), treatment length (five, 51–58%), inconvenience (six, 24–65%), cancer type (three, 55–80%), uncertainty of benefits (seven, 18–54%) and toxicity concerns (11, 18–43%). Hospice professionals most frequently cited factors related to expense of treatment. Conclusions: Published high-quality data on barriers to PRT referral are limited to survey studies. Barriers to PRT referral include referrers’ unfamiliarity regarding risks and benefits, cumbersome referral processes and perceived inconvenience of treatment. Interventions to increase referrals should be tailored to different professional groups and may include increased expert participation in multidisciplinary palliative care, shortening treatment courses and in-person interprofessional education. ? 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists","Article; cancer radiotherapy; clinical decision making; functional status; general practitioner; health care access; health care cost; health care utilization; hospice care; human; life expectancy; palliative therapy; patient referral; physician; priority journal; quality of life; systematic review; treatment duration; cross-sectional study; female; middle aged; neoplasm; palliative therapy; patient referral; procedures; psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Palliative Care; Quality of Life; Referral and Consultation"
"Advances in Antithrombotic Therapy","2019","Thrombosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Consequently, advances in antithrombotic therapy are needed to reduce the disease burden. This article focuses on 2 such advances. First, the prevention of atherothrombosis in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease, which has been enhanced by the finding that the combination of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin is superior to aspirin alone for prevention of recurrent ischemic events. However, this benefit comes at the cost of increased bleeding albeit not fatal bleeding. To overcome this problem, the second advance is the identification of factor XI as a target for new anticoagulants that are potentially safer than those currently available. ? 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antisense oligonucleotide; aptamer; bay 1213790; bay 1831865; blood clotting factor; blood clotting factor 10a; blood clotting factor 11; bms 986177; clopidogrel; enoxaparin; ep 7041; ionis 416858; maa 868; monoclonal antibody; ono 5450598; rivaroxaban; thrombin; thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; unclassified drug; acetylsalicylic acid; blood clotting factor 12; fibrinolytic agent; rivaroxaban; acute coronary syndrome; Article; bleeding; coronary artery disease; deep vein thrombosis; disease burden; drug safety; fibrin clot; human; international normalized ratio; lung embolism; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); thrombosis; treatment outcome; clinical trial (topic); physiology; thrombosis; Aspirin; Clinical Trials as Topic; Factor XI; Factor XII; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Rivaroxaban; Thrombosis"
"Cell surface expression of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) mediates diabetic nephropathy","2019","The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is a well-established endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone that maintains protein homeostasis and regulates the unfolded protein response. Under conditions of ER stress, GRP78 is also expressed at the cell surface and implicated in tumorigenesis, immunity, and cellular signaling events. The role of cell surface- associated GRP78 (csGRP78) in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy has not yet been defined. Hereweexplored the role of csGRP78 in regulating high glucose (HG)-induced profibrotic AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) signaling and up-regulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Using primary kidney mesangial cells, we show that HG treatment, but not the osmotic control mannitol, induces csGRP78 expression through an ER stress-dependent mechanism. We found that csGRP78, known to be located on the outer membrane leaflet, interacts with the transmembrane protein integrin β1 and activates focal adhesion kinase and downstream PI3K/AKT signaling. Localization of GRP78 at the cell surface and its interaction with integrin β1 were also required for extracellular matrix protein synthesis in response to HG. Surprisingly, both the N and C termini of csGRP78 were necessary for this profibrotic response. Increased localization of GRP78 at the plasma membrane was also found in the glomerular mesangial area of type 1 diabetic mice in two different models (streptozotocin-induced and Akita). In freshly isolated glomeruli from Akita mice, csGRP78 colocalized with the mesangial cell surface marker α8-integrin. In conclusion, our work reveals a role for csGRP78 in HG-induced profibrotic responses in mesangial cells, informing a potential approach to treating diabetic nephropathy. ? 2019 Van Krieken et al.

"Motor coordination problems and psychological distress in young adults: A test of the Environmental Stress Hypothesis","2019","Background and aims: The Environmental Stress Hypothesis (ESH) has been used to examine how the relationship between poor motor coordination and psychological distress is affected by physical health and psychosocial factors. However, work applying the ESH is still limited, and no studies have used this framework with adults. The current investigation aims to examine the association between motor coordination and psychological distress among emerging adults, and examine potential mediators to this relationship based on the ESH. Methods: 225 young adults aged 17–23 years completed a survey of motor coordination, physical activity, secondary stressors (i.e., general stress and global relationships), perceived social support, self-concept, and psychological distress. Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine mediating pathways and overall model fit. Results: The final model of the ESH showed good model fit (x 2 = 83.24, p &lt;.01; RMSEA=0.056; NNFI = 0.927; CFI = 0.954; GFI = 0.947), and indicated that the relationship between poor motor coordination and psychological distress was mediated by secondary stressors, perceived social support, and self-concept. Conclusions: This study highlights the effect of poor motor coordination on psychological distress in young adults, and suggests that interventions should target psychosocial well-being, in addition to motor coordination, to prevent psychological distress. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","adolescent; adult; Article; cross-sectional study; disease association; distress syndrome; environmental stress; female; human; major clinical study; male; motor coordination; motor dysfunction; motor function test; Perceived Stress Scale; physical activity; psychological well-being; self concept; social support; structural equation modeling; anxiety; depression; exercise; latent class analysis; mental stress; psychological theory; psychology; psychomotor disorder; young adult; Adolescent; Anxiety; Depression; Exercise; Female; Humans; Latent Class Analysis; Male; Motor Skills Disorders; Psychological Theory; Self Concept; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult"
"The tools at their fingertips: How settler colonial geographies shape medical educators’ strategies for grappling with Anti-Indigenous racism","2019","Settler colonialism implicates settler and Indigenous populations differently within ongoing projects of settlement and nation building. The uneven distribution of benefits and harms is a primary consequence of settler colonialism. Indeed, it is a central organizing feature of the settler state's governance of Indigenous societies and is animated, in part, through pervasive settler ignorance and anti-Indigenous racism, which has manifested in persistent health disparities amongst Indigenous peoples. This broader socio-political context surrounding medical schools, which are seeking to develop teaching and learning about Indigenous health presents a significant challenge. Understanding the cognitive and affective tools that settler educators use when grappling with questions of race, racialization, and Indigenous difference is an important step in addressing anti-Indigenous racism in health care provision. This paper reports on findings from in-depth semi-structured interviews with educators at one Canadian medical school. Our intent was to elicit respondents' understandings, experiences, and attitudes regarding Indigenous-settler relations, Indigenous health and healthcare, and the inclusion of Indigenous health in the curriculum as a means of identifying facilitators and barriers to improving Indigenous health and health care experiences. Respondents were generally sympathetic and evinced an earnest desire to include more Indigenous-related content in the curriculum. What became clear over the course of the data collection and analysis, however, was that most respondents lacked the tools to engage critically with questions of race and racialization and how these are manifested in the context of asymmetrical settler colonial power. We argue that this inability, at best, limits the effectiveness of much needed efforts to incorporate more content relating to Indigenous health, but worse yet, risks re-entrenching anti-Indigenous racism and settler dominance. ? 2019","colonialism; health care; health education; indigenous population; multiculturalism; racism; survey method; teaching; adult; article; Canada; colonialism; cultural diversity; curriculum; female; geography; human; human experiment; learning; male; medical education; medical school; racism; semi structured interview; Canada; Dudleya edulis"
"The Impact of Indigenous Youth Sharing Digital Stories About HIV Activism","2019","Introduction. This article reports on the micro-, meso-, and macro-level impacts of sharing digital stories created by Indigenous youth leaders about HIV prevention activism in Canada. Method. Eighteen participants created digital stories and hosted screenings in their own communities to foster dialogue. Data for this article are drawn from individual semistructured interviews with the youth leaders, audio-recordings of audience reflections, and research team member’s field notes collected between 2012 and 2015 across Canada. Data were coded using NVivo. A content analysis approach guided analysis. Results. The process of sharing their digital stories had a positive impact on the youth themselves and their communities. Stories also reached policymakers. They challenged conventional public health messaging by situating HIV in the context of Indigenous holistic conceptions of health. Discussion. The impact(s) of sharing digital stories were felt most strongly by their creators but rippled out to create waves of change for many touched by them. More research is warranted to examine the ways that the products of participatory visual methodologies can be powerful tools in creating social change and reducing health disparities. ? 2019 Society for Public Health Education.","adult; article; audio recording; Canada; clinical article; conception; content analysis; female; health disparity; human; human experiment; Human immunodeficiency virus; juvenile; leadership; male; nonhuman; public health; semi structured interview; social change"
"The current and future burden of cancer attributable to modifiable risk factors in Canada: Summary of results","2019","Nearly one in two Canadians are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. However, there are opportunities to reduce the impact of modifiable cancer risk factors through well-informed interventions and policies. Since no comprehensive Canadian estimates have been available previously, we estimated the proportion of cancer diagnosed in 2015 and the future burden in 2042 attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors, and infections. Population-based historical estimates of exposure prevalence and their associated risks for each exposure-cancer site pair were obtained to estimate population attributable risks, assuming the exposures were distributed independently and that the risk estimates were multiplicative. We estimated that between 33 and 37% (up to 70,000 cases)of incident cancer cases among adults aged 30 years and over in 2015 were attributable to preventable risk factors. Similar proportions of cancer cases in males (34%)and females (33%)were attributable to these risk factors. Tobacco smoking and a lack of physical activity were associated with the highest proportions of cancer cases. Cancers with the highest number of preventable cases were lung (20,100), colorectal (9800)and female breast (5300)cancer. If current trends in the prevalence of preventable risk factors continue into the future, we project that by 2042 approximately 102,000 incident cancer cases are expected to be attributable to these risk factors per year, which would account for roughly one-third of all incident cancers. Through various risk reduction interventions, policies and public health campaigns, an estimated 10,600 to 39,700 cancer cases per year could be prevented by 2042. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; attributable risk; breast cancer; Canada; cancer incidence; cancer prevention; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; disease burden; environmental factor; exposure; female; human; infection; lifestyle; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; physical inactivity; priority journal; public health campaign; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; smoking"
"Diagnostic Utility of Genome-wide DNA Methylation Testing in Genetically Unsolved Individuals with Suspected Hereditary Conditions","2019","Conventional genetic testing of individuals with neurodevelopmental presentations and congenital anomalies (ND/CAs), i.e., the analysis of sequence and copy number variants, leaves a substantial proportion of them unexplained. Some of these cases have been shown to result from DNA methylation defects at a single locus (epi-variants), while others can exhibit syndrome-specific DNA methylation changes across multiple loci (epi-signatures). Here, we investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood in unresolved ND/CAs. We generate a computational model enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using DNA methylation data with full accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of this model in resolving 67 individuals with uncertain clinical diagnoses, some of whom had variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) in the related genes. We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of the case subjects, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA-affected subjects without a previous diagnostic assumption and a separate assessment of rare epi-variants in this cohort, we identify 15 case subjects with syndromic Mendelian disorders, 12 case subjects with imprinting and trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 case subjects with rare epi-variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the subjects’ phenotypes. This study demonstrates that genomic DNA methylation analysis can facilitate the molecular diagnosis of unresolved clinical cases and highlights the potential value of epigenomic testing in the routine clinical assessment of ND/CAs. ? 2019 American Society of Human Genetics","genomic DNA; adult; Article; case report; child; chromosome analysis; classifier; clinical article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; congenital malformation; controlled study; copy number variation; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease classification; DNA methylation; female; genetic disorder; genetic identification; genetic screening; genetic variability; genome imprinting; genome-wide association study; human; karyotyping; male; mathematical model; mental disease; microarray analysis; molecular diagnosis; phenotype; priority journal; school child; support vector machine; syndrome CHARGE; syndromic Mendelian disorder; trinucleotide repeat; trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder; young adult; computer simulation; congenital disorder; DNA sequence; epigenetics; gene dosage; genetic disorder; genetic variation; genetics; syndrome; Cohort Studies; Computer Simulation; Congenital Abnormalities; DNA Copy Number Variations; DNA Methylation; Epigenomics; Gene Dosage; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomic Imprinting; Humans; Phenotype; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Syndrome; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion"
"Adverse outcomes associated with prescription opioids for acute low back pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Acute low back pain (ALBP) is a common clinical complaint that can last anywhere from 24 hours to 12 weeks. In recent years, there has been an opioid epidemic which is linked to the increased availability of prescription opioids. Though guidelines recommend that in the treatment of ALBP, opioids should be used when other treatments fail, we have seen an increase in opioid prescriptions for ALBP. With this crisis, it is important to examine if there are any adverse outcomes associated with prescribing opioids for ALBP. Objective: We aim to review the published literature to examine the adverse outcomes associated with opioid use for ALBP. Study Design: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in accordance with our published protocol and PRISMA guidelines. Setting: The review was conducted at McMaster University. Methods: Various electronic databases for articles published from inception to September 30, 2017, inclusive. Both randomized clinical trials and observational studies on the impact of opioid use in ALBP in the adult population were included. Eight pairs of independent reviewers performed screening, data extraction, and assessment of methodological quality. The identified articles were assessed for risk of bias using sensitivity analysis. Trials with comparative outcomes were reported in a meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. Results: A total of 13,889 studies were initially screened for the review and a total of 4 studies were included in the full review, of which 2 studies were meta-analyzed. Our results showed that prescribing opioids for ALBP was significantly associated with longterm continued opioid use (1.57, 95% CI, 1.06-2.33). There was no significant association found between unemployment duration and prescribing opioids for ALBP (3.54, 95% CI, -7.57 to 14.66). Limitations: Due to the limited number of studies that considered unemployment, only an unpooled analysis was conducted. Among the included studies there was both statistical and clinical heterogeneity due to differences in methodology, study design, risk of selection or performance bias. Most of the studies had an unclear or high risk of bias and poorly defined side effects. Conclusions: Due to the lack of literature examining long-term adverse outcomes associated with prescribing opioids for ALBP, no definitive conclusions can be made. However, with the literature available, there does seem to be risk associated with prescribing opioids for ALBP so there is a great need to conduct further investigations examining these adverse outcomes for ALBP patients. ? 2019, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

"The influence of the irrigating solution on articular cartilage in arthroscopic surgery: A systematic review","2019","Purpose: Arthroscopic surgery has become an important and popular orthopedic procedure for numerous joint disorders. Continuous irrigation is performed to replace synovial fluid for optimal joint distension and clear visualization of the synovial cavity. Irrigation solutions may, however, negatively impact articular cartilage and chondrocyte viability. This systematic review aims to compare different irrigating solutions and their properties to determine whether one is superior in its effects on articular cartilage and chondrocytes. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted. The online databases: Embase, Medline, HealthStar, Emcare and PubMed were searched from 1946 to August 2018. Methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) was used to assess methodological quality of the included studies. Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in this review. Although the studies used different criteria to define superiority, solution superiority was based on results that focused on articular cartilage and chondrocyte viability. Seven of the sixteen included studies compared Ringer's/lactate solution or Ringer's lactate to normal saline. Three found Ringer's solution or Ringer's lactate to be superior to saline, whereas, three studies found no significant differences and one study found Ringer's lactate to be inferior to saline only when their osmolarities differed. Four studies compared ionic to non-ionic solutions. Two of the four studies demonstrated non-ionic solutions to be superior, one had demonstrated no significant differences between solutions, while one had mixed results. Six of the sixteen included studies compared differing osmolarities. One found no statistically significant differences between solutions of differing osmolarities, whereas, the remaining five studies found superiority with hyperosmolarity. Two of the sixteen included studies examined the effects of different temperatures. Both studies concluded that the use of a warmer (more physiological) temperature is more ideal. Two of the sixteen studies included in this review compared solutions with differing pH levels. Both studies concluded on the importance of utilizing the more physiological solutions for arthroscopic procedures. Conclusion: Ringer's Lactate and Ringer's Solution as well as non-ionic solutions may have merit over the use of the normal saline for irrigation. Hyperosmolarity, warmer solutions and ones with more physiological pH values may be beneficial when considering potential effects on articular cartilage and chondrocytes. The current review demonstrated trends found in the current literature, which require human studies – preferably high quality RCTs –to make recommendations that aid surgeons in making the best decision regarding the ideal irrigation solution to use on their patients.

"A practical generation-interval-based approach to inferring the strength of epidemics from their speed","2019","Infectious disease outbreaks are often characterized by the reproduction number R and exponential rate of growth r. R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size, but estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated directly from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval – the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r–R relationship and provide robust estimates of R. ? 2019 The Authors","Article; basic reproduction number; contact examination; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; human; incidence; measles; population; priority journal; rabies"
"An acetone gas sensor based on nanosized Pt-loaded Fe2O3 nanocubes","2019","Nanosized Pt-loaded Fe2O3 nanocubes are prepared through, successively, a simple hydrothermal reaction, two-step annealing process and finally reduction with NaBH4 of H2PtCl4. The resultant Pt decorated Fe2O3 nanocubes, made up of Fe2O3 nanoplatelets, are hierarchical, hollow and porous, with an average edge length of 200–300 nm. The sensor based on Pt decorated Fe2O3 nanocomposites exhibits higher response (Rair/Rgas = 25.7) to 100 ppm of acetone gas at lower temperature (139 °C), with a short response-recovery time (3 s/22 s), compared with pure Fe2O3 nanocubes sensor. The Pt-Fe2O3 nanocomposite sensor shows excellent potential to act as a low cost, low temperature sensor for acetone gas, with high acetone selectivity under high humidity conditions and with the interference of other gases. Under various environmental conditions designed to mimic exhaled air, the sensor is able to detect ppb amounts of acetone, with high repeatability and stability, making it suitable for applications such as oral diabetic sensors. The attractive chemical and electronic sensitizations of partially oxidized Pt nanoparticles are responsible for the enhancement of acetone sensing performance. Based on the high acetone selectivity, high stability and fast dynamic response, the Pt enhanced Fe2O3 nanocubes sensor is an exceptionally suitable candidate for a low cost acetone sensor, and the proposed approach provides a route to develop gas sensors that can operate at low temperatures for a wide variety of applications. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Acetone; Chemical sensors; Chlorine compounds; Costs; Gas detectors; Gases; Hematite; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Sodium Borohydride; Temperature; Electronic sensitization; Environmental conditions; Fast dynamic response; Hierarchical Fe2O3; Nanocomposite sensors; Nanocubes; Pt nanoparticles; Response-recovery time; Platinum"
"Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways in breast reconstruction: systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature","2019","Purpose: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways are increasingly promoted in post-mastectomy reconstruction, with several articles reporting their benefits and safety. This meta-analysis appraises the evidence for ERAS pathways in breast reconstruction. Methods: A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed to identify reports of ERAS protocols in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. Two reviewers screened studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. Studies evaluated at least one of the following end-points of interest: length of stay (LOS), opioid use, or major complications. Risk of bias was assessed for each study. Meta-analysis was performed via a mixed-effects model to compare outcomes for ERAS versus traditional standard of care. Surgical techniques were assessed through subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 260 articles were identified; 9 (3.46%) met inclusion criteria with a total of 1191 patients. Most studies had “fair” methodological quality and incomplete implementation of ERAS society recommendations was noted. Autologous flaps comprised the majority of cases. In autologous breast reconstruction, ERAS significantly reduces opioid use [Mean difference (MD) = ? 183.96, 95% CI ? 340.27 to 27.64, p = 0.02) and LOS (MD) = ? 1.58, 95% CI ? 1.99 to 1.18, p < 0.00001] versus traditional care. There is no significant difference in the incidence of complications (major complications, readmission, hematoma, and infection). Conclusion: ERAS pathways significantly reduce opioid use and length of hospital stay following autologous breast reconstruction without increasing complication rates. This is salient given the current US healthcare climate of rising expenditures and an opioid crisis. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","autotransplantation; breast reconstruction; clinical practice; clinical protocol; convalescence; enhanced recovery after surgery; hematoma; hospital readmission; human; length of stay; mastectomy; meta analysis; methodology; outcome assessment; pain assessment; patient safety; postoperative complication; postoperative infection; postoperative pain; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; standard; substance use; surgical technique; systematic review; therapy effect; analgesia; breast reconstruction; breast tumor; female; postoperative care; procedures; surgical flaps; narcotic analgesic agent; Analgesics, Opioid; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Length of Stay; Mammaplasty; Mastectomy; Pain Management; Postoperative Care; Surgical Flaps"
"Survival outcomes of marijuana users in p16 positive oropharynx cancer patients","2019","Background: Oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has become the predominant subsite for head and neck mucosal cancers (HNC) due to the rise of human papillomavirus (HPV) related disease. Previous studies have suggested an association between marijuana use and HPV-related OPSCC. Despite this, no study has examined the potential relationship between marijuana use and survival in this subset of patients. Objective: To examine the survival outcomes of HPV-related OPSCC patients in marijuana users. Methods: Patients who were marijuana users were identified from a prospectively collected database of HNC patients from January 2011 to 2015. A physical review of clinic records was undertaken to extract relevant patient, tumor, treatment, follow-up, as well as survival data. Patients greater than 17 years of age with pathologically proven p16 positive OPSCC were included. They were then case-matched in a 1-to-1 basis to patients who were non-marijuana users based on age, gender, and cTNM staging. Results: Forty-Seven patients met inclusion criteria within each group. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, and cT-Stage were predictive of disease recurrence within both groups (p < 0.05). However, cN-stage, treatment modality, tumor subsite, tobacco use, and tobacco dose were not (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between marijuana and non-marijuana user groups in 5-year (p = 0.400) overall survival, disease-specific (p = 0.993), disease-free (p = 0.404), and metastasis-free survival (p = 0.384). Conclusions: No survival difference is found between HPV-related OPSCC marijuana users and non-users. This finding has implications for both de-escalation regimes and the use of cannabis as a therapeutic agent. ? 2019 The Author(s).",""
"Novel molecular synapomorphies demarcate different main groups/subgroups of Plasmodium and piroplasmida species clarifying their evolutionary relationships","2019","The class Hematozoa encompasses several clinically important genera, including Plasmodium, whose members cause the major life-threating disease malaria. Hence, a good understanding of the interrelationships of organisms from this class and reliable means for distinguishing them are of much importance. This study reports comprehensive phylogenetic and comparative analyses on protein sequences on the genomes of 28 hematozoa species to understand their interrelationships. In addition to phylogenetic trees based on two large datasets of protein sequences, detailed comparative analyses were carried out on the genomes of hematozoa species to identify novel molecular synapomorphies consisting of conserved signature indels (CSIs) in protein sequences. These studies have identified 79 CSIs that are exclusively present in specific groups of Hematozoa/Plasmodium species, also supported by phylogenetic analysis, providing reliable means for the identification of these species groups and understanding their interrelationships. Of these CSIs, six CSIs are specifically shared by all hematozoa species, two CSIs serve to distinguish members of the order Piroplasmida, five CSIs are uniquely found in all Piroplasmida species except B. microti and two CSIs are specific for the genus Theileria. Additionally, we also describe 23 CSIs that are exclusively present in all genome-sequenced Plasmodium species and two, nine, ten and eight CSIs which are specific for members of the Plasmodium subgenera Haemamoeba, Laverania, Vinckeia and Plasmodium (excluding P. ovale and P. malariae), respectively. Additionally, our work has identified several CSIs that support species relationships which are not evident from phylogenetic analysis. Of these CSIs, one CSI supports the ancestral nature of the avian-Plasmodium species in comparison to the mammalian-infecting groups of Plasmodium species, four CSIs strongly support a specific relationship of species between the subgenera Plasmodium and Vinckeia and three CSIs each that reliably group P. malariae with members of the subgenus Plasmodium and P. ovale within the subgenus Vinckeia, respectively. These results provide a reliable framework for understanding the evolutionary relationships among the Plasmodium/Piroplasmida species. Further, in view of the exclusivity of the described molecular markers for the indicated groups of hematozoa species, particularly large numbers of unique characteristics that are specific for all Plasmodium species, they provide important molecular tools for biochemical/genetic studies and for developing novel diagnostics and therapeutics for these organisms. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Second-line treatments in children with immune thrombocytopenia: Effect on platelet count and patient-centered outcomes","2019","Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder with isolated thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic risk. While many children with ITP can be safely observed, treatments are often needed for various reasons, including to decrease bleeding, or to improve health related quality of life (HRQoL). There are a number of available second-line treatments, including rituximab, thrombopoietin-receptor agonists, oral immunosuppressive agents, and splenectomy, but data comparing treatment outcomes are lacking. ICON1 is a prospective, multi-center, observational study of 120 children starting second-line treatments for ITP designed to compare treatment outcomes including platelet count, bleeding, and HRQoL utilizing the Kids ITP Tool (KIT). While all treatments resulted in increased platelet counts, romiplostim had the most pronounced effect at 6 months (P =.04). Only patients on romiplostim and rituximab had a significant reduction in both skin-related (84% to 48%, P =.01 and 81% to 43%, P =.004) and non-skin-related bleeding symptoms (58% to 14%, P =.0001 and 54% to 17%, P =.0006) after 1 month of treatment. HRQoL significantly improved on all treatments. However, only patients treated with eltrombopag had a median improvement in KIT scores at 1 month that met the minimal important difference (MID). Bleeding, platelet count, and HRQoL improved in each treatment group, but the extent and timing of the effect varied among treatments. These results are hypothesis generating and help to improve our understanding of the effect of each treatment on specific patient outcomes. Combined with future randomized trials, these findings will help clinicians select the optimal second-line treatment for an individual child with ITP. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","azathioprine; eltrombopag; mercaptopurine; rituximab; romiplostim; adolescent; Article; child; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug response; female; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observational study; platelet count; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; skin bleeding; treatment outcome"

Methods: Treatment na?ve metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients (n = 50) were assessed prior to and 4 months after commencement of carboplatin-based palliative chemotherapy. Methods included echocardiography for left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV function [LV ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain (GLS), diastolic function], computed tomography to quantify skeletal muscle and total adipose tissue, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), validated questionnaires for dyspnoea and fatigue, plasma biomarkers, tumour response to therapy, and overall survival. Results: During 112 ± 6 days, the median change in LVM was ?8.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) ?10.8 to ?4.8, P < 0.001]. Quartiles of LVM loss were ?20.1%, ?12.9%, ?4.8%, and +5.5%. Losses of muscle, adipose tissue, and LVM were frequently concurrent; LVM loss > median value was associated with loss of skeletal muscle [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4–14.8, P=0.01] and loss of total adipose tissue (OR = 10.0, 95% CI: 2.7–36.7, P < 0.001). LVM loss was associated with decreased GLS (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9–22.7, P=0.003) but not with LV ejection fraction or diastolic function. In the population overall, plasma levels of C-reactive protein (P=0.008), high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) (P=0.03), and galectin-3 (P=0.02) increased over time, while N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and hs-cTnI did not change over time. C-reactive protein was the only biomarker associated with LVM loss but at the univariate level only. Independent predictors of LVM loss were prior weight loss (adjusted OR = 10.2, 95% CI: 2.2–46.9, P=0.003) and tumour progression (adjusted OR = 14.6, 95% CI: 1.4–153.9, P=0.02). LVM loss was associated with exacerbations of fatigue (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9–22.7, P=0.003), dyspnoea (OR = 9.3, 95% CI: 2.4–35.8, P<0.001), and deterioration of performance status (OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.3–18.3,P=0.02). Patients with concurrent loss of LVM, skeletal muscle, and fat were more likely to deteriorate in all three symptom domains and to have reduced survival (P=0.05). Conclusions: Intense LVM atrophy is associated with non-small cell lung cancer-induced cachexia. Loss of LVM was associated with emerging alterations of GLS, indicating subtle changes in left ventricular function. Longer term studies are needed to assess the full scope of cardiac atrophy and its impact. LVM atrophy arises in conjunction with losses of fat and skeletal muscle and is temporally associated with meaningful declines in performance status, worsening of fatigue, and dyspnoea, as well as poorer tumour response and decreased survival. The specific contribution of LVM atrophy to these outcomes requires further study. ? 2019 The Authors Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders","amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; carboplatin; cisplatin; galectin 3; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; pemetrexed; troponin T; vinorelbine tartrate; adipose tissue; adult; advanced cancer; Article; body weight loss; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer fatigue; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular risk; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; disease association; dyspnea; female; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart left ventricle mass; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; skeletal muscle; treatment outcome; treatment response; tumor growth"
"Ambulatory Toxicity Management (AToM) in patients receiving adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer - a pragmatic cluster randomized trial protocol","2019","BACKGROUND: Population-based studies suggest that emergency department visits and hospitalizations are common among patients receiving chemotherapy and that rates in routine practice are higher than expected from clinical trials. Chemotherapy-related toxicities are often predictable and, consequently, acute care visits may be preventable with adequate treatment planning and support between visits to the cancer centre. We will evaluate the impact of proactive telephone-based toxicity management on emergency department visits and hospitalizations in women with early stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: In this pragmatic covariate constraint-based cluster randomized trial, 20 centres in Ontario, Canada are randomly allocated to either proactive telephone toxicity management (intervention) or routine care (control). The primary outcome is the cluster-level mean number of ED?+?H visits per patient evaluated using Ontario administrative healthcare data. Participants are all patients with early stage (I-III) breast cancer commencing adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy at participating institutions during the intervention period. At least 25 patients at each centre participate in a patient reported outcomes sub-study involving the collection of standardized questionnaires to measure: severity of treatment toxicities, self-care, self-efficacy, quality of life, and coordination of care. Patients participating in the patient reported outcomes (PRO) sub-study are asked to provide written consent to link their PRO data to administrative data. Unit costs will be applied to each per person resource utilized, and a total cost per population and patient will be generated. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken to compare the incremental costs and outcomes between the intervention and control groups from the health system perspective. DISCUSSION: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a proactive toxicity management intervention in a routine care setting. The use of administrative healthcare data to evaluate the primary outcome enables an evaluation in a real world setting and at a much larger scale than previous studies.

"Relationship between neural crest cell specification and rare ocular diseases","2019","Development of the eye is closely associated with neural crest cell migration and specification. Eye development is extremely complex, as it requires the working of a combination of local factors, receptors, inductors, and signaling interactions between tissues such as the optic cup and periocular mesenchyme (POM). The POM is comprised of neural crest-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells that give rise to numerous important ocular structures including those tissues that form the optic cup and anterior segment of the eye. A number of genes are involved in the migration and specification of the POM such as PITX2, PITX3, FOXC1, FOXE3, PAX6, LMX1B, GPR48, TFAP2A, and TFAP2B. In this review, we will discuss the relevance of these genes in the development of the POM and how mutations and defects result in rare ocular diseases. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","transcription factor FOXC1; transcription factor FOXE3; transcription factor LMX1B; transcription factor PAX6; transcription factor Pitx2; transcription factor Pitx3; unclassified drug; aniridia; anterior eye segment; Axenfeld Rieger syndrome; branchio oculo facial syndrome; cell migration; Char syndrome; coloboma; developmental disorder; eye development; eye disease; human; mandibulofacial dysostosis; mesenchymal stem cell; mesenchyme; nail patella syndrome; neural crest cell; optic disk cup; periocular mesenchyme; Peters anomaly; phenotype; priority journal; Review; syndrome CHARGE; Waardenburg syndrome"
"Assessing the Quality of Evidence Presented at Annual General Meetings: A 5-Year Retrospective Study","2019","Introduction:Health care professionals rely on annual general meetings (AGMs) to obtain up-to-date information and practice guidelines relevant to their specialty. The majority of such information at meetings is presented through abstract sessions. However, the quality of the evidence presented during such abstract sessions is unclear. Standardized measures were applied to assess the quality of evidence of abstracts presented at the Canadian Society of Nephrology AGM over a 5-year period.Methods:Two authors independently reviewed all CSN AGM abstracts presented from 2012 to 2016. Using a schema published in 2011 by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM), each abstract was subsequently ranked based on the quality of evidence. Schema categories ranged from level I, representing the highest evidence quality, to level V, representing the lowest. The number of authors and the authors' institution affiliations were also collected from the abstracts, where available, or if affiliations were unclear, an internet search of the author was performed.Results:Six hundred forty-two articles were screened. In total, 70% (n = 450) met the inclusion criteria. When assessed, 15% of articles were level I (highest quality), 17% level II, 53% level III, 12% level IV, and 3% level V (lowest quality). A Jonckheere-Terpstra test demonstrated a significant trend of increasing quality of evidence (P &lt;.05) and collaboration (P &lt;.005) over the 5-year study period. There was a significant correlation between level of evidence and collaboration across years reviewed in the study, rs(98) = -0.226, P &lt;.001.Discussion:The results indicate a consistent increase in quality of evidence and collaborative submissions over time. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first assessment and analysis of AGM presentation quality within internal medicine and its subspecialties. Documenting and monitoring changes in the quality of evidence with a standardized framework may offer valuable insight pertaining to the medical field and the research community. ? 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","article; education; evidence based practice center; human; Internet; major clinical study; monitoring; nephrology; quality control; retrospective study"
"Development of the IRIS-AR strategy: An intervention to improve rates of accrual and retention for the VTE-PRO randomized controlled trial","2019","Background: The Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis (VTE-PRO) randomized trial is a pilot study evaluating the impact of extended-duration prophylaxis on venous thromboembolic events in patients undergoing lung cancer resection. Enrolled VTE-PRO participants self-inject either low-molecular weight heparin or a saline placebo for 30 days postoperatively. Study outcomes include feasibility, incidence of venous thromboembolism, and venous thromboembolism-related morbidity and mortality. Initial analyses demonstrated low rates of accrual and retention for the VTE-PRO pilot. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to develop a knowledge translation intervention to improve VTE-PRO pilot trial accrual and retention. Methods: Eligible participants were surveyed to identify the barriers to VTE-PRO participation. The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to categorize these barriers. Barriers were mapped to the capabilities, opportunities, and behavior (COM-B) behavioral change wheel to identify potential interventions to support trial accrual and retention. The resulting knowledge translation intervention was titled Inform, Remind, Involve and Support to improve Accrual and Retention (IRIS-AR). Key informant interviews with patients were held to refine and confirm the validity of identified barriers and perceived acceptability of the proposed IRIS-AR intervention. Institutional Review Board approval was granted for this study. Results: The resulting intervention included: information booklets and counseling sessions to identify unique participant challenges to trial participation (Inform); daily reminders to administer injections (Remind); involvement of family/caregivers in study processes (Involve); and leverage of an existing home-care nursing program to provide injection support when needed (Support). Twenty-six key informant participants were interviewed. The most common barriers to trial participation included lack of social support and fear of needle injection. Participants generally supported use of information booklets, involvement of family/caregivers, and support by a home-care nursing program; however, not all supported the use of daily reminders. Conclusion: Developed using theory and integrated knowledge translation, the IRIS-AR presents a patient-centered intervention that leverages existing programs to promote trial engagement. The proposed strategy can likely be adapted to improve compliance with other patient-directed interventions. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; behavior change; Canada; caregiver; controlled study; health program; home care; human; intervention study; learning; needle phobia; parent counseling; patient care; pilot study; program acceptability; prophylaxis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); social support; venous thromboembolism; adverse event; attitude to health; decision making; drug administration; drug self administration; injection; lung resection; lung tumor; patient education; patient selection; psychology; randomized controlled trial; research subject; sample size; time factor; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; anticoagulant agent; low molecular weight heparin; Anticoagulants; Choice Behavior; Drug Administration Schedule; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Injections; Lung Neoplasms; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Selection; Pilot Projects; Pneumonectomy; Research Subjects; Sample Size; Self Administration; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism"
"How we treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: A consensus statement of the Canadian PNH Network and review of the national registry","2019","Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare hematologic disease characterized by intravascular hemolysis, thrombophilia, and marrow failure. Its phenotype is due to absent or reduced expression of GPI-linked complement regulators and subsequent sensitivity of hematopoietic cells to complement-mediated damage and lysis. Introduction of the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab drastically improved outcomes in PNH patients; however, despite this improvement, there remain several challenges faced by PNH patients and physicians who care for them. One of the most important is increasing awareness of the heterogeneity with which patients can present, which can lead to significant delays in recognition. Data from the Canadian PNH Registry are presented to demonstrate the variety of presenting symptoms. In Canada, geography precludes consolidation of care to just a few centers, so management is distributed across academic hospitals, linked together as the Canadian PNH Network. The Network over the last several years has developed educational programs and clinical checklists and has worked to standardize access to diagnostics across the country. Herein, we address some of the common diagnostic and therapeutic challenges faced by PNH physicians and give our recommendations. Gaps in knowledge are also addressed, and where appropriate, consensus opinion is provided. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Attitudes and self-reported practices of orthopedic providers regarding prescription opioid use","2019","Objective: Orthopedic surgeons are the third-highest opioid prescribers in the United States. Their prescribing practices can significantly affect the quantity of unconsumed opioids available to fuel the current opioid epidemic. The aim of this study was to identify prescribing patterns and knowledge gaps among orthopedic providers for targeted future interventions and investigation. Design: An online survey describing six common orthopedic surgical scenarios was distributed electronically to determine opioid type and quantity prescribed at discharge, medication disposal instructions, and the use of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) in the prescription writing process. Setting: Tertiary care academic hospitals. Participants: Orthopedic physicians and mid-level providers practicing at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and University of Maryland Medical System. Of 179 providers contacted, 127 (71 percent) completed the survey. Main outcome measures: Quantity of opioid prescribed, utilization of PDMPs, and provision of opioid disposal instructions. Results: While statistically significant associations were identified between quantity of opioid prescribed and surgical procedure, for five of six scenarios 95 percent of respondents recommended prescribing >55 oxycodone 5 mg pill equivalents (PEs) at discharge. An inverse correlation between years of clinical practice and mean number of PEs prescribed was observed. Fewer than 40 percent of respondents modified prescribing when presented with clinically relevant changes in scenario (history of depression or drug abuse). Over 60 percent of respondents do not use PDMPs, and 79 percent do not provide opioid disposal instructions. Conclusions: Our findings support a need for targeted education to mitigate the role of orthopedic postoperative prescribing practices on the current opioid abuse epidemic. ? 2019 Journal of Opioid Management, All Rights Reserved.","codeine; hydrocodone; hydromorphone; morphine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; oxycodone; paracetamol; tramadol; narcotic analgesic agent; advanced practice provider; analgesia; carpal tunnel release; chronic pain; clinical practice; combination drug therapy; Conference Paper; depression; distal radius fracture; drug abuse; female; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; health survey; hospital discharge; human; intramedullary nailing; laminectomy; major clinical study; male; Maryland; medical history; medical staff; musculoskeletal pain; nurse practitioner; open reduction (procedure); orthopedic surgeon; orthopedic surgery; osteosynthesis; pain severity; patient education; patient risk; peripheral nerve; physician; physician assistant; pill; postoperative pain; prescription; prescription drug monitoring program; resident; risk factor; self report; spine fusion; surgical technique; sustained drug release; tertiary health care; total hip replacement; United States; work experience; opiate addiction; orthopedics; prescription; prescription drug misuse; procedures; Analgesics, Opioid; Attitude of Health Personnel; Drug Prescriptions; Humans; Opioid-Related Disorders; Orthopedics; Population Surveillance; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescription Drug Misuse; Self Report; United States"
"Initial oxygen use for preterm newborn resuscitation: A systematic review with meta-analysis","2019","CONTEXT: The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation prioritized to review the initial fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) during the resuscitation of preterm newborns. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the scientific summary of initial Fio2 in preterm newborns (&lt;35 weeks' gestation) who receive respiratory support at birth. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched between January 1, 1980 and August 10, 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers in 2 stages with a Cohen's κ of 0.8 and 1.0. DATA EXTRACTION: Pairs of independent reviewers extracted data, appraised the risk of bias (RoB), and assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled studies and 4 cohort studies included 5697 patients. There are no statistically significant benefits of or harms from starting with lower compared with higher Fio 2 in short-term mortality (n = 968; risk ratio = 0.83 [95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.37]), long-term mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment, or other key preterm morbidities. A sensitivity analysis in which 1 study with a high RoB was excluded failed to reveal a reduction in mortality with initial low Fio2 (n = 681; risk ratio = 0.63 [95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.03]). LIMITATIONS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes due to RoB, inconsistency, and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: The ideal initial Fio 2 for preterm newborns is still unknown, although the majority of newborns ?32 weeks' gestation will require oxygen supplementation.

"Design and rationale of the COMPLETE trial: A randomized, comparative effectiveness study of complete versus culprit-only percutaneous coronary intervention to treat multivessel coronary artery disease in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction","2019","A significant proportion of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Following successful culprit lesion percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI, the question of whether to routinely revascularize non-culprit lesions or manage them conservatively with optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone is a common dilemma facing clinicians. Methods: COMPLETE is a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter, parallel group, open-label trial with blinded evaluation of outcomes. Following successful PCI (contemporary drug eluting stents recommended) of the culprit lesion for STEMI, a total of 4041 patients from 140 centers in 31 countries were randomized to receive either complete revascularization, consisting of staged PCI of all suitable non-culprit lesions plus optimal medical therapy (OMT), or to culprit lesion-only PCI, consisting of OMT alone. OMT comprises evidence-based therapy for STEMI, including and dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor, HTN and lipid management. All coronary angiograms in the trial are being evaluated in a central angiographic core lab to assess quality and completeness of revascularization. The co-primary outcomes are (1): the composite of CV death or new non-fatal MI and (2 the composite of CV death, new non-fatal MI or ischemia-driven revascularization at a median follow-up of 3 years. Conclusions: The COMPLETE trial is an international multicenter randomized trial that will help determine whether complete revascularization involving staged PCI of non-culprit lesions improves outcomes in patients with STEMI and multivessel CAD.

"Barriers and facilitators to implementation of essential health benefits package within primary health care settings in low-income and middle-income countries: A systematic review","2019","Background: One of the key requirements for achieving universal health coverage is the proper design and implementation of essential health benefits package (EHPs). We systematically reviewed the evidence on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of EHPs within primary health care settings in low-income and middle-income countries. Methods: We searched multiple databases and the gray literature. Two reviewers completed independently and in duplicate data selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. We synthesized the findings according to the following health systems arrangement levels: governance, financial, and delivery arrangements. Results: Ten studies met the eligibility criteria. At the governance level, key reported barriers were insufficient policymaker-implementer interactions, limited involvement of consumers and stakeholders, sub-optimal primary health care network arrangement, poor marketing and promotion of package, and insufficient coordination with community network. The key reported facilitator was the presence of a legal policy framework for package implementation. At the financial level, barriers included delays and inadequate remunerations to health care providers while facilitators included government and donor commitments to financing of package and flexibility in exploring new funding mechanisms. At the delivery level, barriers included inadequate supervision, poor facility infrastructure, limited availability of equipment and supplies, and shortages of workers. Facilitators included proper training and management of workforce, availability of female health workers, presence of clearly defined packages, and continuum of care, including referrals to promote comprehensive service delivery. Conclusion: We identified a set of barriers and facilitators that need to be addressed to ensure proper implementation of EHPs within primary health care settings. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; article; consumer; coordination; data extraction; female; funding; government; health care personnel; health insurance; human; lowest income group; middle income country; primary health care; quality control; remuneration; systematic review; developing country; health care personnel; organization and management; primary health care; Developing Countries; Eligibility Determination; Health Benefit Plans, Employee; Health Personnel; Humans; Primary Health Care; Universal Health Insurance"
"Recommendations for integrating physiotherapy into an interprofessional outpatient care setting for people living with HIV: A qualitative study","2019","Objectives To identify factors to consider when integrating physiotherapy (PT) into an interprofessional outpatient HIV care setting from the perspective of healthcare professionals and adults living with HIV. Design We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews (healthcare professionals) and focus groups (adults living with HIV). We asked participants their perspectives on barriers, facilitators and strategies to accessing and participating in outpatient PT, important characteristics physiotherapists should possess working in outpatient HIV care, content and structure of PT delivery, and programme evaluation. Recruitment and setting We purposively sampled healthcare professionals based on their experiences working in interprofessional HIV care and recruited adults with HIV via word of mouth and in collaboration with an HIV-specialty hospital in Toronto, Canada. Interviews were conducted via Skype or in-person and focus groups were conducted in-person at the HIV-specialty hospital. Participants 12 healthcare professionals with a median of 12 years experience in HIV care, and 13 adults living with HIV (11 men and 2 women) with a median age of 50 years and living with a median of 6 concurrent health conditions in addition to HIV. Results Overall impressions of PT in outpatient HIV care and factors to consider when implementing PT into an interprofessional care setting include: promoting the role of, and evidence for, PT in outpatient HIV care, structuring PT delivery to accommodate the unique needs and priorities of adults living with HIV, working collaboratively with a physiotherapist on the healthcare team and evaluating rehabilitation as a component of interprofessional care. Conclusions Multiple factors exist for consideration when implementing PT into an interprofessional outpatient HIV care setting. Results provide insight for integrating timely and appropriate access to evidence-informed rehabilitation for people living with chronic and episodic illness, such as HIV. ?

"Role of biologics in asthma","2019","Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma have disproportionally high morbidity and healthcare utilization as compared with their peers with well-controlled disease. Although treatment options for these patients were previously limited, with unacceptable side effects, the emergence of biologic therapies for the treatment of asthma has provided promising targeted therapy for these patients. Biologic therapies target specific inflammatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly in patients with an endotype driven by type 2 (T2) inflammation. In addition to anti-IgE therapy that has improved outcomes in allergic asthma for more than a decade, three anti–IL-5 biologics and one anti–IL-4R biologic have recently emerged as promising treatments for T2 asthma. These targeted therapies have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations, improve lung function, reduce oral corticosteroid use, and improve quality of life in appropriately selected patients. In addition to the currently approved biologic agents, several biologics targeting upstream inflammatory mediators are in clinical trials, with possible approval on the horizon. This article reviews the mechanism of action, indications, expected benefits, and side effects of each of the currently approved biologics for severe uncontrolled asthma and discusses promising therapeutic targets for the future.

"Relationship status and quality of the partner relationship in parents of long-term childhood cancer survivors: The Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study-Parents","2019","Objective: The intensive and long-lasting experience of childhood cancer is a tremendous stressor for the parental relationship. We aimed to (1) compare civil status and partner relationship of parents of long-term childhood cancer survivors with population-based comparisons, (2) identify cancer-related characteristics associated with not being married, and (3) evaluate the quality of the partner relationship. Methods: We sent questionnaires to parents of survivors aged ?16?years at diagnosis and ?20?years at study. Population-based comparisons were derived from a random sample of the general population (?1 child aged ?20?years) and standardized by sociodemographic characteristics of survivor parents. We used logistic regression to identify cancer-related characteristics associated with not being married. The quality of the partner relationship was evaluated using the relationship-specific attachment scale for adults assessing the dimensions security (secure-fearful) and dependency (dependent-independent). Results: A total of 784 parents (58.9% mothers) of 512 survivors (response rate: 44.0%) and 471 comparison parents completed the questionnaire. Parents of survivors were less often divorced/separated (9.0% vs 17.5%, P?<?0.001) and more often in a partner relationship (89.9% vs 85.0%, P?=?0.010) than comparisons. Not being married was not associated with cancer-related characteristics. Parents of survivors reported similar security (P?=?0.444) but higher dependency (P?=?0.032) within the partner relationship than comparisons. In both populations, fathers indicated higher security and dependency than mothers. Conclusions: Long after the diagnosis of cancer in their child, parents' relationship appears similar as in parents of the general population. The increased dependency reported by parents of survivors suggests that they managed their child's disease as a team. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","antineoplastic agent; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cancer survivor; central nervous system tumor; child; childhood cancer; controlled study; divorced person; domestic partnership; father child relation; female; human; Langerhans cell histiocytosis; leukemia; long term survival; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; married person; mother child relation; psychological well-being; quality of life; separated person; social security; stem cell transplantation; Switzerland"

Evidence synthesis: Twenty-six studies were included regarding therapies for metastatic RCC including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-directed therapy (n = 9), mTOR inhibitors (n = 2), cytokines (n = 3), vaccines (n = 3), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs, n = 9). VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy had been the standard therapy, and its use is evolving in the front-line setting with ICIs; cabozantinib provides superior progression-free survival versus sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients, by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium criteria. The mTOR therapy is largely inferior to VEGF-directed therapy, although it has a role in combination strategies. Cytokines have largely been replaced in current practice throughout most regions, and vaccines have failed to show improved survival in phase III studies to date. ICIs have now become standard care in untreated patients with intermediate and poor risks, given overall survival benefit seen with CheckMate-214 study; survival data from IMmotion 151 are not yet mature. Several ongoing phase III combination trials, with promising early-phase data, are due to be read out. Conclusions: The treatment landscape for mccRCC has evolved since the introduction of VEGF inhibitors. Combination therapies involving checkpoint inhibitors could be the next standard of care. Patient summary: With the expanding role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, the treatment paradigm has shifted to include combination therapy in the untreated setting. As the field advances, the bar has been raised in evaluating ongoing combination strategies.

"Shared medical appointments for patients with a nondiabetic physical chronic illness: A systematic review","2019","Objectives: Shared medical appointments are group appointments, with an optional individual consultation, for patients diagnosed with chronic illnesses. Shared medical appointments improve diabetes management, but little is known about their use for other illnesses. The objective was to determine the effect that shared medical appointments have on patients with a physical chronic illness, healthcare providers, and the healthcare system. Methods: A systematic review was conducted searching databases from January 1970 to September 2016. Eligible trials evaluated shared medical appointments for patients with a homogeneous chronic illness, excluding diabetes and mental illness. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias were conducted independently by two authors. Analysis was descriptive. Results: Of 2364 citations, nine randomized trials were included. Shared medical appointments were evaluated for cardiovascular illnesses (four studies), breast cancer, chronic kidney disease, Parkinson’s disease, stress urinary incontinence, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Compared to usual care, no negative effects on patient quality of life, knowledge and satisfaction were reported. One study reported no difference in healthcare provider satisfaction. Another study showed fewer hospital admissions for patients who attended shared medical appointments. Discussion: Few rigorous studies evaluated the use of shared medical appointments for chronic illnesses. Overall, there appears to be no patient harms. Further studies should include more objective outcomes and larger sample sizes. ?

"Impact of maternal adverse childhood experiences on child socioemotional function in rural Kenya: Mediating role of maternal mental health","2019","Mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) suffer heightened vulnerability for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which is exacerbated by the multitude of risk factors associated with poverty and may lead to increased risk of psychiatric disorder. The constellation of complex, co-occurring biological, environmental, social, economic and psychological risk factors are in turn transmitted to her child, conferring vulnerability for adverse development. This study examines the association between maternal intra- and extra-familial ACEs, maternal education and the mental health of her child, mediated by maternal mental health. Mother-child dyads (n?=?121) in Machakos, Kenya were examined cross-sectionally using self-report measures of ACEs, maternal mental health and child internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. The four models proposed to examine the relationship between intra- and extra-familial maternal ACEs and child internalizing and externalizing problems demonstrated indirect pathways through maternal mental health. These effects were found to be conditional on levels of maternal education, which served as a protective factor at lower levels of maternal ACEs. These models demonstrate how the impact of ACEs persists across the lifespan resulting in a negative impact on maternal mental health and conferring further risk to subsequent generations. Elucidating the association between ACEs and subsequent intergenerational sequelae, especially in LMIC where risk is heightened, may improve targeted caregiver mental health programs for prevention and intervention. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; child; cross-sectional study; female; human; Kenya; male; mental disease; mental health; mental stress; mother; poverty; psychology; risk factor; Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Kenya; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mothers; Poverty; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological"
"Predictive markers for postsurgical medical management of acromegaly: A systematic review and consensus treatment guideline","2019","Objective: To clarify the selection of medical therapy following transsphenoidal surgery in patients with acromegaly, based on growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) response and glucometabolic control. Methods: We carried out a systematic literature review on three of the best studied and most practical predictive markers of the response to somatostatin analogues (SSAs): Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression, tumor morphologic classification, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensity. Additional analyses focused on glucose metabolism in treated patients. Results: The literature survey confirmed significant associations of all three factors with SSA responsiveness. SSTR expression appears necessary for the SSA response; however, it is not sufficient, as approximately half of SSTR2-positive tumors failed to respond clinically to first-generation SSAs. MRI findings (T2-hypo-intensity) and a densely granulated phenotype also correlate with SSA efficacy, and are advantageous as predictive markers relative to SSTR expression alone. Glucometabolic control declines with SSA monotherapy, whereas GH receptor antagonist (GHRA) monotherapy may restore normoglycemia. Conclusion: We propose a decision tree to guide selection among SSAs, dopamine agonists (DAs), and GHRA for medical treatment of acromegaly in the postsurgical setting. This decision tree employs three validated predictive markers and other clinical considerations, to determine whether SSAs are appropriate first-line medical therapy in the postsurgical setting. DA treatment is favored in patients with modest IGF-1 elevation. GHRA treatment should be considered for patients with T2-hyperintense tumors with a sparsely granulated phenotype and/or low SSTR2 staining, and may also be favored for individuals with diabetes. Prospective analyses are required to test the utility of this therapeutic paradigm. ? 2019 AACE.","angiopeptin; biological marker; cabergoline; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; growth hormone; octreotide; pasireotide; somatomedin C; somatostatin derivative; somatostatin receptor; somatostatin receptor 2; somatostatin receptor 5; human growth hormone; somatomedin C; somatostatin; acromegaly; bibliographic database; decision tree; diffusion weighted imaging; drug response; glucose metabolism; glycemic control; hormone synthesis; human; immunoreactivity; metabolic regulation; monotherapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; phenotype; postoperative care; practice guideline; predictive value; protein expression; Review; systematic review; transsphenoidal surgery; treatment response; tumor classification; tumor growth; acromegaly; consensus; prospective study; retrospective study; Acromegaly; Consensus; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Somatostatin"
"Estimates of the current and future burden of cancer attributable to low fruit and vegetable consumption in Canada","2019","Low fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with colorectal cancer and may be associated with lung, breast, bladder, pancreatic, ovarian, liver, stomach, esophageal, head and neck cancers. We estimated the current attributable and future avoidable burden of cancer associated with low fruit and vegetable consumption in Canada. Using data on cancer incidence, exposure prevalence and risk effects, we estimated the population attributable risk (PAR)for cancers associated with low fruit and vegetable consumption as well as the future avoidable burden. The prevalence of fruit and vegetable consumption was projected to 2032 and cancer incidence was projected to 2042 to estimate the future potential impact fraction of cancer attributable to low fruit and vegetable consumption. Based on estimates from the Canadian Community Health Survey, the prevalence of low fruit (<4 servings/day)and vegetable (<4 servings/day)consumption in the Canadian population was 80.5% and 86.6%, respectively. The PARs for colorectal cancer associated with low fruit and vegetable consumption were 6.1% (1, 371 cases)and 2.2% (487 cases), respectively. For all incident cancers in 2015, 0.7% and 0.3% were attributable to low fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively. An increase of one serving/week of fruit could prevent 20,710 colorectal cancer cases cumulatively by 2042, and the same increase in vegetable consumption could prevent 10,185 cases. Although more research on the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and cancer risk is needed, our results demonstrate that with reasonable increases in current fruit and vegetable consumption by Canadians, over 30,000 colorectal cancer cases could be prevented by 2042. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; aged; Article; attributable risk; Canada; cancer incidence; cancer prevention; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease burden; female; food intake; fruit; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; vegetable"
"Child sleep problems and adult mental health in those born at term or extremely low birth weight","2019","Objectives: To examine associations between parent-reported child sleep walking or talking, nightmares, and trouble sleeping at age eight and psychiatric problems in adulthood (age 30–35) in extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g) survivors and matched normal birth weight (NBW; >2500 g) control participants. Methods: At age eight, parents of ELBW survivors and NBW control participants completed sleep items on the Child Behavior Checklist assessing the presence of sleep walking/talking, nightmares, or trouble sleeping. At age 30–35, 98 ELBW and 94 NBW individuals completed the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Analyses were conducted in each birth weight group independently. Results: In NBW participants, sleep walking/talking in childhood predicted higher BAI and BDI scores, as well as more than three times the odds of having a mood or anxiety disorder (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.26–9.60) at age 30–35. Sex and childhood sleep problem interactions revealed that females who manifested sleep walking/talking as children had higher BAI scores than males. Nightmares in children born at NBW predicted higher BAI scores. These associations persisted despite adjustment for child mental health, sex, socioeconomic status, sexual or physical abuse, and family functioning. Trouble sleeping in childhood did not predict adult mental health problems. Childhood sleep problems did not predict psychopathology in ELBW adults. Conclusions: Children born at NBW who manifest sleep walking or talking appear to be at increased risk for developing mood or anxiety disorders in adulthood. No associations between child sleep and adult mental illness were noted in those with ELBW surviviors. Childhood sleep walking/talking may be a unique risk factor for mental health problems later in life. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory; child; Child Behavior Checklist; cohort analysis; controlled study; extremely low birth weight; family functioning; female; human; male; mental disease; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; nightmare; observational study; physical abuse; prediction; priority journal; sex difference; sexual abuse; sleep disorder; sleep walking; social status"
"International clinical practice recommendations on the definition, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and psychosocial aspects of developmental coordination disorder","2019","Aim: These international clinical practice recommendations (CPR) for developmental coordination disorder (DCD), initiated by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD), aim to address key questions on the definition, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and psychosocial aspects of DCD relevant for clinical practice. Method: Key questions in five areas were considered through literature reviews and formal expert consensus. For recommendations based on evidence, literature searches on ‘mechanisms’, ‘assessment’, and ‘intervention’ were updated since the last recommendations in 2012. New searches were conducted for ‘psychosocial issues’ and ‘adolescents/adults’. Evidence was rated according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (level of evidence [LOE] 1–4) and transferred into recommendations. For recommendations based on formal consensus, two meetings of an international, multidisciplinary expert panel were conducted with a further five Delphi rounds to develop good clinical practice (GCP) recommendations. Results: Thirty-five recommendations were made. Eight were based on the evidence from literature reviews (three on ‘assessment’, five on ‘intervention’). Twenty-two were updated from the 2012 recommendations. New recommendations relate to diagnosis and assessment (two GCPs) and psychosocial issues (three GCPs). Additionally, one new recommendation (LOE) reflects active video games as adjuncts to more traditional activity-oriented and participation-oriented interventions, and two new recommendations (one GCP, one LOE) were made for adolescents and adults with DCD. Interpretation: The CPR–DCD is a comprehensive overview of DCD and current understanding based on research evidence and expert consensus. It reflects the state of the art for clinicians and scientists of varied disciplines. The international CPR–DCD may serve as a basis for national guidelines. What this paper adds: Updated international clinical practice guidelines on developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Refined and extended recommendations on clinical assessment and intervention for DCD. A critical synopsis of current research on mechanisms of DCD.

"The impact of exercise and nutrition on the regulation of skeletal muscle mass","2019","The maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and strength throughout life is a key determinant of human health and well-being. There is a gradual loss of both skeletal muscle mass and strength with ageing (a process termed sarcopenia) that increases the risk of functional dependence, morbidity and mortality. Understanding the factors that regulate the size of human muscle mass, particularly during the later years of life, has therefore become an area of intense scientific inquiry. The amount of muscle mass is determined by coordinated changes in muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB). In this review, we assess both classical and contemporary work that has examined how resistance exercise and nutrition impact on MPS and MPB. Special consideration is given to the role of different sources of dietary protein (food vs. supplements) and non-protein nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids in regulating MPS. We also critically evaluate recent studies that have employed novel ‘omic’ technologies such as dynamic protein profiling to probe for changes in rates of MPS and MPB at the individual protein level following exercise. Finally, we provide suggestions for future research that we hope will yield important information for the development of exercise and nutritional strategies to counteract muscle loss in a variety of clinical settings.

"Usability of the participationand environment measure plus (PEM+) for client-centered and participation-focused care planning","2019","Importance: The Participation and Environment Measure Plus (PEM+) is a new electronic health application to help caregivers contribute to client-centered and participation-focused care planning for their young child. The PEM+ is designed to help caregivers build on their participation assessment by determining priority activities, setting specific goals, and identifying strategies for goal attainment. Objective: To examine the usability of the PEM+. Design: A single-arm usability trial. Setting: Two early intervention and early childhood educational programs. Participants: Six caregivers of children ages 0-3 yr with developmental delay and receiving rehabilitation services. Intervention: Caregivers who were eligible and enrolled were given access to the PEM+ for 1 wk and instructed to complete one iteration. Outcomes and Measures: Usability was assessed according to caregivers' report of PEM+'s technical effectiveness and ease of use, ease of learning, and user satisfaction via the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use questionnaire. Results: All caregivers completed the PEM+ online once and in its entirety (mean completion time = 13.6 min). Mean technical effectiveness ratings ranged from 5.7 to 6.3 out of 7.0, and mean ease of use, ease of learning, and user satisfaction ratings were 4.4, 5.4, and 4.2 out of 6.0, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Caregivers of young children can navigate the PEM+. Trends in survey feedback informed optimizations for the PEM+ before further feasibility testing.

"Complex care for kids Ontario: Protocol for a mixed-methods randomised controlled trial of a population-level care coordination initiative for children with medical complexity","2019","Introduction: Technological and medical advances have led to a growing population of children with medical complexity (CMC) defined by substantial medical needs, healthcare utilisation and morbidity. These children are at a high risk of missed, fragmented and/or inappropriate care, and families bear extraordinary financial burden and stress. While small in number (<1% of children), this group uses ?1/3 of all child healthcare resources, and need coordinated care to optimise their health. Complex care for kids Ontario (CCKO) brings researchers, families and healthcare providers together to develop, implement and evaluate a population-level roll-out of care for CMC in Ontario, Canada through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The intervention includes dedicated key workers and the utilisation of coordinated shared care plans. Methods and analysis: Our primary objective is to evaluate the CCKO intervention using a randomised waitlist control design. The waitlist approach involves rolling out an intervention over time, whereby all participants are randomised into two groups (A and B) to receive the intervention at different time points determined at random. Baseline measurements are collected at month 0, and groups A and B are compared at months 6 and 12. The primary outcome is the family-prioritized Family Experiences with Coordination of Care (FECC) survey at 12 months. The FECC will be compared between groups using an analysis of covariance with the corresponding baseline score as the covariate. Secondary outcomes include reports of child and parent health outcomes, health system utilisation and process outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: Research ethics approval has been obtained for this multicentre RCT. This trial will assess the effect of a large population-level complex care intervention to determine whether dedicated key workers and coordinated care plans have an impact on improving service delivery and quality of life for CMC and their families. ? 2019 Author(s).","analysis of covariance; article; case report; child; clinical article; coordination; female; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; male; multicenter study; Ontario; outcome assessment; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; research ethics; scientist"
"Bridging interventions before bariatric surgery in patients with BMI ? 50?kg/m2: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Bariatric surgery on patients with body mass index (BMI) ? 50?kg/m2, historically known as superobesity, is technically challenging and carries a higher risk of complications. Bridging interventions have been introduced for weight loss before bariatric surgery in this population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging interventions before bariatric surgery in patients with BMI ? 50?kg/m2. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from database inception to September 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they conducted any bridging intervention for weight loss in patients with BMI greater than 50?kg/m2 prior to bariatric surgery. Primary outcome was the change in BMI before and after bridging intervention. Secondary outcomes included comorbidity status after bridging interventions and resulting complications. Pooled mean differences (MD) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. Results: 13 studies including 550 patients met inclusion criteria (mean baseline BMI of 61.26?kg/m2). Bridging interventions included first-step laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), intragastric balloon (IGB), and liquid low-calorie diet program (LLCD). There was a reduction of BMI by 12.8?kg/m2 after a bridging intervention (MD 12.8, 95% CI 9.49–16.1, P &lt; 0.0001). Specifically, LSG demonstrated a BMI reduction of 15.2?kg/m2 (95% CI 12.9–17.5, P &lt; 0.0001) and preoperative LLCD by 9.8?kg/m2 (95% CI 9.82–15.4, P = 0.0006). IGB did not demonstrate significant weight loss prior to bariatric surgery. There was remission or improvement of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea in 62.8%, 74.6%, and 74.6% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: First-step LSG and LLCD are both safe and appropriate bridging interventions which can allow for effective weight loss prior to bariatric surgery in patients with BMI greater than 50?kg/m2. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","bariatric surgery; body mass; clinical effectiveness; human; hypertension; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; low calorie diet; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient safety; priority journal; remission; Review; sleep disordered breathing; systematic review"
"Physician communication via Internet-enabled technology: A systematic review","2019","The use of Internet-enabled technology (information and communication technology such as smartphone applications) may enrich information exchange among providers and, consequently, improve health care delivery. The purpose of this systematic review was to gain a greater understanding of the role that Internet-enabled technology plays in enhancing communication among physicians. Studies were identified through a search in three electronic platforms: the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, ProQuest, and Web of Science. The search identified 5140 articles; of these, 21 met all inclusion criteria. In general, physicians were satisfied with Internet-enabled technology, but consensus was lacking regarding whether Internet-enabled technology improved efficiency or made a difference to clinical decision-making. Internet-enabled technology can play an important role in enhancing communication among physicians, but the extent of that benefit is influenced by (1) the impact of Internet-enabled technology on existing work practices, (2) the availability of adequate resources, and (3) the nature of institutional elements, such as privacy legislation. ?

"Evaluating probiotics for the prevention of ventilator-Associated pneumonia: A randomised placebo-controlled multicentre trial protocol and statistical analysis plan for PROSPECT","2019","Introduction Ventilator-Associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common healthcare-Associated infection in critically ill patients. Prior studies suggest that probiotics may reduce VAP and other infections in critically ill patients; however, most previous randomised trials were small, single centre studies. The Probiotics: Prevention of Severe Pneumonia and Endotracheal Colonization Trial (PROSPECT) aims to determine the impact of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on VAP and other clinically important outcomes in critically ill adults. Methods PROSPECT is a multicentre, concealed, randomised, stratified, blinded, controlled trial in patients ?18 years old, anticipated to be mechanically ventilated ?72 hours, in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada, the USA and Saudi Arabia. Patients receive either 1×10 10 colony forming units of L. rhamnosus GG twice daily or an identical appearing placebo. Those at increased risk of probiotic infection are excluded. The primary outcome is VAP. Secondary outcomes are other ICU-Acquired infections including Clostridioides difficile infection, diarrhoea (including antibiotic-Associated diarrhoea), antimicrobial use, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. The planned sample size of 2650 patients is based on an estimated 15% VAP rate and will provide 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction. Ethics and dissemination This protocol and statistical analysis plan outlines the methodology, primary and secondary analyses, sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses. PROSPECT is approved by Health Canada (#9427-M1133-45C), the research ethics boards of all participating hospitals and Public Health Ontario. Results will be disseminated via academic channels (peer reviewed journal publications, professional healthcare fora including international conferences) and conventional and social media.

"Weathering the rural reality: Delivery of the Nurse-Family Partnership home visitation program in rural British Columbia, Canada","2019","Background: Pregnant girls/young women and new mothers living in situations of social and economic disadvantage are at increased risk for poor health. Rural living may compound marginalization and create additional challenges for young mothers. Public health nurses (PHNs) delivering the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) to mothers living in rural communities may help to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The purpose of this analysis, grounded in data collected as part of a broader process evaluation, was to explore and understand the influence of rural geography on the delivery of NFP in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: For the analysis of this qualitative data, principles of inductive reasoning based on the methodology of interpretive description were applied. A total of 10 PHNs and 11 supervisors providing the NFP program in rural communities were interviewed. Results: The results of this analysis reflect the factors and challenges of providing the NFP program in rural communities. PHNs noted the importance of NFP in the lives of their rural clients, especially in the face of extreme financial and social disparity. Remaining flexible in their approach to rural nursing and protecting time to complete NFP work supported nurses practicing in rural environments. Rural PHNs were often the sole NFP nurse in their office and struggled to remain connected to their supervisors and other NFP colleagues. Challenges were compounded by the realities of rural geography, such as poor weather, reduced accessibility, and long travel distances; however, these were considered normal occurrences of rural practice by nurses. Conclusions: PHNs and NFP supervisors are well-positioned to identify the modifications that are required to support the delivery of NFP in rural geography. NFP nurses need to articulate what classifies as rural in order to effectively determine how to best provide services to these populations. Environmental conditions must be considered when offering NFP in rural communities, particularly if they impact the time required to deliver the program and additional services offered to young mothers. Regular NFP meetings and education opportunities address common problems associated with rural nursing but could be enhanced by better use of technology. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; British Columbia; community health nursing; education; female; geography; human; human experiment; mother; nurse; rural area; rural health nursing; rural population; travel; weather; weathering"
"High-intensity interval training in overweight and obese children and adolescents: Systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","INTRODUCTION: While High Intensity Interval Training is praised in many populations for its beneficial effects on body composition and cardiometabolic health, its use among obese youth remain uncertain. This study aimed at determining whether HIIT is effective to improve aerobic fitness and reduce cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese youth. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search was conducted and articles reporting studies that investigated the effects of HIIT in 6 to 18-year-old youth were eligible. Meta-analyses were performed when appropriate. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fifteen studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analyses. HIIT significantly improves maximal oxygen uptake (1.117 [95% CI: 0.528 to 1.706], P<0.001), and reduces body mass (-0.295 [95% CI: -0.525 to -0.066], P<0.05), body fat (-0.786 [95% CI: -1.452 to -0.120], P<0.05), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-1.026 [95% CI: -1.370 to -0.683], P<0.001; -0.966 [95% CI: -1.628 to -0.304], P<0.01 respectively), and the HOMA-IR (-1.589 [95% CI: -2.528 to -0.650], P<0.01). However, there is significant heterogeneity, and low to high inconsistency for most cardiometabolic risk factors and aerobic fitness. CONCLUSIONS: Although few studies have reported cardiometabolic risks, HIIT may also be as effective as traditional endurance continuous training to decrease blood pressure and insulin resistance. HIIT is effective to improve aerobic fitness, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in obese youth, but data are insufficient to determine whether it is more effective than traditional continuous submaximal intensity exercise training. ? 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA","adolescent; child; female; fitness; high intensity interval training; human; male; meta analysis; metabolic disorder; obesity; oxygen consumption; physiology; risk factor; Adolescent; Child; Female; High-Intensity Interval Training; Humans; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Obesity; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Fitness; Risk Factors"
"Employing Interdisciplinary Approaches in Designing with Fragile Older Adults; Advancing ABLE for Arts-Based Rehabilitative Play and Complex Learning","2019","ABLE is a gesture-based interactive platform that transforms physical therapy into game play and art creation – movement creates a virtual painting, digital music creation or engages users in game play with others. ABLE offers a menu of scalable physical therapy exercises designed to enhance strength, balance, and agility for variable populations with frailty and dementia presenting with low to severe impairments. It is designed for older adults with dementia and fragility, aiming to harness the incentivizing ability of art and gaming to encourage playful, physical interactions. The project aims to establish synergy between physical interaction and creative engagement to reduce boredom, agitation and social isolation while enhancing physiological, affective and cognitive health. This paper reviews how our interdisciplinary team of software engineers, medical scientists and artist/designers work to adapt design thinking in this research, to create participatory roles for older adults and caregivers that take into account the limits to participation posed by various barriers and their differing interests and investment in participation. We discuss how participant feedback can be integrated into the software interface, app design and user experience to meet the diverse and variable needs of users, for both independent use and supported use in residence. As well, to meet the diverse needs of this complex population, we draw on HCI gaming research as well as neuroplasticity research to formulate interaction experiences that seek to teach learning that can translate across the physical, cognitive and affective needs of this population. In seeking to enhance both pleasure and learning, we speculate that users will engage in sustained use of the platform over time and translate learnings into everyday life, to improve their opportunities to achieve health and wellness objectives. This design approach recognizes the need to incorporate diverse research findings into our approach. It also requires we adjust participatory approaches to accommodate less able-bodied participants, and adopt techniques for integrating participant data into all elements of design work, to ensure a coherent interdisciplinary team approach. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Application programs; Geriatrics; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Physical therapy; Psychophysiology; User interfaces; Complex learning; Dementia; Fragility; Interdisciplinary practices; Neuroplasticity; Participatory design; Prevention; User interaction design; Human computer interaction"

"Checklist for the Systemic Treatment of Psoriasis Using Biologics: A Delphi Study","2019","Background: Despite the complexity of psoriasis treatment using biologic therapy, there does not exist a standardized synoptic reporting form for the initiation of this population. The purpose of this study was to use a modified Delphi approach to develop a standard checklist for the standardized documentation of patients receiving systemic biologic therapy for psoriasis. Methods: A modified Delphi survey was conducted over 3 rounds (February 2017 through January 2018). An expert panel generated a 51-item checklist that was proposed to participants. Items were rated on an anchored 1-7 Likert scale. Consensus was defined apriori as ? 70% agreement by respondents. Results: A total of 58, 17, and 18 dermatologists participated in 3 consecutive Delphi rounds, respectively. Only half of the dermatologists surveyed reported using a checklist for the management of psoriasis. The final checklist comprised 19, 5, 6, and 9 items pertaining to patient history; physical exam and history of systemic therapy; vaccinations; and lab investigations and bloodwork, respectively. Conclusions: Given the increasing availability and complexity of biologic agents for psoriasis treatment, there is a need to promote standardized documentation for this population. The Checklist for the Systemic Treatment of Psoriasis presents 38 items that should be considered when initiating patients with psoriasis on biologic therapy. ?

"Examining the association between physical activity, sedentary behavior and sport participation with e-cigarette use and smoking status in a large sample of Canadian youth","2019","Introduction:Youth e-cigarette use is common worldwide, but the profile of e-cigarette users compared with tobacco users is unclear.This study examines how sport participation and activity levels among youth differ between e-cigarette users and smokers. Methods: Using Canadian data from 38977 grade 9 to 12 students who participated inYear 3 (2014-15) of the COMPASS study, logistic regression models were used to examine the likelihood of sport participation and activity level based on e-cigarette use and smoking status. Pearson's chi-square tests were used to examine subgroup differences by gender. Results: E-cigarette users are more likely to participate in intramural, competitive, and team sports compared to non-users. Current and former smokers are less likely to participate in those sports than non-smokers. Youth e-cigarette users are more likely than non-users to meet the physical activity guidelines. Current smokers are more likely than non-smokers to undertake physical activity at least 60 min daily but less likely than non-smokers to tone at least 3 times per week.Youth e-cigarette users are less likely than non-users to be sedentary less than 2 h daily. Gender differences among males and females show that male e-cigarettes users drive the general relationship. Conclusion: Results suggest that e-cigarette users are more likely to engage in physical activity compared to non e-cigarette users.Youth e-cigarette users are more likely to be physically active while the opposite is true for smokers. Although e-cigarettes may be less harmful to health compared to cigarette smoking, the increased uptake among youth of differing profiles should be considered in prevention efforts. Implications: These results highlight the importance of addressing e-cigarette use in youth who undertake health promoting behaviors. Prevention efforts should not focus only on youth who may undertake riskier health habits; e-cigarette prevention programs should go beyond the domain of tobacco control. ? The Author 2017.

"Cannabis use behaviors and prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in a cohort of Canadian medicinal cannabis users","2019","Cannabis is commonly used recreationally for its euphoric and relaxing effects, while its medical use is permitted in several jurisdictions. With only low-quality evidence suggesting anxiolytic effects of cannabis and strong public sentiment surrounding such purported effects, the purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of cannabis for medicinal purposes (CMP) use for anxiety symptoms. An online survey was disseminated to CMP users registered with a Canadian licensed producer. Respondents completed demographic and validated self-report questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, MINI-SPIN, and panic disorder/agoraphobia DSM-5 criteria). Cannabis use behaviors were also discussed. Overall, 2032 completed responses with a verified user number were collected. Of the total sample, 888 (43.7%) reported CMP authorization to treat anxiety symptoms and completed all psychometric screening instruments. Rates of probable disorders were high (Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 45.6%, Social Anxiety Disorder: 42.4%, Major Depressive Disorder: 25.7%, Panic Disorder/Agoraphobia: 25.7%); 63.4% met screening criteria for ?1 disorder. Most (92%) reported that cannabis improved their symptoms, despite continuing to endorse moderate-level severity. Nearly half (49%) reported replacing a non-psychiatric (53.7%) or psychiatric medication (46.3%) prescribed to them by their physician with CMP. Respondents endorsed daily CMP use and severity of anxiety (GAD-7, p < 0.001) and depressive (PHQ-9, p < 0.001) symptoms were positively associated with the amount of cannabis used/day. The vast majority perceived symptom improvement with CMP use and did not believe CMP use was associated with impairment or an inability to control use. Nevertheless, the possibility of cannabis use disorder cannot be ruled out as well as the possibility that improvements in non-psychiatric conditions were attributed to improvements in anxiety. These results highlight the need to systematically evaluate CMP use for mental illness. ? 2019","medical cannabis; adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; Canadian; cannabis use; cohort analysis; comorbidity; depression; disease severity; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; online system; priority journal; psychometry; questionnaire"

"Serotonin in the gut: Blessing or a curse","2019","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) once most extensively studied as a neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, is seen to be predominantly secreted in the gut. About 95% of 5-HT is estimated to be found in gut mainly within the enterochromaffin cells whereas about 5% is found in the brain. 5-HT is an important enteric signaling molecule and is well known for playing a key role in sensory-motor and secretory functions in the gut. In recent times, studies uncovering various new functions of gut-derived 5-HT indicate that many more are yet to be discovered in coming days. Recent studies revealed that 5-HT plays a pivotal role in immune cell activation and generation/perpetuation of inflammation in the gut. In addition to its various roles in the gut, there are now emerging evidences that suggest an important role of gut-derived 5-HT in other biological processes beyond the gut, such as bone remodeling and metabolic homeostasis. This review focuses to briefly summarize the accumulated and newly updated role of 5-HT in the maintenance of normal gut physiology and in the pathogenesis of inflammation in the gut. The collected information about this multifaceted signaling molecule may aid in distinguishing its good and bad effects which may lead to the development of novel strategies to overcome the unwanted effect, such as in inflammatory bowel disease. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Soci?t?

"Identifying and responding to child maltreatment when delivering family-based treatment—A qualitative study","2019","Introduction: This study describes practitioner strategies, perceptions, experiences with identifying and responding to child emotional abuse (CEA) and child exposure to intimate partner violence (CEIPV) when providing Family-Based Treatment (FBT) to children and adolescents with eating disorders. Method: Using qualitative interpretive description, this study recruited a purposeful sample of practitioners (N = 30, 90% female) implementing FBT for adolescent eating disorders. Semi-structured interviews focused on eliciting their perspectives regarding identifying and responding to CEA and CEIPV in practice. Interviews were conducted over the phone, were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using conventional content analysis. Interim member checking, the thoughtful clinician test, and coding memos were used to ensure the integrity of the analysis. Results: Participants were 31–57 years old and practicing FBT in five countries. Three data patterns emerged: (a) perceptions of child maltreatment prevalence and identification; (b) complicating factors; and finally (c) strategies to support family-based work. Practitioners described important considerations for CEA and CEIPV identification, as well as possible FBT adaptations that can support the safety of children and adolescents while simultaneously ensuring the treatment of the eating disorder. Conclusions: Practitioners describe a need for additional training to identify and respond to CEA and CEIPV within FBT and within practice more broadly. There is a need for trials that detail the appropriateness and efficacy of FBT for patients experiencing CEA and/or CEIPV. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adolescent; adult; Article; child abuse; content analysis; controlled study; eating disorder; emotional abuse; family therapy; female; human; male; partner violence; personal experience; physician attitude; prevalence; priority journal; psychological adjustment; qualitative research; semi structured interview; child; child abuse; middle aged; preschool child; psychology; qualitative research; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Abuse; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research"

"Knowledge, attitudes, and the practice of health promotion among physiotherapists in Nigeria","2019","Purpose: In spite of the growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases in Nigeria and the compelling need for the active participation of physiotherapists in health promotion activities around the world, there is no evidence that physiotherapists in Nigeria are engaged in health promotion activities. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge of, attitudes toward, and practice of health promotion among physiotherapists practising in Nigeria. Method: This was a cross-sectional study. We contacted members of the Nigeria Society of Physiotherapy (n = 368) by email; the message contained a link to an online questionnaire. Results: A total of 229 (62%) physiotherapists responded. Most demonstrated a good knowledge of health promotion (approximately 70%) and indicated that they often incorporated aspects of health promotion into their patients’ treatment (63%). However, fewer than one-fifth strongly agreed that health promotion was taught in their entry-level programme and had equipped them with the necessary health promotion skills. Conclusions: The majority of the physiotherapists surveyed demonstrated good knowledge and often incorporated health promotion into their routine daily practice. Nevertheless, the respondents stated that their entry-level physiotherapy education had not sufficiently equipped them for health promotion practice. These findings provide a baseline reference that can be used to track capacity building for health promotion practices. The results also highlight important gaps in the physiotherapy entry-level curriculum and the health promotion training needs of physiotherapists in Nigeria. ? 2019, University of Toronto Press Inc..

"Keeping secrets, disclosing health information: an institutional ethnography of the social organisation of perinatal care for women living with HIV in Canada","2019","This paper describes findings from an institutional ethnography that arose out of the concerns of women living with HIV in Ontario, Canada, regarding the disclosure of their HIV status while accessing perinatal care. The enquiry traces the connections between women’s experiences of perinatal care, the activities of healthcare providers delivering such care and the ruling relations that organise women’s experiences and healthcare providers’ activities. Focusing on HIV disclosure as a concern expressed by women, the findings make visible the day-to-day, routinised practices of healthcare providers working in perinatal care for women living with HIV, as well as the ideological discourses of ‘fear of contagion’ and ‘AIDS hysteria’ that contributed to producing the kinds of care experiences that were articulated by women. Opportunities to strengthen perinatal care policies and practices for women living with HIV are discussed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Network meta-analysis of therapies for previously untreated advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma","2019","Background: The spectrum of treatment options for patients with metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma is broad, spanning multiple treatment classes. However, there is a lack of head-to-head evidence comparing targeted and immunotherapies. The purpose of this study is to conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) in previously untreated, BRAF-mutated melanoma patients and estimate the relative efficacy of systemic therapies for this patient population at the treatment level. Methods: The literature review included searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to November 2018. Randomized controlled trials of previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma were eligible if at least one intervention was either a targeted or immune therapy. Relative treatment effects were estimated by fixed effect Bayesian NMAs on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), based on the hazard ratio. Results: Combination dabrafenib with trametinib (HR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.17, 0.28] vs dacarbazine) and combination vemurafenib with cobimetinib (HR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.17, 0.29] vs dacarbazine) were likely to rank as the most favorable treatment options for PFS, while combination nivolumab with ipilimumab was likely to be the most efficacious in terms of OS (HR 0.33 [0.24, 0.47] vs dacarbazine). Conclusions and relevance: The findings highlight the efficacy of combination PD-1 with CTLA-4 inhibitors and combination BRAF with MEK inhibitors in the treatment of advanced melanoma. However, as few trials informed each treatment comparison, research is needed to further refine our understanding of this complex and rapidly evolving treatment landscape. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","B Raf kinase; cobimetinib; dabrafenib; dacarbazine; ipilimumab; nivolumab; programmed death 1 receptor; trametinib; vemurafenib; antineoplastic agent; azetidine derivative; B Raf kinase; BRAF protein, human; dabrafenib; dacarbazine; GDC-0973; imidazole derivative; oxime; piperidine derivative; pyridone derivative; pyrimidinone derivative; trametinib; vemurafenib; advanced cancer; BRAF gene; cancer immunotherapy; cancer survival; cancer therapy; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; drug efficacy; gene mutation; human; melanoma; meta analysis; molecularly targeted therapy; network meta-analysis; overall survival; progression free survival; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; systemic therapy; treatment outcome; enzymology; genetics; melanoma; metabolism; mutation; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Azetidines; Dacarbazine; Humans; Imidazoles; Melanoma; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Oximes; Piperidines; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Pyridones; Pyrimidinones; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vemurafenib"
"Arterial lesions in giant cell arteritis: A longitudinal study","2019","Objectives: To evaluate large-vessel (LV) abnormalities on serial imaging in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and discern predictors of new lesions. Methods: Clinical and imaging data from patients with GCA (including subjects diagnosed by LV imaging) enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study and/or a randomized clinical trial were included. New arterial lesions were defined as a lesion in a previously unaffected artery. Results: The study included 187 patients with GCA, 146 (78%) female, mean (±SD) age at diagnosis 68.5 ± 8.5 years; 39% diagnosed by LV imaging. At least one arterial lesion was present in 123 (66%) on the first study. The most frequently affected arteries were subclavian (42%), axillary (32%), and thoracic aorta (20%). In 106 patients (57%) with serial imaging, new arterial lesions were noted in 41 patients (39%), all of whom had a baseline abnormality, over a mean (±SD) follow-up of 4.39 (2.22) years. New abnormalities were observed in 33% patients by year 2; clinical features of active disease were present at only 50% of these cases. There were no differences in age, sex, temporal artery biopsy positivity, or disease activity in patients with or without new lesions. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with GCA, LV abnormalities on first imaging were common. Development of new arterial lesions occurred in patients with arterial abnormalities at first imaging, often in the absence of symptoms of active disease. Arterial imaging should be considered in all patients with GCA at diagnosis and serial imaging at least in patients with baseline abnormalities. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","age distribution; aged; artery disease; Article; axillary artery; clinical feature; controlled study; descriptive research; disease activity; female; follow up; giant cell arteritis; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sex difference; subclavian artery; thoracic aorta; computed tomographic angiography; diagnostic imaging; giant cell arteritis; magnetic resonance angiography; middle aged; Aged; Aorta, Thoracic; Axillary Artery; Computed Tomography Angiography; Female; Giant Cell Arteritis; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Subclavian Artery"
"Equivalent Hypertrophy and Strength Gains in β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate- or Leucine-supplemented Men","2019","Ingestion of proteins with high leucine content during resistance training (RT) can augment hypertrophy. Some data suggest that a leucine metabolite, β-hydroxy, β-methylbutyrate (HMB), is substantially more anabolically efficacious than leucine. Purpose We aimed to test whether supplementation with HMB versus leucine, added to whey protein, would result in differential muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in young men performing RT. Methods Twenty-six resistance-trained men (23 ± 2 yr) performed 12 wk of RT with three phases. Phase 1: 8 wk of periodized RT (three training sessions per week). Phase 2: 2 wk overreaching period (five sessions per week). Phase 3: 2 wk taper (three sessions per week). Participants were randomly assigned to twice daily ingestion of: whey protein (25 g) plus HMB (1.5 g) (whey+HMB; n = 13) or whey protein (25 g) plus leucine (1.5 g) (whey+leu; n = 13). Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed before and after RT. Measures of fat- and bone-free mass, vastus lateralis (VL) muscle thickness and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) (both by ultrasound), muscle fiber CSA, and 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength tests were determined. Results We observed increases in fat- and bone-free mass, VL muscle thickness, muscle CSA and fiber type CSA and 1-RM strength with no differences between groups at any phase. We observed no differences between groups or time-group interactions in hormone concentrations at any phase of the RT program. Conclusions β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate added to whey did not result in greater increases in any measure of muscle mass, strength, or hormonal concentration compared to leucine added to whey. Our results show that HMB is no more effective in stimulating RT-induced hypertrophy and strength gains than leucine. ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Lifestyle, Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c, and Survival Among Patients With Stable Ischemic Heart Disease and Diabetes","2019","Background: The importance of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) control as part of comprehensive risk factor management in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is controversial. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a greater number of controlled risk factors at 1 year, including A1c, affects survival in patients with DM and SIHD. Methods: Of 690 patients with DM followed in the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial, 592 (86%) had complete ascertainment of 7 pre-specified risk factors at baseline and after 1 year: systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, nonsmoking, physical activity, diet adherence, body mass index, and A1c. The primary outcome measure was mortality beyond 1 year after randomization. Results: During a mean follow-up of 7.0 ± 4.2 years beyond 1 year after randomization, 186 subjects died (31.4% overall, 4.5%/year). The greater the number of risk factors controlled at 1 year, the higher the probability of survival (unadjusted log rank p = 0.002). Compared with 0 to 1 controlled risk factors, attaining 3 to 7 goals predicted progressively lower mortality (hazard ratio for control of 6 or 7 risk factors was 0.13; 95% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.40). Importantly, only 10.3% of subjects achieved control of 6 or 7 risk factors. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of improved survival were no smoking, regular physical activity, dietary adherence, and A1c <7%. Conclusions: In this high-risk subset of SIHD patients with DM, the number of controlled risk factors, particularly lifestyle behaviors and A1c, were associated with improved survival.

"Impacts of a changing earth on microbial dynamics and human health risks in the continuum between beach water and sand","2019","Although infectious disease risk from recreational exposure to waterborne pathogens has been an active area of research for decades, beach sand is a relatively unexplored habitat for the persistence of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Beach sand, biofilms, and water all present unique advantages and challenges to pathogen introduction, growth, and persistence. These dynamics are further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats. Models of FIB and pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach use, but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats impede robust modeling. Climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling because extreme weather events, warming water, and sea level change may increase human exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between FIB and pathogens. In addition, population growth and urbanization will exacerbate contamination events and increase the potential for human exposure. The cumulative effects of anthropogenic changes will alter microbial population dynamics in beach habitats and the assumptions and relationships used in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and process-based models. Here, we review our current understanding of microbial populations and transport dynamics across the sand-water continuum at beaches, how these dynamics can be modeled, and how global change factors (e.g., climate and land use) should be integrated into more accurate beachscape-based models. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beaches; Climate models; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Health risks; Land use; Models; Pathogens; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sand; Sea level; Water pollution; Water quality; Anthropogenic changes; Extreme weather events; Fecal indicator bacteria; Global change factors; Microbial population dynamics; Microbial populations; Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA); Water-borne pathogens; Climate change; beach water; sand water; unclassified drug; water; sea water; anthropogenic effect; bacterium; beach; biofilm; bioindicator; climate change; coastal water; complexity; global change; health risk; host-pathogen interaction; infectious disease; microbial activity; numerical model; risk assessment; sand; water quality; biofilm; climate change; desiccation; drought; environmental impact; environmental stress; environmental temperature; feces microflora; futurology; geographic and geological phenomena; greenhouse effect; habitat; health hazard; human; human impact (environment); hurricane; mathematical model; microbial community; microbial population dynamics; nonhuman; nutrient availability; organismal interaction; physical chemistry; precipitation; priority journal; Review; sand; seashore; solar radiation; starvation; tide; water management; water pollution; water supply; water transport; wave; environmental monitoring; feces; microbiology; swimming; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Seawater; Water; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution"
"Loss of the sphingolipid desaturase DEGS1 causes hypomyelinating leukodystrophy","2019","Sphingolipid imbalance is the culprit in a variety of neurological diseases, some affecting the myelin sheath. We have used whole-exome sequencing in patients with undetermined leukoencephalopathies to uncover the endoplasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the causative gene in 19 patients from 13 unrelated families. Shared features among the cases include severe motor arrest, early nystagmus, dystonia, spasticity, and profound failure to thrive. MRI showed hypomyelination, thinning of the corpus callosum, and progressive thalamic and cerebellar atrophy, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 in myelin development and maintenance. This enzyme converts dihydroceramide (DhCer) into ceramide (Cer) in the final step of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. We detected a marked increase of the substrate DhCer and DhCer/Cer ratios in patients’ fibroblasts and muscle. Further, we used a knockdown approach for disease modeling in Danio rerio, followed by a preclinical test with the first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya). The enzymatic inhibition of Cer synthase by fingolimod, 1 step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, reduced the critical DhCer/ Cer imbalance and the severe locomotor disability, increasing the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes in a zebrafish model. These proof-of-concept results pave the way to clinical translation.

"Characteristics and Outcomes in Patients with Venous Thromboembolism Taking Concomitant Anti-Platelet Agents and Anticoagulants in the AMPLIFY Trial","2019","The double-blind, randomized, AMPLIFY trial compared 6 months' treatment with apixaban (10 mg twice daily for 7 days and 5 mg twice daily thereafter) versus conventional treatment (subcutaneous enoxaparin [1 mg/kg twice daily for ? 5 days] overlapped and followed by warfarin [international normalized ratio = 2.0-3.0]) in patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). This post hoc analysis of AMPLIFY compared outcomes among those taking or not taking concomitant anti-platelet therapy. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent VTE or VTE-related death; the principal safety outcome was major bleeding. Of 5,365 (apixaban, n = 2,676; enoxaparin/warfarin, n = 2,689) randomized patients, 813 (apixaban, n = 402 [15%]; enoxaparin/warfarin, n = 411 [15%]) took concomitant anti-platelet therapy, of which 92% consisted of low-dose aspirin. Rates of VTE or VTE-related death were similar whether or not anti-platelet agents were taken (apixaban: 3.6 and 2.0%; enoxaparin/warfarin: 3.0 and 2.6%; anti-platelet use: relative risk [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-2.62; no anti-platelet use: RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.52-1.13); interaction p -value = 0.299. Major bleeding rates were threefold higher in those taking versus those not taking anti-platelet agents (apixaban: 1.2 and 0.4%; enoxaparin/warfarin: 4.1 and 1.4%; anti-platelet use: RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.81; no anti-platelet use: RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.63); interaction p -value = 0.924. Concomitant anti-platelet therapy produced a proportionally similar increase in major bleeding in patients randomized to apixaban or conventional therapy, but there were fewer major bleeds with apixaban.

"Determinants of Depressive Symptoms at 1 Year Following ICU Discharge in Survivors of ? 7 Days of Mechanical Ventilation: Results From the RECOVER Program, a Secondary Analysis of a Prospective Multicenter Cohort Study","2019","Background: Moderate to severe depressive symptoms occur in up to one-third of patients at 1 year following ICU discharge, negatively affecting patient outcomes. This study evaluated patient and caregiver factors associated with the development of these symptoms. Methods: This study used the Rehabilitation and Recovery in Patients after Critical Illness and Their Family Caregivers (RECOVER) Program (Phase 1) cohort of 391 patients from 10 medical/surgical university-affiliated ICUs across Canada. We determined the association between patient depressive symptoms (captured by using the Beck Depression Inventory II [BDI-II]), patient characteristics (age, sex, socioeconomic status, Charlson score, and ICU length of stay [LOS]), functional independence measure (FIM) motor subscale score, and caregiver characteristics (Caregiver Assistance Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) by using linear mixed models at time points 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: BDI-II data were available for 246 patients. Median age at ICU admission was 56 years (interquartile range, 45-65 years), 143 (58%) were male, and median ICU LOS was 19 days (interquartile range, 13-32 days). During the 12-month follow-up, 67 of 246 (27.2%) patients had a BDI-II score ? 20, indicating moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Mixed models showed worse depressive symptoms in patients with lower FIM motor subscale scores (1.1 BDI-II points per 10 FIM points), lower income status (by 3.7 BDI-II points; P =.007), and incomplete secondary education (by 3.8 BDI-II points; P =.009); a curvilinear relation with age (P =.001) was also reported, with highest BDI-II at ages 45 to 50 years. No associations were found between patient BDI-II and comorbidities (P =.92), sex (P =.25), ICU LOS (P =.51), or caregiver variables (Caregiver Assistance Scale [P =.28] and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [P =.74]). Conclusions: Increased functional dependence, lower income, and lower education are associated with increased severity of post-ICU depressive symptoms, whereas age has a curvilinear relation with symptom severity. Knowledge of risk factors may inform surveillance and targeted mental health follow-up. Early mobilization and rehabilitation aiming to improve function may serve to modify mood disorders. ? 2019 American College of Chest Physicians","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; Beck Depression Inventory; Canada; caregiver; Caregiver Assistance Scale; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; disease course; disease severity; educational status; female; follow up; Functional Independence Measure; groups by age; hospital discharge; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; phase 1 clinical trial; priority journal; prospective study; rating scale; risk factor; secondary analysis"
"Testing a deep convolutional neural network for automated hippocampus segmentation in a longitudinal sample of healthy participants","2019","Subtle changes in hippocampal volumes may occur during both physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human brain. Assessing hippocampal volumes manually is a time-consuming procedure, however, creating a need for automated segmentation methods that are both fast and reliable over time. Segmentation algorithms that employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have emerged as a promising solution for large longitudinal neuroimaging studies. However, for these novel algorithms to be useful in clinical studies, the accuracy and reproducibility should be established on independent datasets. Here, we evaluate the performance of a CNN-based hippocampal segmentation algorithm that was developed by Thyreau and colleagues – Hippodeep. We compared its segmentation outputs to manual segmentation and FreeSurfer 6.0 in a sample of 200 healthy participants scanned repeatedly at seven sites across Canada, as part of the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression consortium. The algorithm demonstrated high levels of stability and reproducibility of volumetric measures across all time points compared to the other two techniques. Although more rigorous testing in clinical populations is necessary, this approach holds promise as a viable option for tracking volumetric changes in longitudinal neuroimaging studies. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adolescent; adult; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; brain size; child; controlled study; convolutional neural network; female; hippocampus; human; human experiment; image segmentation; longitudinal study; male; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; population research; priority journal; quality control; reproducibility; scoring system; test retest reliability; volumetry"
"A Systematic Review and Evaluation of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Children and Youth with Disruptive Behavior: Rigor of Development and Recommendations for Use","2019","Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) provide a framework for evidence-based practice; however, few studies have assessed the methodological quality of CPGs relevant to child and youth mental health. This study was a systematic review of CPGs for the assessment, prevention and treatment of disruptive behavior, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD) and aggression in children and youth. Systematic review identified 29 CPGs meeting inclusion criteria that were appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) validated tool. Twenty-two guidelines addressed ADHD, 2 CD, 1 ODD, 2 for Behavior Disorders collectively and 2 for Aggression. Among the 29 guidelines, two that were developed for ADHD (NICE 2013a; Spanish Ministry of Health, 2010) and one practice guideline developed for CD (NICE 2013b) met high quality criteria; one guideline for behavior disorders (Gorman et al. 2015), two for ADHD (AAP 2011a, b; SIGN 2009a, b, c, d, e), and two for aggression (Knapp et al. 2012; Scotto Rosato et al. 2012a, b) met minimum quality criteria. Findings from this review provide important information for clinicians and organizations who want to utilize guidelines to implement best-practice clinical services for children and youth with disruptive behavior. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Beyond cost-effectiveness, morbidity and mortality: A comprehensive evaluation of priority setting for HIV programming in Uganda","2019","Background: While there has been progress in controlling the HIV epidemic, HIV still remains a disease of global concern. Some of the progress has been attributed to increased public awareness and uptake of public health interventions, as well as increased access to anti- retroviral treatment and the prevention of vertical HIV transmission. These interventions would not have been possible without substantial investments in HIV programs. However, donor fatigue introduces the need for low income countries to maximize the benefits of the available resources. This necessitates identification of priorities that should be funded. Evaluating prioritization processes would enable decision makers to assess the effectiveness of their processes, thereby designing intervention strategies. To date most evaluations have focused on cost-benefit analyses, which overlooks additional critical impacts of priority setting decisions. Kapiriri & Martin (2010) developed and validated a comprehensive framework for evaluating PS in low income countries. The objective of this paper report findings from a comprehensive evaluation of priority setting for HIV in Uganda, using the framework; and to identify lessons of good practice and areas for improvement. Methods: This was a qualitative study based on forty interviews with decision makers and policy document review. Data were analysed using INVIVO 10, and based on the parameters in Kapiriri et al's evaluation framework. Results: We found that HIV enjoys political support, which contributes to the availability of resources, strong planning institutions, and participatory prioritization process based on some criteria. Some of the identified limitations included; undue donor and political influence, priorities not being publicized, and lack of mechanisms for appealing the decisions. HIV prioritization had both positive and negative impacts on the health system. Conclusions: The framework facilitated a more comprehensive evaluation of HIV priority setting. While there were successful areas, the process could be strengthened by minimizing undue influence of external actors, and support the legitimate institutions to set priorities and implement them. These should also institute mechanisms for publicizing the decisions, appeals and increased accountability. While this paper looked at HIV, the framework is flexible enough to be used in evaluating priority setting for other health programs within similar context. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cost benefit analysis; decision making; developing country; epidemiology; evaluation study; health care delivery; health care planning; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; morbidity; mortality; poverty; qualitative research; social responsibility; standards; Uganda; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Health Planning; Health Priorities; Health Resources; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Morbidity; Mortality; Poverty; Qualitative Research; Social Responsibility; Uganda"

"Attend: A Two-Pronged Trial to Eliminate No Shows in Diagnostic Imaging at a Community-Based Hospital","2019","Purpose: Diagnostic imaging (DI) at Niagara Health, like other hospitals, experiences challenges with patients who do not attend their scheduled appointments, resulting in a “no show.” Reducing no show percentages presents an opportunity to improve upon wait lists within specific modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to reduce the loss of productivity for this high-demand resource. Aim: To reduce the MRI no-show percent in DI at two community hospitals from 6.5% to 5% through patient engagement via mailed reminder letters and education at the primary care level. Methods: Our two-pronged approach included interventions at community hospitals and at the primary care level. Reminder letters were mailed to patients with their appointment time and other pertinent information to allow for an increased number of patients reminded about appointments and a second means of reminder. At the primary care level, an information package was sent to various independent physicians for distribution to patients requiring an MRI scan, outlining benefits of showing up to the scheduled appointment to educate patients and improve attendance at DI. Results: The mailing letter resulted in a significant reduction from 7.1% to 6.3% in overall no shows across two community hospitals (P =.04). The true effect of the letter was likely masked by increased wait times during the study period, which correlates with increased no-show percentages. The first trial of the information pamphlet among five practices for 1 month resulted in a nonsignificant reduction of no shows from 19% to 3% (P =.125). The second trial among 19 practices for 3 months led to a significant reduction of no shows from 7.7% to 4.2% (P =.007). Conclusions: Both the methods, the mailing letter and patient-information pamphlet, provide promising results in regard to reducing the no-show percentage among patients seen in DI for MRI appointments. ? 2018","adult; article; diagnostic imaging; education; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient information; physician; primary medical care; total quality management"
"Severe maternal morbidity surveillance: Monitoring pregnant women at high risk for prolonged hospitalisation and death","2019","Background: There is no international consensus on the definition and components of severe maternal morbidity (SMM). Objectives: To propose a comprehensive definition of SMM, to create an empirically justified list of SMM types and subtypes, and to use this to examine SMM in Canada. Methods: Severe maternal morbidity was defined as a set of heterogeneous maternal conditions known to be associated with severe illness and with prolonged hospitalisation or high case fatality. Candidate SMM types/subtypes were evaluated using information on all hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Quebec), 2006-2015. SMM rates for 2012-2016 were quantified as a composite and as SMM types/subtypes. Rate ratios and population attributable fractions (PAF) associated with overall and specific SMM types/subtypes were estimated in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS?>?7?days) and case fatality. Results: There were 22?799 cases of SMM subtypes (among 1?418?545 deliveries) that were associated with a prolonged LOS or high case fatality. Between 2012 and 2016, the composite SMM rate was 16.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.9, 16.3) per 1000 deliveries. Severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (514.6 per 100?000 deliveries), and severe postpartum haemorrhage (433.2 per 100?000 deliveries) were the most common SMM types, while case fatality rates among SMM subtypes were highest among women who had cardiac arrest and resuscitation (241.1 per 1000), hepatic failure (147.1 per 1000), dialysis (67.6 per 1000), and cerebrovascular accident/stroke (51.0 per 1000). The PAF for prolonged hospital stay related to SMM was 17.8% (95% CI 17.3, 18.3), while the PAF for maternal death associated with SMM was 88.0% (95% CI 74.6, 94.4). Conclusions: The proposed definition of SMM and associated list of SMM subtypes could be used for standardised SMM surveillance, with rate ratios and PAFs associated with specific SMM types/subtypes serving to inform clinical practice and public health policy. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The impact of prior season vaccination on subsequent influenza vaccine effectiveness to prevent influenza-related hospitalizations over 4 influenza seasons in Canada","2019","Background: Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of negative associations between prior influenza vaccines and subsequent influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), depending on season and strain. We investigated this association over 4 consecutive influenza seasons (2011-2012 through 2014-2015) in Canada. Methods: Using a matched test-negative design, laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and matched test-negative controls admitted to hospitals were enrolled. Patients were stratified into 4 groups according to influenza vaccine history (not vaccinated current and prior season [referent], vaccinated prior season only, vaccinated current season only, and vaccinated both current and prior season). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate VE; prior vaccine impact was assessed each season for overall effect and effect stratified by age (<65 years, ?65 years) and type/subtype (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, influenza B). Results: Overall, mainly nonsignificant associations were observed. Trends of nonsignificant decreased VE among patients repeatedly vaccinated in both prior and current season relative to the current season only were observed in the A/H3N2-dominant seasons of 2012-2013 and 2014-2015. Conversely, in 2011-2012, during which B viruses circulated, and in 2013-2014, when A/H1N1 circulated, being vaccinated in both seasons tended to result in a high VE in the current season against the dominant circulating subtype. Conclusions: Prior vaccine impact on subsequent VE among Canadian inpatients was mainly nonsignificant. Even in circumstances where we observed a trend of negative impact, being repeatedly vaccinated was still more effective than not receiving the current season's vaccine. These findings favor continuation of annual influenza vaccination recommendations, particularly in older adults. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT01517191. ? 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

"Single- or double-anastomosis duodenal switch versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as a revisional procedure for sleeve gastrectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis","2019","Background: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG)is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide. There is currently no consensus on which revisional procedure is best after an initial SG. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety between single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass (SADI)or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS)versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)as a revisional procedure for SG. Setting: University Hospital, Canada. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed were searched up to August 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared SADI or BPD-DS with RYGB as a revisional bariatric procedure for SG. Primary outcome was absolute percentage of total weight loss. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, adverse events, and improvement or resolution of co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia). Pooled mean differences were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. Results: Six retrospective cohort studies involving 377 patients met the inclusion criteria. The SADI/BPD-DS group achieved a significantly higher percentage of total weight loss compared with RYGB by 10.22% (95% confidence interval, ?17.46 to ?2.97; P =.006). However, there was significant baseline equivalence bias with 4 studies reporting higher initial body mass index (BMI)in the SADI/BPD-DS group. There were no significant differences in length of stay, adverse events, or improvement of co-morbidities between the 2 groups. Conclusion: SADI, BPD-DS, and RYGB are safe and efficacious revisional surgeries for SG. Both SADI and RYGB are efficacious in lowering initial BMI but there is more evidence for excellent weight loss outcomes with the conversion to BPD-DS when the starting BMI is high. Further randomized trials are required for definitive conclusions. ? 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery","adverse event; Article; biliopancreatic bypass; biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch; body weight loss; Canada; clinical effectiveness; Cochrane Library; cohort analysis; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; Embase; general condition improvement; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; length of stay; Medline; meta analysis; patient safety; priority journal; retrospective study; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; single anastomosis duodeno ileal bypass; systematic review"
"Clinical Practice Guidelines: Tools to Support High Quality Patient Care","2019","Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are systematically-developed statements aimed to assist decision-making relevant to the clinical encounter, to inform clinical policy, and to strengthen health care systems. The development of a CPG begins with the identification of a problem for which evidence-informed guidance is required. Interdisciplinary panels work to craft – and then execute - a protocol that will serve as a blueprint for the development process. It includes the scope of the project; who is involved and how they will function; the specific systematic review and consensus methods that will be used to ensure quality recommendations and to mitigate bias. CPGs should undergo a formal review of relevant stakeholders and results of this review, actions taken by the panel, and the final recommendations should be documented in the final CPG report. Dissemination activities, including the use of social media platforms, and more purposefully designed implementation activities are required to optimize the adoption of recommendations. Methods to keep recommendations current are required to ensure on-going validity and credibility of the recommendations. Two tools, AGREE II, and the AGREE REX, provide quality criteria related to the whole CPG development process and the CPG recommendations, respectively. The AGREE II is comprised of 23 items within 6 CPG quality domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. The AGREE REX is comprised of 9 items within 3 CPG Recommendation quality domains: clinical applicability, values and preferences, and implementability. CPGs are important tools to an overall quality agenda. ? 2018","clinical decision making; consensus; health care policy; health care quality; health care system; human; metastasis; patient care; practice guideline; Review; risk benefit analysis; social media; stakeholder engagement; systematic review (topic); validity; health care quality; patient care; procedures; standards; Patient Care; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality Assurance, Health Care"
"Maternal body mass index and smoking during pregnancy do not affect the proportional sexual dimorphism for birth weight – an analysis of the german perinatal survey","2019","Background: Male sex has been reported as a risk factor for perinatal mortality. It can be hypothesized that smoking during pregnancy and low maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) would lead to a higher proportion of growth restricted male compared to female newborns. The objective of the study was to analyze sex-specific differences in birth weight related to smoking and maternal BMI. Method: Data on maternal and newborn characteristics were obtained from the German Perinatal Survey. We analyzed data on 508,926 singleton pregnancies that had been collected in eight German federal states between 1998 and 2000. Women were classified according to the number of cigarettes smoked per day (non-smokers, 1–7, 8–14, ? 15) and by maternal BMI (&lt; 18.5, 18.5–24.99, 25–29.99, ? 30 kg/m?) at the first obstetric consultation. Newborns were classified as small, appropriate, or large for gestational age based on birth weight below the 10 th , between 10 th and 90 th , or above the 90 th percentile, respectively. The proportional sexual dimorphism (PSD) was calculated as the female mean divided by the male mean ×100. Results: Smoking is related to a decrease in mean birth weight and an increase of in the SGA rate. Maternal BMI is positively related to the birth weight. However, the proportional sexual dimorphism for birth weight was not different with smoking or BMI. Conclusion: Smoking during pregnancy is related to lower birth weight, and high BMI is related to higher birth weight with no change in PSD. ? 2018 E.

"Immunotherapy with check-point inhibitors (CPI) in adult malignancies: A protocol for the systematic review of the quality of economic analyses","2019","Background: Immuno-oncology, and in particular, check-point inhibitors (CPIs), have led to a paradigm shift in the field of cancer care. The cost of new drug development is high, and many novel agents in oncology are significantly more expensive than older agents. Therefore, healthcare funders have factored measures of cost-effectiveness into decisions concerning drug reimbursement and incorporation of new agents into treatment algorithms. The methodology of cost-effectiveness evaluations, however, is less rigorously applied than those evaluating clinical efficacy and safety data. Thus, in spite of many regulatory bodies having approved CPIs based on existing economic analyses, to date, there has not been a systematic evaluation of the quality of health economic studies conducted on this new class of agents. Therefore, we propose to systematically review the methodologic and reporting quality of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies assessing CPIs to alternate established therapies, other immuno-oncology regimens, or placebo, in adults with malignancies. Methods/design: The systematic review will include all published economic evaluations of CPIs compared with at least one other treatment in adult patients with solid or hematologic malignancies. A search will be performed to identify relevant studies in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cost-effectiveness Analysis Registry, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, and the NIHR-HTA database. The titles and abstracts of all identified studies will be independently reviewed by two reviewers, who will then assess the full text of all articles deemed to meet eligibility criteria. Assessed articles will be screened for compliance with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) criteria. The association, with CHEERS criteria, of the journal impact factor, publication year, funding source, tumor site, trial or model-based study, and CPIs studied, will then be assessed. Discussion: The systematic review will aim to provide an overview of the quality of economic analyses evaluating CPIs for the treatment of malignancies in adult patients. Any systemic or recurrent deficiencies in methodological or reporting quality will be described and used to inform recommendations for improved reporting of economic analyses. Systematic review registration: This review will not be registered with PROSPERO, it does not meet the eligibility criterion of addressing an outcome of the direct patient or clinical relevance. ? 2019 The Author(s).","atezolizumab; avelumab; checkpoint kinase inhibitor; durvalumab; ipilimumab; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; ticilimumab; cancer immunotherapy; clinical outcome; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; economic aspect; evidence based medicine; health economics; hematologic malignancy; human; journal impact factor; neoplasm; pharmacoeconomics; priority journal; Review; systematic review"
"Taste changes in children with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","2019","Background: Objectives were to describe bothersome self-reported changes in taste in pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) patients and to identify patient and treatment-related factors associated with bothersome taste changes. Methods: We prospectively enrolled children and adolescents with cancer or pediatric HSCT recipients 8–18?years of age from three groups: inpatients receiving cancer treatments; outpatients in maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); and outpatients in survivorship. Bothersome changes in taste was self-reported using the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi); nausea was self-reported using the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool (PeNAT). Results: Among the 502 children included, 226 (45.0%) reported bothersome taste changes and 48 (9.6%) reported severely bothersome taste changes. In multiple regression, factors independently associated with severely bothersome taste changes were: inpatients receiving cancer treatments vs outpatients in survivorship (odds ratio (OR) 12.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.50–222.27), ALL in maintenance vs outpatients in survivorship (OR 7.43, 95% CI 1.06–147.77), current nausea (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.04–2.42), vomiting (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.06–4.38), and first language not English (OR 2.09, 95% CI 0.97–4.28). Conclusions: We found that 45% of children with cancer and pediatric HSCT recipients reported bothersome changes in taste and these were severely bothersome in 9.6% of children. Inpatients receiving cancer treatment, those experiencing more nausea and vomiting and children whose first language was not English were at greater risk of severely bothersome changes in taste. Future work should evaluate systematic symptom screening in clinical practice and identify interventions focused on addressing bothersome taste changes. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; adult; Article; brain tumor; child; childhood cancer; controlled study; female; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; leukemia; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; nausea; Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool; priority journal; prospective study; quality assessment tool; school child; solid malignant neoplasm; survivorship; Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool; taste; vomiting; young adult; complication; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; neoplasm; pathology; physiology; procedures; taste; taste disorder; transplantation conditioning; Adolescent; Child; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Taste; Taste Disorders; Transplantation Conditioning"
"The state of health advocacy training in postgraduate medical education: a scoping review","2019","Context: Health advocacy is an essential component of postgraduate medical education, and is part of many physician competency frameworks such as the Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) roles. There is little consensus about how advocacy should be taught and assessed in the postgraduate context. There are no consolidated guides to assist in the design and implementation of postgraduate health advocacy curricula. Objectives: This scoping review aims to identify and analyse existing literature pertaining to health advocacy education and assessment in postgraduate medicine. We specifically sought to summarise themes from the literature that may be useful to medical educators to inform further health advocacy curriculum interventions. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and ERIC were searched using MeSH (medical student headings) and non-MeSH search terms. Additional articles were found using forward snowballing. The grey literature search included Google and relevant stakeholder websites, regulatory bodies, physician associations, government agencies and academic institutions. We followed a stepwise scoping review methodology, followed by thematic analysis using an inductive approach. Results: Of the 123 documents reviewed in full, five major themes emerged: (i) conceptions of health advocacy have evolved towards advocating with rather than for patients, communities and populations; (ii) longitudinal curricula were less common but appeared the most promising, often linked to scholarly or policy objectives; (iii) hands-on, immersive opportunities build competence and confidence; (iv) community-identified needs and partnerships are increasingly considered in designing curriculum, and (v) resident-led and motivated programmes appear to engage residents and allow for achievement of stated outcomes. There remain significant challenges to assessment of health advocacy competencies, and assessment tools for macro-level health advocacy were notably absent. Conclusions: There is considerable heterogeneity in the way health advocacy is taught, assessed and incorporated into postgraduate curricula across programmes and disciplines. We consolidated recommendations from the literature to inform further health advocacy curriculum design, implementation and assessment. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education","achievement; adult; conception; curriculum; Embase; female; government; grey literature; human; male; medical student; Medline; postgraduate education; resident; review; systematic review; thematic analysis"
"Predictors of mammographic density among women with a strong family history of breast cancer","2019","Background: Mammographic density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. In the general population, mammographic density can be modified by various exposures; whether this is true for women a strong family history is not known. Thus, we evaluated the association between reproductive, hormonal, and lifestyle risk factors and mammographic density among women with a strong family history of breast cancer but no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Methods: We included 97 premenopausal and 59 postmenopausal women (age range: 27-68 years). Risk factor data was extracted from the research questionnaire closest in time to the mammogram performed nearest to enrollment. The Cumulus software was used to measure percent density, dense area, and non-dense area for each mammogram. Multivariate generalized linear models were used to evaluate the relationships between breast cancer risk factors and measures of mammographic density, adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: Among premenopausal women, those who had two live births had a mean percent density of 28.8% vs. 41.6% among women who had one live birth (P=0.04). Women with a high body weight had a lower mean percent density compared to women with a low body weight among premenopausal (17.6% vs. 33.2%; P=0.0006) and postmenopausal women (8.7% vs. 14.7%; P=0.04). Among premenopausal women, those who smoked for 14 years or longer had a lower mean dense area compared to women who smoked for a shorter duration (25.3cm2 vs. 53.1cm2; P=0.002). Among postmenopausal women, former smokers had a higher mean percent density (19.5% vs. 10.8%; P=0.003) and dense area (26.9% vs. 16.4%; P=0.01) compared to never smokers. After applying the Bonferroni correction, the association between body weight and percent density among premenopausal women remained statistically significant. Conclusions: In this cohort of women with a strong family history of breast cancer, body weight was associated with mammographic density. These findings suggest that mammographic density may explain the underlying relationship between some of these risk factors and breast cancer risk, and lend support for the inclusion of mammographic density into risk prediction models. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; Article; body weight; breast cancer; breast density; cancer risk; cohort analysis; family history; female; human; lifestyle; live birth; major clinical study; mammography; postmenopause; premenopause; smoking; body weight; breast density; breast tumor; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; family health; genetics; mammography; middle aged; parity; reproductive health; risk factor; statistical model; tumor suppressor gene; Adult; Aged; Body Weight; Breast Density; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ex-Smokers; Family Health; Female; Genes, BRCA1; Genes, BRCA2; Humans; Life Style; Linear Models; Mammography; Middle Aged; Parity; Postmenopause; Premenopause; Reproductive Health; Risk Factors; Smokers"
"MetaGxData: Clinically Annotated Breast, Ovarian and Pancreatic Cancer Datasets and their Use in Generating a Multi-Cancer Gene Signature","2019","A wealth of transcriptomic and clinical data on solid tumours are under-utilized due to unharmonized data storage and format. We have developed the MetaGxData package compendium, which includes manually-curated and standardized clinical, pathological, survival, and treatment metadata across breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer data. MetaGxData is the largest compendium of curated transcriptomic data for these cancer types to date, spanning 86 datasets and encompassing 15,249 samples. Open access to standardized metadata across cancer types promotes use of their transcriptomic and clinical data in a variety of cross-tumour analyses, including identification of common biomarkers, and assessing the validity of prognostic signatures. Here, we demonstrate that MetaGxData is a flexible framework that facilitates meta-analyses by using it to identify common prognostic genes in ovarian and breast cancer. Furthermore, we use the data compendium to create the first gene signature that is prognostic in a meta-analysis across 3 cancer types. These findings demonstrate the potential of MetaGxData to serve as an important resource in oncology research, and provide a foundation for future development of cancer-specific compendia. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Oxidative stress, eryptosis and anemia: a pivotal mechanistic nexus in systemic diseases","2019","The average lifespan of circulating erythrocytes usually exceeds hundred days. Prior to that, however, erythrocytes may be exposed to oxidative stress in the circulation which could cause injury and trigger their suicidal death or eryptosis. Oxidative stress activates Ca 2+ -permeable nonselective cation channels in the cell membrane, thus, stimulating Ca 2+ entry and subsequent cell membrane scrambling resulting in phosphatidylserine exposure and activation of Ca 2+ -sensitive K + channels leading to K + exit, hyperpolarization, Cl ? exit, and ultimately cell shrinkage due to loss of KCl and osmotically driven water. While the mechanistic link between oxidative stress and anemia remains ill-defined, several diseases such as diabetes, hepatic failure, malignancy, chronic kidney disease and inflammation have been identified to display both increased oxidative stress as well as eryptosis. Recent compelling evidence suggests that oxidative stress is an important perpetrator in accelerating erythrocyte loss in different systemic conditions and an underlying mechanism for anemia associated with these pathological states. In the present review, we discuss the role of oxidative stress in reducing erythrocyte survival and provide novel insights into the possible use of antioxidants as putative antieryptotic and antianemic agents in a variety of systemic diseases. ? 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies","2 [[2 (isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl]amino] 4 [[2 methoxy 4 [4 (4 methyl 1 piperazinyl) 1 piperidinyl]phenyl]amino] 1,3,5 triazine; acetylcysteine; alpha tocopherol; antianemic agent; antioxidant; artesunate; ascorbic acid; bilirubin; blebbistatin; calcium ion; deferiprone; deferoxamine; glutathione peroxidase; hemoglobin; hydroxytyrosol; iron; lipid hydroperoxide; peroxiredoxin 2; phlorizin; prostaglandin synthase; reactive oxygen metabolite; recombinant erythropoietin; resveratrol; superoxide dismutase; teriflunomide; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; thymol; volasertib; ion channel; aging; anemia; antioxidant activity; autoimmune disease; beta thalassemia; chronic kidney failure; dyslipidemia; eryptosis; erythrocyte lifespan; erythrocyte transfusion; erythropoiesis; heart failure; hematologic disease; human; hypertension; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; ion permeability; iron deficiency anemia; liver disease; malaria; malignant neoplasm; molecular mechanics; myelodysplastic syndrome; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; Review; signal transduction; systemic disease; anemia; animal; drug effect; erythrocyte; hematologic disease; ion transport; metabolism; pathology; Anemia; Animals; Eryptosis; Erythrocytes; Hematologic Diseases; Humans; Ion Channels; Ion Transport; Oxidative Stress; Signal Transduction"
"Self-reported factors contributing to fatigue and its management in adolescents and adults with cerebral palsy","2019","Purpose: To explore the self-reported factors that generate fatigue and to describe fatigue self-management strategies from the perspectives of adolescents and adults with cerebral palsy (CP). Materials and methods: Text responses to open-ended questions of the Fatigue Impact and Severity Self-Assessment from 160 participants (mean age 22.4 years) across all GMFCS levels were coded using inductive line-by-line coding and then grouped together to generate larger categories for each question. Frequency counts associated with each category were then summarized descriptively by Gross Motor Function Classification System level. Results: The most commonly reported contributors to fatigue included the following: activity-related factors, general demands of life, sleep/rest, general health concerns, CP-related factors, mental health concerns, and environmental factors. The top five strategies participants reported to manage fatigue included rest or relaxation, sleeping or napping, changing or limiting their activities, being physically active, or using specific adaptations or assistive devices. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that there are potentially modifiable factors, including activity level and sleep, that significantly contribute to fatigue for persons with CP; these could form the basis of interventions targeted at the prevention and management of fatigue.Implications for Rehabilitation As individuals with cerebral palsy who are physically active experience significant fatigue, clinicians need to address fatigue to enable these individuals to reap the health benefits of physical activity. Providing education and support to integrate self-management techniques, such as planning and pacing, may be an effective long-term strategy to support individuals to complete highly valued tasks. Interventions targeting modifiable fatigue-generating factors such as activity level, sleep, and mental health concerns are needed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Survey of multinational surgical management practices in tetralogy of Fallot","2019","Background A wide variety of surgical strategies are used in tetralogy of Fallot repair. We sought to describe the international contemporary practice patterns for surgical management of tetralogy of Fallot.Methods Surgeons from 18 international paediatric cardiac surgery centres (representing over 1800 tetralogy of Fallot cases/year) completed a Research Electronic Data Capture-based survey. Participating countries include: China (4), India (2), Nepal (1), Korea (1), Indonesia (1), Saudi Arabia (3), Japan (1), Turkey (1), Australia (1), United States of America (2), and Canada (1). Summary measures were reported as means and counts (percentages). Responses were weighted based on case volume/centre.Results Primary repair is the prevalent strategy (83%) with variation in age at elective repair (range). Approximately 47% of sites use patient age as a factor in determining the strategy, with age 3 months being the common cut-off for staged repair. In addition, patient weight of 3 kg is an indication for staged repair in 80% of participating institutions. Trans-atrial ventricular septal defect closure is the preferred approach in 62% of sites. Approximately 70% of responders reported using pulmonary valve z-score to guide right ventricular outflow tract management technique with the most prevalent cut-off for annulus preservation being a z-score of -3. Estimated incidence of annulus preservation is 53%. Minimal trans-annular incision is performed in >90% of all trans-annular repairs.Conclusions In this cohort representing 11 countries, there is variation in tetralogy of Fallot surgical management with no consensus on standard of practice. A large international prospective cohort study would allow analysis of impact of underlying anatomy and repair strategy on early and late outcomes. ?

"Nutritional management of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency in pediatric patients in Canada: A survey of dietitians' current practices","2019","Background: Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is one of 31 targeted inherited metabolic diseases (IMD) for the Canadian Inherited Metabolic Diseases Research Network (CIMDRN). Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment through newborn screening has gradually shifted treatment goals from the prevention of disabling complications to the optimization of long term outcomes. However, clinical evidence demonstrates that subtle suboptimal neurocognitive outcomes are present in the early and continuously diet-treated population with PAH deficiency. This may be attributed to variation in blood phenylalanine levels to outside treatment range and this, in turn, is possibly due to a combination of factors; disease severity, dietary noncompliance and differences in practice related to the management of PAH deficiency. One of CIMDRN's goals is to understand current practices in the diagnosis and management of PAH deficiency in the pediatric population, from the perspective of both health care providers and patients/families. Objectives: We investigated Canadian metabolic dietitians' perspectives on the nutritional management of children with PAH deficiency, awareness of recently published North American treatment and nutritional guidelines in relation to PAH deficiency, and nutritional care practices within and outside these guidelines. Methods: We invited 33 dietitians to participate in a survey, to ascertain their use of recently published guidelines and their practices in relation to the nutritional care of pediatric patients with PAH deficiency. Results: We received 19 responses (59% response rate). All participants reported awareness of published guidelines for managing PAH deficiency. To classify disease severity, 89% of dietitians reported using pre-treatment blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels, alone or in combination with other factors. 74% of dietitians reported using blood Phe levels ?360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL) as the criterion for initiating a Phe-restricted diet. All respondents considered 120-360 μmol/L (2-6 mg/dL) as the optimal treatment range for blood Phe in children 0-9 years old, but there was less agreement on blood Phe targets for older children. Most dietitians reported similar approaches to diet assessment and counseling: monitoring growth trends, use of 3 day diet records for intake analysis, individualization of diet goals, counseling patients to count grams of dietary natural protein or milligrams of dietary Phe, and monitoring blood Phe, tyrosine and ferritin. Conclusion: While Canadian dietitians' practices in managing pediatric PAH deficiency are generally aligned with those of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), and with the associated treatment and nutritional guidelines from Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (GMDI), variation in many aspects of care reflects ongoing uncertainty and a need for robust evidence. ? 2019 The Author(s).","ferritin; phenylalanine; tyrosine; Article; Canada; controlled study; diet therapy; dietary intake; dietitian attitude; disease classification; disease severity; growth rate; health care practice; human; individualization; medical record; monitoring; nutrient management; nutritional assessment; nutritional counseling; patient compliance; pediatric patient; phenylketonuria; practice guideline; protein restriction; adolescent; child; dietitian; female; infant; male; newborn; newborn screening; phenylketonuria; preschool child; procedures; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Adolescent; Canada; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Neonatal Screening; Nutritionists; Phenylketonurias; Surveys and Questionnaires"

"Health Care Workers in the setting of the ""Arab Spring"": A scoping review for the Lancet-AUB Commission on Syria","2019","Background ""Health Care Workers in Conflict Areas"" emerged as one of the priority themes for a Lancet Commission addressing health in conflict. The objective of our study was to conduct a scoping review on health workers in the setting of the Syrian conflict, addressing four topics of interest: violence against health care workers, education, practicing in conflict setting, and migration. Methods Considering the likelihood of scarcity of data, we broadened the scope of the scoping review to include indirect evidence on health care workers from other countries affected by the ""Arab Spring"". We electronically searched six electronic databases. We conducted descriptive analysis of the general characteristics of the included papers. We also used the results of this scoping review to build an evidence gap map. Results Out of the 11 165 identified citations, 136 met our eligibility criteria. The majority of the articles tackled the issue of violence against health care workers (63%) followed by practicing in conflict setting (19%), migration (17%) and education (10%). Countries in focus of most articles were: Syria (35%), Iraq (33%), and Bahrain (29%). News, editorials, commentaries and opinion pieces made up 81% of all included papers, while primary studies made up only 9%. All the primary studies identified in this review were conducted on Iraq. Most of the articles about violence against health care workers were on Bahrain, followed by Syria and Iraq. The first and corresponding authors were most frequently affiliated with institutions from non-Arab countries (79% and 79% respectively). Conclusions Research evidence on health care workers in the setting of the ""Arab Spring"" is scarce. This review and the gap map can inform the research agendas of funders and researchers working in the field of health care workers in conflict setting. More well-designed primary studies are needed to inform the decisions of policymakers and other interested parties. ? 2019 The Author(s) JoGH.","article; Bahrain; education; health care personnel; human; human experiment; Iraq; scientist; spring; Syrian Arab Republic; systematic review; violence; Syrian Arab Republic; warfare; Health Personnel; Humans; Syria; Warfare"
"‘It takes two to tango’: HIV non-disclosure and the neutralization of victimhood*","2019","There is a rich and fulsome literature on victims and the processes by which certain groups or individuals come to be constructed as victims. Less attention has been paid to the rhetorical moves employed as counter strategies by groups who seek to challenge victim status and the use of the ‘victim’ label for particular groups. Using the debates around the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure as a case study, the aim of this paper is to contribute towards a better understanding of efforts to deny or neutralize victimhood. The paper identifies several strategies utilized by individuals and groups, the object of which is to raise questions about the appropriateness of a criminal response to HIV non-disclosure by constructing those who have had intimate encounters with HIV non-disclosers as equally responsible for their circumstances rather than as victims of non-disclosers. ?

"The efficacy of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in girls and women living with human immunodeficiency virus","2019","Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is safe and efficacious in women without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although good immunogenicity has been observed in women living with HIV (WLWH), efficacy data in this population are needed. Methods We enrolled 420 females aged ?9 years (range, 9-65) living with HIV. Participants were to receive 3 doses of qHPV vaccine (0/2/6 months). The main endpoint was vaccine failure (ie, incident persistent qHPV infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher [CIN2+], or genital warts). We compared these rates to published rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated women without HIV as well as unvaccinated WLWH. Results Among 279 eligible women, median follow-up was 2 years. In the intention-to-treat population, the incidence rate (IR) of persistent qHPV (HPV6/11/16/18) was 2.3 per 100 person-years (/100PY) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.1), and IR of genital warts was 2.3/100PY (95% CI, 1.2-4.1). In the per-protocol efficacy population, IR of persistent qHPV was 1.0/100PY (95% CI, 0.3-2.6) and of genital warts was 1.0/100PY (95% CI, 0.3-2.5). No cases of CIN2+ occurred. Reported rates of qHPV-related infection and disease within vaccinated women without HIV, unvaccinated women without HIV, and vaccinated WLWH: 0.1 (95% CI, 0.02-0.03), 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1-2.0), and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.2-3.4) /100PY, respectively. The rate of persistent qHPV among vaccinated WLWH was lower than among unvaccinated WLWH (2.3 vs 6.0/100PY). Conclusions Vaccinated WLWH may be at higher risk for vaccine failure than vaccinated women without HIV. However, overall rates of vaccine failure were low, and rates of persistent qHPV were lower than in unvaccinated WLWH. ?

"c-Myb Exacerbates Atherosclerosis through Regulation of Protective IgM-Producing Antibody-Secreting Cells","2019","Mechanisms that govern transcriptional regulation of inflammation in atherosclerosis remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the nuclear transcription factor c-Myb as an important mediator of atherosclerotic disease in mice. Atherosclerosis-prone animals fed a diet high in cholesterol exhibit increased levels of c-Myb in the bone marrow. Use of mice that either harbor a c-Myb hypomorphic allele or where c-Myb has been preferentially deleted in B cell lineages revealed that c-Myb potentiates atherosclerosis directly through its effects on B lymphocytes. Reduced c-Myb activity prevents the expansion of atherogenic B2 cells yet associates with increased numbers of IgM-producing antibody-secreting cells (IgM-ASCs) and elevated levels of atheroprotective oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)-specific IgM antibodies. Transcriptional profiling revealed that c-Myb has a limited effect on B cell function but is integral in maintaining B cell progenitor populations in the bone marrow. Thus, targeted disruption of c-Myb beneficially modulates the complex biology of B cells in cardiovascular disease. Shikatani et al. demonstrate that the nuclear transcription factor c-Myb exacerbates experimental atherosclerosis directly through its effects on B lymphocytes. Paradoxically, c-Myb promotes B2 cell development yet limits numbers of IgM-producing antibody-secreting cells and levels of atheroprotective OxLDL-specific IgM antibodies. ? 2019 The Authors","immunoglobulin M; immunoglobulin M antibody; oxidized low density lipoprotein; protein c Myb; RNA; adoptive transfer; allele; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody secreting cell; Article; atherosclerosis; B lymphocyte; bone marrow; cell culture; cell isolation; chimera; controlled study; disease exacerbation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; flow cytometry; histology; lipid diet; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; parabiosis; pre B lymphocyte; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation"
"Validation of an algorithmic nutritional approach in children undergoing chemotherapy for cancer","2019","Background: Undernutrition impacts clinical outcome adversely in children with cancer. This study aimed to validate a nutritional algorithm with specific application to the low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting. Procedure: Fifty children with a new diagnosis of cancer were enrolled in this randomized interventional study. Weight, height/length, and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) were measured at baseline. The study arm was administered nutritional care as per the algorithm and the control arm received the institutional standard of care. Weight was monitored regularly and MUAC was repeated after 3 months. Children were classified based on weight for height if <2 years of age or body mass index if ?2 years, as normal, wasted, and severely wasted. The algorithmic approach comprised administration of oral supplements, nasogastric feeds, and/or parenteral nutrition based on objective assessment of the nutritional status. Results: Fifty patients were analyzed (study: 25, control: 25). Four in the study arm (16%) and six in the control arm (24%) had wasting at baseline. MUAC was <5th percentile in 15 (60%) and 13 (52%) patients in the study and control arms, respectively. At the end of 3 months, the median increment in weight was 0.8?kg (interquartile range [IQR]: –0.02; 2.00) and 0.0?kg (IQR: –0.70; 1.25) in the study and control arms, respectively (P?=.153). The median increment in MUAC was 1.20?cm (IQR: 0.10; 2.30) and 0.00?cm (IQR: –0.50; 1.10) in the study and control arms, respectively (P?=.020). Conclusions: The application of an algorithm designed for use in LMICs resulted in significant improvement in nutritional status, as measured by MUAC. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; algorithm; anthropometry; arm circumference; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; child; childhood obesity; clinical article; controlled study; diet supplementation; dietary intake; enteric feeding; erythrocyte concentrate; erythrocyte transfusion; Ewing sarcoma; febrile neutropenia; female; follow up; high income country; Hodgkin disease; human; intervention study; low income country; male; nephroblastoma; nose feeding; nutrition; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; open study; outcome assessment; parallel design; parenteral nutrition; pilot study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; thrombocyte transfusion; total parenteral nutrition"
"Prenatal depression and birth mode sequentially mediate maternal education's influence on infant sleep duration","2019","Rationale: Sleep duration is critical to growth, learning, and immune function development in infancy. Strategies to ensure that national recommendations for sleep duration in infants are met require knowledge of perinatal factors that affect infant sleep. Objectives: To investigate the mechanistic pathways linking maternal education and infant sleep. Methods: An observational study was conducted on 619 infants whose mothers were enrolled at the Edmonton site of the CHILD birth cohort. Infant sleep duration at three months was assessed using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Maternal education was collected via maternal report. Prenatal and postnatal depression scores were obtained from the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Birth records and maternal report were the source of covariate measures. Mediation analysis (PROCESS v3.0)was used to examine the indirect effects of maternal education on infant sleep duration mediated through prenatal depression and birth mode. Measurements and main results: At three months of age, infants slept on average 14.1 h. Lower maternal education and prenatal depression were associated with significantly shorter infant sleep duration. Emergency cesarean section birth was associated with 1-hour shorter sleep duration at three months compared to vaginal birth [without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis](β: ?0.99 h; 95% CI: ?1.51, ?0.48). Thirty percent of the effect of lower maternal education on infant total sleep duration was mediated sequentially through prenatal depression and birth mode (Total Indirect Effects: ?0.12, 95% CI: ?0.22, ?0.03, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Prenatal depression and birth mode sequentially mediate the effect of maternal education on infant sleep duration. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; antenatal depression; antibiotic prophylaxis; Article; Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; cesarean section; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; infant; intrapartum care; male; medical education; mother child relation; observational study; population research; priority journal; questionnaire; self report; sleep time"

"Assisted-Transport Caregiving and Its Impact Towards Carer-Employees","2019","Assisted-transport is the most common informal caregiving task and will be in greater demand due to an aging society. One population group that predominantly covers the demands of informal eldercare while working full time in the paid labor force are carer-employees. The developing carer-employee literature addresses: the health risks for carer-employees; employers of carer-employees, and policy/program interventions. Little research focuses on assisted-transport, which impacts health. This study begins to fill the gap by addressing the following objectives: (1) develop a socioeconomic profile of carer-employees performing assisted-transport tasks; (2) identify any gender differences based on the profile, particularly employment and caregiving traits; (3) examine behavioral factors that increase the likelihood of conducting assisted-transport caregiving, and; (4) determine whether carer-employees are more likely to be overwhelmed from assisted-transport caregiving. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze Statistics Canada’s General Social Survey Cycle 26: Caregiving dataset (2012). Compared to general carer-employees, assisted-transport carer-employees have higher education, household income, and caregiving hours per week and feel more tired and overwhelmed from caregiving. Gender gaps exist based on socioeconomic and caregiving characteristics. Logit results show that female carer-employees are more likely to perform assisted-transport caregiving and feel overwhelmed. Carer-employees conducting assisted-transport caregiving are more likely to be overwhelmed than those who do not. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"A consensus statement on how to conduct inclusive health research","2019","Background: The active involvement of people with intellectual disabilities in research, or inclusive research, is relatively common. However, inclusive health research is less common, even though it is expected to lead to appropriate healthcare and increased quality of life. Inclusive health research can build upon lessons learned from inclusive research. Method: A total of 17 experts on inclusive (health) research without intellectual disabilities and 40 experts with intellectual disabilities collaborated in this consensus statement. The consensus statement was developed in three consecutive rounds: (1) an initial feedback round; (2) a roundtable discussion at the 2016 International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities World Congress; and (3) a final feedback round. Results: This consensus statement provides researchers with guidelines, agreed upon by experts in the field, regarding attributes, potential outcomes, reporting and publishing, and future research directions, for designing and conducting inclusive health research. Conclusions: Consensus was reached on how to design and conduct inclusive health research. However, this statement should be continuously adapted to incorporate recent knowledge. The focus of this consensus statement is largely on inclusive health research, but the principles can also be applied to other areas. ? 2018 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article; consensus development; human; intellectual impairment; interpersonal communication; medical research; medical society; motivation; personal experience"
"Cost-Effectiveness of the Aerobika? Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure Device in the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations in Canada","2019","Background. The Aerobika? oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) device is a hand-held, drug-free medical device that has been shown to improve lung function and improve health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We estimated the cost-effectiveness of this device among postexacerbation COPD patients in the Canadian healthcare system. Methods. We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model to compare both costs and outcome of patients with COPD who had recently experienced an exacerbation between 2 treatment arms: patients who used the Aerobika? device and patients who did not use the Aerobika? device. This cost-utility analysis included costs based on the Alberta healthcare system perspective as these represent Canadian experience. A one-year horizon with 12 monthly cycles was used. Results. For a patient after 1 year, the use of the Aerobika? device would save $694 in healthcare costs and produce 0.04 more in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in comparison with no positive expiratory pressure (PEP)/OPEP therapy. In other words, the economic outcome of the device was dominant (i.e., more effective and less costly). The probability for this device to be the dominant strategy was 72%. With a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained, the probability for the Aerobika? device to be cost-effective was 77%. Conclusions. Given one of the major treatment goals in the GOLD guidelines is to minimize the negative impact of exacerbations and prevent re-exacerbations, the Aerobika? OPEP device should be viewed as a potential component of a treatment strategy to improve symptom control and reduce the risk of re-exacerbations in patients with COPD. ? 2019 Nguyen Xuan Thanh et al.","antibiotic agent; corticosteroid; adult; Alberta; Article; Canada; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; disease exacerbation; disease severity; follow up; health care cost; health care system; hospital admission; hospital cost; hospital readmission; human; length of stay; major clinical study; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; chronic obstructive lung disease; cost benefit analysis; devices; disease exacerbation; economic model; economics; positive end expiratory pressure; Canada; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disease Progression; Humans; Models, Economic; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"

"Melatonin activity and receptor expression in endometrial tissue and endometriosis","2019","STUDY QUESTION: Are melatonin receptors (melatonin receptor 1A (MR1A) and melatonin receptor 1B (MR1B)) expressed in human endometrium and endometriotic tissue, and does melatonin affect endometrial cell proliferation? SUMMARY ANSWER: Melatonin receptors are expressed in human eutopic endometrium, endometriomas and peritoneal lesions, although to different extents, and melatonin treatment attenuated estradiol-induced endometrial epithelial cell proliferation in culture. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Melatonin decreased endometriotic lesion volume in a rat model of endometriosis. Melatonin treatment reduced pain scores in and analgesic use by women with endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Basic science study using human endometrial tissue and an endometrial epithelial cell line. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Measurement of melatonin receptor expression (mRNA and protein) in women with surgically confirmed endometriosis (endometrioma (n = 20) or peritoneal lesion (n = 11) alone) and women without surgical evidence of endometriosis (control, n = 15). Collection of endometrial and endometriotic tissue samples, gynecologic history and demographic information. Quantification of estradiol (1.0 nM) and melatonin (0.1 nM-1.0 μM) ± estradiol-induced endometrial epithelial cell proliferation in cultures of endometrial epithelial cells (CRL-1671) following 24 and 48 hours of culture. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: MR1A and MR1B were localized by immunohistochemistry in glandular epithelial cells of endometrial biopsies from women with and without endometriosis. Both receptors were expressed in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue. mRNA expression of MR1A and MR1B was significantly greater in peritoneal lesions than in either endometriomas or eutopic endometrium. However, protein expression of MR1A was decreased in peritoneal lesions compared to control eutopic endometrium, whereas MR1B expression did not differ between the groups. Melatonin (0.1 nM-1.0 μM) treatment inhibited estradiol (1.0 nM)-induced endometrial epithelial cell proliferation at 48 hours but not 24 hours of culture. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Beneficial effects of melatonin seen in culture have yet to be comprehensively evaluated in women with endometriosis. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our data suggest that melatonin may be useful as an adjunct to current endometriosis treatments.

"The Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System: Implications for Improvements in Research Design, Reporting, Replication, and Synthesis","2019","Despite significant advances in measuring the outcomes of rehabilitation interventions, little progress has been made in specifying the therapeutic ingredients and processes that cause measured changes in patient functioning. The general approach to better clarifying the process of treatment has been to develop reporting checklists and guidelines that increase the amount of detail reported. However, without a framework instructing researchers in how to describe their treatment protocols in a manner useful to or even interpretable by others, requests for more detail will fail to improve our understanding of the therapeutic process. In this article, we describe how the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System (RTSS) provides a theoretical framework that can improve research intervention reporting and enable testing and refinement of a protocol's underlying treatment theories. The RTSS framework provides guidance for researchers to explicitly state their hypothesized active ingredients and targets of treatment as well as for how the individual ingredients in their doses directly affect the treatment targets. We explain how theory-based treatment specification has advantages over checklist approaches for intervention design, reporting, replication, and synthesis of evidence in rehabilitation research. A complex rehabilitation intervention is used as a concrete example of the differences between an RTSS-based specification and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist. The RTSS's potential to advance the rehabilitation field can be empirically tested through efforts to use the framework with existing and newly developed treatment protocols. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","article; checklist; clinical protocol; conceptual framework; human; outcome assessment; rehabilitation; rehabilitation research; scientist; synthesis; theoretical study; translational research; methodology; outcome assessment; patient care planning; procedures; rehabilitation medicine; Clinical Protocols; Humans; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Care Planning; Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine; Research Design"
"Adjuvant Trastuzumab Therapy: Can We Balance Efficacy and Safety?","2019","Trastuzumab is an effective treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. Current guidelines recommend withholding trastuzumab in patients experiencing a significant asymptomatic decline in left ventricular function. In this commentary, we discuss the survival benefits afforded by trastuzumab juxtaposed against the risk of trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity. It is not known whether the net benefit of continuing trastuzumab in the setting of mild cardiotoxicity outweighs the associated risks. We describe a potential approach undertaken by our group, and others, and call for a randomized trial. ?

"Lost in transition or translation? Care philosophies and transitions between child and youth and adult mental health services: a systematic review","2019","Background: Differences in care philosophies may influence transitions from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS). Aims: To review literature about CAMHS and AMHS care philosophies and their influence on transitions. Method: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched electronically using keywords related to transitions, youth and mental disorders. Content relating to philosophies of care was searched manually. Descriptive themes were extracted and the analysis suggested four hypotheses of how care philosophies influence transitions. Results: Of the 1897 identified articles, 12 met eligibility criteria. Findings reveal consistent differences in care philosophies between CAMHS (developmental approach, involving families and nurturing) and AMHS (clinical/diagnosis-focus, emphasis on client autonomy and individual responsibility). Conclusions: Better understanding of philosophical differences and collaborative planning and service delivery may foster shared approaches in CAMHS and AMHS to better meet the needs of transitioning youth. ? 2015, ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.","adolescent; adult; child; diagnosis; family; health care delivery; human; juvenile; mental health service; philosophy; responsibility; systematic review; child health care; mental disease; mental health service; organization and management; transition to adult care; Adolescent; Adolescent Health Services; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Transition to Adult Care"

"Incidence of and risk factors for major haemorrhage in patients treated with ibrutinib: An integrated analysis","2019","Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved for treatment of various B-cell malignancies. In ibrutinib clinical studies, low-grade haemorrhage was common, whereas major haemorrhage (MH) was infrequent. We analysed the incidence of and risk factors for MH from 15 ibrutinib clinical studies (N?=?1768), including 4 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Rates of any-grade bleeding were similar for single-agent ibrutinib and ibrutinib combinations (39% and 40%). Low-grade bleeding was more common in ibrutinib-treated than comparator-treated patients (35% and 15%), and early low-grade bleeding was not associated with MH. The proportion of MH in RCTs was higher with ibrutinib than comparators (4.4% vs. 2.8%), but after adjusting for longer exposure with ibrutinib (median 13?months vs. 6?months), the incidence of MH was similar (3.2 vs. 3.1 per 1000 person-months). MH led to treatment discontinuation in 1% of all ibrutinib-treated patients. Use of anticoagulants and/or antiplatelets (AC/AP) during the study was common (~50% of patients) and had an increased exposure-adjusted relative risk for MH in both the total ibrutinib-treated population (1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–3.0) and RCT comparator-treated patients (2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–5.6), indicating that ibrutinib may not alter the effect of AC/AP on the risk of MH in B-cell malignancies. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Defibrillation testing and clinical outcomes after implantable cardioverter–defibrillator implantation in patients in atrial fibrillation at the time of implant: An analysis from the SIMPLE trial","2019","Background: The Shockless IMPLant Evaluation (SIMPLE) trial showed that defibrillation testing (DT) at the time of implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) implant did not improve shock efficacy or reduce mortality. There are no data regarding the risk of complications, including stroke, among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who undergo DT. Objective: The purpose of this prospectively planned substudy of SIMPLE was to evaluate the effect of DT vs no DT on clinical outcomes among patients with AF. Methods: We compared efficacy (failed appropriate shock/arrhythmic death) and safety between patients who had AF on their immediate preprocedural ECG to the rest of the study patients. Then among patients with AF we compared these outcomes between patients randomized to DT vs no DT. Results: Of the 2500 patients enrolled in SIMPLE, 251 (10%) were in AF immediately before ICD implant. AF patients had an increased risk of failed appropriate shock/arrhythmic death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–2.39; P =.009) and higher all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.2–2.08; P =.001). Among AF patients, perioperative complications and stroke did not significantly differ between DT vs no-DT groups (9.2% vs 5.4%; P =.2; and 1.7% vs 1.5%; P &gt;.999, respectively). Failed appropriate shock or arrhythmic death occurred in 35 of 251 AF patients (14%), and the no-DT group proved not inferior to the DT group (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.30–1.15; Pnoninferiority =.006). Conclusion: ICD recipients with AF are at increased risk for adverse outcomes; however, DT does not improve arrhythmic survival or shock efficacy. There is no evidence that DT increased the occurrence of perioperative stroke. ? 2018 Heart Rhythm Society","antiarrhythmic agent; diuretic agent; heparin; inotropic agent; adult; all cause mortality; anticoagulant therapy; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain ischemia; clinical outcome; defibrillation; electrocardiogram; female; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium pacing; human; international normalized ratio; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; shock; sinus rhythm"
"Ultrasound-Guided Interventions in Lateral Epicondylitis","2019","Lateral epicondylitis is a painful condition related to the myotendinous origin of the extensor muscles at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. Primary treatment typically involves the use of rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physiotherapy. However, in refractory cases where conventional therapy is ineffective, ultrasound-guided injection therapies have become a growing form of treatment. These include needle tenotomy, autologous whole blood injection (AWB), platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection and steroid injection. The consensus regarding the efficacy of individual approaches of ultrasound-guided treatment is unclear in the literature, and is explored further in this review. When evaluating these injection therapies individually, there are multiple case series describing the efficacy of each intervention in refractory lateral epicondylitis. A systematic review of needle tenotomy demonstrates an improvement in pain symptoms for patients with this condition, but all studies were poorly designed with no placebo or control group. Additionally, for PRP therapy, a systematic review performed in 2013 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain and functionality for refractory lateral epicondylitis. However, these studies were similarly associated with a high risk of bias. Autologous whole blood injection has been evaluated through well-designed studies to show statistically significant reductions in pain with this intervention. But very few studies in total have been completed using AWB for lateral epicondylitis, and therefore no clear conclusions can be drawn at this time. Finally, corticosteroid use overall is unsupported in the evidence both in the short and long term, especially given that this condition is not an inflammatory pathology. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Outcomes after Ross procedure in adult patients: A meta-analysis and microsimulation","2019","Objective: We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the risk of adverse events, life expectancy, and event-free life expectancy after the Ross procedure in adults. Methods: We searched databases for reports evaluating the Ross procedure in patients aged more than or equal to 16 years of age. A microsimulation model was used to evaluate age- and gender-specific life expectancy for patients undergoing the Ross procedure. Results: Data were pooled from 63 articles totaling 19 155 patients from 20 countries. Perioperative mortality was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-3.1; N = 9978). We found a mortality risk of 5.9% (95% CI: 4.8-7.2) at a mean follow-up of 7.2 years (N = 7573). The rate of perioperative clinically significant bleeding was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.1-3.0); re-exploration for bleeding 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.3); postoperative clinically significant bleeding from 30 days until a mean of 7.1 years was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0). At a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, reintervention rate of any operated valve was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.7-10.3). The risk of valve thrombosis was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.5) at 7.6 years; peripheral embolism 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.4) at 6.4 years; stroke 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7-1.2) at 6.5 years; and endocarditis 2.1% (95% CI: 1.6-2.6) at 8.0 years. Microsimulation reported a 40-year-old undergoing the Ross procedure to have a life expectancy of 35.4 years and event-free life expectancy of 26.6 years. Conclusions: Ross procedure in nonelderly adults is associated with low mortality and low risk of adverse events both at short- and long-term follow-up. The surgical community must prioritize a large, expertize-based randomized controlled trial to definitively address the risks and benefits of the Ross procedure compared to conventional aortic valve replacement. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","age distribution; Article; bicuspid aortic valve; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; endocarditis; event free survival; gender; human; life expectancy; meta analysis (topic); microsimulation; mortality; outcome assessment; perioperative period; prevalence; prosthetic valve thrombosis; risk factor; Ross procedure; simulation; survival rate; systematic review; thrombosis; treatment outcome; valve thrombosis; adolescent; adult; adverse event; age; aortic valve; autograft; bibliographic database; bioprosthesis; computer simulation; follow up; heart valve prosthesis; heart valve replacement; meta analysis; middle aged; procedures; risk; risk assessment; surgery; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aortic Valve; Autografts; Bioprosthesis; Computer Simulation; Databases, Bibliographic; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Dexmedetomidine for craniotomy under general anesthesia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials","2019","Study objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia for craniotomy. Design: A meta-analysis after systematically searching PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for randomized trials (RCTs). Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Setting: Perioperative setting. Patients: Twenty-two RCTs (1348 patients) with craniotomy under general anesthesia were included. Interventions: Dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia versus placebo or other anesthetics. Measurements: Primary outcomes included procedure success and postoperative pain; Secondary outcomes included cardiac adverse events, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and other clinically important outcomes. Main results: Dexmedetomidine vs. Placebo: High to moderate quality evidence suggested that dexmedetomidine reduced postoperative pain (WMD ?0.25 cm, 95%CI ?0.43 to ?0.07 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV, RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.39 to 0.84), hypertension (RR 0.37, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.61) and tachycardia (RR 0.32, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.85) with no significant increase of hypotension and bradycardia. Moderate quality evidence suggested no significant difference in procedural success. Dexmedetomidine vs. Active Comparators (including remifentanil, fentanyl, or propofol): Moderate quality evidence showed no difference in procedural success and postoperative pain. Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia shows small benefits in reduction of pain, PONV, and maintains more stable hemodynamics with comparable effects on procedural success versus placebo. Very limited evidence explored comparative effects between dexmedetomidine and active controls. Further evidence is required to evaluate patient-important outcomes and optimal dosing strategies, particularly versus active comparators. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","dexmedetomidine; fentanyl; opiate; placebo; propofol; remifentanil; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; dexmedetomidine; bradycardia; Cochrane Library; craniotomy; Embase; extubation; general anesthesia; heart disease; hemodynamic parameters; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; hypotension; intracranial pressure; Medline; meta analysis; operation duration; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain; priority journal; publishing; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; sedation; systematic review; tachycardia; visual analog scale; craniotomy; general anesthesia; postoperative complication; procedures; treatment outcome; Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists; Anesthesia, General; Craniotomy; Dexmedetomidine; Humans; Postoperative Complications; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome"
"Health-related quality of life in adolescents and young adults with cancer – Including a focus on economic evaluation","2019","Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is an amalgam of three elements – the opportunities that a person's health status affords, the constraints that it places upon the person and the value that a person places on his/her health status. HRQL measures are specific, for example for a disease, or generic with broad applicability. The latter include preference-based measures that can be used to generate quality-adjusted life years and so contribute to economic evaluation. Measures of HRQL in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer may fail to capture some important dimensions, for example sexual health. However, the use of HRQL measures in this population has identified burdens of morbidity according to disease, treatment status and duration of follow-up. There are few economic evaluations of the treatment of cancer in AYAs but preliminary evidence suggests that this is a cost-effective undertaking. Opportunities abound to include measurement of HRQL in routine clinical care. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adolescent; adult; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; health care system; human; malignant neoplasm; priority journal; quality of life; Review; young adult; cost benefit analysis; economics; neoplasm; quality adjusted life year; Adolescent; Adult; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Young Adult"
"Exploring the Experiences of Adults With Type 2 Diabetes on Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors","2020","Objective: Diet-related quality of life has not been explored previously in patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, the latest class of diabetes medications. In this study, we sought to describe the patient experience on SGLT-2 inhibitors and examine whether there have been improvements in dietary perception and satisfaction with these drugs. Methods: Adults ?40 years of age with type 2 diabetes and using SGLT-2 inhibitors for at least 1 month were recruited to take part in one-time 1-on-1 interviews. An interpretive descriptive methodology was used. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently and a constant comparative analysis was used. Results: An overall positive response to SGLT-2 inhibitor use was observed. Interviews revealed 3 themes: Recognizing, Reckoning and Realizing. In Recognizing, all patients reported a significant relationship with food that was typically negative and included feelings of food restriction and deprivation. Positive side effects of the drug in Reckoning included better glycemic control, weight loss and improved energy. Some participants were motivated in Realizing to pursue additional behavioural changes to improve their diabetes management. Conclusions: An improved dietary-related quality of life was described by some participants. Although not all individuals were seen to move into the Realizing phase after initiating an SGLT-2 inhibitor, there appeared to be an opportunity to create a behaviour change after positive Reckoning experiences. ? 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association","dapagliflozin; empagliflozin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; behavior change; body weight loss; candidiasis; clinical article; descriptive research; diet restriction; drug safety; female; food deprivation; glycemic control; human; information processing; interview; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient satisfaction; perception; personal experience; polyuria; quality of life; treatment duration; treatment response; urinary tract infection; urogenital tract infection"
