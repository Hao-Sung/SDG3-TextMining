"Development of an intelligent decision support system for ischemic stroke risk assessment in a population-based electronic health record database",2019,"Background Intelligent decision support systems (IDSS) have been applied to tasks of disease management. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are artificial intelligent techniques to achieve high modeling power. The application of DNNs to large-scale data for estimating stroke risk needs to be assessed and validated. This study aims to apply a DNN for deriving a stroke predictive model using a big electronic health record database. Methods and results The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was used to conduct a retrospective population-based study. The database was divided into one development dataset for model training (~70% of total patients for training and ~10% for parameter tuning) and two testing datasets (each ~10%). A total of 11,192,916 claim records from 840,487 patients were used. The primary outcome was defined as any ischemic stroke in inpatient records within 3 years after study enrollment. The DNN was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC or c-statistic). The development dataset included 672,214 patients (a total of 8,952,000 records) of whom 2,060 patients had stroke events. The mean age of the population was 35.5±20.2 years, with 48.5% men. The model achieved AUC values of 0.920 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.908–0.932) in testing dataset 1 and 0.925 (95% CI, 0.914–0.937) in testing dataset 2. Under a high sensitivity operating point, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.5% and 79.8% for testing dataset 1; 91.8% and 79.9% for testing dataset 2. Under a high specificity operating point, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.3% and 87.5% for testing dataset 1; 83.7% and 87.5% for testing dataset 2. The DNN model maintained high predictability 5 years after being developed. The model achieved similar performance to other clinical risk assessment scores. Conclusions Using a DNN algorithm on this large electronic health record database is capable of obtaining a high performing model for assessment of ischemic stroke risk. Further research is needed to determine whether such a DNN-based IDSS could lead to an improvement in clinical practice. ? 2019 Hung et al.

"Evaluation of novel disposable bioreactors on pandemic influenza virus production",2019,"Since 1997, the highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus has spread from Hong Kong. According to the WHO bulletin report, the H5N1 virus is a zoonotic disease threat that has infected more than 850 humans, causing over 450 deaths. In addition, an outbreak of another new and highly pathogenic influenza virus (H7N9) occurred in 2013 in China. These highly pathogenic influenza viruses could potentially cause a worldwide pandemic. it is crucial to develop a rapid production platform to meet this surge demand against any possible influenza pandemic. A potential solution for this problem is the use of cell-based bioreactors for rapid vaccine production. These novel bioreactors, used for cell-based vaccine production, possess various advantages. For example, they enable a short production time, allow for the handling highly pathogenic influenza in closed environments, and can be easily scaled up. In this study, two novel disposable cell-based bioreactors, BelloCell and TideCell, were used to produce H5N1 clade II and H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Madin- Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were used for the production of these influenza CVVs. A novel bench-scale bioreactor named BelloCell bioreactor was used in the study. All culturing conditions were tested and scaled to 10 L industrial-scale bioreactor known as TideCell002. The performances of between BelloCell and TideCell were similar in cell growth, the average MDCK cell doubling time was slightly decreased to 25 hours. The systems yielded approximately 39.2 and 18.0 μg/ml of HA protein with the 10-liter TideCell002 from the H5N1 clade II and H7N9 CVVs, respectively. The results of this study not only highlight the overall effectiveness of these bioreactors but also illustrate the potential of maintaining the same outcome when scaled up to industrial production, which has many implications for faster vaccine production. Although additional studies are required for process optimization, the results of this study are promising and show that oscillating bioreactors may be a suitable platform for pandemic influenza virus production. ? 2019 Lai et al.","hemagglutinin; influenza vaccine; animal cell; Article; cell density; cell growth; cladistics; Influenza A virus (H5N1); Influenza A virus (H7N9); MDCK cell line; nonhuman; scale up; vaccine production; Vero cell line; virus culture"
"Transplantation of adipose stromal cell sheet producing hepatocyte growth factor induces pleiotropic effect in ischemic skeletal muscle",2019,"Cell therapy remains a promising approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this regard, the contemporary trend is the development of methods to overcome low cell viability and enhance their regenerative potential. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of gene-modified adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSC) that overexpress hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in a mice hind limb ischemia model. Angiogenic and neuroprotective effects were assessed following ADSC transplantation in suspension or in the form of cell sheet. We found superior blood flow restoration, tissue vascularization and innervation, and fibrosis reduction after transplantation of HGF-producing ADSC sheet compared to other groups. We suggest that the observed effects are determined by pleiotropic effects of HGF, along with the multifactorial paracrine action of ADSC which remain viable and functionally active within the engineered cell construct. Thus, we demonstrated the high therapeutic potential of the utilized approach for skeletal muscle recovery after ischemic damage associated with complex tissue degenerative effects. ? 2019 by the authors.

"A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness in patients with schizophrenia ?",2019,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is frequently used to attenuate the severity of positive schizophrenia symptoms; however, few studies have focused on attenuating negative symptoms. Recently, researchers have become interested in the effects of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on schizophrenia, but the lack of evidence-based results from random clinical trials (RCTs) has limited their effectiveness. Moreover, longitudinal data must be examined using appropriate study designs. We recruited 60 schizophrenia patients and randomly assigned them to an MBI or to a treatment-as-usual group. Negative symptoms, positive symptoms, mindfulness, and depression were assessed at baseline, post-course, and at a 3-month follow-up. Descriptive analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to examine the effects of MBI. We found that MBI mitigated the severity of negative symptoms and of general schizophrenic psychopathology except for the positive symptoms and for those of depression. Unexpectedly, we did not find long-term effect of mindfulness on negative symptoms. Larger sample sizes, long-term practical course, more rigorous study procedures, and a double-blind design should be considered in future studies. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; depression; disease severity; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; mindfulness; negative syndrome; positive syndrome; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; therapy effect; treatment outcome; treatment planning; adolescent; aged; double blind procedure; middle aged; psychology; schizophrenia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Depression; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"MicroRNA-486-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in oral cancer by targeting DDR1",2019,"Background: Discoidin domain receptor-1 (DDR1) tyrosine kinase is highly expressed in a variety of human cancers and involved in various steps of tumorigenesis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the abnormal expression of DDR1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not been well investigated. Methods: The expression of DDR1 on OSCC patients was determine by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Specific targeting by miRNAs was determined by software prediction, luciferase reporter assay, and correlation with target protein expression. The functions of miR-486-3p and DDR1 were accessed by MTT and Annexin V analyses using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylation specific PCR (MSP) were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by arecoline treatment. Results: Here, we reported that DDR1 was significantly upregulated in OSCC tissues and its levels were inversely correlated with miR-486-3p expression. The experimental results in vitro confirmed that miR-486-3p decreased DDR1 expression by targeting the 3′-UTR of DDR1 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-486-3p led to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction with a similar function by knockdown of DDR1. Aberrant methylation of ANK1 promoter was a highly prevalent in OSCC and contributes to oral carcinogenesis by epigenetic silencing of ANK1 and miR-486-3p. We found that miR-486-3p can be transcriptionally co-regulated with its host gene ANK1 through epigenetic repression. DNA methylation inhibitor treatment re-expressed ANK1 and miR-486-3p. Importantly, arecoline, a major betel nut alkaloid, recruited DNMT3B binding to ANK1 promoter for DNA methylation and then attenuated the expression of miR-486-3p in OSCC. Conclusion: This study was the first to demonstrate that betel nut alkaloid may recruit DNMT3B to regulate miR-486-3p/DDR1 axis in oral cancer andmiR-486-3p and DDR1 may serve as potential therapeutic targets of oral cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).","arecoline; discoidin domain receptor 1; DNA methyltransferase 3B; lipocortin 5; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 486 3p; unclassified drug; ANK1 protein, human; ankyrin; arecoline; DDR1 protein, human; discoidin domain receptor 1; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase; DNA methyltransferase 3B; microRNA; MIRN486 microRNA, human; 3' untranslated region; ANK1 gene; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; DNA methylation; gain of function mutation; gene expression; gene function; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; loss of function mutation; luciferase assay; molecular mechanics; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; MTT assay; oncogene; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein targeting; real time polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; aged; chemistry; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; tumor suppressor gene; 3' Untranslated Regions; Aged; Ankyrins; Apoptosis; Arecoline; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Discoidin Domain Receptor 1; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases; DNA Methylation; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; HEK293 Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; Mouth Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic"
"Lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin S is involved in cancer cell motility by regulating store-operated Ca2+ entry",2019,"Cathepsin S (CTSS), a lysosomal cysteine protease, has been reported to be associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, thus promoting cell migration and invasion, but whether CTSS regulates other intracellular mechanisms during metastasis remains unknown. The expression of CTSS was knocked down using siRNA transfection, and enzymatic activity was inhibited by the highly-selective CTSS inhibitor RJW-58. The results of in vitro functional assays, western blot analysis, and an in vivo colonization model demonstrated that CTSS was positively related to cellular adhesive ability. Moreover, both CTSS knockdown and inhibition significantly decreased Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) without changing STIM1 and Orai1 expression levels, while RJW-58 dose-dependently reduced the activation of the Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors, NFAT1 and Rac1. The results of immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CTSS could bind to STIM1, which was reversed by CTSS inhibition. In addition, confocal microscopy and super-resolution imaging showed that CTSS inhibition led to STIM1 puncta accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced the interaction between active STIM1 and EB1. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that the lysosomal cysteine protease, CTSS, plays an important role in mediating Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating STIM1 trafficking, which leads to the suppression of cell migration and invasion. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","calcium ion; calcium release activated calcium channel 1; cathepsin S; eb1 protein; nfat1 protein; protein; Rac1 protein; small interfering RNA; stromal interaction molecule 1; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer cell; cell adhesion; cell invasion; cell motility; confocal microscopy; controlled study; downstream processing; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme activity; female; GBM8401 cell line; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; OECM-1 cell line; PC-9 cell line; priority journal; store operated calcium entry; Western blotting"
"Distinct tumor microenvironment at tumor edge as a result of astrocyte activation is associated with therapeutic resistance for brain tumor",2019,"Tumor vasculatures and hypoxia are critical tumor microenvironmental factors associated with tumor response to the therapy and heterogeneous in both time- and location-dependent manner. Using a murine orthotopic anaplastic astrocytoma model, ALTS1C1, this study showed that brain tumor edge had a very unique microenvironment, having higher microvascular density (MVD) and better vessel function than the tumor core, but on the other hand was also positive for hypoxia markers, such as pimonidazole (PIMO), hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIX). The hypoxia at tumor edge was transient, named as peripheral hypoxia, and caused by different mechanisms from the chronic hypoxia in tumor core. The correlation of CAIX staining with astrocyte activation marker, glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), at the tumor edge indicated the involvement of astrocyte activation on the development of peripheral hypoxia. Peripheral hypoxia was a specific trait of orthotopic brain tumors at tumor edge, regardless of tumor origin. The hypoxic cells were resistant to the therapy, regardless of their location. Surviving cells, particularly those at the hypoxic region of tumor edge, are likely the cause of tumor recurrence after the therapy. New therapeutic platform that targets cells in tumor edge is likely to achieve better treatment outcomes. Copyright ? 2019 Lin, Yu, Huang, Chen, Hong and Chiang.

"A highly efficient Au-MoS 2 nanocatalyst for tunable piezocatalytic and photocatalytic water disinfection",2019,"Clean water is essential in our daily life. However, nearly one billion people are forced to drink water contaminated with bacteria, leading to diarrhea, dehydration, and even death. Previously, various photocatalysts have been applied to replace high-cost and highly toxic methods for sewage treatment. Nevertheless, the requirement of external light sources limits their application. Herein, we develop a new type of nanocatalyst based on single- and few-layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets (NSs) that can catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inactivate bacteria either through a piezoelectric effect (mechanical vibration) or photocatalytic effect (light irradiation). After 60 min of mechanical vibration or visible-light irradiation, the MoS 2 NSs can reduce Escherichia coli (E. Coli) by 99.999%. In addition, the ROS generation efficiency and bacterial disinfection performance of the catalyst can be enhanced by depositing Au nanoparticles (NPs) on MoS 2 NSs. The period of mechanical vibration or visible-light irradiation that achieves the same 99.999% reduction in E. coli is shortened to 45 min. Moreover, a hybridization of the piezoelectric and photocatalytic effects results in a performance superior to that obtained with the individual effects. A 99.999% reduction in E. coli is also accomplished within 15 min through a combination of mechanical vibration and near-infrared (NIR)-light irradiation. This MoS 2 nanocatalyst is a promising candidate for nextgeneration water purification systems because of its ability to be triggered by diverse environmental stimuli. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Disinfection; Escherichia coli; Gold nanoparticles; Infrared devices; Layered semiconductors; Light; Light sources; Molybdenum compounds; Nanocatalysts; Nanosheets; Piezoelectricity; Sewage treatment; Sulfur compounds; Vibrations (mechanical); Water pollution; Environmental stimuli; Escherichia coli (E. coli); Molybdenum disulfide; Photocatalytic effect; Piezocatalytic effect; Reactive oxygen species; Visible-light irradiation; Water purification systems; Irradiation"
"Foxm1 Transcription Factor Regulates Lung Adenocarcinoma Development",2019,"Foxm1 is a potential transcription factor that is abundantly expressed in highly proliferative human lung cancer cells. Foxm1 also strongly correlates to lung fibrosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to enhance metastatic program during the lung adenocarcinoma development. Foxm1 plays a pivotal role in controlling cell cycle phase through the G1-S-G2 checkpoint. The increasing Foxm1 and K-ras oncogene expression significantly associate with tumor growth and poor prognosis that potentially modulate patient's mortality in a subject with lung carcinoma. The genetic evidence showed that the silencing of Foxm1 resulted in the decrease in lung tumorigenesis. Thus, Foxm1 may contribute in the future as the potential target for cancer therapy by reducing lung fibrosis, EMT, and tumor cell proliferation to improve patient's survival rate. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

"Electrical cortical stimulation for refractory focal epilepsy: A long-term follow-up study",2019,"Objective: To report the long-term seizure control and safety of open-loop electrical cortical stimulation in patients with refractory focal epilepsy of diverse etiologies. Methods: Six patients who received a therapeutic trial of cortical stimulation were included retrospectively. The frequency of seizures was recorded before and after implantation. Surgical procedure- and stimulation-related adverse effects were also recorded. Results: The mean reductions in seizures were 61% at 1 year, 68% at 2 years, and 80% at 3–7 years post-implantation. The median follow-up time was 54 months (range 36–156 months). The etiologies of epilepsy included polymicrogyria in two patients, post-traumatic in one patient, and periventricular heterotopia, post-encephalitis, and familial lateral temporal lobe epilepsy in the remaining three patients. Status epilepticus stopped immediately after stimulation in three patients with focal status epilepticus or epilepsia partialis continua at baseline, with a long-term reduction in seizures of more than 90% and improvements in conscious level. Tissue incompatibility with the connection wire was noted in one patient, which subsided after the system was removed. Conclusions: Open-loop cortical stimulation of epileptic foci improved seizure control in our patients with refractory focal epilepsy of diverse etiologies. Electrical cortical stimulation stopped epilepsia partialis continua/focal status epilepticus immediately after the intervention and exhibited a sustained effect in reducing seizures. No procedure-related complications were observed. Further case cohort studies are needed to clarify which patients respond to open-loop cortical stimulation. ? 2019","adolescent; adult; Article; clinical article; disease control; drug resistant epilepsy; electrical cortical stimulation; electrostimulation; encephalitis; epileptic state; female; focal epilepsy; follow up; human; lateral temporal lobe epilepsy; male; microgyria; patient safety; periventricular heterotopia; priority journal; retrospective study; young adult; biophysics; brain cortex; complication; diagnostic imaging; drug resistant epilepsy; electroencephalography; electrotherapy; focal epilepsy; longitudinal study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; single photon emission computed tomography; treatment outcome; Adult; Biophysics; Cerebral Cortex; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electroencephalography; Epilepsies, Partial; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Treatment Outcome"
"Biofilms in Chronic Wounds: Pathogenesis and Diagnosis",2019,"Chronic non-healing wounds have become a major worldwide healthcare burden. The impact of biofilms on chronic wound infection is well established. Despite increasing understanding of the underlying mechanism of biofilm formation in chronic wounds, current strategies for biofilm diagnosis in chronic wounds are still far from ideal. In this review, we briefly summarize the mechanism of biofilm formation and focus on current diagnostic approaches of chronic wound biofilms based on morphology, microbiology, and molecular assays. Innovative biotechnological approaches, such as wound blotting and transcriptomic analysis, may further shed light on this unmet clinical need. The continuous development of these sophisticated diagnostic approaches can markedly contribute to the future implementation of point-of-care biofilm detection in chronic wound care. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biotechnology; Diagnosis; Biofilm formation; Biotechnological approaches; Chronic wounds; Continuous development; Diagnostic approach; Molecular assays; Point of care; wound blotting; Biofilms; biofilm; chronic wound; clinical feature; human; infection risk; pathogenesis; point of care testing; priority journal; Review; risk factor; transcriptomics; wound care; wound healing; wound infection"
"The Gap Between Tools and Best Practice: An Analysis of Safety Prequalification Surveys in the Construction Industry",2019,"This study characterizes safety prequalification surveys currently in use in the construction industry to identify approaches that include leading indicators of worker safety performance. We collected prequalification surveys available in the public domain from internet searches, construction company websites, published literature, and construction industry partners. We utilized a conceptual framework, based on safety theory and best practices, to categorize survey questions. Fifty-two prequalification surveys were identified containing 112 unique questions. Most included questions related to lagging indicators (83 percent), safety management leadership (75 percent), and worker training (60 percent). Safety management system elements such as hazard prevention and control, program evaluation and improvement, and coordination and communication were notably absent in 90 percent of the surveys. There was little consistency in the surveys available concerning leading indicators of safety. Only a small number of surveys currently in use incorporate all the elements of best practices associated with robust safety management systems. ?

"Sex differences in lower extremity coordinative variability during running",2019,"Background: Differences in coordinative variability have been previously reported between healthy and injured runners. Many running-related injuries have a sex bias, particularly patellofemoral pain (PFP), as female runners are approximately twice as likely to develop PFP compared to males. However, very little is currently known regarding sex differences in coordinative variability during running. Research Question: Are there sex differences in continuous relative phase (CRP) variability for pelvis-thigh and thigh-shank couplings during the stance phase of running? Methods: Pelvis, thigh, and shank segment kinematics were collected on 15 female and 15 male subjects during overground running at a self-selected easy pace (2.39–3.56 m/s) using a 10-camera 3D motion capture system. Continuous relative phase (CRP) variability was calculated between the pelvis-thigh and thigh-shank, and averaged during four distinct stance sub-phases. A mixed effects linear model compared CRP variability between sexes at each stance sub-phase. Results: Compared to males, females displayed significantly lower pelvis-thigh CRP variability in the transverse plane during the loading response phase, and significantly lower thigh-shank CRP variability in the sagittal plane during the loading response and pre-swing phases. Significance: Lower coordinative variability in females during the loading response for two couplings may provide additional insight into the sex bias for developing certain running-related injuries. However, any injury implications from these results are speculative and should be interpreted with caution. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; clinical article; continuous relative phase variability; female; human; kinematics; lower limb; male; musculoskeletal system parameters; patellofemoral joint; pelvis; priority journal; runner; running; sex difference; standing; thigh; adolescent; biomechanics; hip; knee; lower limb; middle aged; physiology; running; sexual characteristics; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Hip Joint; Humans; Knee Joint; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Pelvis; Running; Sex Characteristics; Thigh; Young Adult"
"An integrated microfluidic system with field-effect-transistor sensor arrays for detecting multiple cardiovascular biomarkers from clinical samples",2019,"Certain blood-borne biomarkers offer a potent methodology for understanding the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) with clinicians generally advocating the use of multiple biomarkers for proper risk assessment of CVDs. Herein four such CVDs biomarkers- C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and fibrinogen- were rapidly (5 min) analyzed from clinical samples (~ 4 ?L) on an integrated microfluidic platform equipped with 1) immobilized highly specific aptamer probes and 2) field-effect transistor (FET)-based sensor arrays. The calibration curve from the FET sensor arrays showed good agreement in the physiological concentration ranges for CRP (0.1–50 mg/L), NT-proBNP (50–10,000 pg/mL), cTnI (1–10,000 pg/mL), and fibrinogen (0.1–5 mg/mL). The developed prototype of this fully automated portable device requires minimal reagent and sample inputs and consequently shows great promise for next-generation point-of-care devices assaying multiple CVDs biomarkers in clinical samples. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Cardiology; Diseases; Microfluidics; Risk assessment; Aptamers; B-type natriuretic peptide; C-reactive proteins; Cardio-vascular disease; Field effect transistor sensors; Integrated microfluidic systems; Integrated microfluidics; Physiological concentrations; Field effect transistors; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; fibrinogen; troponin I; aptamer; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; fibrinogen; peptide fragment; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); troponin I; analytic method; Article; automation; equipment design; field effect transistor sensor array; microfluidics; molecular probe; point of care testing; process optimization; protein analysis; blood; cardiovascular disease; chemistry; devices; evaluation study; genetic procedures; human; lab on a chip; limit of detection; point of care system; transistor; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; C-Reactive Protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; Equipment Design; Fibrinogen; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Limit of Detection; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; Point-of-Care Systems; Transistors, Electronic; Troponin I"
"Sigma-2 receptor/TMEM97 agonist PB221 as an alternative drug for brain tumor",2019,"Background: There are limited effective drugs that can reach the brain to target brain tumors, in particular glioblastoma, which is one of the most difficult cancers to be cured from. Because the overexpression of the sigma-2 receptor is frequently reported in glioma clinical samples and associated with poor prognosis and malignancy, we herein studied the anti-tumor effect of the sigma-2 receptor agonist PB221 (4-cyclohexyl-1-[3-(5-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)propyl]piperidine) on an anaplastic astrocytoma tumor model based on previous encouraging results in pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Methods: The expression of the sigma-2 receptor, transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97), in ALTS1C1 and UN-KC6141 cell lines was measured by RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR. The binding of sigma-2 receptor fluorescent ligands PB385 (6-[5-[3-(4-cyclohexylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-5-yloxy]-N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)hexanamine) and NO1 (2-{6-[2-(3-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)propyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one-5-yloxy]hexyl}-5-(dimethylamino)isoindoline-1,3-dione) was examined by flow cytometry and the fluorescent plate reader. The antitumor activity of PB221 was initially examined in the murine brain tumor cell line ALTS1C1 and then in the murine pancreatic cell line UN-KC6141. The potential therapeutic efficacy of PB221 for murine brain tumors was examined by in vitro migration and invasion assays and in vivo ectopic and orthotopic ALTS1C1 tumor models. Results: The IC50 of PB221 for ALTS1C1 and UN-KC6141 cell lines was 10.61 ± 0.96 and 13.13 ± 1.15 μM, respectively. A low dose of PB221 (1 μM) significantly repressed the migration and invasion of ALTS1C1 cells, and a high dose of PB221 (20 μM) resulted in the apoptotic cell death of ALTS1C1 cells. These effects were reduced by the lipid antioxidant α-tocopherol, but not by the hydrophilic N-acetylcysteine, suggesting mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved. The in vivo study revealed that PB221 effectively retarded tumor growth to 36% of the control tumor volume in the ectopic intramuscular tumor model and increased the overall survival time by 20% (from 26 to 31 days) in the orthotopic intracerebral tumor model. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the sigma-2 receptor agonist PB221 has the potential to be an alternative chemotherapeutic drug for brain tumors with comparable side effects as the current standard-of-care drug, temozolomide. ? 2019 The Author(s).","2 [6 [2 (3 (6,7 dimethoxy 3,4 dihydroisoquinolin 2(1h)yl)propyl) 3,4 dihydroisoquinolin 1(2h) one 5 loxy]hexyl] 5 (dimethylamino)isoindoline 1,3 dione; 4 cyclohexyl 1 [3 (5 methoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalen 1 yl)propyl]piperidine; 6 [5 [3 (4 cyclohexylpiperazin 1 yl)propyl] 5,6,7,8 tetrahydronaphthalen 5 yloxy] n (7 nitro 2,1,3 benzoxadiazol 4 yl)hexanamine; acetylcysteine; alpha tocopherol; membrane protein; sigma 2 opiate receptor; sigma receptor agonist; transmembrane protein 97; unclassified drug; membrane protein; piperidine derivative; tetralin derivative; TMEM97 protein, human; ALTS1C1 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell invasion assay; cell migration assay; concentration response; drug efficacy; flow cytometry; fluorescence analysis; glioblastoma; glioblastoma cell line; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; metastasis inhibition; mitochondrial oxidative stress; mouse; nonhuman; overall survival; oxidative stress; pancreatic cell line; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; receptor binding; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor model; UN-KC6141 cell line; animal; astrocytoma; brain tumor; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; dose response; drug effect; drug screening; genetics; human; male; metabolism; tumor cell line; Animals; Astrocytoma; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Oxidative Stress; Piperidines; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Delivery of antigen to cd8+ dendritic cells by fusing antigen with formyl peptide receptor-like 1 inhibitor protein induces antitumor immunity",2019,"A major challenge for vaccine development is targeting antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo, enabling cross-presentation, and inducing the memory responses. Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) are expressed on many cell types including DCs. Therefore, targeting of antigen to DCs via FcγRs is an attractive strategy for vaccine development. This study employ formyl peptide receptor-like 1 inhibitory protein (FLIPr), an FcγR binding protein secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, to deliver antigen to DCs. Our results show that FLIPr is a competent vehicle in delivering antigen to CD8+ DCs for induction of potent immunities without extra adjuvant formulation. Fusion antigen with FLIPr enables effective antigen presentation on both MHC class II and class I to induce memory T cell responses. Altogether, using FLIPr as an antigen delivery vector has great potential to apply antigens for cancer immunotherapy as well as other infectious disease vaccines. ? 2019 Chiang, Wu, Chen, Liu, Leng and Chen.","CD40 antigen; endotoxin; epitope; Fc receptor; FLICE inhibitory protein; formylpeptide receptor like 1; gamma interferon; interleukin 2; interleukin 7 receptor; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; ovalbumin; adaptive immunity; amino acid sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antigen presentation; antineoplastic activity; Article; binding assay; bioassay; cancer immunotherapy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; Dengue virus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; Escherichia coli; expression vector; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; immunoblotting; killing assay; memory T lymphocyte; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; protein expression; protein purification; spleen cell; Staphylococcus aureus; T lymphocyte activation; tumor growth; tumor immunity; vaccination"
"Effect of radiofrequency-based renal denervation: The impact of unplanned medication change from a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) has emerged as a promising treatment option for hypertension. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported conflicting results on blood pressure (BP) reduction. Patient-and procedure-related confounders have been implied as the potential sources of inconsistent BP responses. We aimed to investigated whether unplanned and frequent medication changes in RDN studies affected the BP response to RDN by conducting sensitivity and subgroup analyses, according to antihypertensive medication change rates in a meta-analysis of RCTs. Methods: We searched the PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases up to May 2018. RCTs that studied the effects of RDN on hypertensive patients were included. A meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.3. Results: A total of 12 studies were included, of which four fulfilled the inclusion criteria of &lt; 10% medication change rate in our review. Subgroup meta-analyses of the four RCTs with &lt; 10% medication change rates showed statistically significant reductions of 6.07 mmHg and 7.12 mmHg in 24-hour and office systolic BP, respectively. The 24-hour and office diastolic BP were also reduced (mean difference =-3.89 mmHg and-4.27 mmHg, respectively). These subgroup analyses had no heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). In contrast, the pooled analysis of the 12 studies and the subgroup analysis of eight studies with &gt; 10% medication change rates both had a high level of heterogeneity and no significant BP reduction. Conclusions: The effectiveness of RDN was demonstrated across a broad range of antihypertensive medications used at baseline after removing the confounder of unplanned medication changes. ? 2019, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

"Protease-activated receptor 2 induces migration and promotes Slug-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma cells",2019,"Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G protein-coupled receptor for trypsin, contributes to growth, anti-apoptosis, and migration in lung cancer. Given that PAR2 activation in airway epithelial cells compromises the airway epithelium barrier by disruption of E-cadherin adhesion, PAR2 may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Although PAR2 is known to promote the migration of lung cancer cells, the detailed mechanism of this event is still not clear. Here, we found that PAR2 is highly expressed in several lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. In two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, CL1-5 and H1299 cells, activation of PAR2 induces migration and Slug-mediated EMT. The underlying mechanisms involved in PAR2-induced migration and EMT in CL1-5 cells were further investigated. We showed that PAR2-induced migration of CL1-5 cells is mediated by the Src/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway. β-arrestin 1, not G protein, is involved in this PAR2-mediated Src/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. PAR2-induced EMT in CL1-5 cells is dependent on the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). The activation of ERK2 further mediates Slug stabilization through suppressing the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In addition, a poor prognosis was observed in lung adenocarcinoma patients with a high expression of PAR2. Thus, PAR2 regulates migration through β-arrestin 1-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and EMT through ERK2-mediated stabilization of Slug in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our finding also suggests that PAR2 might serve as a therapeutic target for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","beta arrestin 1; beta arrestin 2; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; guanine nucleotide binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; nerve cell adhesion molecule; proteinase activated receptor 2; transcription factor Slug; uvomorulin; vimentin; beta arrestin 1; cadherin; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; MAPK1 protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; proteinase activated receptor 2; SNAI1 protein, human; transcription factor Snail; Article; cancer prognosis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell surface; CL1-5 cell line; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelioid cell; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma; MAPK signaling; NCI-H1299 cell line; overall survival; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein stability; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; apoptosis; cell motion; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelium cell; genetics; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Apoptosis; beta-Arrestin 1; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Epithelial Cells; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Receptor, PAR-2; Signal Transduction; Snail Family Transcription Factors"
"An Aptamer Based Sandwich Assay for Simultaneous Detection of Multiple Cardiovascular Biomarkers on A Multilayered Integrated Microfluidic System",2019,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have resulted in an estimated death toll of nearly 17 million yearly. Early detection of CVDs may reduce the risk of sudden deaths. The current technologies based on antigen-antibody interactions have limitations in point-of-care (POC) applications. This study therefore reports an aptamer magnetic bead-based assay which is relatively sensitive and highly selective on a new integrated microfluidic platform for simultaneous analysis of up to six untreated clinical serum samples utilizing less than a volume of 10 μL from each patient. Experimental results showed that one of the important biomarkers for CVDs, cardiac troponin I, could be detected on the microfluidic platform in less than 35 minutes with a limit of detection of 0.01 ng/mL. It may provide a promising device for POC applications. ? 2019 IEEE.","Actuators; Biomarkers; Cardiology; Diseases; Microsystems; Solid-state sensors; Antigen-antibody interaction; Aptamers; Cardiac troponin I; Cardio-vascular disease; Integrated microfluidic systems; Integrated microfluidics; Microfluidic platforms; Simultaneous detection; Microfluidics"
"Living Arrangements and Sleep-Related Outcomes Among Older Adults in China: A Panel Analytic Approach",2019,"It has been discussed previously that older adults’ living arrangements are associated with mortality. This study investigated the relationships between older adults’ living arrangements and sleep-related outcomes in China. The nationally representative sample included 4,731 participants who participated on two different occasions, with a total of 9,462 observations (2012 and 2014 waves). Panel logistic regression and panel ordinary least squares regression models were estimated with outcomes of sleep quality and average hours of sleep daily, respectively. Approximately 62% of individuals reported good quality of sleep. We observed that older adults who lived with family members had 17% greater odds of reporting good quality of sleep (adjusted odds ratio = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [1.03, 1.34], p <.05) and reported longer sleep duration daily (β =.334, standard error =.069, p <.01), compared with those who lived alone. Social support is needed to strengthen the residential relationship, especially with family members. ?

"S100A4 inhibits cell proliferation by interfering with the S100A1-RAGE V domain",2019,"The Ca 2+ -dependent human S100A4 (Mts1) protein is part of the S100 family. Here, we studied the interactions of S100A4 with S100A1 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We used the chemical shift perturbed residues from HSQC to model S100A4 and S100A1 complex with HADDOCK software. We observed that S100A1 and the RAGE V domain have an analogous binding area in S100A4. We discovered that S100A4 acts as an antagonist among the RAGE V domain and S100A1, which inhibits tumorigenesis and cell proliferation. We used a WST-1 assay to examine the bioactivity of S100A1 and S100A4. This study could possibly be beneficial for evaluating new proteins for the treatment of diseases. ? 2019 Khan et al.

"A virtual laboratory for learning fullerene production and nanostructure analysis",2019,"Nanotechnology is an emerging technology and it brings a tremendous change to human life and economy. When the size of a material is reduced to the nanoscale, its properties may change significantly and becomes a new substance. A fullerene is a molecule of carbon in the shape of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other geometrical structures. For example, buckyballs are spherical fullerenes and carbon nanotubes are cylindrical fullerenes. Fullerenes have been under intensive investigation for their expanding applications in electronics, energy, medicine, and many other research fields. Nanostructure analysis is very important for understanding the formation of different materials and their properties. In this study, a virtual laboratory is developed for learning fullerene production and its nanostructure analysis. The learners can use the arc discharge equipment to produce fullerenes and then use the transmission electron microscope (TEM) to observe the nanostructures of different fullerene samples. The high interactivity and 3D visual effects of the virtual laboratory enable the learners to become familiar with the geometrical structures and properties of fullerenes. A teaching experiment has been conducted and the results show that the virtual laboratory can improve their learning motivation and effectiveness. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","E-learning; Geometry; Laboratories; Nanotechnology; Transmission electron microscopy; Virtual reality; Yarn; Arc discharge; Emerging technologies; Fullerene production; Geometrical structure; Learning motivation; Nanostructure analysis; Spherical fullerenes; Virtual laboratories; Fullerenes"
"The stability and immunogenicity of inactivated MDCK cell-derived influenza H7N9 viruses",2019,"In recent years, cell-based influenza vaccines have gained a great interest over the egg-based vaccines. Several inactivated H7N9 vaccines have been evaluated in clinical trials, including whole-virion vaccines, split vaccines and subunit vaccines. Recently, we developed a new suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cell line for influenza viruses production. However, the properties of purified antigen from sMDCK cells remain unclear. In this study, the stability of influenza H7N9 vaccine bulk derived from sMDCK cells was investigated, and the data were compared with the vaccine antigen derived from our characterized adhesion MDCK (aMDCK) cells in serum-free medium. The influenza H7N9 bulks derived from sMDCK and aMDCK cells were stored at 2–8 °C for different periods of time, and a number of parameters selected to monitor the H7N9 vaccine antigen stability were evaluated at each interval (1, 3 and 12 months). The monitored parameters included virus morphology, hemagglutinin (HA) activity, HA concentration, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. The sMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk showed similar morphology to that of the aMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk, and there were no obvious changes after the extended storage periods. Furthermore, the HA titer, HA concentration, and antigenicity of sMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk were stable after 28 months of storage. Finally, the results of hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization tests showed that sMDCK- and aMDCK-derived H7N9 vaccines had comparable immunogenicity. These results indicated that sMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk has good stability compared to that of aMDCK-derived H7N9 bulk. Thus, the newly developed suspension MDCK cell line shows a great alternative for manufacturing cell-based influenza vaccines. ? 2019 The Authors","aluminum hydroxide; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; adjuvant therapy; animal experiment; antigenicity; Article; cell suspension; controlled study; drug stability; female; hemagglutination inhibition test; immunogenicity; Influenza A virus (H7N9); MDCK cell line; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; virus neutralization; virus particle"
"Metformin was associated with lower all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes with acute coronary syndrome: A Nationwide registry with propensity score-matched analysis",2019,"Background: No randomized controlled trials evaluating metformin therapy efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been reported. We aimed to examine the mortality benefit of metformin therapy in patients with type 2 DM and ACS, compared with non-metformin anti-diabetes agents users. Methods: Data were extracted from the prospective nationwide ACS-DM Taiwan Society of Cardiology registry. Propensity score (PS) matching on baseline characteristics and treatment measures was performed for metformin versus non-metformin users. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare mortality outcomes among the PS-matched cohort as the primary analysis. The Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for all pre-determined covariates and quintiles of the PS among the overall population were performed as the secondary analyses. Results: Of 1157 patients with type 2 DM and ACS receiving anti-diabetes agents, 78 patients (6.7%) died over the 2-year follow-up period. After PS matching, 318 metformin users were matched with 318 non-metformin users. Metformin users had a lower all-cause mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26–0.95) in the primary analysis. The survival benefit of metformin therapy was consistent in the secondary analyses (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17–0.54 while adjusting for all pre-determined covariates, and aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19–0.59 while adjusting for quintiles of the PS). Conclusions: Among patients with type 2 DM and ACS, metformin was associated with lower all-cause mortality. However, a detrimental effect of any of the comparators could not be excluded. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","angiotensin receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; inotropic agent; insulin; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; acute coronary syndrome; adult; all cause mortality; Article; cardiology; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease registry; drug efficacy; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; medical society; monotherapy; mortality; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; priority journal; propensity score; Taiwan; treatment response"
"An integrated self-driven microfluidic device for rapid detection of the influenza A (H1N1) virus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification",2019,"Influenza A is amongst the most infectious diseases of the past decade. Although rapid and accurate detection can efficiently prevent its spread, the sensitivity and specificity of current rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are relatively low. In this study, a self-driven microfluidic device was developed to rapidly detect the H1N1 influenza virus via a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay. The device was capable of 1) virus isolation via H1N1-specific aptamers conjugated magnetic beads, 2) virus lysis, 3) isothermal nucleic acid amplification, and 4) colorimetric detection of the virus. The limit of detection was measured to be only 3 × 10?4 hemagglutinating units (HAU)/reaction, which is sensitive enough for clinical applications. The entire procedure could be performed in only 40 min by capillary forces through a novel polydimethylsiloxane surface treatment in cooperation with hydrophobic soft valves. This is the first time that a simple, self-driven passive microfluidic chip has been demonstrated to be capable of performing sample pretreatment, RT-LAMP, and H1N1 virus detection on a single chip. This microfluidic chip may therefore serve a promising RIDT with high sensitivity and high specificity for point-of-care diagnostics in the near future. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Diagnosis; Fluidic devices; Isotherms; Nucleic acids; Silicones; Surface treatment; Transcription; Viruses; Capillary-driven; Colorimetric detection; Diagnostic tests; Influenza A; Loop mediated isothermal amplifications; Micro-fluidic devices; Point of care diagnostic; Sensitivity and specificity; Microfluidics"
"Relationship between body mass index, antidiabetic agents, and midterm mortality in patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome",2019,"Background-The aim of this study was to determine the influence of various antidiabetic therapies on the relationship between body mass index and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. Methods and Results-This was a prospective, observational study comprising 1193 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. The patients were stratified into 4 body mass index categories, and their mortality rates were compared using time-dependent Cox regression analysis using normal weight (body mass index, 18.5-23.9) as the reference. Subsequently, the influence of antidiabetic therapies on the association between BMI and mortality were analyzed. Seventy-four patients (6.2%) died over 2 years of follow-up. The mortality rate was lowest in the class I obese group (3.35%) and highest in the normal-weight group (9.67%). After adjusting for covariates, class I obesity paradoxically remained significantly protective against mortality compared with normal weight (hazard ratio, 0.141; P=0.049); interaction term analysis showed that insulin therapy influenced this “obesity paradox” (P=0.045). When the patients were stratified by insulin use, the protective effect of obesity disappeared in the insulin-treated patients but persisted in the non-insulin-treated patients. Conclusions-In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome, the relationship between body mass index and mortality rate is U-shaped, with class I obesity representing the nadir and normal weight the peak. The protective effect of obesity disappeared in patients treated with insulin. ? 2019 The Authors.","angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; sulfonylurea; acute coronary syndrome; adult; adverse outcome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; body weight; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug use; female; follow up; human; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; treatment response"
"Graphene Quantum Dots Decorated Gold-Polyaniline Nanowire for Impedimetric Detection of Carcinoembryonic Antigen",2019,"A label-free impedimetric immunosensor based on N, S-graphene quantum dots@Au-polyaniline (N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI) nanowires was fabricated for the quantitative detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The N, S-GQDs and Au-PANI were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal pyrolysis and interfacial polymerization, respectively. Subsequently, 2–9 nm N, S-GQDs are successfully decorated onto 30–50 nm Au-PANI nanowires by Au-thiol linkage to serve as the bifunctional probe for amplifying the electrochemical activity as well as anchoring anti-CEA. The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires are excellent conducting materials to accelerate the electron transfer, while the formation of CEA antibody-antigen bioconjugates after the addition of CEA significantly increase the charge transfer resistance, and subsequently provides a highly stable and label-free immunoassay platform for the impedimetric detection of CEA. The label-free immunosensor exhibits a wide linear range from 0.5 to 1000 ng mL ?1 with a low detection limit of 0.01 ng mL ?1 . The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI based immunosensor also shows high selectivity and stability over other cancer makers and amino acids. Moreover, this promising platform is successfully applied to the detection of CEA in human serum samples with excellent recovery of (96.0 ± 2.6)–(103 ± 3.8)%. These results clearly demonstrate a newly developed highly efficient and label-free impedimetric immunosensor for the detection of CEA using N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires as the biosensing probe, which can pave the gateway for the fabrication of high performance and robust impedimetric immunosensor to detect cancer makers in early stage of cancer diagnosis and therapy. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Aerosol delivery into small anatomical airway model through spontaneous engineered breathing",2019,"Pulmonary administration is a noninvasive drug delivery method that, in contrast to systemic administration, reduces drug dosage and possible side effects. Numerous testing models, such as impingers and impactors, have previously been developed to evaluate the fate of inhaled drugs. However, such models are limited by the lack of information regarding several factors, such as pulmonary morphology and breathing motion, which are required to fully interpret actual inhaled-drug deposition profiles within the human respiratory tract. In this study, a spontaneous breathing-lung model that integrates branched morphology and deformable alveolar features was constructed using a multilayered fabrication technology to mimic the complex environment of the human lower respiratory tract. The developed model could emulate cyclic and spontaneous breathing motions to inhale and exhale aerosols generated by a nebulizer under diseaselike conditions. Results of this research demonstrate that aerosols (4.2 μm) could reach up to the deeper lung regions (generation 19 of the branched lung structure) within the obstructivelike model, whereas lesser penetration (generation 17) was observed when using the restrictivelike model. The proposed breathing-lung model can serve as a testing platform to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pharmacokinetics of pulmonary drugs within the lower lungs. ? 2019 Author(s).","Aerosols; Biological organs; Controlled drug delivery; Drug dosage; Drug interactions; Morphology; Targeted drug delivery; Breathing motions; Complex environments; Fabrication Technologies; Human respiratory tract; Pulmonary administrations; Spontaneous breathing; Systemic administration; Testing platforms; Physiological models"
"Citronellol induces necroptosis of human lung cancer cells via TNF-α pathway and reactive oxygen species accumulation",2019,"Background/Aim: Our current study aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms of citronellol-induced cell death and ROS accumulation in non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H1299 cells) and also compare the anticancer effects of citronellol and EOPC. Materials and Methods: ROS measurement and western blotting were performed to detect whether citronellol can induce necroptosis in vitro. Besides, we performed an in vivo analysis of tumourigenesis inhibition by citronellol treatment in BALB/c (nu/nu) nude mice. Results: Necroptosis occured by up-regulating TNF-?, RIP1/RIP3 activities, and down-regulating caspase-3/caspase-8 activities after citronellol treatment in NCI-H1299 cells. Citronellol also resulted in a biphasic increase in ROS production at 1 h and at 12 h in NCI-H1299 cells. Xenograft model experiments showed that citronellol could effectively inhibit subcutaneous tumours produced 4 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of NCI-H1299 in BALB/c nude mice.

"Cordycepin suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and tumor growth by regulating focal Adhesion Kinase and p53",2019,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays an important role in vascular development, including the regulation of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. 3’-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) is known to suppress FAK expression, cell migration, and the epithelial–mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether cordycepin affects FAK expression and cellular functions in ECs and the specific molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we found that cordycepin suppressed FAK expression and the phosphorylation of FAK (p-FAK) at Tyr397 in ECs. Cordycepin inhibited the proliferation, wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation of ECs. Confocal microscopy revealed that cordycepin significantly reduced FAK expression and decreased focal adhesion number of ECs. The suppressed expression of FAK was accompanied by induced p53 and p21 expression in ECs. Finally, we demonstrated that cordycepin suppressed angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis assay and reduced HCC tumor growth in a xenograft nude mice model. Our study indicated that cordycepin could attenuate cell proliferation and migration and may result in the impairment of the angiogenesis process and tumor growth via downregulation of FAK and induction of p53 and p21 in ECs. Therefore, cordycepin may be used as a potential adjuvant for cancer therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Engineered resistance to Zika virus in transgenic Aedes aegypti expressing a polycistronic cluster of synthetic small RNAs",2019,"Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have highlighted the necessity for development of novel vector control strategies to combat arboviral transmission, including genetic versions of the sterile insect technique, artificial infection with Wolbachia to reduce population size and/or vectoring competency, and gene drive-based methods. Here, we describe the development of mosquitoes synthetically engineered to impede vector competence to ZIKV. We demonstrate that a polycistronic cluster of engineered synthetic small RNAs targeting ZIKV is expressed and fully processed in Aedes aegypti, ensuring the formation of mature synthetic small RNAs in the midgut where ZIKV resides in the early stages of infection. Critically, we demonstrate that engineered Ae. aegypti mosquitoes harboring the anti-ZIKV transgene have significantly reduced viral infection, dissemination, and transmission rates of ZIKV. Taken together, these compelling results provide a promising path forward for development of effective genetic-based ZIKV control strategies, which could potentially be extended to curtail other arboviruses. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Concurrent osteosarcoma theranostic strategy using contrast-enhanced ultrasound and drug-loaded bubbles",2019,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone tumor in children and teenagers. The multidrug resistant property of OS produces a major obstacle to chemotherapy, since the effective drug dose cannot be achieved via conventional drug delivery routes without serious systemic cytotoxicity. Microbubbles in conjunction with ultrasound (US) has recently been shown to spatially and temporally permeabilize the cellular membrane, promoting drug penetration into tumors. Here, we investigated whether drug (doxorubicin, DOX)-loaded bubbles (DOX-bubbles) can serve as drug-loaded carriers in combination with US in order to facilitate tumor drug delivery. The proposed bubbles have a high payload capacity (efficiency of 69.4 ± 9.1%, payload of 1.4 mg/mL) for DOX. In vitro data revealed that when used in combination with US (1-MHz), these DOX-bubbles facilitate DOX entering into tumor cells. In tumor-bearing animals, DOX-bubbles + US could provide 3.7-fold suppression of tumor growth compared with the group without insonation (1.8 ± 0.9 cm3 vs. 8.5 ± 2.2 cm3) because of the acceleration of DOX-induced tumor necrosis. In the meantime, the tumor perfusion and volume can be monitored by DOX-bubbles with contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. Our data provide useful information in support of translating the use of theranostic US-responsive bubbles for regulated tumor drug delivery into clinical use. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Advances in exosomes technology",2019,"Exosomes, also called extracellular vesicles (EVs), are membranous structures measuring between 40 and 100 nm. Exosomes, secreted by various cells of the human body into body fluids, contain protein, mRNA, miRNA, and signaling molecules. Physiologically, exosomes assist in the intercellular transport of protein and RNA. Immunologically, exosomes exhibit antigen-presenting capability. In recent studies, exosomes were found to be associated with the pathophysiology of cardiovascular, renal, neurological, and ocular diseases. In addition, exosomes may play a major role in cancer metastasis. Due to the extremely small size and scarcity of exosomes in living samples, many early studies utilized sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation for exosome collection. However, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation is rather time consuming and requires large biological sample quantities. Newer exosome studies combined immunoaffinity and microfluidic system approaches for more efficient exosome collection. Our review summarizes existing methods for EV isolation and notes their advantages and disadvantages. These promising approaches are all characterized by isolation efficiency, and savings in cost, labor, and time. Optimization of current methods is a necessary step toward clinically-relevant diagnostic product production, but the fact that EVs are already widely used in disease diagnosis and treatment encourages continued efforts. ? 2019","heparin; macrogol; microRNA; tumor marker; diagnostic value; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exosome; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; immunomagnetic separation; microfluidics; precipitation; priority journal; protein aggregation; Review; scanning electron microscopy; size exclusion chromatography; sucrose density gradient centrifugation; transcriptomics; ultrafiltration; affinity chromatography; chemistry; density gradient centrifugation; exosome; microfluidic analysis; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; Chromatography, Affinity; Exosomes; Humans; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques"
"Generating digital drug cocktails: Via optical manipulation of drug-containing particles and photo-patterning of hydrogels",2019,"An integrated microfluidic system combining 1) an optically-induced-dielectrophoresis (ODEP) module for manipulation of drug-containing particles and 2) an ultraviolet (UV) ""direct writing"" module capable of patterning hydrogels was established herein for automatic formulation of customized digital drug cocktails. Using the ODEP module, the drug-containing particles were assembled by using moving light patterns generated from a digital projector. The hydrogel, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), was used as the medium in the ODEP module such that the assembled drug-containing particles could be UV-cured and consequently encapsulated in ""pills"" of specific sizes and shapes by using the UV direct writing module. At an optimal ODEP force of 335 pN, which was achieved in a solution of 15% PEGDA in 0.2 M sucrose, it was possible to manipulate and UV-cure the drug-containing particles. Furthermore, with a digital micromirror device inside the UV direct writing module, different UV patterns could be designed and projected, allowing for the digital drug cocktails to be packaged into different shapes in <60 s. As a demonstration, emulsion droplets containing two different anti-cancer drugs were further tested to show the capability of the developed device. This represents an automatic digital drug cocktail formulating device which stands to revolutionize personalized medicine. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","macrogol derivative; sucrose; acrylic acid derivative; antineoplastic agent; etoposide; fluorouracil; macrogol; Article; emulsion; hydrogel; light; light intensity; microtechnology; optics; priority journal; ultraviolet radiation; chemistry; electrophoresis; fluorescence imaging; human; hydrogel; microfluidic analysis; particle size; personalized medicine; photochemistry; surface property; Acrylates; Antineoplastic Agents; Electrophoresis; Etoposide; Fluorouracil; Humans; Hydrogels; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Optical Imaging; Particle Size; Photochemical Processes; Polyethylene Glycols; Precision Medicine; Surface Properties; Ultraviolet Rays"
"Development of photo-activated ROS-responsive nanoplatform as a dual-functional drug carrier in combinational chemo-photodynamic therapy",2019,"Dual functional drug carrier has been a modern strategy in cancer therapy because it is a platform to elicit additive and synergistic effects through combination therapy. Photo-activated external stimuli such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) also ensure adequate drug delivery in a precise temporal and spatial manner. However, current ROS-responsive drug delivery systems usually require tedious synthetic procedures. A facile one-pot approach has been reported herein, to obtain self-assembled polymeric nanocarriers (NCs) for simultaneous paclitaxel (PTX)- and Rose Bengal (RB)-loading to achieve combined chemo-photodynamic therapy and controlled drug release in responsive to a light-induced ROS stimulus. To encapsulate these hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, chitosan (CTS), branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were selected and fabricated into nanoblended matrices through an oil-in-water emulsion method. The amphiphilic properties of CTS permit simultaneous entrapment of PTX and RB, while the encapsulation efficiency of RB was further improved by increasing the amount of short-chain bPEI. During the one-step assembly process, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also added to condense the cationic tripolymer mixtures into more stable nanocarriers (BNCs). Hyaluronic acid (HA) was subsequently grafted onto the surface of BNCs through electrostatic interaction, leading to the formation of HA-BSA/CTS/PVA/bPEI-blended nanocarriers (HBNCs) to achieve an efficient prostate-cancer-cell uptake. Importantly, in response to external light irradiation, HBNCs become destabilized owing to the RB-mediated photodynamic action. It allows an on-demand dual-payload release to evoke a simultaneous photodynamic and chemo treatment for cancer cell eradication. Thus, HBNCs present a new promising approach that exhibits a specific vulnerability to RB-induced photosensitization. The consequent dual-cargo release is also expected to successfully combat cancer through a synergistic anti-tumor effect. ? 2019 Chang, del Valle, Yeh, He and Huang.",""
"Recommended limit for time spent in daily sedentary behaviors among adults",2019,"Prolonged sitting is increasingly being considered a severe concern in public health recommendations, which suggests that all adults should reduce the amount of daily sedentary time. This review examines several crucial aspects of sedentary behaviors and health and discusses the possibilities of developing public health guidelines on daily sedentary time. The following issues were observed and analyzed to review the evidence regarding sedentary time and health: First, the profile of the daily sedentary time of adults across different countries was described. Second, the physical activity guidelines provided by the World Health Organization or government authorities of various countries were reviewed. Third, evidence was obtained on systematic reviews and meta-analyses to explore the recommended limit of daily sedentary time; spending a higher amount of time on sedentary activities than the recommended threshold may damage adult health. Fourth, measurement methods of sedentary behaviors may moderate the associations between sedentary time and mortality across studies. Finally, conclusions and suggestions for future research were proposed. In summary, an increased sedentary time is associated with high morbidity and mortality risks in adults. Self-reported questionnaires typically underestimate the total sedentary time compared with that obtained using device-based measures. Recent metaanalyses revealed that sedentary time of >9 h/day may increase the all-cause mortality risk. However, based on few studies conducted with objectively-assessed sedentary time, the current evidence is insufficient to form guidelines. More large-scale and long-term prospective studies with objective measures of sedentary time are required to validate these findings.

"Large-area blade-coated organic solar cells processed from halogen-free solvent",2019,"High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are generally prepared by halogenated solvents, which are detrimental to the environment and human health. The replacement of hazardous halogenated solvents is a priority in the commercialization of solution-processed OSCs. In this study, poly[4,8?bis(5?(2?ethylhexyl)thiophen?2?yl)benzo[1,2?b;4,5?b’]dithiophene?2,6?diyl?alt?(4?(2?ethylhexyl)?3?fluorothieno[3,4?b]thiophene?)?2?carboxylate?2?6-diyl)] (PBDTTT?EFT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)-based device processed with binary halogen-free solvents (toluene and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) is fabricated by blade-coating method. Through the combination of morphological manipulation of active layer and interfacial engineering, the resulting OSCs deliver a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.09%. Importantly, large-area (216 cm2) blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs is also demonstrated, and the resulting devices deliver a high PCE up to 5.03%, which is comparable to those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents (PCE = 5.20%). Additionally, the devices processed with halogen-free solvents also exhibit superior stability, maintaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 3960 h of continuous operation. More encouragingly, halogen-free solvents-based manufacturing process can also be performed under ambient conditions, and a moderate PCE of 3.67% is attained for large-area (216 cm2) OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 3.67% represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed large-area OSCs.

"Utilizing Online Stochastic Optimization on Scheduling of Intensity-Modulate Radiotherapy Therapy (IMRT)",2019,"According to Ministry of Health and Welfare Address of Taiwan, cancer has become the highest death rates among all causes of death in Taiwan from 1982 to 2016. The Intensive-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is one of the most important cancer's radiotherapy process, and it is critical for cancer patients to receive the treatment as soon as possible. Therefore, having an effective patient scheduling model can not only reduce the patients' waiting time but improve the IMRT treatment quality. This study proposed a mathematical model to improve patient scheduling efficiency, and this research considered the practical characteristics in actual medical procedures. The mathematical model was validated in a specific case, but the same method can be applied in other radiotherapy scheduling. ? 2019 IEEE.","Diseases; Genetic algorithms; Scheduling; Causes of death; Intensity-modulated radiation therapy; Medical procedures; Online stochastic scheduling; Scheduling efficiencies; Scheduling models; Stochastic optimizations; Treatment quality; Radiotherapy"
"A microfluidic platform integrated with field-effect transistors for enumeration of circulating tumor cells",2019,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are one of the promising cancer biomarkers whose concentrations are measured not only in the initial diagnostic stages, but also as treatment progresses. However, the existing methods for CTC detection are relatively time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a new microfluidic platform integrated with field-effect transistors (FETs) and chambers for the trapping of CTCs was developed. This novel design could not only trap CTCs from whole blood samples, but also enumerate them via FET sensing of CTC-specific aptamer-CTC complexes. The FET output signal was experimentally found to increase with the increasing number of captured CTCs. More importantly, the enumeration of spiked CTCs in blood samples could be achieved in accordance with the signals measured on the FET devices. We therefore believe that this automated system could be a useful tool for enumeration of CTCs. ?

"Simultaneous Recovery of Display Panel Waste Glass and Wastewater Boron by Chemical Oxo-precipitation with Fluidized-Bed Heterogeneous Crystallization",2019,"Silica-based carrier is a promising material for recovery of metal and nonmetal contaminants in chemical oxo-precipitation-fluidized bed crystallization (COP-FBC) system. Boron species are an essential element for plant growth and can cause health concerns in human beings at high concentrations in water environments. The composition of thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) contains a wide variety of metal oxides and can be tailored as promising functional mesoporous carriers for boron crystallization recovery in the presence of barium ions and hydrogen peroxide. In this study, waste-derived mesoporous aluminosilicate (MAS) nanomaterial in the presence of barium ions and hydrogen peroxide was used as a carrier for sustainable recovery of crystallized boron, a priority wastewaters pollutant. The MAS shows the hierarchically homogeneous distribution of nanostructured aluminosilicate particles with an average size of 12.8 ± 3.6 nm on the surface after the activation with Na2CO3 at 1000 °C. Moreover, the negatively charged surface and the mesoporous structure of MAS enhance the adsorption of Ba2+ onto MAS, and the Langmuir adsorption capacity of 105 mg/g is achieved, which is conducive to the enhancement of the recovery of boron species. Moreover, the recovery efficiency and crystallization ratio of boron by MAS can be up to 84.5 and 93.4%, respectively. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy images and the high-temperature X-ray diffraction results confirm the boron recovery mechanism that the negatively charged functional group as well as the mesoporosity of MAS triggers the rapid formation of needle-shaped precipitates of barium peroxoborate, and then converted to barium borate after calcination at 1050 °C. Results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate the possibility of fabricating environmentally benign mesoporous aluminosilicate adsorbents from TFT-LCD waste to sustainably recover and crystallize boron species from water and wastewater in COP-FBC.

"A comparison of dose distributions in gross tumor volume between boron neutron capture therapy alone and combined boron neutron capture therapy plus intensity modulation radiation therapy for head and neck cancer",2019,"Nine patients with recurrent head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer received boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in one fraction at the Tsing-Hua Open pool reactor (THOR) utilizing the THORplan treatment planning system (TPS). The aims of the present study were to evaluate the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of 45 Gy in 20 fractions to compensate for the dose heterogeneity in gross tumor volume observed with single-fraction BNCT with mean prescription dose 19 Gy (w), and to evaluate planning quality indices of simulated BNCT+IMRT versus single-fraction BNCT alone. All IMRT plans were generated using the Eclipse TPS which employs the analytical anisotropic algorithm. The conformity index for the gross tumor volume (GTV) was better for the BNCT+IMRT plan than for the BNCT-alone plan (p = 0.003). In addition, the BNCT+IMRT plan provided significantly better homogeneity in the GTV (p = 0.03). The cold spots in inhomogeneous dose distribution in the BNCT plan may be a key factor for H&amp;N cancer recurrence. Our results suggest that single-fraction BNCT combined with compensated multi-fraction IMRT improves treatment homogeneity and conformity than single-fraction BNCT alone, especially for tumor volumes &gt;100 cm 3 , and possibly increases local tumor control. ? 2019 Lee et al.

"A novel AURKA mutant-induced early-onset severe hepatocarcinogenesis greater than wild-type via activating different pathways in Zebrafish",2019,"Aurora A kinase (AURKA) is an important regulator in mitotic progression and is overexpressed frequently in human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Many AURKA mutations were identified in cancer patients. Overexpressing wild-type Aurka developed a low incidence of hepatic tumors after long latency in mice. However, none of the AURKA mutant animal models have ever been described. The mechanism of mutant AURKA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. A novel AURKA mutation with a.a.352 Valine to Isoleucine (V352I) was identified from clinical specimens. By using liver-specific transgenic fish overexpressing both the mutant and wild-type AURKA, the AURKA(V352I)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis was earlier and much more severe than wild-type AURKA. Although an increase of the expression of lipogenic enzyme and lipogenic factor was observed in both AURKA(V352I) and AURKA(WT) transgenic fish, AURKA(V352I) has a greater probability to promote fibrosis at 3 months compared to AURKA(WT). Furthermore, the expression levels of cell cycle/proliferation markers were higher in the AURKA(V352I) mutant than AURKA(WT) in transgenic fish, implying that the AURKA(V352I) mutant may accelerate HCC progression. Moreover, we found that the AURKA(V352I) mutant activates AKT signaling and increases nuclear β-catenin, but AURKA(WT) only activates membrane form β-catenin, which may account for the differences. In this study, we provide a new insight, that the AURKA(V352I) mutation contributes to early onset hepatocarcinogenesis, possibly through activation of different pathways than AURKA(WT). This transgenic fish may serve as a drug-screening platform for potential precision medicine therapeutics. ? 2019 by the authors.","aurora A kinase; beta catenin; carbohydrate responsive element binding protein; cell protein; connective tissue growth factor; cycline; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; fatty acid synthase; heparanase; isoleucine; mammalian target of rapamycin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidate phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; unclassified drug; valine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; AURKA gene; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cell cycle; cell proliferation; cola1a1 gene; controlled study; ctgfa gene; disease severity; fibrosis; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; gene overexpression; hpse gene; liver carcinogenesis; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; transgenic fish; upregulation; zebra fish"
"Pattern formation of skin cancers: Effects of cancer proliferation and hydrodynamic interactions",2019,"We study pattern formation of skin cancers by means of numerical simulation of a binary system consisting of cancer and healthy cells. We extend the conventional model H for macrophase separations by considering a logistic growth of cancer cells and also a mechanical friction between dermis and epidermis. Importantly, our model exhibits a microphase separation due to the proliferation of cancer cells. By numerically solving the time evolution equations of the cancer composition and its velocity, we show that the phase separation kinetics strongly depends on the cell proliferation rate as well as on the strength of hydrodynamic interactions. A steady-state diagram of cancer patterns is established in terms of these two dynamical parameters and some of the patterns correspond to clinically observed cancer patterns. Furthermore, we examine in detail the time evolution of the average composition of cancer cells and the characteristic length of the microstructures. Our results demonstrate that different sequence of cancer patterns can be obtained by changing the proliferation rate and/or hydrodynamic interactions. ? 2019 American Physical Society.","Cell proliferation; Cells; Cytology; Hydrodynamics; Microphase separation; Phase separation; Cell proliferation rate; Characteristic length; Conventional modeling; Dynamical parameters; Hydrodynamic interaction; Macro phase separation; Phase separation kinetics; Time evolution equations; Diseases; biological model; cell proliferation; computer simulation; dermis; disease exacerbation; epidermis; human; hydrodynamics; pathology; pathophysiology; skin tumor; time factor; Cell Proliferation; Computer Simulation; Dermis; Disease Progression; Epidermis; Humans; Hydrodynamics; Models, Biological; Skin Neoplasms; Time Factors"
"Indocyanine green/doxorubicin-encapsulated functionalized nanoparticles for effective combination therapy against human MDR breast cancer",2019,"To overcome low therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy against multidrug resistance (MDR) breast cancer, a combination therapy system based upon functionalized polymer nanoparticles comprising poly(γ-glutamic acid)-g-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (γ-PGA-g-PLGA) as the major component was developed. The NPs were loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and indocyanine green (ICG) for dual modality cancer treatment and coated with cholesterol-PEG (C-PEG) for MDR abrogation in treatment of human MDR breast cancer. The in vitro cellular uptake of the DOX/ICG loaded nanoparticles (DI-NPs) by MDR cancer cells was significantly enhanced owing to effective inhibition of the P-gp activity by C-PEG and γ-PGA receptor-mediated endocytosis. DOX localization in cytoplasm and nucleus was observed particularly with the photo-thermal effect that facilitated intracellular drug release. As a result, the C-PEG coated DI-NPs after photo-irradiation exhibited a synergistic effect of combination (chemo/thermal) therapy to depress the proliferation of MDR cancer calls. The ex vivo biodistribution study revealed an enhanced tumor accumulation of C-PEG (2000) coated DI-NPs in MCF-7/MDR tumor-bearing nude mice due to the excellent EPR effects by the NP surface PEGylation. The MDR tumor growth was almost entirely inhibited in the group receiving combination therapy from CP2k-DI-NPs and photo-irradiation along with substantial cell apoptosis of tumor tissues examined by immunohistochemical staining.

"Histogram analysis of prostate cancer on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: A preliminary study emphasizing on zonal difference",2019,"Background This study evaluated the performance of histogram analysis in the time course of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for differentiating cancerous tissues from benign tissues in the prostate. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the histograms of DCE-MRI of 30 patients. Histograms within regions of interest(ROI) in the peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ) were separately analyzed. The maximum difference wash-in slope (MWS) and delay phase slope (DPS) were defined for each voxel. Differences in histogram parameters, namely the mean, standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of variation (CV), kurtosis, skewness, interquartile range (IQR), percentile (P10, P25, P75, P90, and P90P10), Range, and modified full width at half-maximum (mFWHM) between cancerous and benign tissues were assessed. Results In the TZ, CV for ROIs of 7.5 and 10mm was the only significantly different parameter of the MWS (P = 0.034 and P = 0.004, respectively), whereas many parameters of the DPS (mean, skewness, P10, P25, P50, P75 and P90) differed significantly (P = <0.001-0.016 and area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73-0.822). In the PZ, all parameters of the MWS exhibited significant differences, except kurtosis and skewness in the ROI of 7.5mm(P = <0.001-0.017 and AUC = 0.865-0.898). SD, IQR, mFWHM, P90P10 and Range were also significant differences in the DPS (P = 0.001-0.035). Conclusion The histogram analysis of DCE-MRI is a potentially useful approach for differentiating prostate cancer from normal tissues. Different histogram parameters of the MWS and DPS should be applied in the TZ and PZ. Copyright: ? 2019 Lai et al.

"A Tri-fusion Reporter Mouse Reveals Tissue-Specific FGF1B Promoter Activity in vivo",2019,"Transgenic mice harboring imaging reporters take full advantage of imaging technologies in studies using living mice. Here, we established a tri-fusion multimodal reporter gene containing fragments from firefly luciferase, enhanced green fluorescent protein, and herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase and generated tri-fusion reporter Tg mice. Fibroblast growth factor type 1 (FGF1), a multifunctional mitogen to a wide range of tissues, regulates proliferation of neural stem cells of the brain, where FGF1 expression is initiated through activation of the FGF1B (F1B) promoter. The reporter mouse under the control of the human F1B promoter enables visualization in vivo where F1B activity is elevated, including tissues not only in the brain but also in the nasopharynx, skull, spine, and testes, particularly in Leydig cells. Treating Tg mice with the alkylating agent busulfan, which is known to eradicate Leydig cells and disrupt spermatogenesis in mice, eliminated the reporter signals. Restoring Leydig cells recovered reporter expression, indicating that the reporter can be used as a surrogate marker for Leydig cells. The F1B tri-fusion reporter mouse model can be utilized in longitudinal monitoring of the health status of the male reproductive system, such as in studies exploring the toxicity of chemicals to spermatogenesis.",""
"Investigating common pathogenic mechanisms between homo sapiens and different strains of Candida albicans for drug design: Systems biology approach via two-sided NGS data identification",2019,"Candida albicans (C. albicans) is the most prevalent fungal species. Although it is a healthy microbiota, genetic and epigenetic alterations in host and pathogen, and microenvironment changes would lead to thrush, vaginal yeast infection, and even hematogenously disseminated infection. Despite the fact that cytotoxicity is well-characterized, few studies discuss the genome-wide genetic and epigenetic molecular mechanisms between host and C. albicans. The aim of this study is to identify drug targets and design a multiple-molecule drug to prevent the infection from C. albicans. To investigate the common and specific pathogenic mechanisms in human oral epithelial OKF6/TERT-2 cells during the C. albicans infection in different strains, systems modeling and big databases mining were used to construct candidate host-pathogen genetic and epigenetic interspecies network (GEIN). System identification and system order detection are applied on two-sided next generation sequencing (NGS) data to build real host-pathogen cross-talk GEINs. Core host-pathogen cross-talk networks (HPCNs) are extracted by principal network projection (PNP) method. By comparing with core HPCNs in different strains of C. albicans, common pathogenic mechanisms were investigated and several drug targets were suggested as follows: orf19.5034 (YBP1) with the ability of anti-ROS; orf19.939 (NAM7), orf19.2087 (SAS2), orf19.1093 (FLO8) and orf19.1854 (HHF22) with high correlation to the hyphae growth and pathogen protein interaction; orf19.5585 (SAP5), orf19.5542 (SAP6) and orf19.4519 (SUV3) with the cause of biofilm formation. Eventually, five corresponding compounds-Tunicamycin, Terbinafine, Cerulenin, Tetracycline and Tetrandrine-with three known drugs could be considered as a potential multiple-molecule drug for therapeutic treatment of C. albicans. ? 2019 by the authors.","cerulenin; nucleic acid binding protein; oxidoreductase; terbinafine; tetracycline; tetrandrine; tunicamycin; antifungal agent; fungal protein; Article; biofilm; Candida albicans; cell adhesion; core host pathogen cross talk network; cytotoxicity; disease exacerbation; DNA methylation; DNA replication; drug design; enzyme activity; epigenetics; gene expression; genetic and epigenetic interspecies network; genetic transcription; host pathogen interaction; human; immune response; metal ion binding; microbial interaction; microenvironment; microflora; next generation sequencing; OKF6 cell line; open reading frame; protein protein interaction; systems biology; Tert 2 cell line; thrush; transcription regulation; vaginal yeast infection; vaginitis; Candida albicans; candidiasis; cell line; comparative study; drug design; genetics; high throughput sequencing; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; physiology; systems biology; Antifungal Agents; Candida albicans; Candidiasis; Cell Line; Drug Design; Fungal Proteins; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Systems Biology"
"Doxycycline inhibits electric field-induced migration of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells",2019,"Adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most commonly diagnosed subtypes of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Numerous lung cancer cell types have exhibited electrotaxis under direct current electric fields (dcEF). Physiological electric fields (EF) play key roles in cancer cell migration. In this study, we investigated electrotaxis of NSCLC cells, including human large cell lung carcinoma NCI-H460 and human lung squamous cell carcinoma NCI-H520 cells. Non-cancerous MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were included as a control. After dcEF stimulation, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells, which both exhibit epithelial-like morphology, migrated towards the cathode, while MRC-5 cells, which have fibroblast-like morphology, migrated towards the anode. The effect of doxycycline, a common antibiotic, on electrotaxis of MRC-5, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells was examined. Doxycycline enhanced the tested cells’ motility but inhibited electrotaxis in the NSCLC cells without inhibiting non-cancerous MRC-5 cells. Based on our finding, further in-vivo studies could be devised to investigate the metastasis inhibition effect of doxycycline in an organism level. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Identification of novel anti-liver cancer small molecules with better therapeutic index than sorafenib via zebrafish drug screening platform",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Sorafenib was the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for treating advanced HCC until recently, so development of new target therapy is urgently needed. In this study, we established a zebrafish drug screening platform and compared the therapeutic effects of two multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 419S1 and 420S1, with Sorafenib. All three compounds exhibited anti-angiogenesis abilities in immersed fli1:EGFP transgenic embryos and the half inhibition concentration (IC50) was determined. 419S1 exhibited lower hepatoxicity and embryonic toxicity than 420S1 and Sorafenib, and the half lethal concentration (LC50) was determined. The therapeutic index (LC50/IC50) for 419S1 was much higher than for Sorafenib and 420S1. The compounds were either injected retro-orbitally or by oral gavage to adult transgenic zebrafish with HCC. The compounds not only rescued the pathological feature, but also reversed the expression levels of cell-cycle-related genes and protein levels of a proliferation marker. Using a patient-derived-xenograft assay, we found that the effectiveness of 419S1 and 420S1 in preventing liver cancer proliferation is better than that of Sorafenib. With integrated efforts and the advantage of the zebrafish platform, we can find more effective and safe drugs for HCC treatment and screen for personalized medicine. ? 2019 by the authors.

"KDM8/JMJD5 as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 integrates AR/EZH2 network and tumor metabolism in CRPC",2019,"During the evolution into castration or therapy resistance, prostate cancer cells reprogram the androgen responses to cope with the diminishing level of androgens, and undergo metabolic adaption to the nutritionally deprived and hypoxia conditions. AR (androgen receptor) and PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) have key roles in these processes. We report in this study, KDM8/JMJD5, a histone lysine demethylase/dioxygnase, exhibits a novel property as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 and as such, it is a potent inducer of castration and therapy resistance. Previously, we showed that KDM8 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and tumor metabolism in breast cancer cells. Its role in prostate cancer has not been explored. Here, we show that KDM8’s oncogenic properties in prostate cancer come from its direct interaction (1) with AR to affect androgen response and (2) with PKM2 to regulate tumor metabolism. The interaction with AR leads to the elevated expression of androgen response genes in androgen-deprived conditions. They include ANCCA/ATAD2 and EZH2, which are directly targeted by KDM8 and involved in sustaining the survival of the cells under hormone-deprived conditions. Notably, in enzalutamide-resistant cells, the expressions of both KDM8 and EZH2 are further elevated, so are neuroendocrine markers. Consequently, EZH2 inhibitors or KDM8 knockdown both resensitize the cells toward enzalutamide. In the cytosol, KDM8 associates with PKM2, the gatekeeper of pyruvate flux and translocates PKM2 into the nucleus, where the KDM8/PKM2 complex serves as a coactivator of HIF-1α to upregulate glycolytic genes. Using shRNA knockdown, we validate KDM8’s functions as a regulator for both androgen-responsive and metabolic genes. KDM8 thus presents itself as an ideal therapeutic target for metabolic adaptation and castration-resistance of prostate cancer cells. ? 2018, The Author(s).","androgen; androgen receptor; enzalutamide; histone demethylase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; JMJD5 enzyme; KDM8 enzyme; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase M2; short hairpin RNA; transcription factor EZH2; unclassified drug; AAA protein; androgen receptor; AR protein, human; ATAD2 protein, human; carrier protein; DNA binding protein; EZH2 protein, human; HIF1A protein, human; histone demethylase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; KDM8 protein, human; membrane protein; phenylthiohydantoin; small interfering RNA; thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone-binding proteins; transcription factor EZH2; tumor protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer resistance; carcinogenesis; castration resistant prostate cancer; castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line; cell cycle; cell survival; chemosensitization; controlled study; cytosol; gene conversion; gene expression; gene knockdown; gene translocation; genetic regulation; glycolysis; hormone receptor interaction; hormone response; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; molecular pathology; mouse; nonhuman; Nu Nu mouse; nuclear reprogramming; nude mouse; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein transport; signal transduction; tumor growth; tumor immunity; upregulation; adenocarcinoma; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; castration resistant prostate cancer; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; nucleocytoplasmic transport; pathology; physiology; protein analysis; tumor cell line; xenograft; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Glycolysis; Heterografts; Histone Demethylases; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Proteins; Phenylthiohydantoin; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Protein Interaction Mapping; Receptors, Androgen; RNA, Small Interfering; Thyroid Hormones"
"Increased brain entropy of resting-state fMRI mediates the relationship between depression severity and mental health-related quality of life in late-life depressed elderly",2019,"Background: Entropy analysis is a computational method used to quantify the complexity in a system, and loss of brain complexity is hypothesized to be related to mental disorders. Here, we applied entropy analysis to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal in subjects with late-life depression (LLD), an illness combined with emotion dysregulation and aging effect. Methods: A total of 35 unremitted depressed elderly and 22 control subjects were recruited. Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis was performed in the entire brain, 90 automated anatomical labeling-parcellated ROIs, and five resting networks in each study participant. Limitations: Due to ethical concerns, all the participants were under medication during the study. Results: Regionally, subjects with LLD showed decreased entropy only in the right posterior cingulate gyrus but had universally increased entropy in affective processing (putamen and thalamus), sensory, motor, and temporal nodes across different time scales. We also found higher entropy in the left frontoparietal network (FPN), which partially mediated the negative correlation between depression severity and mental components of the quality of life, reflecting the possible neural compensation during depression treatment. Conclusion: MSE provides a novel and complementary approach in rs-fMRI analysis. The temporal-spatial complexity in the resting brain may provide the adaptive variability beneficial for the elderly with depression. ? 2019","adult; aged; aging; Article; brain; clinical article; controlled study; emotion; entropy; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Geriatric Depression Scale; geriatric patient; human; late life depression; male; mental health; posterior cingulate; priority journal; putamen; quality of life; thalamus; brain; brain mapping; cingulate gyrus; depression; entropy; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; quality of life; rest; antidepressant agent; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Brain; Brain Mapping; Depressive Disorder; Entropy; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Rest; Thalamus"
"Relationship between self-identity confusion and internet addiction among college students: The mediating effects of psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance",2019,"Internet addiction (IA) has become a major public health problem among college students. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-identity confusion and IA and the mediating effects of psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance (PI/EA) indicators in college students. A total of 500 college students (262 women and 238 men) were recruited. Their levels of self-identity were evaluated using the Self-Concept and Identity Measure. Their levels of PI/EA were examined using the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II. The severity of IA was assessed using the Chen Internet Addiction Scale. The relationships among self- identity, PI/EA, and IA were examined using structural equation modeling. The severity of self-identity confusion was positively associated with both the severity of PI/EA and the severity of IA. In addition, the severity of PI/EA indicators was positively associated with the severity of IA. These results demonstrated that the severity of self-identity confusion was related to the severity of IA, either directly or indirectly. The indirect relationship was mediated by the severity of PI/EA. Self-identity confusion and PI/EA should be taken into consideration by the community of professionals working on IA. Early detection and intervention of self-identity confusion and PI/EA should be the objectives for programs aiming to lower the risk of IA. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Development of American-lineage influenza H5N2 reassortant vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness",2019,"Novel low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 viruses hit poultry farms in Taiwan in 2003, and evolved into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in 2010. These viruses are reassortant viruses containing HA and NA genes from American-lineage H5N2 and six internal genes from local H6N1 viruses. According to a serological survey, the Taiwan H5N2 viruses can cause asymptomatic infections in poultry workers. Therefore, a development of influenza H5N2 vaccines is desirable for pandemic preparation. In this study, we employed reverse genetics to generate a vaccine virus having HA and NA genes from A/Chicken/CY/A2628/2012 (E7, LPAI) and six internal genes from a Vero cell-adapted high-growth H5N1 vaccine virus (Vero-15). The reassortant H5N2 vaccine virus, E7-V15, presented high-growth efficiency in Vero cells (512 HAU, 107.6 TCID50/mL), and passed all tests for qualification of candidate vaccine viruses. In ferret immunization, two doses of inactivated whole virus antigens (3 ?g of HA protein) adjuvanted with alum could induce robust antibody response (HI titre 113.14). In conclusion, we have established reverse genetics to generate a qualified reassortant H5N2 vaccine virus for further development. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A overexpression promotes liver cancer development in transgenic zebrafish via activation of ERK and β-catenin pathways",2019,"Dysregulation of the enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is known to promote tumorigenesis. Our recent study demonstrated that ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPIA), a key regulator of the PPP, regulates hepatoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Our studies in zebrafish reveal that RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and β-catenin signaling. To further investigate RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, two independent lines of transgenic zebrafish expressing human RPIA in the liver were generated. These studies reveal that RPIA overexpression triggers lipogenic factor/enzyme expression, steatosis, fibrosis and proliferation of the liver. In addition, the severity of fibrosis and the extent of proliferation are positively correlated with RPIA expression levels. Furthermore, RPIA-mediated induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires the ERK and β-catenin signaling pathway but is not dependent upon transaldolase levels. Our study presents a mechanism for RPIA-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that RPIA represents a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","beta catenin; isomerase; mitogen activated protein kinase; ribose 5 phosphate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; enzyme activation; fatty liver; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transgenic zebrafish; xenotransplantation"
"Sialylation of vasorin by ST3Gal1 facilitates TGF-β1-mediated tumor angiogenesis and progression",2019,"ST3Gal1 is a key sialyltransferase which adds α2,3-linked sialic acid to substrates and generates core 1 O-glycan structure. Upregulation of ST3Gal1 has been associated with worse prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, the protein substrates of ST3Gal1 implicated in tumor progression remain elusive. In our study, we demonstrated that ST3GAL1-silencing significantly reduced tumor growth along with a notable decrease in vascularity of MCF7 xenograft tumors. We identified vasorin (VASN) which was shown to bind TGF-β1, as a potential candidate that links ST3Gal1 to angiogenesis. LC-MS/MS analysis of VASN secreted from MCF7, revealed that more than 80% of its O-glycans are sialyl-3T and disialyl-T. ST3GAL1-silencing or desialylation of VASN by neuraminidase enhanced its binding to TGF-β1 by 2- to 3-fold and thereby dampening TGF-β1 signaling and angiogenesis, as indicated by impaired tube formation of HUVECs, suppressed angiogenesis gene expression and reduced activation of Smad2 and Smad3 in HUVEC cells. Examination of 114 fresh primary breast cancer and their adjacent normal tissues showed that the expression levels of ST3Gal1 and TGFB1 were high in tumor part and the expression of two genes was positively correlated. Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter relapse-free survival for those with lower expression VASN, notably, the combination of low VASN with high ST3GAL1 yielded even higher risk of recurrence (p = 0.025, HR = 2.967, 95% CI = 1.14–7.67). Since TGF-β1 is known to transcriptionally activate ST3Gal1, our findings illustrated a feedback regulatory loop in which TGF-β1 upregulates ST3Gal1 to circumvent the negative impact of VASN. ? 2018 The Authors.

"KDM4B is a coactivator of c-Jun and involved in gastric carcinogenesis",2019,"KDM4/JMJD2 Jumonji C-containing histone lysine demethylases (KDM4A–D) constitute an important class of epigenetic modulators in the transcriptional activation of cellular processes and genome stability. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is overexpressed in gastric cancer, but the mechanisms and particularly the role of the epigenetic regulation of IL-8, are unclear. Here, we report that KDM4B, but not KDM4A/4C, upregulated IL-8 production in the absence or presence of Helicobacter pylori. Moreover, KDM4B physically interacts with c-Jun on IL-8, MMP1, and ITGAV promoters via its demethylation activity. The depletion of KDM4B leads to the decreased expression of integrin αV, which is exploited by H. pylori carrying the type IV secretion system, reducing IL-8 production and cell migration. Elevated KDM4B expression is significantly associated with the abundance of p-c-Jun in gastric cancer and is linked to a poor clinical outcome. Together, our results suggest that KDM4B is a key regulator of JNK/c-Jun-induced processes and is a valuable therapeutic target. ? 2019, The Author(s).","CD51 antigen; histone demethylase; histone lysine demethylase 4; histone lysine demethylase 4a; histone lysine demethylase 4b; histone lysine demethylase 4c; interleukin 8; interstitial collagenase; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; small interfering RNA; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; virulence factor; Article; cancer therapy; cell migration; controlled study; disease association; gene expression; gene silencing; genetic association; Helicobacter pylori; histone demethylation; histone modification; human; human cell; outcome assessment; priority journal; promoter region; protein depletion; protein interaction; protein targeting; stomach carcinogenesis; transcription initiation; type IV secretion system; upregulation"
"Androgen deprivation-induced ZBTB46-PTGS1 signaling promotes neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer",2019,"Androgen receptor (AR) targeting is an important therapeutic strategy for treating prostate cancer. Most tumors progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and develop the neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype under androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The molecular basis for NE transdifferentiation after ADT remains incompletely understood. Herein, we show that an immunocyte expression protein, ZBTB46, induces inflammatory response gene expression and contributes to NE differentiation of prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated a molecular mechanism whereby ZBTB46 can be regulated by the androgen-responsive gene, SPDEF, and is associated with NE prostate cancer (NEPC) differentiation. In addition, ZBTB46 acts as a transcriptional coactivator that binds to the promoter of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) and transcriptionally regulated PTGS1 levels. Overexpression of ZBTB46 decreases the sensitivity of the combination of enzalutamide and a PTGS1 inhibitor; however, knockdown of ZBTB46 sensitizes the PTGS1 inhibitor and reduces tumor malignancy. ZBTB46 is inversely correlated with SPDEF and is increased in higher tumor grades and small-cell NE prostate cancer (SCNC) patients, which are positively associated with PTGS1. Our findings suggest that the induction of ZBTB46 results in increased PTGS1 expression, which is associated with NEPC progression and linked to the dysregulation of the AR-SPDEF pathway. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","membrane protein; prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 1; unclassified drug; androgen receptor; androgen receptor antagonist; AR protein, human; cyclooxygenase 1; PTGS1 protein, human; SPDEF protein, human; transcription factor; transcription factor Ets; Zbtb46 protein, human; analysis of variance; androgen deprivation therapy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; carcinogenicity; cell differentiation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; colony formation; controlled study; cytokine production; human; human cell; human tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; prostate cancer; protein binding; protein expression; signal transduction; tissue microarray; transcription regulation; ZBTB46 PTGS1 signaling; animal; biosynthesis; cell differentiation; genetics; metabolism; neuroendocrine tumor; nude mouse; pathology; prostate tumor; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Androgen Receptor Antagonists; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclooxygenase 1; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Prostatic Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets; Receptors, Androgen; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors"
"Knowledge of medications among patients with glaucoma in Taiwan",2019,"Background/Purpose: To investigate the knowledge and learning ability of glaucoma patients regarding their anti-glaucoma topical medications. Methods: Patients on regular follow-up at the Glaucoma Clinic at Hsin-Chu General Hospital were recruited. After detailed ocular examinations, the participants were asked to recall and identify their glaucoma eye drops. The same test was repeated 3 months later. The results of both tests, the learning ability of patients regarding their glaucoma drugs, and the relationship between learning ability and demographic variables were evaluated. Results: Two hundred eighty-seven glaucoma patients participated in this study. Of the study population, 25.8% and 57.1% could recall their topical mediation at the first and second tests, whereas 72.1% and 88.5% could identify their prescribed eye drops at the first and second tests, respectively. Approximately 34% of the participants showed improved knowledge at the repeat test, whereas 40% of the participants showed no improvement. Participants with a better learning ability were more likely to be younger, with a higher level of education, and with less visual field impairment. Conclusion: The knowledge of glaucoma patients regarding their prescribed medication was deficient in Taiwan. Physician effort could improve knowledge on the prescribed drugs. Patient-centered education should be considered, targeting elderly individuals, illiterate individuals, and those with loss of visual function to increase compliance with glaucoma medication. ? 2018","antiglaucoma agent; eye drops; eye drops; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; best corrected visual acuity; color vision; educational status; eye examination; female; glaucoma; high school; human; intraocular pressure; knowledge; learning; major clinical study; male; prescription; primary school; Taiwan; topical treatment; visual acuity; visual field defect; attitude to health; drug monitoring; glaucoma; medication compliance; middle aged; prospective study; questionnaire; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Drug Monitoring; Female; Glaucoma; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Logistic Models; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Ophthalmic Solutions; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Casein-Coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for in vitro Hyperthermia for Cancer Therapy",2019,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been a very appealing choice in magnetic-mediated hyperthermia for cancer therapy. The responses of NPs to hyperthermia as a cancer treatment method are complex and variable. Herein, the heating properties of the casein-coated magnetic NPs (MNPs) under an alternating magnetic field were investigated. The casein-coated MNPs were synthesized via one-pot chemical method. The casein-coated MNPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis. TEM images of casein-coated MNPs show that their shapes are spherical and their core sizes are between 20nm and 25nm. The FTIR and EDAX results confirmed the presence of casein on the surface of MNPs. The VSM shows the superparamagnetic nature of iron oxide and casein-coated iron oxide NPs with the magnetic saturation of 60emu/g and 44.86emu/g, respectively, at room temperature. Furthermore, hyperthermia tests for casein-coated MNPs with various concentrations and frequencies are performed. Hyperthermia results show that lower concentrations of casein-coated MNPs dispatch higher heating into their surrounding medium, whereas maximum specific absorption rate occurs at the concentration of 1mg/mL for the frequency of 150kHz. Findings of this study suggest that casein-coated MNPs have great potential as an anticancer agent in hyperthermia cancer therapy. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",""
"Heart Rhythm Complexity Impairment in Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension",2019,"Pulmonary hypertension is a fatal disease, however reliable prognostic tools are lacking. Heart rhythm complexity analysis is derived from non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and has shown excellent performance in predicting clinical outcomes in several cardiovascular diseases. However, heart rhythm complexity has not previously been studied in pulmonary hypertension patients. We prospectively analyzed 57 patients with pulmonary hypertension (31 with pulmonary arterial hypertension and 26 with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) and compared them to 57 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Heart rhythm complexity including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multiscale entropy (MSE) and linear HRV parameters were analyzed. The patients with pulmonary hypertension had significantly lower mean RR, SDRR, pNN20, VLF, LF, LF/HF ratio, DFAα1, MSE slope 5, scale 5, area 1–5 and area 6–20 compared to the controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that heart rhythm complexity parameters were better than traditional HRV parameters to predict pulmonary hypertension. Among all parameters, scale 5 had the greatest power to differentiate the pulmonary hypertension patients from controls (AUC: 0.845, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, adding heart rhythm complexity parameters significantly improved the discriminatory power of the traditional HRV parameters in both net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement models. In conclusion, the patients with pulmonary hypertension had worse heart rhythm complexity. MSE parameters, especially scale 5, had excellent single discriminatory power to predict whether or not patients had pulmonary hypertension. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Demography and welfare status of free-roaming dogs in Yangmingshan National Park, Taiwan",2019,"Free-roaming dogs (Canis familiaris) cause threats to native wildlife and public health and raise concerns for their welfare. Understanding the demography of free-roaming dog populations is essential for developing an effective management plan. An evaluation of their welfare status would be beneficial to earn public support for the management plan. In this study, we estimated the population size, survivorship, and health of a free-roaming dog population in Yangmingshan National Park (YMSNP), Taiwan, during 2016–2018. YMSNP is a rural area with human settlements but also a protected area of conservation concern. We identified 191, 176, 216 individuals at our sampling sites in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Using a photographic capture-recapture method and extrapolation, we estimated that there were 786–979 dogs in the park during this 3-year period. The annual apparent survival rate of identified dogs was 16.7% for 2016–2017 and 23.9% for 2017–2018. The dogs had a high rate of lameness and dermatosis of 5.1–8.8% and 14.2–18.1%, respectively. Thirty-five blood samples showed that 34.3% of the dogs were anemic, 37.1% showed abnormal white blood cell counts, and 68.6% exhibited abnormal platelet counts. These results suggested that the dogs were at high density with low survivorship and in poor health, and new individuals entered the population continuously. Interventions to manage this dog population and to improve their welfare must be carried out. Our study provides an example for monitoring and managing a free-roaming dog population in a rural, conservation area in Southeast Asia. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","hemoglobin variant; animal health; animal lameness; animal welfare; Article; blood cell count; blood sampling; demography; dog disease; erythrocyte count; female; leukocyte count; male; national park; nonhuman; platelet count; population density; population size; priority journal; public health; rural area; skin disease; stray dog; survival rate; Taiwan; wildlife; wound; animal; dog; physiology; recreational park; Animal Welfare; Animals; Dogs; Female; Male; Parks, Recreational; Population Density; Taiwan"
"Polydopamine-coated gold nanostar for combined antitumor and antiangiogenic therapy in multidrug-resistant breast cancer",2019,"Cancer combination therapy can improve treatment efficacy and is widely utilized in the biomedical field. In this paper, we propose a facile strategy to develop a polydopamine (PDA)-coated Au nanostar (NS@PPFA) as a multifunctional nanoplatform for cancer targeting and combination therapy. The Au nanostar demonstrated high photothermal conversion efficiency because of the tip-enhanced plasmonic effect. Modification of PDA and folic acid on the NS surface improved its drug-loading efficiency and targeting capability. In vitro, compared with nontargeted cells, targeted breast cancer MCF-7 cells demonstrated efficient uptake of chemodrug-loaded NS-D@PPFA through the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. In combination with the photothermal effect induced by near-infrared laser irradiation, controlled payload release could be activated in response to both internal (acid) and external (photothermal) stimuli, leading to an efficient chemo-photothermal action against MCF-7 cells and drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. By contrast, cellular damage was less obvious in normal HaCaT (human skin keratinocytes) and NIH-3T3 cells (murine fibroblasts). In addition, payload-free NS@PPFA exhibited a high binding affinity (Kd = 2.68 × 10-10 M) toward vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A165), which was at least two orders of magnitude stronger than that of highly abundant plasma proteins, such as human serum albumin. Furthermore, in vitro study showed that NS@PPFA could effectively inhibit VEGF-A165-induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, resulting in additional therapeutic benefits for eradicating tumors through a simultaneous antiangiogenic action in chemo-photothermal treatment. The combined treatment also exhibited the lowest microvessel density, leading to a potent antitumor effect in vivo. Overall, our ""all-in-one"" nanoplatform is highly promising for tumor therapy, enabling effective treatment against multidrug-resistant cancers.",""
"Hierarchically targetable polysaccharide-coated solid lipid nanoparticles as an oral chemo/thermotherapy delivery system for local treatment of colon cancer",2019,"Although oral formulations of anticancer chemotherapies are clinically available, the therapeutic action relies mostly on drug absorption, being inevitably accompanied with systemic side effects. It is thus desirable to develop oral therapy systems for the local treatment of colon cancers featured with highly selective delivery to cancer cells and minimized systemic drug absorption. The present study demonstrates the effective accumulation and cell uptake of the doxorubicin and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles-loaded solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) delivery system for chemo/magnetothermal combination therapy at tumors by hierarchical targeting of folate (FA) and dextran coated on SLN surfaces in a sequential layer-by-layer manner. Both the in vitro and in vivo characterizations strongly confirmed that the dextran shells on SLN surfaces not only retarded the cellular transport of the FA-coated SLNs by the proton-coupled FA transporter on brush border membranes in small intestine, but also enhanced the particle residence in colon by specific association with dextranase. The enzymatic degradation and removal of dextran coating led to the exposure of the FA residues, thereby further facilitating the cellular-level targeting and uptake of the SLNs by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. The evaluation of the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the hierarchically targetable SLN therapy system by oral administration showed the effective inhibition of primary colon tumors and peritoneal metastasis in terms of the ascites volume and tumor nodule number and size, along with the absence of systemic side effects. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cell membranes; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Dextran; Diseases; Iron oxides; Molecular biology; Nanoparticles; Tumors; Anti-cancer chemotherapy; Brush border membranes; Combination therapy; Hierarchical targeting; Oral formulations; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN); Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; dextran; dextranase; doxorubicin; folic acid; polysaccharide; solid lipid nanoparticle; superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; A-549 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; ascites cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell transport; cell volume; colon cancer; controlled study; CT26 cell line; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug reexposure; drug release; drug synthesis; endocytosis; enzymatic degradation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneum metastasis; priority journal; small intestine; target cell; thermotherapy; tumor volume"
"Aerosol emissions from long-lasting smoldering of boreal peatlands: Chemical composition, markers, and microstructure",2019,"As large-scale peat burning emissions can severely impact the environment and human health, it is crucial to assess the characteristics of smoke aerosol at the source and at down-wind locations. From March until late summer in 2014, the Tver region, north of the city of Moscow, was considerably affected by long-lasting peat bog fires. Peat bog smoldering emissions from three types of smoke (underground, inside grass, and above grass) were analyzed by an extensive suite of instrumentation that sampled and measured their optical and chemical properties. The particle composition was characterized by organic species with high OC/EC ratios (10–20), with water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and levoglucosan (Lev) comprising the largest fraction, up to 30 and 9%, respectively, of the OC. Aliphatic, aromatic, carbonyl, and carboxylate functionalities in the underground smoke were enriched by nitro compounds, and brown carbon (BrC) was identified by a high Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) of 4.1. Organic “tar balls” in the peat smoke were more abundant (78.5%) than individual Ca-rich (e.g., Ca-oxides or carbonates), Fe-rich (e.g., Fe-oxides), and Al-rich (e.g., alumosilicates) particles. Peat smoke plumes affected an urban site in Moscow in August 2014, with ambient PM 10 mass loadings reaching up to 97 ?g m –3 and OC, EC, and ionic species accounting for a large percentage of the total aerosol enhancement. With the transport of air masses from the peat bog region to Moscow, the OC/EC ratio and AAE reached peak values of 7 and 1.3, respectively. Levoglucosan served as a molecular marker of the impact of peat smoldering, approaching a maximum ambient concentration of 108 ng m –3 . WSOC correlated well with Lev, indicating secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation associated with peat burning emissions. Spectral absorbance features showed characteristics similar to peat burning and traffic source emissions during fire and non-fire related days, confirming the potential effect of transported peat smoke on air quality in megacities. ?

"Disease antigens detection by silicon nanowires with the efficiency optimization of their antibodies on a chip",2019,"Enhancing the efficiency of antibody protein immobilized on a silicon nanowire-based chip for their antigens detection is reported. An external electric field (EEF) is applied to direct the orientation of antibodies during their immobilization on a chip. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure the binding forces between immobilized antibody and targeting antigen under the influence of EEF at different angles. The maximum binding force under a specific angle (optimal angle; oa) of EEF (maxEEFoa) implies the optimal orientation of the antibodies on the chip. In this report, two different cancer carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules 5 (CEACAM5) &amp; 1 (CEACAM1) were used for the examples of disease antigen detection. maxEEFoa of anti-CEACAM5 or anti-CEACAM1 immobilized on a general chip was firstly determined. Spectroscopy of AFM revealed that both binding forces were the largest ones with their antigens when maxEEFoa was applied as compared with no or other angles of EEF. These antibody proteins accompanied with the application of EEF were secondly immobilized on silicon-nanowires (n = 1000) and the field effects were measured (?I) as their target antigens were approached. Results showed that ?I was the largest ones when maxEEFoas (225°/270° and 135°/180° for anti-CEACAM5 and anti-CEACAM1, respectively) were applied as compared with other angles of EEF. These observations imply that the silicon nanowires together with the application of maxEEFoa as detection tools could be applied for the cancer diagnostics in the future. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antibodies; Antigens; Atomic force microscopy; Cell adhesion; Diagnosis; Diseases; Efficiency; Electric fields; Nanowires; Silicon; Antigen detections; Carcinoembryonic antigen; Cell adhesion molecules; Efficiency optimization; EOP); External electric field; Immobilized antibodies; Optimal orientation; Chemical detection; carcinoembryonic antigen; cell adhesion molecule; cell adhesion molecule 1; cell adhesion molecule 5; immunoglobulin; nanowire; silicon; unclassified drug; antigen binding; antigen detection; Article; atomic force microscopy; cancer diagnosis; electric field; nanofabrication; process optimization; protein immobilization; protein targeting"
"Application of virtual reality for learning the material properties of shape memory alloys",2019,"A shape memory alloy (SMA) is an alloy which can eliminate deformation at lower temperatures and restore its original shape upon heating. SMAs have been receiving considerable attention in the research field of materials science, and their applications include robotics, automotive, aerospace, and biomedical industries. Observing the SMA's shaping and restoration processes is important for understanding its working principles and applications. However, the transformation of its crystal structure with temperature can only be seen using special equipment, such as a transmission electron microscope (TEM), which is an expensive apparatus and the operation requires professional skills. In this study, a teaching module is designed using virtual reality (VR) technology and research results of an SMA to show its shape memory properties, shaping and restoration processes, as well as the real-life applications in an immersive and interactive way. A teaching experiment has been conducted to analyze students' learning effectiveness using the teaching module (the experimental group) compared with that of using real SMA materials as the teaching aids (the control group). Two classes of students in the Department of Materials Science (one as the experimental group and the other as the control group) were selected as the samples by convenience sampling from a university in North Taiwan. The experimental group contained 52 students and the control group contained 70 students. A nonequivalent pretest-posttest design was adopted to explore whether the two groups had a significant difference in learning effectiveness. The experimental results reveal that the teaching module can improve the learning effectiveness significantly (p = 0.001), and the questionnaire results also show that a majority of the students had positive attitudes about the teaching module. They believed that it could increase their learning motivation and help them understand the properties and applications of the SMA. ? 2019 by the authors.",""
"Photosensitizer–conjugated Cu-In-S heterostructured nanorods for cancer targeted photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy",2019,"Photo-activated therapy is a non-invasive and promising medical technology for the treatment of cancers. Herein, we present Ce6-HA-CIS phototherapeutic nanohybrids composed of Cu-In-S (CIS) heterostructured nanorod (HS-rod), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and hyaluronic acid (HA) for the use in targeted photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT). In the Ce6-HA-CIS nanohybrids, the CIS HS-rod was investigated as a PTT agent to convert light into thermal energy, with Ce6 acting as a PDT agent to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). HA encapsulated the surface of the CIS HS-rod and aided the hydrophobic CIS HS-rod in achieving aqueous solubility. HA also acts as a tumor-specific targeting vector of cancer cells bearing the cluster determinant 44 receptor. Under light irradiation, the fabricated Ce6-HA-CIS nanohybrids exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency, good photo-stability, and satisfactory photodynamic activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Ce6-HA-CIS showed low cytotoxicity and synergistic photodynamic and photothermal cancer cell killing effects as compared to PTT or PDT agents alone.

"Role of PGRMC1 in cell physiology of cervical cancer",2019,"Aims: The most frequent cancers among women worldwide. The mortality of cervical cancer has declined significantly primarily due to the widespread use of Pap smear tests as a screening test and therapeutic vaccination. However, cervical cancer still remains a severe disease among the female population, as the prognosis of metastatic cervical cancer is very poor. Key methods: In this study, we performed 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to analyze differentially expressed proteins between HeLa and invasive HeLa-I5 cells. Key findings: According to our proteomics data, 68 differentially expressed proteins between the HeLa and HeLa-I5 cells were identified. One of these differentially expressed proteins, Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), was selected as a candidate for further studies. To correlate the role of PGRMC1 with cellular migration and cancer progression, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown the expression of PGRMC1. Similar function of PGRMC1 was also observed in two other cervical cancer lines, CaSki and ME-180. Significance: PGRMC1 plays an essential role in regulating cancer progression and metastasis of cervical cancer cells, thus serving as a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. ? 2019","membrane protein; progesterone receptor membrane component 1; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; membrane protein; PGRMC1 protein, human; progesterone receptor; Article; Ca Ski cell line; cancer growth; cell function; cell migration; cervical adenocarcinoma cell line; controlled study; female; gene knockdown; HeLa cell line; HeLa I5 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; ME-180 cell line; metastasis; protein expression; protein function; proteomics; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; uterine cervix cancer; cell motion; cell proliferation; genetics; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metabolism; pathology; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; uterine cervix tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; HeLa Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Proteomics; Receptors, Progesterone; RNA, Small Interfering; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"

"Engineering a Nanoscale Al-MOF-Armored Antigen Carried by a “Trojan Horse”-Like Platform for Oral Vaccination to Induce Potent and Long-Lasting Immunity",2019,"Vaccination via the oral administration of an antigen faces many challenges, including gastrointestinal (GI) proteolysis and mucosal barriers. To limit GI proteolysis, a biomimetically mineralized aluminum-based metal–organic framework (Al-MOF) system that is resistant to ambient temperature and pH and can act synergistically as a delivery vehicle and an adjuvant is synthesized over a model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to act as armor. To overcome mucosal barriers, a yeast-derived capsule is used to carry the Al-MOF-armored OVA as a “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform. In vitro experiments reveal that the mineralization of Al-MOFs forms an armor on OVA that protects against highly acidic and degradative GI conditions. However, the mineralized Al-MOFs can gradually disintegrate in a phosphate ion-containing simulated intracellular fluid, slowly releasing their encapsulated OVA. In vivo studies reveal that the “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform specifically targets intestinal M cells, favoring the transepithelial transport of the Al-MOF-armored OVA, followed by subsequent endocytosis in local macrophages, ultimately accumulating in mesenteric lymph nodes, yielding long-lasting, high-levels of mucosal S-IgA and serum IgG antibodies. Such an engineered delivery platform may represent a promising strategy for the oral administration of prophylactic or therapeutic antigens for vaccination. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Managing “incidental findings” in biobank research: Recommendations of the Taiwan biobank",2019,"Background: In this article, incidental findings (IF) refer to unforeseen findings made possible through biobanking research and advances in medical diagnostic technologies that raise issues regarding the obligation and/or responsibility of biobank-users and biobanks to return clinically significant information to participants. The World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Taipei (2016) highlights the possibility of encountering IF and requires that research on biospecimens address biobank feedback policies in their informed consent process, leaving open the possibility that the policy may be “no return”. As clinicians and researchers begin to use these “resources”, the possibility of finding clinically significant IF is becoming a reality. Discussion: In line with the WMA's Declaration of Taipei, a pragmatic approach is needed to deal with the issue of returning IF in biobank governance. Indeed, the impacts and concerns associated with the return of IF differ across different stakeholder groups and jurisdictions. Therefore, the framework governing IF return needs to be custom-built, taking into account the nature of each research project and the unique features of biobanks. To this end, in addition to facilitating biobank transparency, establishing an endurable and horizontal connection among biobanks and clinical institutions under a public health system will improve efficiency and effectiveness. Hence, subject to contemporary Taiwanese ethical and/or legal regulations, this article argues for the establishment of an updated framework for imaging-related and genetic-related IF return within the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), mainly based on a limited obligation to disclose life-threatening information revealed by imaging, but not genetic, information. After discussing some of the ethical, legal and social issues encountered by the TWB and accounting for the experiences of other international biobanks, we propose a systematic framework for returning IF, mainly on a “limited obligation” basis, which offers better and more comprehensive protection for biobank-participants' rights and health. ? 2019 The Authors","Diagnosis; Philosophical aspects; Biobanks; Bioethics; Framework; Incidental findings; The WMA Declaration of Taipei (2016); Laws and legislation; adult; biobank; bioethics; clinician; human; incidental finding; informed consent; public health; responsibility; review; scientist; Taiwan"
"Comparing progression molecular mechanisms between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma based on genetic and epigenetic networks: Big data mining and genome-wide systems identification",2019,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant type of lung cancer in the world. Lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) are subtypes of NSCLC. We usually regard them as different disease due to their unique molecular characteristics, distinct cells of origin and dissimilar clinical response. However, the differences of genetic and epigenetic progression mechanism between LADC and LSCC are complicated to analyze. Therefore, we applied systems biology approaches and big databases mining to construct genetic and epigenetic networks (GENs) with next-generation sequencing data of LADC and LSCC. In order to obtain the real GENs, system identification and system order detection are conducted on gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) for each stage of LADC and LSCC. The core GENs were extracted via principal network projection (PNP). Based on the ranking of projection values, we got the core pathways in respect of KEGG pathway. Compared with the core pathways, we found significant differences between microenvironments, dysregulations of miRNAs, epigenetic modifications on certain signaling transduction proteins and target genes in each stage of LADC and LSCC. Finally, we proposed six genetic and epigenetic multiple-molecule drugs to target essential biomarkers in each progression stage of LADC and LSCC, respectively. ? 2019 Impact Journals LLC.

"MetaSMC: A coalescent-based shotgun sequence simulator for evolving microbial populations",2019,"Motivation: High-throughput sequencing technology has revolutionized the study of metagenomics and cancer evolution. In a relatively simple environment, a metagenomics sequencing data is dominated by a few species. By analyzing the alignment of reads from microbial species, single nucleotide polymorphisms can be discovered and the evolutionary history of the populations can be reconstructed. The ever-increasing read length will allow more detailed analysis about the evolutionary history of microbial or tumor cell population. A simulator of shotgun sequences from such populations will be helpful in the development or evaluation of analysis algorithms. Results: Here, we described an efficient algorithm, MetaSMC, which simulates reads from evolving microbial populations. Based on the coalescent theory, our simulator supports all evolutionary scenarios supported by other coalescent simulators. In addition, the simulator supports various substitution models, including Jukes-Cantor, HKY85 and generalized time-reversible models. The simulator also supports mutator phenotypes by allowing different mutation rates and substitution models in different subpopulations. Our algorithm ignores unnecessary chromosomal segments and thus is more efficient than standard coalescent when recombination is frequent. We showed that the process behind our algorithm is equivalent to Sequentially Markov Coalescent with an incomplete sample. The accuracy of our algorithm was evaluated by summary statistics and likelihood curves derived from Monte Carlo integration over large number of random genealogies. ? 2018 The Author.",""
"Traditional Chinese medicine use is associated with lower end-stage renal disease and mortality rates among patients with diabetic nephropathy: A population-based cohort study",2019,"Background: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that imposes an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Although some studies show that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments confer a protective effect on DN, the long-term impact remains unclear. This study aims to examine end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality rates among TCM users with DN. Methods: A total of 125,490 patients with incident DN patients from 2004 to 2006 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan and followed until 2012. The landmark method was applied to avoid immortal time bias, and propensity score matching was used to select 1:1 baseline characteristics-matched cohort. The Kaplan-Meier method and competing-risk analysis were used to assess mortality and ESRD rates separately. Results: Among all eligible subjects, about 60% of patients were classified as TCM users (65,812 TCM users and 41,482 nonusers). After 1:1 matching, the outcomes of 68,882 patients were analyzed. For the ESRD rate, the 8-year cumulative incidence was 14.5% for TCM users [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.9-15.0] and 16.6% for nonusers (95% CI: 16.0-17.2). For the mortality rate, the 8-year cumulative incidence was 33.8% for TCM users (95% CI: 33.1-34.6) and 49.2% for nonusers (95% CI: 48.5-49.9). After adjusting for confounding covariates, the cause-specific hazard ratio of ESRD was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.84), and the hazard ratio of mortality for TCM users was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.47-0.50). The cumulative incidence of mortality increased rapidly among TCM users with ESRD (56.8, 95% CI: 54.6-59.1) when compared with TCM users without ESRD (30.1, 95% CI: 29.4-30.9). In addition, TCM users who used TCM longer or initiated TCM treatments after being diagnosed with DN were associated with a lower risk of mortality. These results were consistent across sensitivity tests with different definitions of TCM users and inverse probability weighting of subjects.

"ZNF479 downregulates metallothionein-1 expression by regulating ASH2L and DNMT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Decreased expression of metallothionein-1 (MT-1) is associated with a poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we found that MT-1 expression was suppressed by 14-3-3ε, and MT-1 overexpression abolished 14-3-3ε-induced cell proliferation and tumor growth. We identified that 14-3-3ε induced expression of ZNF479, a novel potential transcriptional regulator by gene expression profiling and ZNF479 contributed to 14-3-3ε-suppressed MT-1 expression. ZNF479 induced the expression of DNMT1, UHRF1, and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex proteins (ASH2L and Menin), and increased tri-methylated histone H3 (H3K4me3) levels, but suppressed H3K4 (H3K4me2) di-methylation. ZNF479-suppressed MT-1 expression was restored by silencing of ASH2L and DNMT1. Furthermore, ZNF479 expression was higher in HCC tissues than that in the non-cancerous tissues. Expression analyses revealed a positive correlation between the expression of ZNF479 and DNMT1, UHRF1, ASH2L, and Menin, and an inverse correlation with that of ZNF479, ASH2L, Menin, and MT-1 isoforms. Moreover, correlations between the expression of ZNF479 and its downstream factors were more pronounced in HCC patients with hepatitis B. Here, we found that ZNF479 regulates MT-1 expression by modulating ASH2L in HCC. Approaches that target ZNF479/MLL complex/MT-1 or related epigenetic regulatory factors are potential therapeutic strategies for HCC. ? 2019, The Author(s).","DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; histone H3; metallothionein I; methionine; mixed lineage leukemia protein; protein 14 3 3; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; ash2l gene; cancer chemotherapy; carcinogenesis; cell function; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene silencing; histone methylation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; tumor growth; tumor volume; uhrf1 gene; znf479 gene"
"Dysregulation of cystathionine γ-lyase promotes prostate cancer progression and metastasis",2019,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous signaling gaseous molecule, is involved in various physiological activities, including vessel relaxation, regulation of cellular bioenergetics, inflammation, and angiogenesis. By using xenograft orthotopic implantation of prostate cancer PC3 cells and subsequently comparing bone metastatic with primary tumor-derived cancer cells, we find that H2S-producing?enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is upregulated in bone-metastatic PC3 cells. Clinical data further reveal that the expression of CTH is elevated in late-stage prostate cancer patients, and higher CTH expression correlates with poor survival from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate cancer RNA-seq datasets. CTH promotes NF-κB nuclear translocation through H2S-mediated sulfhydration on cysteine-38 of the NF-κB p65 subunit, resulting in increased IL-1β expression and H2S-induced cell invasion. Knockdown of CTH in PC3 cells results in the suppression of tumor growth and distant metastasis, while overexpression of CTH in DU145 cells promotes primary tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in the orthotopic implanted xenograft mouse model. Together, our findings provide evidence that CTH generated H2S promotes prostate cancer progression and metastasis through IL-1β/NF-κB signaling pathways. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Evaluation of Suitable Rest Times for the Use of Optical Head-Mounted Displays",2020,"This study aimed to determine suitable rest times for visual tasks of different lengths by evaluating visual fatigue and visually induced motion sickness while 20 healthy participants were using an optical head-mounted display. The independent variables tested were participant gender, visual task condition (30??min and 60??min), and length of rest time (5??min, 10??min, and 15??min). The critical fusion frequency (CFF) value and simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) scores were used as dependent measures. Gender showed no significant effect on CFF values or SSQ scores. Greater CFF values and SSQ scores were produced by the 60-min visual task than the 30-min visual task. The results of this study suggest that after completing a 30-min visual task, a rest time of at least 10??min is necessary for participants to recover, and a rest time of more than 15??min needs to follow a 60-min visual task. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Diseases; Helmet mounted displays; Human engineering; Street traffic control; Surveys; Virtual reality; Vision; Critical fusion frequency; Induced motions; Optical heads; Simulator sickness; Visual fatigue; Wearable technology"
"Gold nanorod-encapsulated biodegradable polymeric matrix for combined photothermal and chemo-cancer therapy",2019,"Purpose: A biocompatible nanocomplex system co-encapsulated with gold nanorods (AuNRs) and doxorubicin (DOX) was investigated for its potentials on the combined photothermal-and chemotherapy. Materials and methods: Hydrophobic AuNRs were synthesized by the hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB)-mediated seed growth method, and then, they received two-step surface modifications of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dodecane. The AuNR/DOX/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocomplexes were prepared by emulsifying DOX, AuNR, and PLGA into aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution by sonication. Human serum albumin (HSA) was used to coat the nanocomplexes to afford HSA/AuNR/DOX–PLGA (HADP). Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were determined by using a Zetasizer. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the HADP were analyzed by using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. In vitro anticancer effects of the HADP were studied on various cancer cell lines. To assess the therapeutic efficacy, CT26 tumor-bearing mice were intravenously administered with HADP nanocomplexes and laser treatments, followed by monitoring of the tumor growth and body weight. Results: Size and surface potential of the HADP nanocomplexes were 245.8 nm and-8.6 mV, respectively. Strong photothermal effects were verified on the AuNR-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) in vitro. Rapid and repeated drug release from the HADP nanocomplexes was successfully achieved by near-infrared (NIR) irradiations. HSA significantly promoted cellular uptake of the HADP nanocomplexes to murine colon cancer cells as demonstrated by cell imaging and flow cytometric studies. By combining photothermal and chemotherapy, the HADP nanocomplexes exhibited strong synergistic anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: An NIR-triggered drug release system by encapsulating hydrophobic AuNR and DOX inside the PLGA NPs has been successfully prepared in this study. The HADP NPs show promising combined photothermal-and chemotherapeutic effects without inducing undesired side effects on a murine colon cancer animal model. ? 2019 Chuang et al.","cetrimide; dodecane; doxorubicin; gold nanorod; human serum albumin; macrogol; polyglactin; polymer; polyvinyl alcohol; antineoplastic agent; biomaterial; doxorubicin; gold; nanotube; polymer; serum albumin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; biodegradability; body weight; cancer chemotherapy; cancer growth; chemical modification; colon adenocarcinoma; controlled study; CT26 cell line; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug release; emulsion; flow cytometry; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; material coating; mouse; MTT assay; nanoencapsulation; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; particle size; photothermal therapy; surface property; synthesis; ultrasound; animal; chemical phenomena; chemistry; disease model; endocytosis; human; neoplasm; phototherapy; static electricity; thermotherapy; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biocompatible Materials; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Doxorubicin; Drug Liberation; Endocytosis; Gold; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Hyperthermia, Induced; Mice; Nanotubes; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Phototherapy; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer; Polymers; Serum Albumin; Static Electricity"
"Albumin-functionalized CuFeS 2 /photosensitizer nanohybrid for single-laser-induced folate receptor-targeted photothermal and photodynamic therapy",2019,"Multimodal therapy is an emerging medical intervention to overcome the current limitation in cancer therapy combining treatment modalities with different mechanisms of action to eradicate tumors. This study demonstrates a targeted multifunctional bovine serum albumin (BSA)-functionalized CuFeS 2 /chlorin e6 (Ce6) for synergistic photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) effects. The CuFeS 2 nanocrystals were synthesized through a simple heating-up approach and transferred into an aqueous phase using BSA in an ultrasonic-assisted microemulsion method. The as-prepared CuFeS 2 @BSA nanoparticles further conjugated with folic acid (FA) followed by attachment of Ce6 to form the Ce6:CuFeS 2 @BSA-FA nanohybrid with improved solubility and strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and fluorescence. It is the first report to fabricate the targeted Ce6:CuFeS 2 @BSA-FA hybrid and evaluates their synergistic PTT/PDT effect using a single laser. The Ce6:CuFeS 2 @BSA-FA hybrid showed lower toxicity in vitro (HeLa and HepG2 cells) and in vivo (zebrafish embryos), while they are selectively recognized and internalized by HeLa cells that over-express folate receptors. Compared to each modality applied separately, the combined single-laser-induced PTT and PDT treatment showed the enhanced generation of heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with synergistic cancer killing under 671 nm laser irradiation (10 min, 1 W/cm 2 ). As a biocompatible targeted nanoprobe, the multifunctional nanohybrid holds promise in combined PDT/PTT synergistic therapy to achieve better efficacy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biocompatibility; Body fluids; Copper compounds; Diseases; Infrared devices; Iron compounds; Lanthanum compounds; Mammals; Microemulsions; Nanostructured materials; Photosensitizers; Bovine serum albumins; CuFeS2; Medical intervention; Micro-emulsion methods; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Photothermal therapy; Reactive oxygen species; Single lasers; Photodynamic therapy; bovine serum albumin; copper; folate receptor; folic acid; iron derivative; nanoparticle; oil; photosensitizing agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; endocytosis; HeLa cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; laser; metabolism; photochemotherapy; spectrofluorometry; thermotherapy; ultrastructure; zebra fish; Animals; Cell Survival; Copper; Endocytosis; Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored; Folic Acid; HeLa Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Iron Compounds; Lasers; Nanoparticles; Oils; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Zebrafish"
"Alpinia oxyphylla Fruit Extract Ameliorates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis through the Regulation of Th1/Th17 Cells",2019,"Alpinia oxyphylla is a traditional Chinese medicine widely used for treating diarrhea, ulceration, and enuresis. Moreover, A. oxyphylla is effective for cognitive function improvement and nerve regeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuronal inflammatory autoimmune disease that commonly affects young adults in high-latitude regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of A. oxyphylla in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model, which is an extensively used model for human MS. The ethanolic extract of A. oxyphylla fruit (AO-1) was orally administered to EAE mice. Our results showed AO-1 significantly reduced EAE symptoms. Histopathological analysis showed AO-1 reduced demyelination, inflammation, gliosis, and axonal swelling in the spinal cord. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) studies revealed that the infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and CD11b+ monocytes into the spinal cord decreased in the AO-1-treated group. Mechanistically, the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, Th17 transcription factor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), and inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17 were reduced in the spinal cords of mice treated with AO-1. The expression levels of T-bet and RORγt were also lowered in the spleens of those mice. Further in vitro study showed AO-1 inhibited production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor- from MOG35-55-peptide-stimulated splenocytes. One component isolated from AO-1, yakuchinone A, inhibited IL-17 production in vitro and reduced EAE symptoms in the mice. Collectively, our results indicate that AO-1 ameliorated the severity of EAE in mice and may involve the regulation of Th1/Th17 response. A. oxyphylla warrants further investigation, particularly regarding its clinical benefits for MS. ? 2019 Kuo-Kuei Huang et al.","Alpinia oxyphylla extract; antiinflammatory agent; CD11b antigen; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; plant extract; retinoic acid receptor gamma; transcription factor T bet; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; Alpinia; Alpinia oxyphylla; animal experiment; animal model; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; demyelination; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; female; gliosis; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; inflammation; molecular weight; monocyte; mouse; multiple sclerosis; nerve fiber degeneration; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; regulatory mechanism; spinal cord; spleen cell; T lymphocyte activation; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; ultra performance liquid chromatography; Western blotting"
"An automated microfluidic system for selection of aptamer probes against ovarian cancer tissues",2019,"Because of the difficulty of treatment in its latest stages, cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Therefore, high-affinity and specificity biomarkers are still in demand for many cancer types, and the utility of aptamers to serve in this regard has been explored recently. Although a process known as ""systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment"" (SELEX) has been used to generate aptamer-based cancer biomarkers, this approach is complicated, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. An automated microfluidic system was consequently developed herein to screen ovarian cancer-specific aptamers via on-chip SELEX with clinical cancer tissue samples. The integrated microfluidic system consisted of an integrated microfluidic chip, a temperature control module equipped with 12 thermoelectric coolers, and a flow control module for controlling 36 electromagnetic valves such that the entire, tissue-based SELEX process could be fully automated and carried out within 15 h. Highly specific ovarian cancer aptamers with high affinity (dissociation constant of 129 nM) to their cellular targets were screened with this system. Given the comparable specificity to their much more expensive antibody counterparts, these aptamers, when used in conjunction with the developed microfluidic system, may be used to diagnose ovarian cancer in its earliest stages. ? 2019 Author(s).","Automation; Biomarkers; Dissociation; Fluidic devices; Microfluidics; Thermoelectric equipment; Tissue; Cancer biomarkers; Dissociation constant; Electromagnetic valves; Integrated microfluidic chips; Integrated microfluidic systems; Micro fluidic system; Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichments; Thermoelectric cooler; Diseases"
"Redesigning the user interface of a healthcare management system for the elderly with a systematic usability testing method",2019,"Myriad medical advances and lengthening human longevity increasingly draw our focus toward ways to stay healthy. Healthcare management systems, both videos and apps, prosper now in the marketplace under that focus. Usability and interfaces have been identified as two critical components of these systems, yet to date, few studies have focused on improving these components for older users, who comprise a unique, expanding ethnic group. This study aimed to integrate both objective and subjective perspectives to analyze a health management system’s usability and its interface for senior. We developed an integrative usability metrics set collating both psychological and physiological data. An empirical study verified a resulting improvement of the system and its interface. Results showed more consistent data when the system user’s cognition was positive with respect to usability. Suggestions for enhancing the system’s usability among the older persons are given. ? 2019, ? 2019 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.","Eye tracking; Health care; Testing; Usability engineering; Critical component; elderly; Health management systems; Healthcare management systems; Heart rates; Physiological data; Usability testing; Usability testing methods; User interfaces"
"MED28 and forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) mediate matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)-dependent cellular migration in human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells",2019,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of the lung cancer cases that have become a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Overexpression of transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is involved in the inauspicious development of several types of cancer, including lung tumor aggressiveness. Our laboratory has previously found that MED28, a Mediator subunit for transcriptional activation, modulates cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion in human breast cancer cells. The objective of the current study is to investigate the potential role of MED28 and FOXM1 in NSCLC. In addition to A549 and PC9 cells, we also used a doxycycline-inducible system to generate FOXM1-overexpressed A549-DN cells, and we explored the connection of MED28 with FOXM1 and their effect on migration. Herein, we report that the increased expression levels of both MED28 and FOXM1 elevated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), a metastasis marker, which enhanced cell migration and matrigel invasion of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, MED28 interacted with FOXM1, and both exhibited a mutual effect on the expression and subcellular localization. Moreover, MED28 small interfering RNA-mediated MMP2 gene suppression could be attenuated by inducible expression of a constitutively active form of FOXM1, which consequently restored the migration and invasion ability of NSCLC cells. Our data indicate that MED28 interacts with FOXM1, and each affects the expression and localization of the other, and, more importantly, both regulate MMP2-dependent migration and invasion in human lung cancer cells. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","forkhead box protein M1; gelatinase A; med28 protein; protein; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; Article; cell invasion; cell migration; cellular distribution; controlled study; gene repression; human; human cell; non small cell lung cancer; PC-9 cell line; priority journal; protein expression; protein interaction; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting"
"Different routes of heroin intake cause various heroin-induced leukoencephalopathies",2019,"Objective: Toxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare but critical neurological disorder in heroin abusers. Our aim is to compare the clinical manifestations, brain MRIs and prognoses of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy by different intake routes. Methods: We present two patients with toxic leukoencephalopathy caused by intravenous (IV) injection of heroin and 48 additional cases from systematic reviews of the literature published between 1994 and 2018. Results: Among the 50 heroin abusers who developed leukoencephalopathy, inhalation was the most popular route (60%), followed by IV injection (30%) and snorting (10%). Mental changes, mutism and urine/fecal incontinence were the major symptoms in patients who IV injected heroin, while cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria were more common among those who inhaled heroin. Delayed-onset encephalopathy uniquely occurred in those who IV injected heroin, whereas progressive encephalopathy was more commonly observed in those who inhaled heroin. Clinical improvement was observed in 60% of patients, the overall mortality rate was 12%, and higher mortality was observed in patients who used the inhalation route (16.7%). The hallmarks on the MRIs of those who inhaled heroin were posterior to anterior involvement of the cerebral white matter and lesions in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, cerebellum and brainstem. In contrast, those who IV injected heroin had more frequent lesions in the subcortical U fibers and the genu of the internal capsules. Conclusion: These data could help physicians make an early diagnosis and predict prognosis and suggest that prompt antioxidative or symptomatic treatments might reduce the long-term consequences and mortality of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; choline; diamorphine; n acetylaspartic acid; ubidecarenone; diamorphine; narcotic agent; acute kidney failure; adult; akinetic mutism; Article; bradykinesia; brain disease; brain stem; capsula interna; case report; cerebellar ataxia; cerebellum; clinical article; clinical feature; compulsion; confusion; corpus callosum; delta rhythm; dysarthria; electroencephalogram; emergency ward; feces incontinence; Glasgow coma scale; hepatitis; heroin dependence; human; hyperthermia; inhalation; intoxication; intravenous drug abuse; irritability; leukoencephalopathy; limb weakness; male; mental disease; mortality rate; mutism; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; paraplegia; priority journal; prognosis; rhabdomyolysis; systematic review; tachycardia; urge incontinence; urinalysis; urine retention; white matter lesion; chemically induced; complication; diagnostic imaging; heroin dependence; inhalational drug administration; intranasal drug administration; intravenous drug administration; leukoencephalopathy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Intranasal; Administration, Intravenous; Adult; Heroin; Heroin Dependence; Humans; Leukoencephalopathies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Narcotics"
"Chikungunya virus inhibition by synthetic coumarin–guanosine conjugates",2019,"Since its discovery in Tanganyika, Africa in 1952, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreaks have occurred in Africa, Asia, Europe, and America. Till now chikungunya fever has spread in nearly 40 countries. Because of lack of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs to intervene this disease, 21 new conjugated compounds were designed and synthesized by coupling of 6,8-dithioguanosine at its C-6 position with 3-(chloromethyl)coumarins bearing an F, Cl, Br, Me, or –OMe substituent through the –SCH2– joint. Meanwhile, an organic “dummy” ligand (e.g., methyl, benzyl, and naphthylmethyl) or a coumarinyl moiety was attached at the C-8 position. By high through-put screening, three of these new conjugates were found to inhibit CHIKV in Vero cells with significant potency (EC50 = 9.9–13.9 μM) and showed low toxicity (CC50 = 96.5–212 μM). The selectivity index values were 9.37–21.7. Their structure–activity relationship was deduced, which indicates that the coumarin moiety is essential and the presence of a –OMe group enhances the antiviral activity. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","2 amino 6 (6' methoxycoumarin 3' yl)methylthio 8 (1'' naphthylmethylthio) 9 (beta d ribofuranos 1''' yl)purine; 2 amino 6,8 bis[(6' methoxycoumarin 3' yl)methylthio] 9 (beta d ribofuranos 1'' yl); 2 amino 6,8 bis[(8' methoxycoumarin 3' yl)methylthio] 9 (beta d ribofuranos 1'' yl); 3 [(methylthio) methyl]coumarin; antivirus agent; coumarin; coumarin derivative; guanosine; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; coumarin; coumarin derivative; guanosine; alkylation; antiviral activity; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chikungunya; Chikungunya virus; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug synthesis; fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry; high throughput screening; lipophilicity; Michael addition; nucleophilicity; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; selectivity index; structure activity relation; Vero cell line; animal; chemical phenomena; chemistry; Chikungunya virus; Chlorocebus aethiops; drug effect; IC50; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Cercopithecus aethiops; Chikungunya virus; Coumarins; Guanosine; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Vero Cells"
"A novel miR-365-3p/EHF/keratin 16 axis promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma metastasis, cancer stemness and drug resistance via enhancing β5-integrin/c-met signaling pathway",2019,"Background: Targeting the c-Met signaling pathway has become a therapeutic strategy in multiple types of cancer. We unveiled a novel c-Met regulating mechanism that could be applied as a modality for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) therapy. Methods: Upregulation of keratin 16 (KRT16) was found by comparing isogenic pairs of low and high invasive human OSCC lines via microarray analysis. OSCC cells with ectopic expression or silencing of KRT16 were used to scrutinize functional roles and associated molecular mechanisms. Results: We observed that high KRT16 expression significantly correlated with poorer pathological differentiation, advanced stages, increased lymph nodes metastasis, and decreased survival rate from several Taiwanese OSCC patient cohorts. We further revealed that miR-365-3p could target ETS homologous factor (EHF), a KRT16 transcription factor, to decrease migration, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance in OSCC cells via inhibition of KRT16. Under confocal microscopic examination, c-Met was found possibly partially associates with KRT16 through β5-integrin. Colocalization of these three proteins may facilitate c-Met and β5-integrin-mediated signaling in OSCC cells. Depletion of KRT16 led to increased protein degradation of β5-integrin and c-Met through a lysosomal pathway leading to inhibition of their downstream Src/STAT3/FAK/ERK signaling in OSCC cells. Knockdown of KRT16 enhanced chemosensitivity of OSCC towards 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Various combination of c-Met inhibitor (foretinib), protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), β5-integrin antibody, and 5-FU markedly augmented cytotoxic effects in OSCC cells as well as tumor killing effects in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Our data indicate that targeting a novel miR-365-3p/EHF/KRT16/β5-integrin/c-Met signaling pathway could improve treatment efficacy in OSCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","beta5 integrin; cytokeratin 16; ETS homologous factor; fluorouracil; foretinib; genistein; microRNA; microRNA 365 3p; scatter factor receptor; transcription factor; unclassified drug; beta integrin; beta5 integrin; cytokeratin 16; EHF protein, human; fluorouracil; KRT16 protein, human; microRNA; MIRN365 microRNA, human; scatter factor receptor; transcription factor; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; beta5 integrin c met signaling pathway; cancer staging; cancer stemness; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cell differentiation; cell migration; chemosensitivity; cohort analysis; confocal microscopy; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; ectopic expression; female; gene function; gene silencing; genetic association; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; infant; KRT16 gene; lymph node metastasis; lysosome; major clinical study; male; metastasis; microarray analysis; molecular biology; mouse; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line; priority journal; protein degradation; protein depletion; protein localization; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; survival rate; Taiwanese; transcription initiation; tumor invasion; upregulation; animal; cell motion; drug effect; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; lymph node metastasis; mouth tumor; pathology; SCID mouse; signal transduction; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Fluorouracil; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Integrin beta Chains; Keratin-16; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mice; Mice, SCID; MicroRNAs; Mouth Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors"
"Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation over right posterior parietal cortex on attention function in healthy young adults",2019,"Attention involves three distinct networks for alerting, orienting, and executive control. Interventions targeting the specific attentional networks remain lacking. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modulate cortical excitability, which potentially serves as an interventional tool to treat individuals with attention impairment. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of applying tDCS over the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) on the performance of the three attentional networks. Twenty-six healthy young adults performed the Attention Network Test before and after anodal or sham tDCS stimulation over the right PPC. The alerting, orienting, and executive effects were assessed before and after the stimulation. The results demonstrated that the orienting effect was significantly improved after real tDCS relative to sham, whereas the alerting and executive control effects remained unaffected. Consistent with previous clinical and functional imaging studies, this suggests that the right PPC is actively engaged with the spatial orienting of attention. ? 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; attention; clinical article; executive function; female; human; human experiment; male; posterior parietal cortex; transcranial direct current stimulation; young adult"
"Antitumor effect of kurarinone and underlying mechanism in small cell lung carcinoma cells",2019,"Background: Kurarinone, a prenylated flavonone isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens, is known to be cytotoxic against many human cancer cells but not human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) yet. Also, the exact molecular mechanism of kurarinone for induction cytotoxicity remains unknown. Material and methods: We investigated the effects of kurarinone on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration in H1688 SCLC cells. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Apoptotic indices such as cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase activity, and death receptors were evaluated by flow cytometry. Transwell migration and invasion assays were also included. Results: Our results indicated that kurarinone significantly decreased H1688 cell viability and induced the accumulation of sub-G1 fractions by activating caspase-3,-9, and PARP cleavage accompanied by the elevated release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial dysfunction in H1688 cells. Additionally, kurarinone promoted Fas and TRAIL receptor-1 and-2 expression via the caspase-8/Bid pathway, suggesting that kurarinone triggered apoptosis via the mitochondria-mediated and receptor-mediated apoptotic pathways. We also observed that kurarinone repressed migration and invasion capabilities of SCLC cells by suppressing the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins and matrix metalloproteinases. Conclusion: Our findings provided evidence that kurarinone can induce apoptosis in SCLC cells via multiple mechanisms and delayed the cell migration and invasion of SCLC cells. ? 2019 Chung et al.","caspase; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; cytochrome c; death receptor; death receptor 4; death receptor 5; kurarinone; matrix metalloproteinase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell cycle; cell invasion; cell migration; cell migration assay; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug mechanism; enzyme activity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; flow cytometry; human; human cell; lung small cell carcinoma cell line; mitochondrial membrane potential; MTT assay; NCI-H1688 cell line; protein expression; protein metabolism; protein secretion; signal transduction"
"DOX/ICG-carrying γ-PGA-g-PLGA-based polymeric nanoassemblies for acid-triggered rapid DOX release combined with NIR-activated photothermal effect",2019,"To boost the efficacy of chemo-photothermal cancer treatment by the intracellular rapid release of doxorubicin (DOX) combined with near-infrared (NIR)-triggered photothermal effect of indocyanine green (ICG), the poly(γ-glutamic acid)-g-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (γ-PGA-g-PLGA)-based polymeric nanoassemblies (PNAs) with simultaneous incorporation of DOX and ICG were developed in this work by simple one-step nanoprecipitation. The obtained DOX/ICG-loaded PNAs were characterized by a compact γ-PGA/DOX complexes-encapsulated PLGA-rich core covered with the co-assembly of amphiphilic D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)] (DSPE-PEG) and ICG molecules. The robust cargo-loaded PNAs not only promoted the photo-stability of ICG in PBS, but also reduced ICG leakage from PNAs. With the milieu pH being altered from 7.4 to 5.0, the massive disruption of ionic DOX/γ-GA complexes and PLGA degradation considerably accelerated DOX release from payload-containing PNAs. The results of in vitro cellular uptake revealed that the DOX/ICG-loaded PNAs appreciably enhanced the cellular uptake of payloads by HeLa cells. Notably, through the intracellular acid-triggered rapid DOX release combined with the ICG-based NIR-activated hyperthermia and singlet oxygen generation, the combination therapy of DOX/ICG-loaded PNAs can use lower dosage of drugs to effectively inhibit proliferation of HeLa cells compared to the chemo or photothermal treatment alone, thus showing the great potential to improve efficacy of cancer treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Amino acids; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Drug dosage; Gas generators; Hyperthermia therapy; Infrared devices; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylenes; Targeted drug delivery; Amphiphilic graft copolymers; Combination therapy; Intracellular drug delivery; Nano-assemblies; Photo-thermal; Photothermal effects; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Singlet oxygen generation; Lanthanum compounds"
"TNF-α-induced miR-450a mediates TMEM182 expression to promote oral squamous cell carcinoma motility",2019,"Distant metastasis leads oral cancer patients into a poor survival rate and a high recurrence stage. During tumor progression, dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to involve tumor initiation and modulate oral cancer malignancy. MiR-450a was significantly upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients without functional reports. This study was attempted to uncover the molecular mechanism of novel miR-450a in OSCC. Mir-450a expression was examined by quantitative RT-PCR, both in OSCC cell lines and patients. Specific target of miR-450a was determined by software prediction, luciferase reporter assay, and correlation with target protein expression. The functions of miR-450a and TMEM182 were accessed by adhesion and transwell invasion analyses. Determination of the expression and cellular localization of TMEM182 was examined by RT-PCR and by immunofluorescence staining. The signaling pathways involved in regulation of miR-450a were investigated using the kinase inhibitors. Overexpression of miR-450a in OSCC cells impaired cell adhesion ability and induced invasiveness, which demonstrated the functional role of miR-450a as an onco-miRNA. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-mediated expression of TMEM182 was regulated by miR-450a induction. MiR-450a-reduced cellular adhesion was abolished by TMEM182 restoration. Furthermore, the oncogenic activity of TNF-α/miR-450a/TMEM182 axis was primarily through activating extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. ERK1/2 inhibitor prevented the TNF-α-induced miR-450a expression and enhanced adhesion ability. Our data suggested that TNF-α-induced ERK1/2-dependent miR-450a against TMEM182 expression exerted a great influence on increasing OSCC motility. Overall, our results provide novel molecular insights into how TNF-α contributes to oral carcinogenesis through miR-450a that targets TMEM182. ? 2019 Hsing et al.

"Maslinic acid enhances immune responses in leukemic mice through macrophage phagocytosis and natural killer cell activities in vivo",2019,"Background/Aim: Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from wax-like coatings of olives, has been shown to reduce cancer cell number through induction of autophagy and apoptosis in many human cancer cells including human leukemia HL-60 cells. In the present study, we investigated whether or not MA affects immune responses in a leukemia mouse model. Materials and Methods: WEHI-3 cells were intraperitonealIy (i.p.) injected into normal BALB/c mice to develop leukemia. Mice were then treated by i.p. injection with MA at different doses (0, 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. After treatment, all animals were weighed and blood, liver and spleen tissues were weighed. Blood or spleen both were used for determination of cell markers or phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activities and T- and B-cell proliferation, respectively, by using a flow cytometric assay. Results: MA did not significantly affect body, liver, and spleen weights. However, MA increased markers of T-cells (at 16 mg/kg treatment) and monocytes (at 32 mg/kg treatment), but reduced B-cell markers (at 8 mg/kg treatment); MA did not significantly affect cell marker of macrophages. Furthermore, MA increased phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peritoneal cavity at 32 mg/kg treatment and increased NK cell activity at target cell:splenocyte ratio of 25:1 but did not affect B- and T-cell proliferation. Conclusion: MA increased immune responses by enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and NK cell activities in leukemic mice. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Lymphatic vessel remodeling and invasion in pancreatic cancer progression",2019,"Background: The lymphatic system is involved in metastasis in pancreatic cancer progression. In cancer staging, lymphatic spread has been used to assess the invasiveness of tumor cells. However, from the endothelium's perspective, the analysis downplays the peri-lesional activities of lymphatic vessels. This unintended bias is largely due to the lack of 3-dimensional (3-D) tissue information to depict the lesion microstructure and vasculature in a global and integrated fashion. Methods: We targeted the pancreas as the model organ to investigate lymphatic vessel remodeling in cancer lesion progression. Transparent pancreases were prepared by tissue clearing to facilitate deep-tissue, tile-scanning microscopy for 3-D lymphatic network imaging. Findings: In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we identify the close association between the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions and the lymphatic network. In mouse models of PanIN (elastase-CreER;LSL-KrasG12D and elastase-CreER;LSL-KrasG12D;p53+/?), the 3-D image data reveal the peri-lesional lymphangiogenesis, endothelial invagination, formation of the bridge/valve-like luminal tubules, vasodilation, and luminal invasion. In the orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we identify the localized, graft-induced lymphangiogenesis and the peri- and intra-tumoral lymphatic vessel invasion. Interpretation: The integrated view of duct lesions and vascular remodeling suggests an active role, rather than a passive target, of lymphatic vessels in the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Our 3-D image data provide insights into the pancreatic cancer microenvironment and establish the technical and morphological foundation for systematic detection and 3-D analysis of lymphatic vessel invasion.

"A structure-function approach identifies L-PGDS as a mediator responsible for glucocorticoid-induced leptin expression in adipocytes",2019,"Leptin is an adipokine predominantly secreted by adipocytes and has many physiological roles, including in energy homeostasis. We identified that AM630, a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) antagonist, down-regulated leptin expression in mature adipocytes differentiated from either stromal vascular fractions isolated from inguinal fat pads of C57BL/6J mice or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. However, the leptin-suppressive effects of AM630 preserved in CB2-deficient adipocytes indicated the off-target activity of AM630 in leptin expression. Pharmacological and genetic studies, cheminformatics, and docking simulation were applied to identify the potential protein target of AM630 that modulates leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. Screening of the reported off-targets of AM630 identified a synthetic cannabinoid WIN55212-2 exerting the same function. Target deconvolution and docking simulation suggested that AM630 and WIN55212-2 were both inhibitors of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS). Further studies showed that L-PGDS positively regulates leptin expression. Although glucocorticoid and aldosterone were previously reported to induce expression of both L-PGDS and leptin, our data demonstrated that L-PGDS mediates only glucocorticoid-induced leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. No effect was observed after aldosterone treatment. This newly discovered glucocorticoid – L-PGDS – leptin pathway may provide insights into current clinical use of glucocorticoid and management of their undesired effects such as obesity. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","6 iodo 3 (4 methoxybenzoyl) 2 methyl 1 (2 morpholinoethyl)indole; glucocorticoid; leptin; lipocalin type prostaglandin d2 synthase; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; Article; cell differentiation; controlled study; down regulation; in vitro study; inguinal fat pad; male; mediator; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein expression"
"Highly immunogenic influenza virus-like particles containing B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) for multi-subtype vaccine development",2019,"Virus-like particle (VLP) technology is an attractive platform for the development of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Influenza VLPs can be obtained by the overexpression of HA, M1, NA, and/or M2 viral proteins in insect, mammalian, or plant cells. In this study, we reported to obtain highly immunogenic influenza VLPs by molecular incorporation with B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) or proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Since BAFF and APRIL act as homotrimers to interact with their receptors, we engineered the VLPs by direct fusion of BAFF or APRIL to the transmembrane anchored domain of H5HA gene. Results showed that immunizations with the HA-transmembrane anchored BAFF- or APRIL-VLPs only formulated in alum but not MPL adjuvant elicited significantly higher IgG titers in sera. However, only the BAFF-VLPs formulated in alum adjuvant elicited more broadly neutralizing antibodies against the homologous and two heterologous H5N1 clade/subclade viruses and conferred protective immunity against live virus challenges. As the multi-subtype influenza vaccines containing a variety of HA subtypes can confer broader protective immunity, we also obtained multi-subtype H5H7 BAFF-VLPs and H1H5H7 BAFF-VLPs and demonstrated that these multi-subtype BAFF-VLPs were able to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against multiple HA subtypes. Our findings provided useful information for the development of highly immunogenic, multi-subtype influenza VLP vaccines. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aluminum potassium sulfate; APRIL protein; B cell activating factor; h5ha protein; immunoglobulin G; immunological adjuvant; influenza vaccine; neutralizing antibody; unclassified drug; viral protein; animal experiment; animal model; antibody production; Article; bioengineering; body weight loss; cladistics; controlled study; drug formulation; female; human; human cell; humoral immunity; immunization; immunoglobulin blood level; influenza; Influenza A virus (H5N1); Influenza virus; inhibitory concentration; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; sedimentation; sucrose gradient; survival rate; transmembrane anchored domain; vaccine immunogenicity; virus like agent; virus neutralization; Western blotting; wild type"
"Multilayer architecture microfluidic network array for combinatorial drug testing on 3D-cultured cells",2019,"In vitro testing of drug compounds on cell models during the drug development process represents an indispensable step in the initial screening process. Although drug testing on three-dimensional (3D) cultured cells may provide a more accurate prediction of drug efficacy, it is relatively costly and time-consuming to perform compared with conventional 2D cultures due to the thick z-axis of the 3D models. In this study, we have presented a microfluidic platform with integrated pneumatic valves for producing a thin-gel 3D cell culture-based combinatorial drug screening array (3D-μCDS array). The multilayer architecture and microfluidic layout has a smaller device footprint than a single-layer microfluidic channel arrangement, making it well suited to scaling up for high-throughput combinatorial drug screening on 3D cell model. We performed 8 × 8 combination drug screening experiments with the device using two anti-cancer drugs (doxorubicin and paclitaxel) on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines for demonstration. Our results indicate that our 3D-μCDS array device allows the successful screening of multiple drug combinations while reducing the operation time and the number of sample/reagents required, making it an ideal tool for general combinatorial drug screening, as well as for applications using valuable tissues and clinical samples. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Body fluids; Cell culture; Cells; Diseases; Drug products; Microfluidics; Multilayers; Network architecture; Screening; Software architecture; 3-D cell culture; Drug screening; High throughput; MCF-7 breast cancer cells; Microfluidic array; Microfluidic platforms; Multi-layer architectures; Threedimensional (3-d); 3D modeling; collagen; animal; cell culture technique; chemistry; combinatorial chemistry; devices; diffusion; equipment design; extracellular matrix; fluorescence; gel; high throughput screening; human; IC50; microfluidics; preclinical study; procedures; rat; tumor cell culture; Animals; Cell Culture Techniques; Collagen; Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques; Diffusion; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Equipment Design; Extracellular Matrix; Fluorescence; Gels; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Microfluidics; Rats; Tumor Cells, Cultured"
"A simple approach for the ultrasensitive detection of paraquat residue in adzuki beans by surface-enhanced Raman scattering",2019,"Paraquat (PQ), a broad-spectrum contact herbicide, has been used in many countries for controlling weed growth in agriculture because of its quick-acting and nonselective contact with green plant tissue. PQ is also toxic to humans, and even contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, PQ is generally excluded from pesticide residue monitoring programs due to the lack of suitable determination methods. Thus, this study developed a detection method combined with simple extraction and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to rapidly determine and quantify the PQ residue on legumes without destructive procedures and high-cost instruments. Following the extraction procedure of the QuPPe-method, however, we took whole adzuki beans (Vigna angularis) extracted via a mixture of methanol and 1% formic acid at room temperature and followed by a 1 min cleanup by SPE. The PQ values for adzuki beans determined by LC/MSMS showed that regardless of whether extraction was followed by the QuPPe-method or the method we proposed, a consistent and low relative standard deviation (RSD) below &lt;22% was found. In this study, we proposed to extract PQ on the surface of the beans by shaking briefly with solvent, and then the PQ molecules were detected and quantified by depositing Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) and performing SERS within 10 min. Using a coating of deposited Ag nanoparticles, SERS can achieve a limit of detection (LOD) for PQ on the order of 1 μg L -1 (?4 × 10 -9 M) and a method detection limit (MDL) for adzuki beans of 0.8 μg kg -1 (?3.3 × 10 -9 M). This sensitivity at the ppb level absolutely met the maximum residue limit (MRL) for PQ in dried beans as declared by most countries, including the US (0.3 mg kg -1 ), Australia (1.0 mg kg -1 ) and Taiwan (0.2 mg kg -1 ). Taiwan will ban the use of PQ as a defoliating agent for harvest in adzuki bean fields in 2019; therefore, developing a method for detecting PQ residues in the field or in import markets is necessary for consumer health and for authorities. This study provided an opportunity to utilize SERS in the field of on-site pesticide residue screening. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",""
"CoMutPlotter: A web tool for visual summary of mutations in cancer cohorts",2019,"Background: CoMut plot is widely used in cancer research publications as a visual summary of mutational landscapes in cancer cohorts. This summary plot can inspect gene mutation rate and sample mutation burden with their relevant clinical details, which is a common first step for analyzing the recurrence and co-occurrence of gene mutations across samples. The cBioPortal and iCoMut are two web-based tools that allow users to create intricate visualizations from pre-loaded TCGA and ICGC data. For custom data analysis, only limited command-line packages are available now, making the production of CoMut plots difficult to achieve, especially for researchers without advanced bioinformatics skills. To address the needs for custom data and TCGA/ICGC data comparison, we have created CoMutPlotter, a web-based tool for the production of publication-quality graphs in an easy-of-use and automatic manner. Results: We introduce a web-based tool named CoMutPlotter to lower the barriers between complex cancer genomic data and researchers, providing intuitive access to mutational profiles from TCGA/ICGC projects as well as custom cohort studies. A wide variety of file formats are supported by CoMutPlotter to translate cancer mutation profiles into biological insights and clinical applications, which include Mutation Annotation Format (MAF), Tab-separated values (TSV) and Variant Call Format (VCF) files. Conclusions: In summary, CoMutPlotter is the first tool of its kind that supports VCF file, the most widely used file format, as its input material. CoMutPlotter also provides the most-wanted function for comparing mutation patterns between custom cohort and TCGA/ICGC project.

"Systems biology approaches to investigate genetic and epigenetic molecular progression mechanisms for identifying gene expression signatures in papillary thyroid cancer",2019,"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer. Particularly, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for the highest proportion of thyroid cancer. Up to now, there are few researches discussing the pathogenesis and progression mechanisms of PTC from the viewpoint of systems biology approaches. In this study, first we constructed the candidate genetic and epigenetic network (GEN) consisting of candidate protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) and candidate gene regulatory network (GRN) by big database mining. Secondly, system identification and system order detection methods were applied to prune candidate GEN via next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA methylation profiles to obtain the real GEN. After that, we extracted core GENs from real GENs by the principal network projection (PNP) method. To investigate the pathogenic and progression mechanisms in each stage of PTC, core GEN was denoted in respect of KEGG pathways. Finally, by comparing two successive core signaling pathways of PTC, we not only shed light on the causes of PTC progression, but also identified essential biomarkers with specific gene expression signature. Moreover, based on the identified gene expression signature, we suggested potential candidate drugs to prevent the progression of PTC with querying Connectivity Map (CMap). ? 2019 by the authors.

"Multiplexed Ultra-Sensitive Detection of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) Ion by FET Sensor Array in a Liquid Medium",2019,"Chromium, one of the top five toxic heavy metals ranked according to significance in public health by WHO, exists as Cr(III) which is naturally occurring or Cr(VI) which is anthropogenic in origin. The EPA specifies the maximum contaminant level in drinking water to be 10-6 M or 0.1 mg/L or 100 ppb for the total dissolved Cr. To ensure the water consumed by the population has these pollutants below the safe threshold, this report demonstrates a field effect transistor (FET) based sensor design incorporating a highly target specific ion-selective membrane combined with extended gate technology which manifests sensitivity exceeding the Nernst limit aided by the high field effect in the short gap region of extended gate technology. Characterization and repeated testing of the portable device revealed a commendable calibration sensitivity of 99 mV/log [Cr3+] and 71 mV/log [Cr6+] for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) respectively, well surpassing the Nernst limits of sensitivity and offering a detection limit lower than ion-selective electrodes (10-6 M), and comparable to the expensive benchtop laboratory instrument, ICP-MS. This report presents a robust, easy to fabricate, economic and efficient handheld biosensor to detect the chromium in a liquid sample whether it exists as Cr(III) or Cr(VI).",""
"Nanodiamond-supported silver nanoparticles as potent and safe antibacterial agents",2019,"Since its discovery nearly a century ago, antibiotics has been one of the most effective methods in treating infectious diseases and limiting pathogen spread. However, pathogens often build up antibiotic resistance over time, leading to serious failure of the treatment. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) is an appealing alternative, but successful treatment of the bacterial infection requires a plentiful supply of AgNP, which can negatively impact human health if people are excessively exposed to the particles. Here, we present a method to overcome this challenge by synthesizing nanodiamond-supported AgNP noncovalently conjugated with albumin molecules to achieve enhanced antibacterial activity and strengthened biocompatibility. Using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, we found that the albumin-conjugated silver-diamond nanohybrids showed a long-term bactericidal effect after 36 days of the treatment at the AgNP concentration of 250 ?g mL?1. Moreover, the toxicity of the nanohybrids to human cells (including human fibroblasts, lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, and breast adenocarcinoma cells) is low even at the particle concentration of 500 ?g mL?1. The method provides a general and practical solution to the concerns of bacterial resistance against AgNP and issues associated with the size, shape, aggregation, and toxicity of AgNP are largely resolved. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanohybrids can be readily incorporated into natural polysaccharides (such as guar gum) to form three-in-one hydrogels, showing promising applications in nanomedicine. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Sulfur-doped graphene quantum dot-based paper sensor for highly sensitive and selective detection of 4-nitrophenol in contaminated water and wastewater",2019,"4-Nitrophenol (4-NP) is a promulgated priority pollutant, which can cause a negative impact on human health. The development of a direct and effective technique for the rapid detection and screening of 4-NP is, therefore, of urgent need. In this study, the blue luminescent sulfur-doped graphene quantum dots (S-GQDs) with a size of 1-5 nm are fabricated using a one-step pyrolysis procedure in the presence of citric acid and 3-mercaptosuccinic acid. The S-GQDs exhibit a strong emission band at 450 nm under the excitation of 330 nm UV light. 4-NP can serve as the fluorescence quencher by the π-π interaction with S-GQD, resulting in the linear decrease in fluorescence intensity after the addition of various 4-NP concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 200 μM. The S-GQDs serve as the sensing probe to enhance the analytical performance on 4-NP detection with the limit of detection values of 0.7 and 3.5 nM in deionized water and wastewater, respectively. The S-GQD based sensing platform can be used to detect 4-NP in different matrices of water and wastewater. In addition, the detected percentages of spiked 4-NP concentrations in the presence of different matrices and interferences are in the range of (98 ± 5)-(108 ± 2)%. Moreover, the S-GQD based paper sensor can rapidly screen 4-NP in wastewater within 1 min. Results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate the superiority of S-GQDs as a promising fluorescence probe for highly sensitive and selective detection of a wide concentration range of 4-NP in deionized water and wastewater. ?

"Effects of systemic and neuraxial morphine on the immune system",2019,"In the study, we tried to evaluate the effects of morphine injected through the systemic or neuraxial route on immune cell function and cytokine production in healthy women.In total, 29 paired samples of fresh peripheral blood were collected from healthy women who had been administered morphine for anesthetic analgesia through intravenous (IV), epidural, or spinal route postpartum. Their isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were mitogen-activated and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-interleukin (IL)-2, and anti-interferon (IFN)-γ antibodies for flow cytometry, and the plasma levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-α2, IL-10, IL-8, GM-CSF, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, were measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The results demonstrated that regardless of the administration route, morphine delivery slightly reduced IL-2 expression in CD4 cells after activation, and the same effect was not noted for CD8 cells. Intravenous or epidural morphine tended to reduce IFN-γ expression in CD8 cells. Spinal and IV morphine substantially increased IL-6 production, whereas epidural morphine hindered IL-10 and GM-CSF production. IV morphine injection reduced MCP-1 production in plasma. Compared with spinal morphine, IV or epidural morphine may more effectively inhibit the expression of various cytokines and thus affect immune response.All 3 routes of morphine injection tended to decrease IL-2 production by CD4 cells, whereas IV or epidural morphine injection showed lower IFN-γ production by CD8 cells. However, additional large-scale studies with longer follow-up durations are warranted.","biological marker; cytokine; morphine; narcotic analgesic agent; adult; blood; drug effect; female; human; immune system; immunology; metabolism; puerperium; T lymphocyte; Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Female; Humans; Immune System; Morphine; Postpartum Period; T-Lymphocytes"

This work develops a bioinspired nanocomposite hyaluronic acid hydrogel system that incorporates N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (TMC/NPs) that carry a model subunit vaccine ovalbumin (OVA) that can elicit a potent and prolonged antigen-specific humoral response. Experimental results indicate that the nanocomposite hydrogel system (NPs-Gel) can retain a large proportion of its TMC/NPs that are bonded by covalent/electrostatic interactions and extend the release of the encapsulated OVA, enabling their localization at the site of hydrogel injection. The positively charged TMC/NPs can be effectively internalized by dendritic cells, significantly augmenting their maturation, suggesting that TMC can function as an adjuvant-based OVA delivery system. Upon subcutaneous implantation in mice, the NPs-Gel acts as an in situ depot that recruits and concentrates immune cells. The TMC/NPs that do not have any specific interactions with the hydrogel network are released rapidly and internalized by the neighboring immune cells, providing a priming dose, while those retained inside the NPs-Gel are ingested by the recruited and concentrated immune cells over time, acting as a booster dose, eliciting high titers of OVA-specific antibody responses. These experimental results suggest particulate vaccines that are integrated in such a bioinspired hydrogel system may be used as single-injection prime-boost vaccines, enabling effective and persistent humoral immune responses. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cells; Cytology; Hyaluronic acid; Hydrogels; Mammals; Nanocomposites; Vaccines; Adjuvant; Catechol; Humoral immune response; Hyaluronic acid hydrogels; N-trimethyl chitosans; Nanocomposite hydrogels; Specific interaction; Vaccine delivery; Immune system; chitosan nanoparticle; hyaluronic acid; nanocomposite; ovalbumin; animal cell; animal experiment; antibody response; antibody titer; antigen specificity; Article; cell maturation; covalent bond; dendritic cell; drug delivery system; drug release; experimental study; host cell; humoral immunity; hydrogel; immunocompetent cell; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; static electricity"
"Investigation of functional brain network reconfiguration during vocal emotional processing using graph-theoretical analysis",2019,"Vocal expression is essential for conveying the emotion during social interaction. Although vocal emotion has been explored in previous studies, little is known about how perception of different vocal emotional expressions modulates the functional brain network topology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional brain networks under different attributes of vocal emotion by graph-theoretical network analysis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were performed on 36 healthy participants.We utilized the Power-264 functional brain atlas to calculate the interregional functional connectivity (FC) from fMRI data under resting state and vocal stimuli at different arousal and valence levels. The orthogonal minimal spanning trees method was used for topological filtering. The paired-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction across all regions and arousal-valence levels were used for statistical comparisons. Our results show that brain network exhibits significantly altered network attributes at FC, nodal and global levels, especially under high-arousal or negative-valence vocal emotional stimuli. The alterations within/between well-known large-scale functional networks were also investigated. Through the present study, we have gained more insights into how comprehending emotional speech modulates brain networks. These findings may shed light on how the human brain processes emotional speech and how it distinguishes different emotional conditions. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; arousal; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; filtration; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; male; rest; speech; stimulus; theoretical study; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; emotion; image processing; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; voice; young adult; Adult; Arousal; Brain Mapping; Emotions; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Voice; Young Adult"
"Erratum: Highly efficient gene release in spatiotemporal precision approached by light and pH dual responsive copolymers",2019,"Triblock copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(pyrenylmethyl methacrylate) (PEG-b-PDMAEMA-b-PPy) has been developed for use as an ideal gene delivery system, which showed both high stability under physiological conditions and efficient gene release in a mimetic cancer environment. The siRNA release from this system without external stimulation was 16% in 1?h and then remained steady. However, the photo-triggered siRNA release was 78% within 1 h and was higher than 91% after 24 h. The remarkable contrast between the stability and release efficiency of these siRNA-condensed micelleplexes before and after photo-irradiation has been rationalized by the light- and pH-induced structural transitions of the triblock copolymer micelles. The negligible cytotoxicity, high cellular uptake efficiency, and remarkable knockdown efficiency shown in in vitro tests further revealed the promising potential of these triblock copolymer micelleplexes for use in stimuli-responsive gene therapy. ?

"Fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds as 10B delivery agent for boron neutron capture therapy",2019,"Boron neutron capture therapy is a potentially powerful anti-cancer treatment, the success of which depends heavily on the boron delivery agent. Enabling the real-time tracing of delivery agents as they move through the body is crucial to the further development of boron neutron capture therapy. In this study, we fabricate fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds using physical ion implantation in conjunction with a two-step annealing process. Fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds perform well in cell viability test. The red fluorescence of the 10B embedded nanodiamonds allows their use in fluorescence microscopy and in vivo imaging systems, thereby making it possible to conduct tracking in real time. The proposed fluorescent 10B embedded nanodiamonds, combining optical visibility and 10B transport capability, might be a promising boron delivery agent suitable for a wide range of biomedical applications. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Boron; Embedded systems; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Ion implantation; Medical applications; Neutrons; Real time systems; Biomedical applications; Boron neutron capture therapy; Cell viability; In-Vivo imaging; IVIS; Red fluorescence; Transport capabilities; Two-step annealing; Nanodiamonds"
"Enumerating circulating tumor cells with a Self-Assembled Cell Array (SACA) Chip: A feasibility study in patients with colorectal cancer",2019,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the secondmost common cause of cancer-related deathworldwide. Detecting and enumerating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with colorectal cancer emerged as an important prognostic tool which provides a direct estimate of metastatic potential. Improving the turnaround time and decreasing sample volume is critical for incorporating this liquid biopsy tool into routine practice. The objective of the current study was to validate the clinical feasibility of a self-assembled cell array (SACA) chip, a CTC counting platform with less than 4 h turnaround time, in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancers. In total, 179 patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancers from a single institute were enrolled. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive (EpCAM(+)), cluster of differentiation 45 negative (CD45(-)) cells were isolated and enumerated from 2 mL of peripheral vein blood (PB) and inferior mesenteric vein blood (IMV) samples obtained during surgery. We found that the CTC count in PB but not IMV correlates with disease stages. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not lead to decreased CTC count in both types of blood samples. With cutoffs of four CTCs per 2 mL of blood, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 5 ng/mL, patients with non-metastatic disease were more likely to experience recurrence if they had high PB CTC count and high serum CEA concentration (odds ratio, 8.9). Our study demonstrates the feasibility of enumerating CTCs with a SACA chip in patients with colorectal cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.
