"Calpain Inhibition Restores Autophagy and Prevents Mitochondrial Fragmentation in a Human iPSC Model of Diabetic Endotheliopathy",2019,"The relationship between diabetes and endothelial dysfunction remains unclear, particularly the association with pathological activation of calpain, an intracellular cysteine protease. Here, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) to investigate the effects of diabetes on vascular health. Our results indicate that iPSC-ECs exposed to hyperglycemia had impaired autophagy, increased mitochondria fragmentation, and was associated with increased calpain activity. In addition, hyperglycemic iPSC-ECs had increased susceptibility to cell death when subjected to a secondary insult—simulated ischemia-reperfusion injury (sIRI). Importantly, calpain inhibition restored autophagy and reduced mitochondrial fragmentation, concurrent with maintenance of ATP production, normalized reactive oxygen species levels and reduced susceptibility to sIRI. Using a human iPSC model of diabetic endotheliopathy, we demonstrated that restoration of autophagy and prevention of mitochondrial fragmentation via calpain inhibition improves vascular integrity. Our human iPSC-EC model thus represents a valuable platform to explore biological mechanisms and new treatments for diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction. ? 2019 The Author(s)In this article, Ong and colleagues used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) as a novel disease modeling platform to study the effects of diabetes on vascular dysfunction and provided the cause for calpain inhibitors as an anti-diabetic and cardioprotective drug. ? 2019 The Author(s)","adenosine triphosphate; calpain; caspase 3; caspase 7; reactive oxygen metabolite; aortic endothelial cell; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; cell differentiation; comparative study; controlled study; diabetic complication; diabetic patient; DNA fragmentation; endothelial dysfunction; enzyme activity; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; hyperglycemia; in vitro study; induced pluripotent stem cell; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrion; nuclear reprogramming; priority journal; reperfusion injury"

"The hemodynamic and pain impact of peripheral nerve block versus spinal anesthesia in diabetic patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery",2020,"Purpose: Comparison of hemodynamic profiles and pain scores in diabetic patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery receiving peripheral nerve block (PNB) or spinal anesthesia [subarachnoid block (SAB)]. Methods: This was a prospective, randomised controlled trial. We recruited diabetic patients aged?>?18?years, American Society of Anesthesiologists class II–III, who were scheduled for unilateral diabetic foot surgery below the knee. All patients were assessed for autonomic dysfunction using the Survey of Autonomic Symptoms score. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either PNB or SAB for the surgery. Hemodynamic data, including usage of vasopressors, were recorded at 5-min intervals for up to 1 h after the induction of anesthesia. Pain scores were recorded postoperatively, and follow-up was done via telephone 6?months later. Results: Compared to the PNB group, the SAB group had a larger number of patients with significant hypotension (14 vs. 1; p?=?0.001) and more patients who required vasopressor boluses (6 vs. 0 patients). Compared to SAB group, the patients in the PNB group had a longer postoperative pain-free duration (9 vs. 4.54?h; p?=?0.002) and lower pain scores 1?day after surgery (3.63 vs. 4.69; p?=?0.01). Conclusion: Peripheral nerve block should be considered, whenever possible, as the first option of anesthesia for lower limb surgery in diabetic patients as it provides hemodynamic stability and superior postoperative pain control compared to SAB.

"Techniques of monitoring blood glucose during pregnancy for women with pre-existing diabetes",2019,"Background There are a number of ways of monitoring blood glucose in women with diabetes during pregnancy, with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) recommended as a key component of the management plan. No existing systematic reviews consider the benefits/ effectiveness of different techniques of blood glucose monitoring on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear. This review is an update of a review that was first published in 2014 and subsequently updated in 2017. Objectives To compare techniques of blood glucose monitoring and their impact on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 November 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing techniques of blood glucose monitoring including SMBG, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), automated telemedicine monitoring or clinic monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also eligible for inclusion. RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results This review update includes a total of 12 trials (863) women (792 women with type 1 diabetes and 152 women with type 2 diabetes). The trials took place in Europe, the USA and Canada. Three of the 12 included studies are at low risk of bias, eight studies are at moderate risk of bias, and one study is at high risk of bias. Four trials reported that they were provided with the continuous glucose monitors free of charge or at a reduced cost by the manufacturer. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) versus intermittent glucose monitoring, (four studies, 609 women) CGM may reduce hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension) (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.85; 2 studies, 384 women; low-quality evidence), although it should be noted that only two of the four relevant studies reported data for this composite outcome. Conversely, this did not translate into a clear reduction for pre-eclampsia (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.08; 4 studies, 609 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was also no clear reduction in caesarean section (average RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.18; 3 studies, 427 women; I2 = 41%; moderate-quality evidence) or large-for-gestational age (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.26; 3 studies, 421 women; I2 = 70%; low-quality evidence) with CGM. There was not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.05 to 12.61, 71 infants, 1 study; low-quality evidence), or mortality or morbidity composite (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.06; 1 study, 200 women) as the evidence was based on single studies of low quality. CGM appears to reduce neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93; 3 studies, 428 infants). Neurosensory disability was not reported. Other methods of glucose monitoring For the following five comparisons, self-monitoring versus a different type of self-monitoring (two studies, 43 women); self-monitoring at home versus hospitalisation (one study, 100 women), pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring (one study, 61 women), automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system (three studies, 84 women), and constant CGM versus intermittent CGM (one study, 25 women), it is uncertain whether any of the interventions has any impact on any of our GRADE outcomes (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesarean section, large-for-gestational age) because the quality of the evidence was found to be very low. This was due to evidence largely being derived from single trials, with design limitations and limitations with imprecision (wide CIs, small sample sizes, and few events). There was not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality and morbidity composite. Other important outcomes, such as neurosensory disability, were not reported in any of these comparisons. Authors’ conclusions Two new studies (406 women) have been incorporated to one of the comparisons for this update. Although the evidence suggests that CGM in comparison to intermittent glucose monitoring may reduce hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, this did not translate into a clear reduction for pre-eclampsia, and so this result should be viewed with caution. No differences were observed for other primary outcomes for this comparison. The evidence base for the effectiveness of other monitoring techniques analysed in the other five comparisons is weak and based on mainly single studies with very low-quality evidence. Additional evidence from large well-designed randomised trials is required to inform choices of other glucose monitoring techniques and to confirm the effectiveness of CGM. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.","adiponectin; fatty acid; fructosamine; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; insulin; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; academic achievement; Apgar score; behavior change; birth injury; birth weight; blood glucose monitoring; blood pressure monitoring; body mass; breast feeding; cardiovascular disease; cesarean section; childhood obesity; diabetic ketoacidosis; eclampsia; educational status; fasting; feeding difficulty; fracture; gestational weight gain; glucose blood level; glycemic control; head circumference; health care cost; health service; hospitalization; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypocalcemia; hypoglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; large for gestational age; macrosomia; maternal diabetes mellitus; maternal hypertension; metabolic syndrome X; nerve paralysis; neurologic disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient compliance; perinatal morbidity; perinatal mortality; perineum injury; physical well-being; polycythemia; postnatal depression; postpartum hemorrhage; preeclampsia; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; premature labor; prenatal care; priority journal; puerperal infection; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory distress; respiratory distress syndrome; Review; sample size; self monitoring; shoulder dystocia; small for date infant; social status; solutio placentae; spontaneous abortion; systematic review; telemedicine; transient tachypnea of the newborn; treatment outcome; vaginal delivery; adult; blood; blood glucose monitoring; Canada; chemically induced; Europe; female; glucose blood level; hypertension; metabolism; newborn; preeclampsia; pregnancy; procedures; United States; Adult; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Canada; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Europe; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Hypoglycemia; Infant, Newborn; Perinatal Mortality; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; United States"
"In-depth examination of issues surrounding the reasons for child marriage in Kelantan, Malaysia: A qualitative study",2019,"Objective To examine individual, familial, community and societal issues surrounding the reasons for child marriage in Kelantan, Malaysia. Design Qualitative study by means of semistructured interviews with women and key informants, using social-ecological model as a conceptual framework. Setting Interviews were conducted in Kota Bharu district, Kelantan, a northeast state in Peninsular Malaysia. Participants Eighteen women of reproductive age (18 to 44 years old) that experienced their first marriage below the age of 18, as well as five key informants, consisting of a government officer, a community leader, an officer from religious department and two mothers. The women were recruited from a reproductive health clinic. The key informants who had specialised knowledge related to child marriage were selectively chosen. Results Three themes emerged that aligned with the social-ecological model: immaturity in decision-making, family poverty and religious and cultural norms. Conclusions The findings imply that sex education and awareness-building activities regarding the consequences of child marriage must be implemented to eradicate child marriage in Malaysia. Such implementation must be coordinated as a team-based approach involving experts in such fields as law, religion, psychology, social-welfare and public health. In order to increase the awareness of child marriage consequences, the target for awareness must extend not only to the adolescent girls and their families, but also to the community and society at large by clearly communicating the negative consequences of and addressing the drivers for child marriage. ?

"School culture and instructional leadership: A comparison between high-performing and low-performing urban secondary schools",2019,"In the school setting, instructional leadership has been asserted as the most crucial type of leadership that is closely linked to professional culture in schools. The main reason is that instructional leadership pertains to the core functions of education, instruction, and learning in classrooms, which also directly constitute as the main components of school culture. The purpose of the study presented in this paper was to examine and analyze the patterns of differences and relationships between instructional leadership and school culture of some high-and low-performing secondary schools. This study found that the school culture and instructional leadership of high-performing schools were markedly different from that of the low-performing schools. In high-performing schools, the school heads maintained positive attitudes toward students, staff, and parents; created a school culture and climate conductive to learning; and predominantly emphasized teachers’ professional values and collegiality. The findings imply that a school head should establish clear school vision and mission, set professional goals for staff, and build a two-way communication channel with teachers. School heads also should set high expectations on teachers and students, and create a positive school culture and climate of learning. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

"The role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the transduction of dental pain",2019,"Dental pain is a common health problem that negatively impacts the activities of daily living. Dentine hypersensitivity and pulpitis-associated pain are among the most common types of dental pain. Patients with these conditions feel pain upon exposure of the affected tooth to various external stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying dental pain, especially the transduction of external stimuli to electrical signals in the nerve, remain unclear. Numerous ion channels and receptors localized in the dental primary afferent neurons (DPAs) and odontoblasts have been implicated in the transduction of dental pain, and functional expression of various polymodal transient receptor potential (TRP) channels has been detected in DPAs and odontoblasts. External stimuli-induced dentinal tubular fluid movement can activate TRP channels on DPAs and odontoblasts. The odontoblasts can in turn activate the DPAs by paracrine signaling through ATP and glutamate release. In pulpitis, inflammatory mediators may sensitize the DPAs. They could also induce post-translational modifications of TRP channels, increase trafficking of these channels to nerve terminals, and increase the sensitivity of these channels to stimuli. Additionally, in caries-induced pulpitis, bacterial products can directly activate TRP channels on DPAs. In this review, we provide an overview of the TRP channels expressed in the various tooth structures, and we discuss their involvement in the development of dental pain. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Consumer behaviour towards willingness to pay for Halal products: An assessment of demand for Halal certification in a Muslim country",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the factors affecting Muslim consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for Halal food, products and operations by employing theory of reasoned action. Design/methodology/approach: This study has used quantitative research methodology and collected data from 350 questionnaires from a densely populated city of Pakistan. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: The results show that the concerns about Halal, religiosity, perception of usefulness of Halal and product ingredients have a significant impact on WTP for Halal foods, while attitude has an insignificant impact on WTP. Moreover, the extent of demand for Halal certification is significantly affected by WTP. Originality/value: The study highlighted the concerns of the Muslim consumers with respect to Halalness of the products and operations despite living in a Muslim country. It is recommended that the policy makers, food authorities and health institutions should conduct regular inspections of foods, products and producers’/manufacturers’ operations to ensure that all the procedures from manufacturing of the raw material till the finished goods follow Islamic principles to make them completely Halal. ? 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","article; certification; consumer attitude; human; human experiment; Muslim; Pakistan; partial least squares regression; perception; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; structural equation modeling; Theory of Reasoned Action"
"Application of nonlinear methods to discriminate fractionated electrograms in paroxysmal versus persistent atrial fibrillation",2019,"Background and Objective: Complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) may contain information concerning the electrophysiological substrate of atrial fibrillation (AF); therefore they are of interest to guide catheter ablation treatment of AF. Electrogram signals are shaped by activation events, which are dynamical in nature. This makes it difficult to establish those signal properties that can provide insight into the ablation site location. Nonlinear measures may improve information. To test this hypothesis, we used nonlinear measures to analyze CFAE. Methods: CFAE from several atrial sites, recorded for a duration of 16 s, were acquired from 10 patients with persistent and 9 patients with paroxysmal AF. These signals were appraised using non-overlapping windows of 1-, 2- and 4-s durations. The resulting data sets were analyzed with Recurrence Plots (RP) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). The data was also quantified via entropy measures. Results: RQA exhibited unique plots for persistent versus paroxysmal AF. Similar patterns were observed to be repeated throughout the RPs. Trends were consistent for signal segments of 1 and 2 s as well as 4 s in duration. This was suggestive that the underlying signal generation process is also repetitive, and that repetitiveness can be detected even in 1-s sequences. The results also showed that most entropy metrics exhibited higher measurement values (closer to equilibrium) for persistent AF data. It was also found that Determinism (DET), Trapping Time (TT), and Modified Multiscale Entropy (MMSE), extracted from signals that were acquired from locations at the posterior atrial free wall, are highly discriminative of persistent versus paroxysmal AF data. Conclusions: Short data sequences are sufficient to provide information to discern persistent versus paroxysmal AF data with a significant difference, and can be useful to detect repeating patterns of atrial activation. ? 2019","Ablation; Chemical activation; Diseases; Electrophysiology; Entropy; Multivariable control systems; Atrial electrograms; Atrial fibrillation; Electrogram; Entropy measure; Information concerning; Multi-scale entropies; Recurrence plot; Recurrence quantification analysis; Nonlinear analysis; Article; clinical article; comparative study; complex fractionated atrial electrogram; controlled study; deep learning; diagonal line lengths entropy; electrocardiogram; electrography; entropy; fuzzy entropy; fuzzy system; heart electrophysiology; heart right atrium; human; multiscale entropy; nonlinear system; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; persistent atrial fibrillation; pulmonary vein; radiofrequency catheter ablation; algorithm; atrial fibrillation; catheter ablation; fuzzy logic; heart function test; image processing; nonlinear system; procedures; signal processing; statistical analysis; Algorithms; Atrial Fibrillation; Catheter Ablation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Nonlinear Dynamics; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"
"A Nationwide Study Comparing Knowledge and Beliefs about HPV among Female Students before and after HPV Vaccination",2019,"Study Objective: To assess the knowledge and beliefs regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccine among girls before and after vaccination in the Malaysian HPV Immunisation Programme. Design: A nationwide longitudinal survey. Setting: Thirty-two randomly selected schools from 13 states and 3 federal territories in Malaysia from February to March 2013, and October to November 2013. Participants: Form One female students (13 years old). Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Mean knowledge score of HPV infection. Results: A total of 2644 students responded to the prevaccination survey, of whom 2005 (70%) completed the postvaccination survey. The mean knowledge score was 2.72 (SD ± 2.20) of a maximum score of 10 in the prevaccination survey, which increased significantly to 3.33 (SD ± 1.73) after the 3 doses of HPV vaccine (P = .001). Many answered incorrectly that, “Only girls can get HPV infection” (91.5%, n = 1841 prevaccination vs 96.1%, n = 1927 postvaccination), and only a few were aware that, “Vaccinating boys helps to protect girls against HPV infection” (11.4%, n = 229 for prevaccination vs 10.2%, n = 206 for postvaccination). The mean knowledge score was significantly higher postvaccination among higher-income families and those with parents of a higher occupational status. Regarding beliefs about the HPV vaccine, 89.4% in the prevaccination survey held the view that they would not get a HPV infection, and the percentage remained similar in the postvaccination survey. Perceived severity of HPV infection also remained low in the pre- and postintervention groups. Only 21.5% reported receiving health information about HPV along with the provision of the HPV vaccine; those who received health information showed higher levels of knowledge. Conclusion: Findings revealed a general lack of knowledge and erroneous beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine even after receiving vaccination. This suggests that imparting accurate knowledge about HPV along with vaccine administration is essential. Specifically, girls from lower socioeconomic groups should be a target of educational intervention. ? 2018 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology","Wart virus vaccine; Wart virus vaccine; Article; comparative study; cross-sectional study; employment status; female; health belief; health survey; highest income group; household income; human; knowledge; longitudinal study; major clinical study; Malaysian; medical information; papillomavirus infection; parent; priority journal; religious group; vaccination; adolescent; attitude to health; Malaysia; male; Papillomaviridae; papillomavirus infection; school; statistics and numerical data; student; vaccination; Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Malaysia; Male; Papillomaviridae; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Schools; Students; Vaccination"
"Zinc and Metallothionein in the Development and Progression of Dental Caries",2019,"Chronic oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oral cavity as well as acidic pH on dental enamel surface due to the metabolic activities of bacterial plaque are the major contributors in the development and progression of dental caries. Along with other factors, deposition or dissolution Ca and Mg mostly determines the re- or demineralization of dental enamel. Zn plays an important role for both Ca and Mg bioavailability in oral cavity. Metallothionein (MT), a group of small molecular weight, cysteine-rich proteins (~ 7?kDa), is commonly induced by ROS, bacterial infection, and Zn. In the current review, we evaluated MT at the junction between the progression of dental caries and its etiologies that are common in MT biosynthesis. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","calcium ion; magnesium; metallothionein; reactive oxygen metabolite; zinc; metallothionein; reactive oxygen metabolite; zinc; acidity; bacterial infection; bacterial metabolism; bioavailability; demineralization; dental caries; enamel; human; mouth cavity; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; protein expression; protein synthesis; Review; tooth development; dental caries; disease exacerbation; metabolism; pathology; pH; Dental Caries; Dental Enamel; Disease Progression; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metallothionein; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Zinc"
"Help seeking attitudes and illegal drug use among methadone maintenance therapy patients in Malaysia",2020,"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified substance use disorders as a significant public health concern for many countries. In Malaysia, the government took the step to address this concern in 2005 through the introduction of Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) to treat opioid use disorders. The purpose of this study is to test whether help-seeking attitudes by MMT patients are associated with continued substance use. Method: Participants were 171 patients who received MMT in 2 of the National Anti-Drug Agencies in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Participants were, on average, 45.35 years old (SD = 10.22) and approximately half of them were married. Participants’ Help Seeking Attitudes were measured using the 10-Item Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help–Short Form (ATSPPH-SF) (Fischer and Farina 1995). The dependent measure for this analysis was whether or not the participant had a positive drug screen in the past 6 months of their MMT. Results: Frequencies indicate that 46.2% of the participants had positive drug screen results indicating illicit drug use during the past 6 months of MMT treatment. Logistic regression results indicate that more positive Help Seeking Attitudes are associated with reduced odds of a positive drug screen (O.R. =.87, 95% CI =.80,.93, p <.001). Participant perceptions that help-seeking is positive reduced the odds of having a positive drug screen. Conclusions: This result suggests that research, practice, and policy efforts might include messages that aim to promote help-seeking and to reduce stigma associated with seeking help for substance use disorders. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Cardenolides: Insights from chemical structure and pharmacological utility",2019,"Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are a class of naturally occurring steroid-like compounds, and members of this class have been in clinical use for more than 1500 years. They have been used in folk medicine as arrow poisons, abortifacients, heart tonics, emetics, and diuretics as well as in other applications. The major use of CGs today is based on their ability to inhibit the membrane-bound Na + /K + -ATPase enzyme, and they are regarded as an effective treatment for congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiac arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, increasing evidence has indicated the potential cytotoxic effects of CGs against various types of cancer. In this review, we highlight some of the structural features of this class of natural products that are crucial for their efficacy, some methods of isolating these compounds from natural resources, and the structural elucidation tools that have been used. We also describe their physicochemical properties and several modern biotechnological approaches for preparing CGs that do not require plant sources. ? 2018","cardenolide derivative; antineoplastic agent; cardenolide; cardiovascular agent; diuretic agent; biotechnological production; drug activity; drug efficacy; drug structure; drug synthesis; human; nonhuman; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; animal; chemistry; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardenolides; Cardiovascular Agents; Diuretics; Humans"
"Trends in mortality among ART-treated HIV-infected adults in the Asia-Pacific region between 1999 and 2017: results from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD) and Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) of IeDEA Asia-Pacific",2019,"Introduction: AIDS-related deaths in people living with HIV/AIDS have been decreasing in number since the introduction of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART). However, data on recent causes of death in the Asia-Pacific region are limited. Hence, we analysed and compared AIDS-related and non-AIDS–related mortality in high- and low-income settings in the region. Methods: Patients from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD) and Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) receiving cART between 1999 and 2017 were included. Causes of death verification were based on review of the standardized Cause of Death (CoDe) form designed by the D:A:D group. Cohorts were grouped as AHOD (all high-income sites), TAHOD-high (high/upper-middle income countries) and TAHOD-low (lower-middle income countries). TAHOD sites were split into high/upper-middle income and lower-middle income country settings based on World Bank classifications. Competing risk regression was used to analyse factors associated with AIDS and non-AIDS–related mortality. Results: Of 10,386 patients, 522 died; 187 from AIDS-related and 335 from non-AIDS–related causes. The overall incidence rate of deaths during follow-up was 0.28 per 100 person-years (/100 PYS) for AIDS and 0.51/100 PYS for non-AIDS. Analysis indicated that the incidence rate of non-AIDS mortality decreased from 0.78/100 PYS to 0.37/100 PYS from year groups 2003 to 2007 to 2013 to 2017 (p?<?0.001). Similarly, incidence rates of AIDS-related deaths decreased from 0.51/100 PYS to 0.09/100 PYS from year groups 2003 to 2007 to 2013 to 2017 (p?<?0.001). More recent years of follow-up were associated with reduced hazard for non-AIDS mortality (2008 to 2012: aSHR (adjusted sub-hazard ratio) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, p?=?0.027; 2013 to 2017: aSHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.87, p?=?0.004) compared to years 2003 to 2007. The AHOD cohort had almost twice the hazard of non-AIDS mortality compared to TAHOD-low (lower-middle income sites) (aSHR 1.72, 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.46, p?=?0.003); there were no differences between cohorts for AIDS-related mortality (p?=?0.834). Conclusion: AIDS and non-AIDS–related mortality rates have decreased over the past years in the Asia-Pacific region. There is a greater risk for non-AIDS–associated deaths in the AHOD cohort compared to lower-middle income settings in TAHOD. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Incidence and predictors of multimorbidity among a multiethnic population in Malaysia: a community-based longitudinal study",2019,"Background: Multimorbidity in older adults needs to be assessed as it is a risk factor for disability, cognitive decline, and mortality. Aims: A community-based longitudinal study was performed to determine the incidence and to identify possible predictors of multimorbidity among multiethnic older adults population in Malaysia. Methods: Comprehensive interview-based questionnaires were administered among 729 participants aged 60?years and above. Data were analyzed from the baseline data of older adults participating in the Towards Useful Aging (TUA) study (2014–2016) who were not affected by multimorbidity (349 without any chronic diseases and 380 with one disease). Multimorbidity was considered present in an individual reporting two or more chronic diseases. Results: After 1? years of follow-up, 18.8% of participants who were initially free of any diseases and 40.9% of those with one disease at baseline, developed multimorbidity. The incidence rates were 13.7 per 100 person-years and 34.2 per 100 person-years, respectively. Female gender, smoking, and irregular preparing of food (lifestyle) were predictors for incidence of multimorbidity, especially in those without any disease, while Body Mass Index (BMI) 22–27?kg/m2 and inadequate daily intake of iron were identified as predictors of multimorbidity among participants who already have one disease. Conclusions: The incidence rates of multimorbidity among Malaysian older adults were between the ranges of 14–34 per 100 person-years at a 1?-year follow-up. Gender, smoking, BMI 22–27?kg/m2, inadequate daily intake of iron and lack of engagement in leisure or lifestyle physical activities were possible predictors in the development of multimorbidity. There is a need to formulate effective preventive management strategies to decelerate multimorbidity among older adults. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ascorbic acid; calcium; folic acid; iron; nicotinic acid; phosphorus; pyridoxine; riboflavin; saturated fatty acid; sodium; thiamine; zinc; adult; age; Article; body mass; calcium intake; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; chronic disease; diastolic blood pressure; education; fat intake; female; follow up; food processing; gender; grip strength; human; incidence; interview; iron intake; leisure; lifestyle; longitudinal study; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; mental performance; middle aged; multiple chronic conditions; physical activity; protein intake; questionnaire; smoking; social behavior; sodium intake; systolic blood pressure; vitamin intake; waist circumference; aged; chronic disease; ethnology; exercise; Malaysia; multiple chronic conditions; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Chronic Disease; Exercise; Female; Humans; Incidence; Life Style; Longitudinal Studies; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity"
"Molecular testing for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in Malaysia: Consensus statement from the College of Pathologists, Academy of Medicine Malaysia, the Malaysian Thoracic Society, and the Malaysian Oncological Society",2019,"In the recent years, increased understanding of the molecular profiles of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has allowed for targeted treatment of actionable genetic mutations. The management of NSCLC now requires multiple molecular tests to guide the treatment strategy. In the light of this, there is a need to establish a molecular testing consensus statement for advanced NSCLC patients in Malaysia. This Malaysian consensus statement was developed by a panel of experts, chaired by a pathologist and composed of three other pathologists, four respiratory physicians and three oncologists. It reflects currently available scientific data and adaptations of recommendations from international guidelines to the local landscape. Expert recommendations on different aspects of molecular testing agreed upon by the panel are provided as structured discussions. These recommendations address the appropriate patients and samples to be tested, as well as when and how these tests should be performed. The algorithms for molecular testing in metastatic NSCLC, in the first line setting and upon disease progression beyond first line therapy, were developed. ? 2019 The Authors","atezolizumab; avelumab; B Raf kinase; durvalumab; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; programmed death 1 ligand 1; protein Ret; ALK gene; BRAF gene; cancer growth; cancer immunotherapy; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; consensus; diagnostic accuracy; EGFR gene; genetic screening; HER2 gene; human; liquid biopsy; lung metastasis; Malaysia; medical school; medical society; MET gene; molecular diagnosis; molecular genetics; next generation sequencing; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; NTRK1 gene; oncogene; oncogene K ras; oncologist; oncology; pathologist; practice guideline; primary health care; priority journal; pulmonologist; RET gene; Review; ROS1 gene; treatment outcome"
"Blood pressure and risk of cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition",2019,"Several studies have reported associations of hypertension with cancer, but not all results were conclusive. We examined the association of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure with the development of incident cancer at all anatomical sites in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals) were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by EPIC-participating center and age at recruitment, and adjusted for sex, education, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, diabetes and dietary (in women also reproductive) factors. The study included 307,318 men and women, with an average follow-up of 13.7 (standard deviation 4.4) years and 39,298 incident cancers. We confirmed the expected positive association with renal cell carcinoma: HR = 1.12 (1.08–1.17) per 10 mm Hg higher SBP and HR = 1.23 (1.14–1.32) for DBP. We additionally found positive associations for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): HR = 1.16 (1.07–1.26) (SBP), HR = 1.31 (1.13–1.51) (DBP), weaker for head and neck cancers: HR = 1.08 (1.04–1.12) (SBP), HR = 1.09 (1.01–1.17) (DBP) and, similarly, for skin SCC, colon cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer and uterine adenocarcinoma (AC), but not for esophageal AC, lung SCC, lung AC or uterine endometroid cancer. We observed weak inverse associations of SBP with cervical SCC: HR = 0.91 (0.82–1.00) and lymphomas: HR = 0.97 (0.93–1.00). There were no consistent associations with cancers in other locations. Our results are largely compatible with published studies and support weak associations of blood pressure with cancers in specific locations and morphologies. ? 2019 UICC",""
"Resistance towards metronidazole in Blastocystis sp.: A pathogenic consequence",2019,"Blastocsytis sp. is a protozoan parasite that has been linked to common gastrointestinal illnesses. Metronidazole, the first line therapy, was reported to show frequent inefficacy. Previously, Blastocystis sp. isolated from different population showed varying metronidazole resistance. However, the effect of metronidazole treatment on pathogenic potentials of Blastocystis sp. isolated from different populations, which is known to have different gut environment, is unclear. This study investigates the in vitro effect of metronidazole on the pathogenic potentials of Blastocystis sp. isolated from urban and orang asli individuals. Blastocystis sp. ST 3 isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were treated with a range of metronidazole concentration. The parasites’ growth characteristics, apoptotic rate, specific protease activity and the ability to proliferate cancer cells were analyzed upon treatment with 0.001 mg/l metronidazole. The study demonstrates that Blastocystis sp. isolates showed increase in the parasite numbers especially the amoebic forms (only in urban isolates) after treating with metronidazole at the concentration of 0.001 mg/ml. High number of cells in post-treated isolates coincided with increase of apoptosis. There was a significant increase in cysteine protease of Blastocystis sp. isolates upon treatment despite the initial predominance of serine protease in asymptomatic isolates. Metronidazole resistant Blastocystis sp. also showed significant increase in cancer cell proliferation. Resistance to metronidazole did not show significant different influence on the pathogenicity between Blastocystis sp. isolated from urban and orang asli individual. However, an increase in parasite numbers, higher amoebic forms, cysteine protease and ability to proliferate cancer cells implicates a pathogenic role. The study provides evidence for the first time, the effect of metronidazole towards enhancing pathogenic potentials in Blastocystis sp. when isolated from different gut environment. This necessitates the need for reassessment of metronidazole treatment modalities. ? 2019 Rajamanikam et al.

"SMOOTH: Self-Management of Open Online Trials in Health analysis found improvements were needed for reporting methods of internet-based trials",2019,"Background and Objectives: The growth of trials conducted over the internet has increased, but with little practical guidance for their conduct, and it is sometimes challenging for researchers to adapt the conventions used in face-to-face trials and maintain the validity of the work. The aim of the study is to systematically explore existing self-recruited online randomized trials of self-management interventions and analyze the trials to assess their strengths and weaknesses, the quality of reporting, and the involvement of lay persons as collaborators in the research process. Study Design and Settings: The Online Randomized Controlled Trials of Health Information Database was used as the sampling frame to identify a subset of self-recruited online trials of self-management interventions. The authors cataloged what these online trials were assessing, appraised study quality, extracted information on how trials were run, and assessed the potential for bias. We searched out how public and patient participation was integrated into online trial design and how this was reported. We recorded patterns of use for registration, reporting, settings, informed consent, public involvement, supplementary materials, and dissemination planning. Results: The sample included 41 online trials published from 2002 to 2015. The barriers to replicability and risk of bias in online trials included inadequate reporting of blinding in 28/41 (68%) studies; high attrition rates with incomplete or unreported data in 30/41 (73%) of trials; and 26/41 (63%) of studies were at high risk for selection bias as trial registrations were unreported. The methods for (23/41, 56%) trials contained insufficient information to replicate the trial, 19/41 did not report piloting the intervention. Only 2/41 studies were cross-platform compatible. Public involvement was most common for advisory roles (n = 9, 22%), and in the design, usability testing, and piloting of user materials (n = 9, 22%). Conclusion: This study catalogs the state of online trials of self-management in the early 21st century and provides insights for online trials development as early as the protocol planning stage. Reporting of trials was generally poor and, in addition to recommending that authors report their trials in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, we make recommendations for researchers writing protocols, reporting on and evaluating online trials. The research highlights considerable room for improvement in trial registration, reporting of methods, data management plans, and public and patient involvement in self-recruited online trials of self-management interventions. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; informed consent; Internet; layperson; male; medical information; patient participation; practice guideline; publication; randomized controlled trial; registration; review; scientist; selection bias; self care; writing; methodology; online system; practice guideline; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); self report; total quality management; Humans; Online Systems; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality Improvement; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Self Report; Self-Management"
"Consequences of Elder Abuse and Neglect: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies",2019,"This article presents the results of a systematic review of the consequences of elder abuse and neglect (EAN). A systematic search was conducted in seven electronic databases and three sources of gray literature up to January 8, 2016, supplemented by scanning of citation lists in relevant articles and contact with field experts. All observational studies investigating elder abuse as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, mortality, and health-care utilization were included. Of 517 articles initially captured, 19 articles met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Two reviewers independently performed abstract screening, full-texts appraisal, and quality assessment using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Across 19 studies, methodological heterogeneity was a prominent feature; seven definitions of EAN and nine measurement tools for abuse were employed. Summary of results reveals a wide range of EAN outcomes, from premature mortality to increased health-care consumption and various forms of physical and psychological symptoms. Higher risks of mortality emerged as the most credible outcome, while the majority of morbidity outcomes originated from cross-sectional studies. Our findings suggest that there is an underrepresentation of older adults from non-Western populations and developing countries, and there is a need for more population-based prospective studies in middle- and low-income regions. Evidence gathered from this review is crucial in upgrading current practices, formulating policies, and shaping the future direction of research. ?

"Effectiveness and prescription pattern of lipid-lowering therapy and its associated factors among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in malaysian primary care settings",2019,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main complication leading to morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is a large amount of evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) for the prevention of CVD. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and prescription quality of LLT among T2DM patients and to identify its associated factors. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional study included 816 T2DM patients from four different primary care centers in Pahang, Malaysia. We involved LLT-eligible T2DM patients as per the national clinical practice guidelines (CPG). The assessment of therapy effectiveness focused on the attainment of target lipid measures stated in the CPG. Evaluation of the prescription quality was classified into appropriate, potentially inappropriate, and inappropriate, based on the compliance with guidelines and existence of potential safety concerns. Binomial logistic regression was employed to identify the predictors of LLT effectiveness and prescription quality. Results: The overall percentage of T2DM patients receiving statin therapy was 87.6% (715/816). Statin therapy was appropriately prescribed in 71.5% of the cases. About 17.5% of the LLT prescriptions have at least one significant drug interaction with co-prescribed medications. The achievement of the primary target of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels was observed in only 37% of T2DM patients. The LLT indication and appropriateness of prescription were significantly associated with the attainment of LDL-C treatment goals. Primary prevention, Malay race, and hypertension were identified as predictors for appropriate prescribing of LLT among T2DM subjects. Conclusion: There is a need to enhance the quality of LLT prescribing in the primary care setting to cover all eligible high-risk patients and ensure patient safety. Strategies to improve the achievement of LDL-C goals among patients with T2DM, such as investigating the potential role of the combination therapy and high-intensity statin therapy, are required. ? 2019 Elnaem et al.","antilipemic agent; atorvastatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; simvastatin; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cross-sectional study; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; human; hypertension; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; Malay (people); Malaysia; male; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; practice guideline; prescription; primary prevention"
"Genetic determinants of telomere length and risk of pancreatic cancer: A PANDoRA study",2019,"Telomere deregulation is a hallmark of cancer. Telomere length measured in lymphocytes (LTL) has been shown to be a risk marker for several cancers. For pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) consensus is lacking whether risk is associated with long or short telomeres. Mendelian randomization approaches have shown that a score built from SNPs associated with LTL could be used as a robust risk marker. We explored this approach in a large scale study within the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium. We analyzed 10 SNPs (ZNF676-rs409627, TERT-rs2736100, CTC1-rs3027234, DHX35-rs6028466, PXK-rs6772228, NAF1-rs7675998, ZNF208-rs8105767, OBFC1-rs9420907, ACYP2-rs11125529 and TERC-rs10936599) alone and combined in a LTL genetic score (“teloscore”, which explains 2.2% of the telomere variability) in relation to PDAC risk in 2,374 cases and 4,326 controls. We identified several associations with PDAC risk, among which the strongest were with the TERT-rs2736100 SNP (OR = 1.54; 95%CI 1.35–1.76; p = 1.54 × 10 ?10 ) and a novel one with the NAF1-rs7675998 SNP (OR = 0.80; 95%CI 0.73–0.88; p = 1.87 × 10 ?6 , p trend = 3.27 × 10 ?7 ). The association of short LTL, measured by the teloscore, with PDAC risk reached genome-wide significance (p = 2.98 × 10 ?9 for highest vs. lowest quintile; p = 1.82 × 10 ?10 as a continuous variable). In conclusion, we present a novel genome-wide candidate SNP for PDAC risk (TERT-rs2736100), a completely new signal (NAF1-rs7675998) approaching genome-wide significance and we report a strong association between the teloscore and risk of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that telomeres are a potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer. ? 2018 UICC","adenine; cytosine; guanine; telomerase reverse transcriptase; thymine; NAF1 protein, human; ribonucleoprotein; telomerase; TERT protein, human; ACYP2 gene; adult; aged; Article; cancer genetics; cancer risk; controlled study; CTC1 gene; DHX35 gene; female; gene; genetic association; human; lymphocyte; major clinical study; male; NAF1 gene; OBFC1 gene; pancreas cancer; priority journal; PXK gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; telomere length; TERC gene; TERT gene; ZNF208 gene; ZNF676 gene; case control study; Europe; genetics; genome-wide association study; metabolism; middle aged; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; single nucleotide polymorphism; telomere; telomere shortening; Aged; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Case-Control Studies; Europe; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Ribonucleoproteins; Telomerase; Telomere; Telomere Shortening"
"Antiproliferative and apoptotic activities of 8-prenylnaringenin against human colon cancer cells",2019,"Aims: The compound 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN) is a prenylflavonoid that can be isolated from hops and beer and has anti-cancer properties against breast cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities of 8-PN against human colon cancer HCT-116 cells. Main methods: Colon cancer HCT-116 cells were treated with 8-PN and subjected to MTT and acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) staining to investigate the cytotoxicity of 8-PN. Arrest of the cells at different phases of cell cycle was monitored in the presence of 8-PN. Moreover, the apoptotic effects of 8-PN was assessed via annexin V and caspase activity assays and compared to the untreated cells. Key findings: The findings showed that 8-PN revealed strong inhibitory effect against HCT-116 cells with an IC50 value of 23.83 ± 2.9 μg/ml after 48 h. However, at similar concentrations and experimental time-points, the compound did not show cytotoxic effect to non-cancerous colon cells (CCD-41). Annexin-V assay indicates that 38.5% and 14.4% of HCT-116 cells had entered early and late stages of apoptosis, respectively after exposure of the cells to 8-PN for 48 h. Caspase activity assay illustrates that apoptosis is activated through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Moreover, flow cytometry cell cycle results indicate that treatment with 8-PN significantly arrested the HCT-116 cells at G0/G1 phase. Significance: These findings reveal that 8-PN has anti-proliferative activity against HCT-116 colon cancer cells via induction of intrinsic and extrinsic pathway-mediated apoptosis. Further investigations should be carried out to unravel the mechanistic pathways underlying these activities. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","8 prenylnaringenin; acridine orange; caspase; fluorouracil; lipocortin 5; propidium iodide; 8-prenylnaringenin; antineoplastic agent; flavanone derivative; adult; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; caspase assay; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle checkpoint; cell viability; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; male; MTT assay; proapoptotic activity; propidium iodide assay; signal transduction; cell cycle; cell proliferation; colon tumor; drug effect; HCT 116 cell line; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; pathology; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Colonic Neoplasms; Flavanones; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mitochondria"
"Provider costs of treating colorectal cancer in government hospital of Malaysia",2019,"Background: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly rising in several Asian countries, including Malaysia, but there is little data on health care provider costs in this region. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost of CRC management from the perspective of the health care provider, based on standard operating procedures. Methods: A combination of top-down approach and activity-based costing was applied. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for CRC was developed for each stage according to national data and guidelines at the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). The unit cost was calculated and incorporated into the treatment pathway in order to obtain the total cost of managing a single CRC patient according to the stage of illness. The cost data were represented by means and standard deviation and the results were demonstrated by tabulation. All cost data are presented in Malaysian Ringgit (RM). The cost difference between early stage (Stage I) and late stage (Stage II-IV) was analysed using independent t-test. Results: The cost per patient increased with stage of CRC, from RM13,672 (USD4,410.30) for stage I, to RM27,972 (USD9,023.20) for Stage IV. The early stage had statistically significant lower cost compared to late stage t(2) = -4.729, P = 0.042. The highest fraction of the cost was related to surgery for Stage I, but was superseded by oncology day care treatment for Stages II-IV. CRC is a costly illness. From a provider perspective, the highest cost was found in Stages III and IV. The early stages conserved more resources than did the advanced stages of cancer. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and management of CRC, therefore, not only affects oncologic prognosis, but has implications for health care costs. This adds further justification to develop and implement CRC screening programmes in Malaysia. ?

"Conolodinines A-D, Aspidosperma- Aspidosperma Bisindole Alkaloids with Antiproliferative Activity from Tabernaemontana corymbosa",2019,"Examination of the EtOH extract of the leaves of the Malayan Tabernaemontana corymbosa resulted in the isolation of four new (1-4) and two known bisindole alkaloids (5, 6) of the Aspidosperma-Aspidosperma type. The structures of these alkaloids were determined based on analysis of the spectroscopic data (NMR and HRESIMS). X-ray diffraction analyses of the related bisindole alkaloids conophylline (5) and conophyllinine (6) established the absolute configurations. Treatment of the bisindole alkaloid conophylline (5) with benzeneselenic anhydride gave, in addition to the known bisindole polyervinine (7) previously isolated from another Malayan Tabernaemontana, another bisindole product, 8, an isolable tautomer of 7. X-ray diffraction analyses yielded the absolute configurations of both bisindoles and in addition showed that polyervinine (7) exists primarily as the neutral dione structure. The bisindoles (1-8) and the related conophylline-type bisindoles (9-13) showed pronounced in vitro growth inhibitory activity against an array of human cancer cell lines, including KB, vincristine-resistant KB, PC-3, LNCaP, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, A549, HT-29, and HCT 116 cells, with IC50 values for the active compounds in the 0.01-5 μM range. ? 2019 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.","alkaloid; antineoplastic agent; bisindole; cisplatin; conofolidine; conofoline; conofoline quinone; conolodinine a; conolodinine b; conolodinine c; conolodinine d; conophyllidine; conophyllidine quinone; conophylline; conophyllinine; polyervinine; unclassified drug; verapamil; vincristine; A-549 cell line; antiproliferative activity; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; controlled study; crystal structure; drug isolation; drug oxidation; drug structure; female; fetus; HCT 116 cell line; heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; LNCaP cell line; male; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; nuclear Overhauser effect; plant leaf; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; structure analysis; Tabernaemontana; tabernaemontana corymbosa; tautomer; vincristine-resistant cell line; X ray diffraction"
"Determinants of household catastrophic health expenditure: A systematic review",2019,"The World Health Organization estimates that annually 150 million people experience severe (catastrophic) financial difficulties as a result of healthcare payments. Therefore, a systematic review was carried out to identify the determinants of household catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) in low- to high-income countries around the world. Both electronic and manual searches were conducted. The main outcome of interest was the determinants of CHE due to healthcare payments. Thirty eight studies met the inclusion criteria for review. The analysis revealed that household economic status, incidence of hospitalisation, presence of an elderly or disabled household member in the family, and presence of a family member with a chronic illness were the common significant factors associated with household CHE. The crucial finding of the current study is that socioeconomic inequality plays an important role in the incidence of CHE all over the world, where low-income households are at high risk of financial hardship from healthcare payments. This suggests that healthcare financing policies should be revised in order to narrow the gap in socioeconomic inequality and social safety nets should be implemented and strengthened for people who have a high need for health care. ?

"Diagnosis of severe dengue: Challenges, needs and opportunities",2020,"Background: Delayed diagnosis of dengue cases with increased risk for severe disease could lead to poor disease outcome. To date there is no specific laboratory diagnostic test for severe dengue. This qualitative study explored expert views regarding current issues in diagnosing severe dengue, rationale for severe dengue-specific diagnostics, future prospects and features of potential diagnostics for severe dengue. Methods: In-depth individual interviews with thematic saturation were conducted between May and July 2018. The data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Based on expert opinion, diagnosis of severe dengue is challenging as it depends on astute clinical interpretation of non-dengue-specific clinical and laboratory findings. A specific test that detects impending manifestation of severe dengue could 1) overcome failure in identifying severe disease for referral or admission, 2) facilitate timely and appropriate management of plasma leakage and bleeding, 3) overcome the lack of clinical expertise and laboratory diagnosis in rural health settings. The most important feature of any diagnostics for severe dengue is the point-of-care (POC) format where it can be performed at or near the bedside. Conclusion: The development of diagnostics to detect impending severe dengue is warranted to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of dengue infection and it should be prioritized. ? 2020 The Authors","immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; nonstructural protein 1; Article; bleeding; diagnostic test; human; interview; laboratory diagnosis; nonhuman; pilot study; priority journal; qualitative research; rural health; severe dengue; thematic analysis"
"Two truncating variants in FANCC and breast cancer risk",2019,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with 22 disease-causing genes reported to date. In some FA genes, monoallelic mutations have been found to be associated with breast cancer risk, while the risk associations of others remain unknown. The gene for FA type C, FANCC, has been proposed as a breast cancer susceptibility gene based on epidemiological and sequencing studies. We used the Oncoarray project to genotype two truncating FANCC variants (p.R185X and p.R548X) in 64,760 breast cancer cases and 49,793 controls of European descent. FANCC mutations were observed in 25 cases (14 with p.R185X, 11 with p.R548X) and 26 controls (18 with p.R185X, 8 with p.R548X). There was no evidence of an association with the risk of breast cancer, neither overall (odds ratio 0.77, 95%CI 0.44–1.33, p = 0.4) nor by histology, hormone receptor status, age or family history. We conclude that the breast cancer risk association of these two FANCC variants, if any, is much smaller than for BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations. If this applies to all truncating variants in FANCC it would suggest there are differences between FA genes in their roles on breast cancer risk and demonstrates the merit of large consortia for clarifying risk associations of rare variants. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"A Framework for Non-contact ECG Signal Detection Device on Smart Chair and Its Implementation",2019,"Heart disease is the top cause of death in Malaysia. Arrhythmia is a sign of heart diseases that entails abnormal heart rhythm and is detected mostly by electrocardiogram (ECG) devices, which are attached to the chest, arms or legs of an individual. This mostly requires contact with the skin, which has to be routinely examined. Unfortunately, in unexpected, extreme situations of rising symptoms related to heart problems, the time it takes to examine a situation with the ECG signal device might make the difference between life and death. Non-contact ECG signal detection techniques could help assess cases of heart problems or an initial apoplectic condition without attaching ECG signal devices to people’s body. This paper aims to provide a non-contact ECG signal detection framework that could empower Malaysian community to get an access to understanding arrhythmic phase status at any time of their activities. The framework relies on one of the major activities that humans often engage in, which is sitting. As a result, a non-contact ECG signal device is conceptualized for chairs that most people can use at home, in the office chair and many other sitting situations. ?

"Quantitative and qualitative comparison of low- and high-cost 3D-printed heart models",2019,"Current visualization techniques of complex congenital heart disease (CHD) are unable to provide comprehensive visualization of the anomalous cardiac anatomy as the medical datasets can essentially only be viewed from a flat, two-dimensional (2D) screen. Three-dimensional (3D) printing has therefore been used to replicate patient-specific hearts in 3D views based on medical imaging datasets. This technique has been shown to have a positive impact on the preoperative planning of corrective surgery, patient-doctor communication, and the learning experience of medical students. However, 3D printing is often costly, and this impedes the routine application of this technology in clinical practice. This technical note aims to investigate whether reducing 3D printing costs can have any impact on the clinical value of the 3D-printed heart models. Low-cost and a high-cost 3D-printed models based on a selected case of CHD were generated with materials of differing cost.

"First report of extended-spectrum β-lactamases TEM-116 and OXA-10 in clinical isolates of alcaligenes species from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",2019,"There is an alarming increase in the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) present mainly in Enterobacteriaceae and other nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, such as Alcaligenes faecalis, which is the only species in that genus that is clinically relevant. We investigated Alcaligenes species from 7 cases (6 inpatients and one outpatient) at our tertiary-care hospital. Four patients had urinary tract infections, and one each had systemic lupus erythematosus, pulmonary stenosis, and diabetic ulcer. All 7 isolates were identified as Alcaligenes spp. based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences, and antibiotic susceptibility was determined using a Vitek 2 system with AST-GN87 cards. All the strains were resistant to cefazolin; 6 were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; 5 manifested resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefepime, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin; whereas 5 had multidrug resistance profiles. All the strains (7/7) expressed ESBL activity; PCR screening and sequencing showed evidence of genes blaTEM-116 (7/7) and blaOXA-10 (4/7), and we believe that this is the first report on the presence of TEM-116 and OXA-10 in an Alcaligenes spp. A combination of the 2 genes was present in 4 strains. All 7 strains were found to harbor at least one ESBL gene probably contributing to the drug resistance. ? 2019, National Institute of Health.

"Important Metabolites in Maintaining Folate Cycle, Homocysteine, and Polyamine Metabolism Associated with Ranibizumab Treatment in Cultured Human Tenon's Fibroblasts",2019,"The anti-fibrotic properties of ranibizumab have been well documented. As an antagonist to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), ranibizumab works by binding and neutralizing all active VEGF-A, thus limiting progressive cell growth and proliferation. Ranibizumab application in ocular diseases has shown remarkable desired effects; however, to date, its antifibrotic mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified metabolic changes in ranibizumab-treated human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs). Cultured HTFs were treated for 48 h with 0.5 mg/mL of ranibizumab and 0.5 mg/mL control IgG antibody which serves as a negative control. Samples from each group were injected into Agilent 6520 Q-TOF liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer (LC/MS) system to establish the metabolite expression in both ranibizumab treated cells and control group. Data obtained was analyzed using Agilent Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software to identify the most regulated metabolite following ranibizumab treatment. At p-value < 0.01 with the cut off value of two-fold change, 31 identified metabolites were found to be significantly upregulated in ranibizumab-treated group, with six of the mostly upregulated having insignificant role in fibroblast cell cycle and wound healing regulations. Meanwhile, 121 identified metabolites that were downregulated, and seven of the mostly downregulated are significantly involved in cell cycle and proliferation. Our findings suggest that ranibizumab abrogates the tissue scarring and wound healing process by regulating the expression of metabolites associated with fibrotic activity. In particular, we found that vitamin Bs are important in maintaining normal folate cycle, nucleotide synthesis, and homocysteine and spermidine metabolism. This study provides an insight into ranibizumab's mechanism of action in HTFs from the perspective of metabolomics.","folic acid; homocysteine; polyamine; ranibizumab; adolescent; adult; aged; cell culture; cytology; drug effect; female; fibroblast; human; male; metabolism; metabolomics; middle aged; tendon; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cells, Cultured; Female; Fibroblasts; Folic Acid; Homocysteine; Humans; Male; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Polyamines; Ranibizumab; Tendons; Young Adult"
"What will make patients use a patient decision aid? A qualitative study on patients' perspectives on implementation barriers and facilitators",2019,"Rationale, aims, and objectives: Few studies focus on patients' views on factors influencing implementation of patient decision aids (PDAs). This study aims to explore patients' views on the factors influencing implementation of an “insulin choice” PDA in a primary care setting. Methods: This study used a descriptive qualitative study design. Interviews were conducted using a semistructured interview guide developed based on the theoretical domains framework. Nine in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted with patients with type 2 diabetes who have been advised to start insulin or were currently using insulin and those who had been seeking diabetes treatment in the clinic for more than 1?year. Interviews were conducted after the participants were familiarized with the PDA. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Results: Five themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) trust in the physician (patients preferred physicians to other health care providers in delivering the insulin PDA to them as they trusted physicians more when it comes to making decisions such as starting insulin), (b) physician's attitude (patients were more likely to trust a physician who is friendly and sympathetic hence would be more willing to use the insulin PDA), (c) physician's communication style (patients were more willing to use the insulin PDA if the physicians would take time and guide them in the PDA use), (d) conducive environment (patients preferred to read the PDA at home), and (e) cost (patients would not be willing to pay to use the insulin PDA unless they needed it). Conclusions: Patients want physicians to play a major role in the implementation of the insulin PDA; physicians' communication style and commitment may influence implementation outcomes. Health care authorities need to create a conducive environment and provide patients with free access to PDA to promote effective implementation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",""
"Prevalence and determinants of pathological internet use among undergraduate students in a public university in Malaysia",2019,"Pathological Internet Use (PIU) affects one's physical and mental health, and university students are at risk as they are more likely to develop PIU. This study determines the prevalence of PIU and its associated factors among students in a public university in Malaysia. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1023 undergraduate students in 2015. The questionnaire comprised of items from the Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire to assess PIU and items related to socio-demography, psychosocial, lifestyle and co-morbidities. Anonymous paper-based data collection method was adopted. Mean age of the respondents was 20.73 ± 1.49 years old. The prevalence of pathological Internet user was 28.9% mostly Chinese (31%), 22 years old and above (31.0%), in Year 1 (31.5%), and those who perceived themselves to be from family from higher socio-economic status (32.5%). The factors found statistically significant (p < 0.05) with PIU were Internet use for three or more hours for recreational purpose (OR: 3.89; 95% CI:1.33 - 11.36), past week of Internet use for pornography purpose (OR: 2.52; 95% CI:1.07 - 5.93), having gambling problem (OR: 3.65; 95% CI:1.64 - 8.12), involvement in drug use in the past 12 months (OR: 6.81; 95% CI:1.42 - 32.77) and having moderate/severe depression (OR: 4.32; 95% CI:1.83 - 10.22). University authorities need to be aware of the prevalence so that interventions can be developed to prevent adverse outcomes. Interventions should focus on screening students for PIU, creating awareness on the negative effects of PIU and promoting healthy and active lifestyle and restricting students' access to harmful websites. ?

"Analysis of obesity among malaysian university students: A combination study with the application of Bayesian structural equation modelling and pearson correlation",2019,"In obesity modelling studies, researchers have been seeking to identify the effective indicators of obesity by using appropriate statistical or mathematical techniques. The main objective of the present study is addressed in three stages. First, a new framework for modelling obesity in university students is introduced. The second stage involves data analysis based on Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (BSEM) for estimating the Body Mass Index (BMI) (representative of the obesity level) of students at three university levels: Bachelor, Master and PhD. In the third stage, the highest significant correlation is determined between the BMI and other variables in the research model that were found significant through the second phase. The data for this study were collected from students at selected Malaysian universities. The results indicate that unhealthy food intake (fast food and soft drinks), social media use and stress exhibit the highest weightage contributing to overweight and obesity issues for Malaysian university students. ? 2019 by the authors.

"A newly developed porcine training model for transurethral piecemeal and en bloc resection of bladder tumour",2019,"Purpose: The Asian Urological Surgery Training & Education Group (AUSTEG) has been established to provide training and education to young urologists in Asia. We developed and validated a porcine bladder training model for transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Methods: Urology residents and specialists were invited to test the training model. They were asked to complete a pre-task questionnaire, to perform piecemeal and en bloc resection of ‘bladder tumours’ within the training model, and to complete a post-task questionnaire afterwards. Their performances were assessed by faculty members of the AUSTEG. For the face validity, a pre-task questionnaire consisting of six statements on TURBT and the training model were set. For the content validity, a post-task questionnaire consisting of 14 items on the details of the training model were set. For the construct validity, a Global Rating Scale was used to assess the participants’ performances. The participants were stratified into two groups (junior surgeons and senior surgeons groups) according to their duration of urology training. Results: For the pre-task questionnaire, a mean score of ? 4.0 out of 5.0 was achieved in 5 out of 6 statements. For the post-task questionnaire, a mean score of ? 4.5 out of 5.0 was achieved in every item. For the Global Rating Scale, the senior surgeons group had higher scores than the junior surgeons group in 8 out of 11 items as well as the total score. Conclusion: A porcine TURBT training model has been developed, and its face, content and construct validity has been established. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","animal; bladder tumor; cystectomy; disease model; education; educational model; medical education; pig; procedures; urethra; urology; Animals; Cystectomy; Disease Models, Animal; Internship and Residency; Models, Educational; Swine; Urethra; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Urology"
"Number of blood pressure measurements needed to estimate long-term visit-to-visit systolic blood pressure variability for predicting cardiovascular risk: A 10-year retrospective cohort study in a primary care clinic in Malaysia",2019,"Objective To determine the reproducibility of visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BPV) in clinical practice. We also determined the minimum number of blood pressure (BP) measurements needed to estimate long-term visit-to-visit BPV for predicting 10-year cardiovascular (CV) risk. Design Retrospective study Setting A primary care clinic in a university hospital in Malaysia. Participants Random sampling of 1403 patients aged 30 years and above without any CV event at baseline. Outcomes measures The effect of the number of BP measurement for calculation of long-term visit-to-visit BPV in predicting 10-year CV risk. CV events were defined as fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease, fatal and non-fatal stroke, heart failure and peripheral vascular disease. Results The mean 10-year SD of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for this cohort was 13.8±3.5 mm Hg. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the SD of SBP based on the first eight and second eight measurements was 0.38 (p<0.001). In a primary care setting, visit-to-visit BPV (SD of SBP calculated from 20 BP measurements) was significantly associated with CV events (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.13, p=0.009). Using SD of SBP from 20 measurement as reference, SD of SBP from 6 measurements (median time 1.75 years) has high reliability (ICC 0.74, p<0.001), with a mean difference of 0.6 mm Hg. Hence, a minimum of six BP measurements is needed for reliably estimating intraindividual BPV for CV outcome prediction. Conclusion Long-term visit-to-visit BPV is reproducible in clinical practice. We suggest a minimum of six BP measurements for calculation of intraindividual visit-to-visit BPV. The number and duration of BP readings to derive BPV should be taken into consideration in predicting long-term CV risk. ? 2019 Author(s).

"Creativity in Measuring Trust in Human-Robot Interaction Using Interactive Dialogs",2019,"The measurement of human trust in humanoid robots in human-robot interaction requires novel approaches that can predict trust effectively. We present a method that mapped subjective measures (i.e. general trust, psychological) to objective measures (i.e. physiological) to predict trust. We designed interactive dialogs that represent real world service scenarios of Business, Disaster, and Healthcare. The dialogs embedded fifteen trust attributes of Ability, Benevolence and Integrity (ABI) in the communication dialogs. The ABI measures were mapped to physiological measures of facial expressions, voiced speech and camera-based heart rate. Forty-eight subjects comprising 24 males and 24 females aged between 18 to 36 years participated in the experiment. Half of the subjects were Malays and half were Chinese. Three humanoid robots represented full bodied, partial bodied and virtual agents. The experimental design was a within-subjects design. Each subject was tested on all robots in all scenarios. Subjects scored trust on an online scale that ranged from 0 to 7 points. The subjective data was analyzed using Univariate and Oneway MANOVA. The results found the humanoids to be trustworthy in different service tasks. The attributes of ‘Integrity’ and ‘Ability’ trust components are important in Business and Disaster scenarios. The estimation of trust was about 83% accurate when using this creative approach. In conclusion, humanoid robots can interact with humans using dialogs that are representative of real world communication. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anthropomorphic robots; Disasters; Ergonomics; Human computer interaction; Machine design; Man machine systems; Physiology; Dialog design; Different services; Disaster scenario; Facial Expressions; Interactive dialogs; Objective measure; Physiological measures; Trust; Human robot interaction"
"Association between Soft Drink Consumption and Mortality in 10 European Countries",2019,"Importance: Soft drinks are frequently consumed, but whether this consumption is associated with mortality risk is unknown and has been understudied in European populations to date. Objective: To examine the association between total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drink consumption and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study involved participants (n = 451743 of the full cohort) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an ongoing, large multinational cohort of people from 10 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), with participants recruited between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2000. Excluded participants were those who reported cancer, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes at baseline; those with implausible dietary intake data; and those with missing soft drink consumption or follow-up information. Data analyses were performed from February 1, 2018, to October 1, 2018. Exposure: Consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Total mortality and cause-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for other mortality risk factors. Results: In total, 521 330 individuals were enrolled. Of this total, 451743 (86.7%) were included in the study, with a mean (SD) age of 50.8 (9.8) years and with 321081 women (71.1%). During a mean (range) follow-up of 16.4 (11.1 in Greece to 19.2 in France) years, 41693 deaths occurred. Higher all-cause mortality was found among participants who consumed 2 or more glasses per day (vs consumers of <1 glass per month) of total soft drinks (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.22; P <.001), sugar-sweetened soft drinks (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P =.004), and artificially sweetened soft drinks (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.35; P <.001). Positive associations were also observed between artificially sweetened soft drinks and deaths from circulatory diseases (?2 glasses per day vs <1 glass per month; HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.30-1.78; P <.001) and between sugar-sweetened soft drinks and deaths from digestive diseases (?1 glass per day vs <1 glass per month; HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.05; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks was positively associated with all-cause deaths in this large European cohort; the results are supportive of public health campaigns aimed at limiting the consumption of soft drinks. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Antibody responses to Fusobacterium nucleatum Proteins in prediagnostic blood samples are not associated with risk of developing colorectal cancer",2019,"Background: There is a lack of prospective data on the potential association of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and colorectal cancer risk. In this study, we assessed whether antibody responses to F. nucleatum are associated with colorectal cancer risk in prediagnostic serum samples in the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC) cohort. Methods: We applied a multiplex serology assay to simultaneously measure antibody responses to 11 F. nucleatum antigens in prediagnostic serum samples from 485 colorectal cancer cases and 485 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: We observed neither a statistically significant colorectal cancer risk association for antibodies to individual F. nucleatum proteins nor for combined positivity to any of the 11 proteins (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06). Conclusions: Antibody responses to F. nucleatum proteins in prediagnostic serum samples from a subset of colorectal cancer cases and matched controls within the EPIC study were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. Impact: Our findings in prospectively ascertained serum samples contradict the existing literature on the association of F. nucleatum with colorectal cancer risk.

"Cost of preterm birth during initial hospitalization: A care provider’s perspective",2019,"Preterm birth incidence has risen globally and remains a major cause of neonatal mortality despite improved survival. Demand and cost of initial hospitalization has also increased. This study assessed the cost of preterm birth during initial hospitalization from care provider perspective in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) of two hospitals in the state of Kedah, Malaysia. It utilized universal sampling and prospectively followed up preterm infants till discharge. Care provider cost was assessed using mixed method of top down approach and activity based costing. A total of 112 preterm infants were recruited from intensive care (93 infants) and minimal care (19 infants) units. Majority were from the moderate (23%) and late (36%) preterm groups followed by very preterm (32%) and extreme preterm (9%). Median cost per infant increased with level of care and degree of prematurity. Cost was dominated by overhead (fixed) costs for general (hospital), intermediate (clinical support services) and final (NICU) cost centers where it constituted at least three quarters of admission cost per infant while the remainder was consumables (variable) cost. Breakdown of overhead cost showed NICU specific overhead contributing at least two thirds of admission cost per infant. Personnel salary made up three quarters of NICU specific overhead. Laboratory investigation was the cost driver for consumables. Gender, birth weight and length of stay were significant factors and cost prediction was developed with these variables. This study demonstrated the inverse relation between resource utilization, cost and prematurity and identified personnel salary as the cost driver. Cost estimates and prediction provide in-depth understanding of provider cost and are applicable for further economic evaluations. Since gender is non-modifiable and reducing LOS alone is not effective, birth weight as a cost predictive factor in this study can be addressed through measures to prevent or delay preterm birth. ? 2019 Zainal et al.

"Performance of a Novel Low-Cost, Instrument-Free Plasma Separation Device for HIV Viral Load Quantification and Determination of Treatment Failure in People Living with HIV in Malaysia: a Diagnostic Accuracy Study",2019,"HIV viral load (VL) testing is the recommended method for monitoring the response of people living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The availability of standard plasma VL testing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and access to this testing, are limited by the need to use fresh plasma. Good specimen collection methods for HIV VL testing that are applicable to resource-constrained settings are needed. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the filtered dried plasma spot (FDPS), created using the newly developed, instrument-free VLPlasma device, in identifying treatment failure at a VL threshold of 1,000 copies/ml in fresh plasma. Performance was compared with that of the conventional dried blood spot (DBS). Venous blood samples from 201 people living with HIV and attending an infectious disease clinic in Malaysia were collected, and HIV VL was quantified using fresh plasma (the reference standard), FDPS, and DBS specimens. VL testing was done using the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan v2.0 assay. At a threshold of 1,000 copies/ml, the diagnostic performance of the FDPS was superior (sensitivity, 100% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 89.1 to 100%]; specificity, 100% [95% CI, 97.8 to 100%]) to that of the DBS (sensitivity, 100% [95% CI, 89.4 to 100%]; specificity, 36.8% [95% CI, 29.4 to 44.7%]) (P?<?0.001). A stronger correlation was observed between the FDPS VL and the plasma VL (r?=?0.94; P?<?0.001) than between the DBS VL and the plasma VL (r?=?0.85; P?<?0.001). The mean difference in VL measures between the FDPS and plasma (plasma VL minus FDPS VL) was 0.127 log10 copies/ml (standard deviation [SD], 0.32), in contrast to -0.95 log10 copies/ml (SD, 0.84) between the DBS and plasma. HIV VL measurement using the FDPS outperformed that with the DBS in identifying treatment failure at a threshold of 1,000 copies/ml and compared well with the quantification of VL in plasma. The FDPS can be an attractive alternative to fresh plasma for improving access to HIV VL monitoring among people living with HIV on ART in LMICs. Copyright ? 2019 Pham et al.",""
"Circulating metabolic biomarkers of screen-detected prostate cancer in the ProtecT study",2019,"Background: Whether associations between circulating metabolites and prostate cancer are causal is unknown. We report on the largest study of metabolites and prostate cancer (2,291 cases and 2,661 controls) and appraise causality for a subset of the prostate cancer–metabolite associations using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: The case–control portion of the study was conducted in nine UK centers with men ages 50–69 years who underwent prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial. Two data sources were used to appraise causality: a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of metabolites in 24,925 participants and a GWAS of prostate cancer in 44,825 cases and 27,904 controls within the Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium. Results: Thirty-five metabolites were strongly associated with prostate cancer (P < 0.0014, multiple-testing threshold). These fell into four classes: (i) lipids and lipoprotein subclass characteristics (total cholesterol and ratios, cholesterol esters and ratios, free cholesterol and ratios, phospholipids and ratios, and triglyceride ratios); (ii) fatty acids and ratios; (iii) amino acids; (iv) and fluid balance. Fourteen top metabolites were proxied by genetic variables, but MR indicated these were not causal. Conclusions: We identified 35 circulating metabolites associated with prostate cancer presence, but found no evidence of causality for those 14 testable with MR. Thus, the 14 MR-tested metabolites are unlikely to be mechanistically important in prostate cancer risk. Impact: The metabolome provides a promising set of biomarkers that may aid prostate cancer classification. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","amino acid; biological marker; cholesterol; cholesterol ester; fatty acid; phospholipid; prostate specific antigen; triacylglycerol; cholesterol; phospholipid; prostate specific antigen; triacylglycerol; tumor marker; adult; aged; amino acid blood level; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer screening; causality; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; controlled study; fatty acid blood level; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; Mendelian randomization analysis; multicenter study; phospholipid blood level; population based case control study; priority journal; prospective study; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial; triacylglycerol blood level; blood; case control study; clinical trial; genome-wide association study; metabolome; middle aged; prostate tumor; United Kingdom; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Case-Control Studies; Cholesterol; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Metabolome; Middle Aged; Phospholipids; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Triglycerides; United Kingdom"

"Co-occurrence of acute ophthalmoplegia (without ataxia) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension",2019,"Background: Acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia was designated as ‘atypical Miller Fisher syndrome’ as it presents with progressive, relatively symmetrical ophthalmoplegia, but without ataxia nor limb weakness, in the presence of anti-GQ1b antibody. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by signs of raised intracranial pressure occurring in the absence of cerebral pathology, with normal composition of cerebrospinal fluid and a raised opening pressure of more than 20 cmH2O during lumbar puncture. We aim to report a rare case of acute ophthalmoplegia with co-occurrence of raised intracranial pressure. Case Description: A 28-year-old gentleman with body mass index of 34.3 was referred to us for management of double vision of 2 weeks duration. His symptom started after a brief episode of upper respiratory tract infection. His best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 OU. He had bilateral sixth nerve palsy worse on the left eye and bilateral hypometric saccade. His deep tendon reflexes were found to be hyporeflexic in all four limbs. No sensory or motor power deficit was detected, and his gait was normal. Plantar reflexes were downwards bilaterally and cerebellar examination was normal. Both optic discs developed hyperaemia and swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was normal and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 50 cmH2O. Anti-GQ1b IgG and anti-GT1a IgG antibody were tested positive. Conclusion: Acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia can present with co-occurrence of raised intracranial pressure. It is important to have a full fundoscopic assessment to look for papilloedema in patients presenting with Miller Fisher syndrome or acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia. ?

"Vancomycin Pharmacokinetics Throughout Life: Results from a Pooled Population Analysis and Evaluation of Current Dosing Recommendations",2019,"Background and Objectives: Uncertainty exists regarding the optimal dosing regimen for vancomycin in different patient populations, leading to a plethora of subgroup-specific pharmacokinetic models and derived dosing regimens. We aimed to investigate whether a single model for vancomycin could be developed based on a broad dataset covering the extremes of patient characteristics. Furthermore, as a benchmark for current dosing recommendations, we evaluated and optimised the expected vancomycin exposure throughout life and for specific patient subgroups. Methods: A pooled population-pharmacokinetic model was built in NONMEM based on data from 14 different studies in different patient populations. Steady-state exposure was simulated and compared across patient subgroups for two US Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency-approved drug labels and optimised doses were derived. Results: The final model uses postmenstrual age, weight and serum creatinine as covariates. A 35-year-old, 70-kg patient with a serum creatinine level of 0.83?mg?dL?1 (73.4??mol?L?1) has a V1, V2, CL and Q2 of 42.9 L, 41.7 L, 4.10 L?h?1 and 3.22?L?h?1. Clearance matures with age, reaching 50% of the maximal value (5.31 L?h?1?70?kg?1) at 46.4?weeks postmenstrual age then declines with age to 50% at 61.6?years. Current dosing guidelines failed to achieve satisfactory steady-state exposure across patient subgroups. After optimisation, increased doses for the Food and Drug Administration label achieve consistent target attainment with minimal (± 20%) risk of under- and over-dosing across patient subgroups. Conclusions: A population model was developed that is useful for further development of age and kidney function-stratified dosing regimens of vancomycin and for individualisation of treatment through therapeutic drug monitoring and Bayesian forecasting. ? 2019, The Author(s).","vancomycin; area under the curve; Article; creatinine blood level; drug approval; drug clearance; drug monitoring; Food and Drug Administration; human; mental capacity; pharmacokinetic parameters; plasma concentration-time curve; population model; practice guideline; priority journal; steady state"
"Subjective depressive symptoms associated with pain in patients with major depressive disorder: Findings from the study on the aspect of Asian depression",2020,"Purpose: To examine subjective depressive symptoms associated with physical pain symptoms (PPSs) in Asian patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Design and methods: Four PPSs, including headache, chest pain, low back pain, and muscle pain, and subjective depressive symptoms were assessed using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Findings: Out of 528 participants, 390 (73.9%) had at least one PPS. After adjusting for sex, depression severity, disability, fatigue, physical health status, and mental health status, PPSs were found to be associated with crying easily, blaming oneself, feeling lonely, feeling blue, and worrying too much. Practical implications: Almost three-quarters of Asian patients with MDD experience PPSs. PPSs are associated with some subjective feelings of depression. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",""
"Chest pain in pregnancy: A false alarm",2019,"Chest pain in pregnancy can be alarmingly difficult to manage. Life threatening causes such as ischemic heart disease (IHD) must be excluded especially in those with high-risk group although the incidence in pregnancy is low. Early recognition of this condition with prompt revascularization treatment is the key to prevent devastating sequelae. However, the diagnostic dilemma in the disease confirmation during pregnancy may lead to unnecessary further intervention.

"Data fusion and multiple classifier systems for human activity detection and health monitoring: Review and open research directions",2019,"Activity detection and classification using different sensor modalities have emerged as revolutionary technology for real-time and autonomous monitoring in behaviour analysis, ambient assisted living, activity of daily living (ADL), elderly care, rehabilitations, entertainments and surveillance in smart home environments. Wearable devices, smart-phones and ambient environments devices are equipped with variety of sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometer, heart rate, pressure and wearable camera for activity detection and monitoring. These sensors are pre-processed and different feature sets such as time domain, frequency domain, wavelet transform are extracted and transform using machine learning algorithm for human activity classification and monitoring. Recently, deep learning algorithms for automatic feature representation have also been proposed to lessen the burden of reliance on handcrafted features and to increase performance accuracy. Initially, one set of sensor data, features or classifiers were used for activity recognition applications. However, there are new trends on the implementation of fusion strategies to combine sensors data, features and classifiers to provide diversity, offer higher generalization, and tackle challenging issues. For instances, combination of inertial sensors provide mechanism to differentiate activity of similar patterns and accurate posture identification while other multimodal sensor data are used for energy expenditure estimations, object localizations in smart homes and health status monitoring. Hence, the focus of this review is to provide in-depth and comprehensive analysis of data fusion and multiple classifier systems techniques for human activity recognition with emphasis on mobile and wearable devices. First, data fusion methods and modalities were presented and also feature fusion, including deep learning fusion for human activity recognition were critically analysed, and their applications, strengths and issues were identified. Furthermore, the review presents different multiple classifier system design and fusion methods that were recently proposed in literature. Finally, open research problems that require further research and improvements are identified and discussed. ? 2018","Assisted living; Automation; Data fusion; Deep learning; Frequency domain analysis; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; mHealth; Monitoring; Pattern recognition; Smartphones; Time domain analysis; Wavelet transforms; Wearable sensors; Activity detection; Activity of daily livings; Energy expenditure estimation; Health monitoring; Human activity recognition; Multimodal sensor; Multiple classifier systems; Revolutionary technology; Classification (of information)"
"Generic Cost-Effectiveness Models: A Proof of Concept of a Tool for Informed Decision-Making for Public Health Precision Medicine",2019,"Background/Aims: Economic evaluation is integral to informed public health decision-making in the rapidly growing field of precision and personalized medicine (PM); however, this research requires specialized expertise and significant resources. Generic models are a novel innovation to efficiently address a critical PM evidence shortage and implementation barrier by enabling use of population-specific input values. This is a generic PM economic evaluation model proof-of-concept study for a pharmacogenomic use case. Methods: An 8-step generic economic model development process was applied to the use case of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B?15:02genotyping for prediction of carbamazepine-induced cutaneous reactions, with a user-friendly decision-making tool relying on user-provided input values. This generic model was transparently documented and validated, including cross-validation comparing cost-effectiveness results with 3 country-specific models. Results: A generic pharmacogenomic use case cost-effectiveness model with decision-making tool was successfully developed and cross-validated using input values for 6 populations which produced consistent results for HLA-B?15:02 screening at country-specific cost-effectiveness threshold values. Differences between the generic and country-specific model results were largely due to differences in model structure and assumptions. Conclusion: This proof on concept demonstrates the feasibility of generic models to provide useful PM economic evidence, supporting their use as a pragmatic and timely approach to address a growing need. ? 2019 S.

"Small molecule grp94 inhibitors block dengue and Zika virus replication",2019,"Two major flaviviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), cause severe health and economic burdens worldwide. Recently, genome-wide screenings have uncovered the importance of regulators of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway for flavivirus replication in host cells. Here we report the identification of the compound Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-me) as a potent inhibitor of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ERAD, which possesses a broad-spectrum activity against both DENV and ZIKV. Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) suggested that CDDO-me binds to grp94, a key component of the Hrd1 pathway, at a low nanomolar concentration, whereas interaction was not detected with its paralog Hsp90. CDDO-me and the grp94 inhibitor PU-WS13 substantially suppressed DENV2 replication and the cytopathic effects caused by DENV and ZIKV infection. The antiviral activities of both compounds were demonstrated for all four DENV serotypes and four ZIKV strains in multiple human cell lines. This study defines grp94 as a crucial host factor for flavivirus replication and identified CDDO-me as a potent small molecule inhibitor of flavivirus infection. Inhibition of grp94 may contribute to the antiviral activity of CDDO-me. Further investigation of grp94 inhibitors may lead to a new class of broad-spectrum anti-flaviviral medications. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","bardoxolone methyl; glucose regulated protein 94; hrd1 ubiquitin ligase; ubiquitin protein ligase; unclassified drug; antiviral activity; Article; bioassay; cellular thermal shift assay; concentration (parameter); concentration response; controlled study; cytopathogenic effect; Dengue virus 2; drug identification; drug protein binding; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; human; human cell; priority journal; serotype; virus replication; virus strain; Zika virus"
"Prevalence of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis in the patients with coronary artery disease in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia",2019,"There is limited information regarding the prevalence of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis in the patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in South East Asia. The primary objective was to assess the prevalence of extracranial carotid stenosis, raised carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), and plaques in the patients with CAD undergoing elective CABG. The secondary objective was to evaluate the risk factors for extracranial carotid atherosclerosis.A total of 119 consecutive patients with CAD undergoing elective CABG in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia were recruited. Data on the demographic characteristics and risk factors were collected. The ultrasound carotid Doppler findings comprising of raised CIMT, plaques, and stenosis in the extracranial carotid vessels were recorded.The mean age of the patients was 64.26?±?10.12 (range 42-89). Most of the patients were men (73.1%). The patients consisted of 44 (37%) Malays, 26 (21.8%) Chinese, and 49 (41.2%) Indians.A total of 67 (56.3%) patients had raised CIMT, 89 (74.8%) patients had plaques, and 10 (8.4%) patients had stenosis in the internal and common carotid arteries. The mean age of patients with plaques was higher compared to those without plaques (66.00?±?9.63 vs 59.10?±?9.92, P?=?.001). The body mass index (BMI) of patients with stenosis was higher compared to those without stenosis (28.35?±?4.92 vs 25.75?±?3.16, P?=?.02).The patients with plaques were more likely to be older, whereas the patients with carotid stenosis were more likely to have higher BMI.","adult; age; aged; arterial wall thickness; body mass; carotid artery disease; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; female; human; Malaysia; male; middle aged; prevalence; retrospective study; risk factor; tertiary care center; very elderly; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Carotid Artery Diseases; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tertiary Care Centers"
"Mouth self-examination as a screening tool for oral potentially malignant disorders among a high-risk Indigenous population",2019,"Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of mouth self-examination (MSE) as a self-screening tool for detection of oral mucosal lesions among an Indigenous population in Malaysia at high risk for oral premalignant and malignant disorders. Methods: Two villages were selected as the sampling frame based on prevalence of tobacco and betel quid chewing habit. Respondents were asked to check their mouth for presence of lesion or abnormalities. Education on oral cancer, including MSE, was provided. Subsequently, respondents were asked to perform MSE. Finally, a clinical oral examination (COE) was done by a specialist and the presence of oral mucosal lesions was recorded. Results: Almost 64.5 percent of respondents exhibited high levels of difficulty and low mucosal visualization and retracting ability, whereas 3.0 percent demonstrated high attention level when performing MSE. Prevalence of oral mucosal lesions was 59.0 percent, whereas the prevalence of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) was 9.0 percent. Detection of oral lesions by respondents using MSE was lower than detection by the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity of MSE for detection of all types of lesions were 8.6 and 95.0 percent respectively. When analyzing each lesion type separately, MSE was found to be most sensitive in detection of swellings (10.0 percent), and most specific in identifying white lesions (97.8 percent). For detection of OPMDs, although specificity was high (98.9 percent), sensitivity (0 percent), and +LR (0) was poor. Conclusion: MSE is not an effective self-screening tool for early detection of potentially malignant lesions for this population. ? 2019 American Association of Public Health Dentistry","human; mouth disease; mouth tumor; self examination; Diagnosis, Oral; Humans; Mouth Diseases; Mouth Neoplasms; Self-Examination"
"Coffee and tea consumption and risk of prostate cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition",2019,"The epidemiological evidence regarding the association of coffee and tea consumption with prostate cancer risk is inconclusive, and few cohort studies have assessed these associations by disease stage and grade. We examined the associations of coffee (total, caffeinated and decaffeinated) and tea intake with prostate cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Among 142,196 men, 7,036 incident prostate cancer cases were diagnosed over 14 years of follow-up. Data on coffee and tea consumption were collected through validated country-specific food questionnaires at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Models were stratified by center and age, and adjusted for anthropometric, lifestyle and dietary factors. Median coffee and tea intake were 375 and 106 mL/day, respectively, but large variations existed by country. Comparing the highest (median of 855 mL/day) versus lowest (median of 103 mL/day) consumers of coffee and tea (450 vs. 12 mL/day) the HRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.94–1.09) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90–1.07) for risk of total prostate cancer and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.79–1.21) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.70–1.13) for risk of fatal disease, respectively. No evidence of association was seen for consumption of total, caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee or tea and risk of total prostate cancer or cancer by stage, grade or fatality in this large cohort. Further investigations are needed to clarify whether an association exists by different preparations or by concentrations and constituents of these beverages. ? 2018 UICC","adult; Article; cancer grading; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cancer staging; coffee; confidence interval; controlled study; fatality; follow up; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; hazard ratio; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; prostate cancer; risk assessment; risk factor; tea; aged; cohort analysis; diet; Europe; incidence; middle aged; prostate tumor; Adult; Aged; Coffee; Cohort Studies; Diet Surveys; Europe; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Tea"
"An Islamic Microfinance Approach to Scaling up the Economic Life of Vulnerable People with HIV/AIDS in the Muslim Society",2019,"People with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) commonly pose problems to their family as well as to society because of their vulnerable health and economic conditions. Contrarily, PLWHA encounter social discrimination and adverse realities while finding it difficult to continue in their jobs. These complex phenomena interact to push them into a low economic status. A microfinance program can hopefully assist poor patients to cope with the negative economic consequences of this disease. But the conventional market-oriented microfinance institutions show reluctance to serve this group of people due to the possibilities of having credit risk. In this paper, we propose an alternative microfinancing technique that can provide a better economic life of the PLWHA while absorbing the credit risks. A comprehensive model is designed using specific Islamic financial instruments in conjugation with household economic portfolio theory. Critical realism method was adopted to construct this model. We concluded that the application of Islamic microfinance can enhance income of HIV patients while reducing the productivity-loss. This model can be useful to the microfinance practitioners and policymakers for addressing a different market segment, diversifying products, and formulating policy. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Analysis of core protein clusters identifies candidate variable sites conferring metronidazole resistance in Helicobacter pylori",2019,"Background: Metronidazole is one of the first-line drugs of choice in the standard triple therapy used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection. Hence, the global emergence of metronidazole resistance in Hp poses a major challenge to health professionals. Inactivation of RdxA is known to be a major mechanism of conferring metronidazole resistance in H. pylori. However, metronidazole resistance can also arise in H. pylori strains expressing functional RdxA protein, suggesting that there are other mechanisms that may confer resistance to this drug. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing on 121 H. pylori clinical strains, among which 73 were metronidazole-resistant. Sequence-alignment analysis of core protein clusters derived from clinical strains containing full-length RdxA was performed. Variable sites in each alignment were statistically compared between the resistant and susceptible groups to determine candidate genes along with their respective amino-acid changes that may account for the development of metronidazole resistance in H. pylori. Results: Resistance due to RdxA truncation was identified in 34% of metronidazole-resistant strains. Analysis of core protein clusters derived from the remaining 48 metronidazole-resistant strains and 48 metronidazole-susceptible identified four variable sites significantly associated with metronidazole resistance. These sites included R16H/C in RdxA, D85N in the inner-membrane protein RclC (HP0565), V265I in a biotin carboxylase protein (HP0370) and A51V/T in a putative threonylcarbamoyl-AMP synthase (HP0918). Conclusions: Our approach identified new potential mechanisms for metronidazole resistance in H. pylori that merit further investigation. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"Screening for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using transient elastography",2019,"Background and Aim: The recommendation in regard to screening for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients differs in major guidelines. The aim of this paper was to study the prevalence of NALFD and advanced fibrosis among T2DM patients. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of consecutive adult T2DM patients attending the Diabetes Clinic of a university hospital. Significant hepatic steatosis and advanced fibrosis was diagnosed based on transient elastography if the controlled attenuation parameter was ??263?dB/m, and the liver stiffness measurement was ??9.6?kPa using the M probe or ??9.3?kPa using the XL probe, respectively. Patients with liver stiffness measurement ??8?kPa were referred to the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Clinic for further assessment, including liver biopsy. Results: The data of 557 patients were analyzed (mean age 61.4?±?10.8?years, male 40.6%). The prevalence of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis based on transient elastography was 72.4% and 21.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with NAFLD were central obesity (OR 4.856, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.749–8.577, P?=?0.006), serum triglyceride (OR 1.585, 95% CI 1.056–2.381, P?=?0.026), and alanine aminotransferase levels (OR 1.047, 95% CI 1.025–1.070, P?<?0.001) while advanced fibrosis was associated with serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR 0.355, 95% CI 0.126–0.997, P?=?0.049), alanine aminotransferase (OR 1.023, 95% CI 1.009–1.037, P?=?0.001), γ-glutamyltransferase (OR 1.005, 95% CI 1.001–1.008, P?=?0.017), and platelet levels (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.992–0.999, P?=?0.010). Seventy-one patients underwent liver biopsy. The majority had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (83.1%) and ??F1 fibrosis (87.3%) while advanced fibrosis was seen in 36.6%.

"In vitro evaluation of dual-antigenic PV1 peptide vaccine in head and neck cancer patients",2019,"Peptide vaccines derived from tumour-associated antigens have been used as an immunotherapeutic approach to induce specific cytotoxic immune response against tumour. We previously identified that MAGED4B and FJX1 proteins are overexpressed in HNSCC patients; and further demonstrated that two HLA-A2-restricted 9–11 amino acid peptides derived from these proteins were able to induce anti-tumour immune responses in vitro independently using PBMCs isolated from these patients. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a dual-antigenic peptide vaccine (PV1), comprised of MAGED4B and FJX1 peptides in HNSCC patients. We first demonstrated that 94.8% of HNSCC patients expressed MAGED4B and/or FJX1 by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that PV1 could benefit the majority of HNSCC patients. The presence of pre-existing MAGED4B and FJX1-specific T-cells was detected using a HLA-A2 dimer assay and efficacy of PV1 to induce T-cell to secrete cytotoxic cytokine was evaluated using ELISPOT assay. Pre-existing PV1-specific T-cells were detected in all patients. Notably, we demonstrated that patients’ T-cells were able to secrete cytotoxic cytokines upon exposure to target cells expressing the respective antigen post PV1 stimulation. Furthermore, patients with high expression of MAGED4B and FJX1 in their tumours were more responsive to PV1 stimulation, demonstrating the specificity of the PV1 peptide vaccine. Additionally, we also demonstrated the expression of MAGED4B and FJX1 in breast, lung, colon, prostate and rectal cancer suggesting the potential use of PV1 in these cancers. In summary, PV1 could be a good vaccine candidate for the treatment of HNSCC patients and other cancers expressing these antigens. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cancer vaccine; dimer; dual antigenic peptide vaccine; four jointed box protein 1; gamma interferon; granzyme B; HLA A2 antigen; influenza virus matrix protein 1; melanoma antigen 4; messenger RNA; monoclonal antibody; peptide vaccine; tumor antigen; unclassified drug; virus nucleoprotein; cytokine; HLA A2 antigen; subunit vaccine; tumor antigen; adult; aged; antigen expression; antigen specificity; Article; breast cancer; cancer staging; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical article; colon cancer; controlled study; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; drug efficacy; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; head and neck cancer; human; human cell; immune response; immunogenicity; immunohistochemistry; lung cancer; male; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nasopharynx carcinoma; overall survival; polymerase chain reaction; prostate cancer; protein expression; rectum cancer; T lymphocyte activation; Western blotting; head and neck tumor; immunology; lymphocyte activation; middle aged; mononuclear cell; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cancer Vaccines; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokines; Female; Gene Expression; Head and Neck Neoplasms; HLA-A2 Antigen; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Lymphocyte Activation; Male; Middle Aged; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Vaccines, Subunit"

"CPAF, HSP60 and MOMP antigens elicit pro-inflammatory cytokines production in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from genital Chlamydia trachomatis-infected patients",2019,"Background: Persistent inflammation caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in the female genital compartment represents one of the major causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy and infertility in females. Here, we examined the pro-inflammatory cytokine response following stimulation with three different types of C. trachomatis antigens, viz. chlamydial protease-like factor (CPAF), heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and major outer membrane protein (MOMP). Methods: A total of 19 patients with genital C. trachomatis infection and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited for the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from genital C. trachomatis-infected females were cultured in the presence of CPAF, HSP60 and MOMP antigens, and cytokines were measured by ELISA assay. Results: We reported that pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) were robustly secreted following antigenic exposure. Notably, CPAP and MOMP were more potent in triggering IL-1β, as compared to HSP60. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines were also noted in the samples infected with plasmid-bearing C. trachomatis as compared to those infected with plasmid-free strains. Conclusions: Our study highlights distinct ability of chlamydial antigens in triggering pro-inflammatory response in the host immune cells. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","bacterial antigen; chaperonin 60; chlamydial protease like factor; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; major outer membrane protein; outer membrane protein; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; autacoid; chaperonin 60; CPA factor; cytokine; outer membrane protein; proteinase; adult; Article; Chlamydia trachomatis; chlamydial urethritis; clinical article; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; human cell; inflammation; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; plasmid; priority journal; strain difference; young adult; cell culture; Chlamydia trachomatis; chlamydiasis; genital system; immunology; metabolism; mononuclear cell; physiology; Adult; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Cells, Cultured; Chaperonin 60; Chlamydia Infections; Chlamydia trachomatis; Cytokines; Endopeptidases; Female; Genitalia; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Young Adult"
"Chronic restraint stress impairs sociability but not social recognition and spatial memory in C57BL/6J mice",2019,"Chronic stress has been associated with impairment of memory, learning, and social cognition. In animal studies, chronic stress has been shown to impair rodent sociability behaviour which mimics social withdrawal as observed in depression patients. The effect of chronic stress on social recognition, however, is uncertain. Moreover, with reference to spatial learning and memory, the effect of chronic stress is dependent on the type of behavioural task: an appetitively or aversively motivated tasks. The effect of chronic stress was consistent in impairing spatial learning and memory in the appetitive task; however, the effect was inconsistent in an aversive task like the Morris water maze. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of chronic restraint stress on sociability and social recognition by using a modified protocol of the three-chamber paradigm and the effect of chronic restraint stress on spatial learning and memory by using the Morris water maze test in young adult C57BL/6J male mice. The present report also describes a modified protocol of the three-chamber paradigm. Our modification is based on measurement of sniffing behaviour, which is a direct social interaction that represents sociability. We used the chronic restraint stress paradigm for 6 h/day for 21 days to induce depression-like symptoms in male C57BL/6J mice which were validated by forced-swim test.

"Breaking down the barriers: Understanding migrant workers’ access to healthcare in Malaysia",2019,"Background Malaysia is widely credited to have achieved universal health coverage for citizens. However, the accessibility of healthcare services to migrant workers is questionable. Recently, medical fees for foreigners at public facilities were substantially increased. Mandatory health insurance only covers public hospital admissions and excludes undocumented migrants. This study explores barriers to healthcare access faced by documented and undocumented migrant workers in Malaysia. Methods We use qualitative data from 17 in-depth interviews conducted with key informants from civil society organisations, trade unions, academia, medical professionals, as well as migrant workers and their representatives. We interviewed doctors working in public hospitals and private clinics frequented by migrants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results We found that healthcare services in Malaysia are often inaccessible to migrant workers. Complex access barriers were identified, many beyond the control of the health sector. Major themes include affordability and financial constraints, the need for legal documents like valid passports and work permits, language barriers, discrimination and xenophobia, physical inaccessibility and employer-related barriers. Our study suggests that government mandated insurance for migrant workers is insufficient in view of the recent increase in medical fees. The perceived close working relationship between the ministries of health and immigration effectively excludes undocumented migrants from access to public healthcare facilities. Language barriers may affect the quality of care received by migrant workers, by inadvertently resulting in medical errors, while preventing them from giving truly informed consent. Conclusions We propose instituting migrant-friendly health services at public facilities. We also suggest implementing a comprehensive health insurance to enable healthcare access and financial risk protection for all migrant workers. Non-health sector solutions include the formation of a multi-stakeholder migration management body towards a comprehensive national policy on labour migration which includes health. ? 2019 Loganathan et al.

"Determinants of diet and physical activity in malaysian adolescents: A systematic review",2019,"The increased prevalence of unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles among Malaysian adolescents has become a public health concern. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize evidence from observational studies related to diet and physical activity (PA) among Malaysian adolescents (13–18 years) and to recognize the associations between determinants of diet and PA and diet and PA behaviours. A systematic search for observational studies published from August 1990 through August 2017 was conducted via PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane and Web of Science. A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria; these were independently extracted by two reviewers. Gender and ethnicity were the most commonly studied correlates of diet and PA; males were more physically active and they tended to have poorer diet quality and higher energy and macronutrient intakes in comparison to females; Malay adolescents had a lower diet quality and Chinese adolescents spent less time in PA compared to other ethnicities. However, the significance of these associations was often small or inconsistent. This review highlights the lack of longitudinal observational studies but summarizes the best available evidence for policymakers and public health practitioners to improve the diet and the level of PA in Malaysian adolescents. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Genetic data from nearly 63,000 women of European descent predicts DNA methylation biomarkers and epithelial ovarian cancer risk",2019,"DNA methylation is instrumental for gene regulation. Global changes in the epigenetic landscape have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer. However, the role of DNA methylation in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains unclear. In this study, high-density genetic and DNA methylation data in white blood cells from the Framingham Heart Study (N ? 1,595) were used to build genetic models to predict DNA methylation levels. These prediction models were then applied to the summary statistics of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ovarian cancer including 22,406 EOC cases and 40,941 controls to investigate genetically predicted DNA methylation levels in association with EOC risk. Among 62,938 CpG sites investigated, genetically predicted methylation levels at 89 CpG were significantly associated with EOC risk at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P &lt; 7.94 10 7 . Of them, 87 were located at GWAS-identified EOC susceptibility regions and two resided in a genomic region not previously reported to be associated with EOC risk. Integrative analyses of genetic, methylation, and gene expression data identified consistent directions of associations across 12 CpG, five genes, and EOC risk, suggesting that methylation at these 12 CpG may influence EOC risk by regulating expression of these five genes, namely MAPT, HOXB3, ABHD8, ARH-GAP27, and SKAP1. We identified novel DNA methylation markers associated with EOC risk and propose that methylation at multiple CpG may affect EOC risk via regulation of gene expression. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","DNA; tumor marker; tumor marker; ABHD8 gene; aged; ARHGAP27 gene; Article; cancer genetics; cancer susceptibility; cohort analysis; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; Europe; female; gene; gene expression regulation; genetic association; genome-wide association study; HOXB3 gene; human; leukocyte; major clinical study; MAPT gene; ovary carcinoma; pathogenesis; priority journal; SKAP1 gene; biological model; Caucasian; genetic predisposition; genetics; ovary tumor; predictive value; risk; women's health; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Cohort Studies; DNA Methylation; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Models, Genetic; Ovarian Neoplasms; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk; Women's Health"
"Withaferin A inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-F442A cell line, improves insulin sensitivity and promotes weight loss in high fat diet-induced obese mice",2019,"The increased prevalence of obesity and associated insulin resistance calls for effective therapeutic treatment of metabolic diseases. The current PPARγ-targeting antidiabetic drugs have undesirable side effects. The present study investigated the anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects of withaferin A (WFA) in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice and also the anti-adipogenic effect of WFA in differentiating 3T3- F442A cells. DIO mice were treated with WFA (6 mg/kg) or rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, metabolic profile, liver function and inflammatory parameters were obtained. Expression of selective genes controlling insulin signaling, inflammation, adipogenesis, energy expenditure and PPARγ phosphorylation-regulated genes in epididymal fats were analyzed. Furthermore, the anti-adipogenic effect of WFA was evaluated in 3T3- F442A cell line. WFA treatment prevented weight gain without affecting food or caloric intake in DIO mice. WFA-treated group also exhibited lower epididymal and mesenteric fat pad mass, an improvement in lipid profile and hepatic steatosis and a reduction in serum inflammatory cytokines. Insulin resistance was reduced as shown by an improvement in glucose and insulin tolerance and serum adiponectin. WFA treatment upregulated selective insulin signaling (insr, irs1, slc2a4 and pi3k) and PPARγ phosphorylation-regulated (car3, selenbp1, aplp2, txnip, and adipoq) genes, downregulated inflammatory (tnf-α and il-6) genes and altered energy expenditure controlling (tph2 and adrb3) genes. In 3T3- F442A cell line, withaferin A inhibited adipogenesis as indicated by a decrease in lipid accumulation in differentiating adipocytes and protein expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. The effect of rosiglitazone on physiological and lipid profiles, insulin resistance, some genes expression and differentiating adipocytes were markedly different. Our data suggest that WFA is a promising therapeutic agent for both diabetes and obesity. ? 2019 Khalilpourfarshbafi et al.

"Magnetic cellulose nanocrystal stabilized Pickering emulsions for enhanced bioactive release and human colon cancer therapy",2019,"Stimuli-responsive drug release and controlled delivery play crucial roles in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and lowering over-dosage induced side effects. In this paper, we report magnetically-triggered drug release and in-vitro anti-colon cancer efficacy of Fe 3 O 4 @cellulose nanocrystal (MCNC)-stabilized Pickering emulsions containing curcumin (CUR). The loading efficiency of CUR in the micron-sized (?7 μm) MCNC-stabilized Pickering emulsions (MCNC-PE) template was found to be 99.35%. The drug release profiles showed that the exposure of MCNC-PE to external magnetic field (EMF) (0.7 T) stimulated the release of bioactive from MCNC-PE achieving 53.30 ± 5.08% of the initial loading over a 4-day period. The MTT assay demonstrated that the CUR-loaded MCNC-PE can effectively inhibits the human colon cancer cells growth down to 18% in the presence of EMF. The formulation also resulted in 2-fold reduction on the volume of the 3-D multicellular spheroids of HCT116 as compared to the control sample. The MCNC particle was found to be non-toxic to brine shrimp up to a concentration of 100 μg/mL. Our findings suggested that the palm-based MCNC-PE could be a promising yet effective colloidal drug delivery system for magnetic-triggered release of bioactive and therapeutics. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","curcumin; drug carrier; magnetite cellulose nanocrystal stabilized Pickering emulsion; magnetite nanoparticle; nanocomposite; unclassified drug; cellulose; curcumin; drug carrier; magnetite nanoparticle; nanoparticle; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Artemia; Article; biocompatibility; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer therapy; colon cancer; concentration (parameter); controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug release; emulsion; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; magnetic field; MTT assay; multicellular spheroid; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; toxicity testing; chemistry; colon tumor; delayed release formulation; metabolism; particle size; pathology; pharmacokinetics; pharmacology; Cellulose; Colonic Neoplasms; Curcumin; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Carriers; Emulsions; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Particle Size"
"Elevated concentration of radioactive potassium in edible algae cultivated in Malaysian seas and estimation of ingestion dose to humans",2019,"Although the various benefits of seaweeds are well recognised, potential health hazards are much less well researched, as an instance the possible presence of concentrated levels of natural radionuclides. In present work the concentrations of natural radionuclides in seaweed cultivated in Malaysian seas are assessed using conventional HPGe γ-ray spectrometry. An edible species of seaweed has been collected from several seaweed farms located along coasts of the Andaman and South China Sea. Activity concentrations of 226Ra, 228Ra and 40K in samples collected from Langkawi are observed to be greater than those from Sabah, while 40K radioactivity levels (2.2E3 ± 100 – 3.8E3 ± 180 Bq kg?1) in all samples are noted to be well above the world average value of between 400 and 580 Bq kg?1. The estimated amount of total potassium is in the range 68 – 120 g (kg of seaweed)?1 and 53–106 g kg?1 obtained via ICP-OES, which are in line with data for New Zealand seaweed of between 43.7 and 123 g kg?1. The estimated total effective dose of 84 μSv·y?1 is lower compared to a global internal dose of 290 μSv·y?1 as reported by UNSCEAR. Accordingly, the mean cancer risk from such consumption was also estimated to be slightly lower (1.92 × 10?3) compared to the ICRP cancer risk factor of 2.5 × 10?3 based on the additional annual dose limit of 1 mSv for a member of the general public, which gives an annual mortality probability of 10?5 (1 in 100,000; ICRP, 1991). Although posing a low risk health hazard, periodic monitoring of natural radioactivity in foodstuff remains important in seeking to ensure the radiological safety of the public. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",""
"Diabetes, arthritis, urinary incontinence, poor self-rated health, higher body mass index and lower handgrip strength are associated with falls among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults: Pooled analyses from two cross-sectional Malaysian datasets",2019,"Aim: The identification of risk factors associated with comorbidities and physical fitness might provide pathways for planning therapeutic targets for future falls prevention. Results from large datasets that examined falls risk factors in Asia have been limited. The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors for falls by pooling data consisting of medical history, physical performance and self-rated health from two large Malaysian epidemiological studies. Methods: Matching variables from the Towards Useful Aging and Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research datasets related to falls, physical performance and determinants of falls were identified and pooled for analysis. The Timed Up and Go test and dominant handgrip strength tests were used as physical performance measures. Falls were self-reported, and functional status was assessed using activities of daily living. Results: Data of 3935 participants, mean age 68.9 ± 6.8 years, 2127 (54.0%) women and 1807 (46.0%) men were extracted for analyses. In an adjusted model, independent risk factors for falls from this cohort studies were diabetes (OR 1.258), arthritis (OR 1.366), urinary incontinence (OR 1.346), poor self-rated health (OR 1.293), higher body mass index (OR 1.029) and lower handgrip strength (OR 1.234). Conclusions: Although the risk factors that emerged from our analyses were similar to available studies among older adults, the Timed Up and Go test did not appear as one of the risk factors in the present study that included middle-aged adults.

"Mixed-methods approach to exploring patients’ perspectives on the acceptability of a urinary biomarker test in replacing cystoscopy for bladder cancer surveillance",2019,"Objectives: To determine the minimal accepted sensitivity (MAS) of a urine biomarker that patients are willing to accept to replace cystoscopy and to assess qualitatively their views and reasons. Patients and Methods: Patients were part of a prospective multicentre observational study recruiting people with bladder cancer for a urine biomarker study (DETECT II; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02781428). A mixed-methods approach comprising (1) a questionnaire to assess patients’ experience with cystoscopy and patients’ preference for cystoscopy vs urinary biomarker, and (2) semi-structured interviews to understand patient views, choice and reasons for their preference. Results: A urine biomarker with an MAS of 90% would be accepted by 75.8% of patients. This was despite a high self-reported prevalence of haematuria (51.0%), dysuria/lower urinary tract symptoms (69.1%) and urinary tract infection requiring antibiotics (25.8%). There was no association between MAS with patient demographics, adverse events experienced, cancer characteristics or distance of patients’ home to hospital. The qualitative analysis suggested that patients acknowledge that cystoscopy is invasive, embarrassing and associated with adverse events but are willing to tolerate the procedure because of its high sensitivity. Patients have confidence in cystoscopy and appreciate the visual diagnosis of cancer. Both low- and high-risk patients would consider a biomarker with a reported sensitivity similar to that of cystoscopy. Conclusion: Patients value the high sensitivity of cystoscopy despite the reported discomfort and adverse events experienced after it. The sensitivity of a urinary biomarker must be close to cystoscopy to gain patients’ acceptance. ? 2019 The Authors BJU International published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of BJU International","antibiotic agent; biological marker; aged; Article; cancer epidemiology; cystoscopy; diagnostic value; dysuria; female; hematuria; high risk patient; human; low risk patient; lower urinary tract symptom; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; non muscle invasive bladder cancer; observational study; patient attitude; patient preference; priority journal; prospective study; qualitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; urinalysis; urinary tract infection; very elderly"
"Development of live attenuated Enterovirus 71 vaccine strains that confer protection against lethal challenge in mice",2019,"Besides causing mild hand, foot and mouth infections, Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is associated with neurological complications and fatality. With concerns about rising EV-A71 virulence, there is an urgency for more effective vaccines. The live attenuated vaccine (LAV) is a more valuable vaccine as it can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. A miRNA-based vaccine strain (pIY) carrying let-7a and miR-124a target genes in the EV-A71 genome which has a partial deletion in the 5′NTR (?11 bp) and G64R mutation (3D p ° l ) was designed. The viral RNA copy number and viral titers of the pIY strain were significantly lower in SHSY-5Y cells that expressed both let-7a and miR-124a. Inhibition of the cognate miRNAs expressed in RD and SHSY-5Y cells demonstrated de-repression of viral mRNA translation. A previously constructed multiply mutated strain, MMS and the pIY vaccine strain were assessed in their ability to protect 4-week old mice from hind limb paralysis. The MMS showed higher amounts of IFN-γ ex vivo than the pIY vaccine strain. There was absence of EV-A71 antigen in the skeletal muscles and spinal cord micrographs of mice vaccinated with the MMS and pIY strains. The MMS and pIY strains are promising LAV candidates developed against severe EV-A71 infections. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Hybrid of Swarm Intelligent Algorithms in Medical Applications",2019,"In this paper, we designed a hybrid of swarm intelligence algorithms to diagnose hepatitis, breast tissue, and dermatology conditions in patients with such infection. The effectiveness of hybrid swarm intelligent algorithms was studied since no single algorithm is effective in solving all types of problems. In this study, feed forward and Elman recurrent neural network (ERN) with swarm intelligent algorithms is used for the classification of the mentioned diseases. The capabilities of six (6) global optimization learning algorithms were studied and their performances in training as well as testing were compared. These algorithms include: Hybrid of Cuckoo Search algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) (CSLM), Cuckoo Search algorithm (CS) and backpropagation (BP) (CSBP), CS and ERN (CSERN), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and LM (ABCLM), ABC and BP (ABCBP), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and BP (GANN). Simulation comparative results indicated that the classification accuracy and run time of the CSLM outperform the CSERN, GANN, ABCBP, ABCLM, and CSBP in the breast tissue dataset. On the other hand, the CSERN performs better than the CSLM, GANN, ABCBP, ABCLM, and CSBP in both the dermatology and hepatitis datasets. The results obtained could allow researchers to quickly identify the most suitable algorithm for application in a particular medical dataset. ?

"Genetic diversity of zoonotic malaria parasites from mosquito vector and vertebrate hosts",2019,"We explored and constructed haplotype network for simian malaria species: Plasmodium knowlesi, P. cynomolgi and P. inui aiming to understand the transmission dynamics between mosquitoes, humans and macaques. Mosquitoes were collected from villages in an area where zoonotic malaria is prevalent. PCR analysis confirmed Anopheles balabacensis as the main vector for macaque parasites, moreover nearly 60% of the mosquitoes harboured more than one Plasmodium species. Fragments of the A-type small subunit ribosomal RNA (SS rRNA) amplified from salivary gland sporozoites, and equivalent sequences obtained from GenBank were used to construct haplotype networks. The patterns were consistent with the presence of geographically distinct populations for P. inui and P. cynomolgi, and with three discrete P. knowlesi populations. This study provides a preliminary snapshot of the structure of these populations, that was insufficient to answer our aim. Thus, collection of parasites from their various hosts and over time, associated with a systematic analysis of a set of genetical loci is strongly advocated in order to obtain a clear picture of the parasite population and the flow between different hosts. This is important to devise measures that will minimise the risk of transmission to humans, because zoonotic malaria impedes malaria elimination. ? 2019","small subunit ribosomal RNA; adult; Anopheles; Anopheles balabacensis; Article; controlled study; disease transmission; DNA sequence; genetic variability; haplotype; host parasite interaction; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Plasmodium; Plasmodium cynomolgi; Plasmodium inui; Plasmodium knowlesi; population structure; priority journal; salivary gland; sporozoite"
"Assessing regional left ventricular thickening dysfunction and dyssynchrony via personalized modeling and 3D wall thickness measurements for acute myocardial infarction",2019,"Background: Existing clinical diagnostic and assessment methods could be improved to facilitate early detection and treatment of cardiac dysfunction associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to reduce morbidity and mortality. Purpose: To develop 3D personalized left ventricular (LV) models and thickening assessment framework for assessing regional wall thickening dysfunction and dyssynchrony in AMI patients. Study Type: Retrospective study, diagnostic accuracy. Subjects: Forty-four subjects consisting of 15 healthy subjects and 29 AMI patients. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T/steady-state free precession cine MRI scans; LGE MRI scans. Assessment: Quantitative thickening measurements across all cardiac phases were correlated and validated against clinical evaluation of infarct transmurality by an experienced cardiac radiologist based on the American Heart Association (AHA) 17-segment model. Statistical Test: Nonparametric 2-k related sample-based Kruskal–Wallis test; Mann–Whitney U-test; Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: Healthy LV wall segments undergo significant wall thickening (P < 0.05) during ejection and have on average a thicker wall (8.73 ± 1.01 mm) compared with infarcted wall segments (2.86 ± 1.11 mm). Myocardium with thick infarct (ie, >50% transmurality) underwent remarkable wall thinning during contraction (thickening index [TI] = 1.46 ± 0.26 mm) as opposed to healthy myocardium (TI = 4.01 ± 1.04 mm). For AMI patients, LV that showed signs of thinning were found to be associated with a significantly higher percentage of dyssynchrony as compared with healthy subjects (dyssynchrony index [DI] = 15.0 ± 5.0% vs. 7.5 ± 2.0%, P < 0.01). Also, a strong correlation was found between our TI and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = 0.892, P < 0.01), and moderate correlation between DI and LVEF (r = 0.494, P < 0.01). Data Conclusion: The extracted regional wall thickening and DIs are shown to be strongly correlated with infarct severity, therefore suggestive of possible practical clinical utility.

"A comparison study on hindfoot correction, Achilles tendon length and thickness between clubfoot patients treated with percutaneous Achilles tendon tenotomy versus casting alone using Ponseti method",2019,"Purpose: To compare the hindfoot correction using clinical and ultrasonography assessment in clubfoot patients undergoing Achilles tendon tenotomy with patients corrected with casting alone. Method: A prospective observational study on idiopathic clubfoot patients less than 3 months old. Clinical assessment was done using hindfoot Pirani score and measurement of ankle dorsiflexion. Serial ultrasonography was done to measure the length and thickness of the Achilles tendon pre-hindfoot correction, 3 and 6 weeks post-hindfoot correction. Independent t-test was used to analyse the increase in ankle dorsiflexion, improvement in length and thickness of Achilles tendon between the two groups. Mann–Whitney U test was used to analyse the improvement in hindfoot Pirani score. Pearson correlation test was used for correlation in between clinical severity and ultrasonography assessment. Results: Twenty-three patients with bilateral clubfoot and four with unilateral clubfoot were recruited with a total of 50 clubfeet. Each group consists of 25 feet with a mean age of 2 months. Marked improvement in hindfoot correction was noted in tenotomy group compared to non-tenotomy group as evidenced by significant increase in Achilles tendon length, ankle dorsiflexion and improvement of hindfoot Pirani score. No significant difference in Achilles tendon thickness was noted between the two groups. Positive correlation was demonstrated between increase in Achilles tendon length and increase in ankle dorsiflexion as well as improvement in hindfoot Pirani score. Conclusion: We would like to propose Achilles tendon tenotomy in all clubfoot patients as it is concretely evident that superior hindfoot correction was achieved in tenotomy group. ?

The structure of the L has been confirmed by single crystal XRD study. The complexes show good binding propensity to bovine serum albumin (BSA) having relatively higher binding constant values (104 M?1) than the ligand. Fluorescence spectral studies indicate that [CoLCl2] binds relatively stronger with CT DNA through intercalative mode, exhibiting higher binding constant (2.22 × 105 M?1). Agarose gel electrophoresis run on plasmid DNA (pUC18) prove that all the complexes showed efficient DNA cleavage via hydroxyl radical mechanism. The complexes were identified as potent anticancer agents against two human cancer cell lines (MCF7 and A549) by comparing with cisplatin.

Recently, it has been suggested that cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) could mediate drug resistance. In this study, the role of EVs in mediating the response of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells to cisplatin was investigated. We isolated and characterized EVs from OSCC cell lines showing differential sensitivities to cisplatin. Increased EV production was observed in both de novo (H314) and adaptive (H103/cisD2) resistant lines compared to sensitive H103 cells. The protein profiles of these EVs were then analyzed. Differences in the proteome of EVs secreted by H103 and H103/cisD2 indicated that adaptation to cisplatin treatment caused significant changes in the secreted nanovesicles. Intriguingly, both resistant H103/cisD2 and H314 cells shared a highly similar EV protein profile including downregulation of the metal ion transporter, ATP1B3, in the EVs implicating altered drug delivery. ICP-MS analysis revealed that less cisplatin accumulated in the resistant cells, but higher levels were detected in their EVs. Therefore, we inhibited EV secretion from the cells using a proton pump inhibitor and observed an increased drug sensitivity in cisplatin-resistant H314 cells. This finding suggests that control of EV secretion could be a potential strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment. ? 2019 by the authors.","CAB39 protein; carrier proteins and binding proteins; CTNNB1 protein; DLG1 protein; epidermal growth factor receptor; lansoprazole; PACSIN3 protein; proteome; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1A1; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B3; unclassified drug; Article; BICR31 cell line; cancer resistance; cell isolation; cellular secretion; controlled study; down regulation; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; drug response; drug sensitivity; exosome; H103 cell line; H314 cell line; H357 cell line; H376 cell line; H413 cell line; human; human cell; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; NCI-H157 cell line; oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell line; regulatory mechanism; tumor cell; tumor cell derived extracellular vesicle"
"Encapsulation of Bacillus salmalaya 139SI using double coating biopolymer technique",2019,"Sustainable crop production for a rapidly growing human population is one of the current challenges faced by the agricultural sector. However, many of the chemical agents used in agriculture can be hazardous to humans, non-targeted organism and environment. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria have demonstrated a role in promoting plant growth and health under various stress conditions including disease. Unfortunately, bacterial viability degrades due to temperature and other environmental factors (Bashan et?al., Plant Soil 378: 1–33, 2014). Encapsulation of bacteria into core-shell biopolymers is one of the promising techniques to overcome the problem. This study deals with the encapsulation of Bacillus salmalaya 139SI using simple double coating biopolymer technique which consist of brown rice protein/alginate and 0·5% low molecular weight chitosan of pH 4 and 6. The influence of biopolymer to bacteria mass ratio and the chitosan pH on the encapsulation process, physic-chemical, morphology and bioactivity properties of encapsulated B.?salmalaya 139SI have been studied systematically. Based on the analysis of physico-chemical, morphology and bioactivity properties, B.?salmalaya 139S1 encapsulated using double coating encapsulation technology has promising viability pre- and postfreeze-drying with excellent encapsulation yields of 99·7 and 89·3% respectively. Significance and Impact of the Study: The need of a simple yet effective way of encapsulating plant growth promoting rhizobacteria is crucial to further improve their benefits to global sustainable agriculture practice. Effective encapsulation allows for protection, controlled release and function of the micro-organism, as well as providing a longer shelf life for the product. This research report offers an innovative yet simple way of encapsulating using double coating technology with environmentally friendly biopolymers that could degrade and provide nutrients when in soil. Importantly, the bioactivity of the bacteria is maintained upon encapsulation. ? 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology","biopolymer; chitosan; biopolymer; bacterium; bioactivity; biotechnology; encapsulation; growth regulator; morphology; physicochemical property; protein; rhizobacterium; rice; viability; Article; Bacillus; Bacillus salmalaya; bacterial survival; bacterial viability; biological activity; controlled study; encapsulation; field emission scanning electron microscopy; freeze drying; material coating; molecular weight; morphology; nonhuman; pH; agriculture; Bacillus; chemistry; crop; desiccation; growth, development and aging; human; metabolism; microbial viability; microbiology; physiology; plant development; procedures; soil; temperature; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Rhizobiales; Agriculture; Bacillus; Biopolymers; Chitosan; Crops, Agricultural; Desiccation; Humans; Microbial Viability; Plant Development; Soil; Temperature"
"Effect of macrolide prophylactic therapy on AIDS-Defining conditions and HIV-Associated mortality",2019,"Background:Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis is recommended for patients with advanced HIV infection. With the decrease in incidence of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection and the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the benefits of macrolide prophylaxis were investigated. This study examined the impact of macrolide prophylaxis on AIDS-defining conditions and HIV-associated mortality in a cohort of HIV-infected patients on ART.Methods:Patients from TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (September 2015 data transfer) aged 18 years and older with a CD4 count &lt;50 cells/mm3 at ART initiation were included. The effect of macrolide prophylaxis on HIV-associated mortality or AIDS-defining conditions (as a combined outcome) and HIV-associated mortality alone were evaluated using competing risk regression. Sensitivity analysis was conducted in patients with a CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation.Results:Of 1345 eligible patients, 10.6% received macrolide prophylaxis. The rate of the combined outcome was 7.35 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.04 to 8.95] per 100 patient-years, whereas the rate of HIV-associated mortality was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.35 to 4.19) per 100 patient-years. Macrolide use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HIV-associated mortality (hazard ratio 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.80, P = 0.031) but not with the combined outcome (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI: 0.32 to 2.229, P = 0.764). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent results among patients with a CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation.Conclusions:Macrolide prophylaxis is associated with improved survival among Asian HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts and on ART. This study suggests the increased usage and coverage of macrolide prophylaxis among people living with HIV in Asia. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Rationale and design of the hip fracture accelerated surgical treatment and care track (hip attack) trial: A protocol for an international randomised controlled trial evaluating early surgery for hip fracture patients",2019,"Introduction Annually, millions of adults suffer hip fractures. The mortality rate post a hip fracture is 7%-10% at 30 days and 10%-20% at 90 days. Observational data suggest that early surgery can improve these outcomes in hip fracture patients. We designed a clinical trial - HIP fracture Accelerated surgical TreaTment And Care tracK (HIP ATTACK) to determine the effect of accelerated surgery compared with standard care on the 90-day risk of all-cause mortality and major perioperative complications. Methods and analysis HIP ATTACK is a multicentre, international, parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will include patients ?45 years of age and diagnosed with a hip fracture from a low-energy mechanism requiring surgery. Patients are randomised to accelerated medical assessment and surgical repair (goal within 6 h) or standard care. The co-primary outcomes are (1) all-cause mortality and (2) a composite of major perioperative complications (ie, mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, sepsis, stroke, and life-threatening and major bleeding) at 90 days after randomisation. All patients will be followed up for a period of 1 year. We will enrol 3000 patients. Ethics and dissemination All centres had ethics approval before randomising patients. Written informed consent is required for all patients before randomisation. HIP ATTACK is the first large international trial designed to examine whether accelerated surgery can improve outcomes in patients with a hip fracture. The dissemination plan includes publishing the results in a policy-influencing journal, conference presentations, engagement of influential medical organisations, and providing public awareness through multimedia resources.

"V1016G Point Mutation: The Key Mutation in the Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel (Vgsc) Gene of Pyrethroid-Resistant Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Indonesia",2019,"Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is widespread in Indonesian Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), the primary vector of dengue viruses. This study aims to investigate the mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) conferring pyrethroid resistance against Ae. aegypti populations from Indonesia. Molecular genotyping of mutations using polymerase chain reaction assay and direct DNA sequencing were performed at positions 989 and 1,016 in IIS6 region, and 1,534 in IIIS6 region of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) in nine populations of Indonesian Ae. aegypti. The V1016G and S989P genotyping identified the RR genotype to be predominant in six out of nine populations of Ae. aegypti, whereas the SS genotype occurred only in minority. Interestingly, co-occurrence of the V1016G and S989P mutations was detected in the aforementioned six populations with high frequency. Genotyping of F1534C showed all nine populations exhibited the SS genotype, with merely two individuals from a population were heterozygous (RS). Significant correlations were demonstrated between the allele frequencies of the V1016G mutation and the survivability rates as well as resistance ratios in pyrethroid adult bioassays. This signifies the V1016G can contribute more to the insensitivity of Vgsc than the F1534C. Homozygous 1016G mosquitoes were likelier to survive pyrethroid exposure. Identification of underlying mechanisms resulting in insecticide resistance is advantageous in developing effective mosquito control programs in Indonesia. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"Clinical phenotypes of COPD and health-related quality of life: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Introduction: The Spanish COPD guideline (GesEPOC) classifies COPD into four clinical phenotypes based on the exacerbation frequency and dominant clinical manifestations. In this study, we compared the disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with different clinical phenotypes. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with COPD attending the respiratory medicine clinic of University of Malaya Medical Centre from 1 June 2017 to 31 May 2018. Disease-specific HRQoL was assessed by using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-c). Results: Of 189 patients, 28.6% were of non-exacerbator phenotype (NON-AE), 18.5% were of exacerbator with emphysema phenotype (AE NON-CB), 39.7% were of exacerbator with chronic bronchitis phenotype (AE CB), and 13.2% had asthma-COPD overlap syndrome phenotype (ACOS). The total CAT and SGRQ-c scores were significantly different between the clinical phenotypes (P<0.001). Patients who were AE CB had significantly higher total CAT score than those with ACOS (P=0.033), AE NON-CB (P=0.001), and NON-AE (P<0.001). Concerning SGRQ-c, patients who were AE CB also had a significantly higher total score than those with AE NON-CB (P=0.001) and NON-AE (P<0.001). However, the total SGRQ-c score of AE CB patients was only marginally higher than those who had ACOS (P=0.187). There was a significant difference in the score of each CAT item (except CAT 7) and SGRQ-c components between clinical phenotypes, with AE CB patients recording the highest score in each of them. Conclusion: Patients who were AE CB had significantly poorer HRQoL than other clinical phenotypes and recorded the worst score in each of the CAT items and SGRQ-c components. Therefore, AE CB patients may warrant a different treatment approach that focuses on the exacerbation and chronic bronchitis components. ? 2019 Chai et al.","aged; Article; asthma; chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical assessment; controlled study; COPD Assessment Test score; cross-sectional study; disease course; female; human; lung emphysema; major clinical study; male; phenotype; quality of life; scoring system; St. George Respiratory Questionnaire; tertiary care center; asthma; chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; comparative study; disease exacerbation; forced expiratory volume; health status; lung; lung emphysema; Malaysia; middle aged; parasitology; pathophysiology; phenotype; prognosis; psychology; questionnaire; very elderly; vital capacity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asthma; Bronchitis, Chronic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Health Status; Humans; Lung; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Prognosis; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Pulmonary Emphysema; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vital Capacity"
"Comparative study of the circumferential and volumetric analysis between conventional casting and three-dimensional scanning methods for transtibial socket: A preliminary study",2019,"Transtibial prosthetic sockets can be fabricated either by the conventional way, which involve using plaster of Paris bandages for casting. This will include modifications through hand, scanning and digital imaging of software. The aim of this study is to determine the circumferential profiles and conduct a volumetric analysis of a conventional socket that has fabrication using biosculptor technology. In doing this, a male transtibial amputee, age 28 years old with stable health condition was studied, where circumferential measurements were taken at intervals of 1 cm from the distal end of the residual limb to the medial tibial plateau level. Furthermore, the interior volume of both sockets and residuum were determined directly using water displacement method. A comparative value for the calculation of volume was also carried out using engineering mathematical equations. From these measurements, a total surface bearing transtibial sockets was fabricated to compare the changes of circumferential values of both sockets. The finding shows a percentage of the difference between the volume of the residual limb and conventional sockets to be 6.09%, whereas the biosculptor fabrication socket was 7.84% using the water displacement method. A comparison of circumferential profiles and volumetric analysis findings on the contrary showed that socket fabricated using the biosculptor technology is interchangeable with the conventional socket with more advantages, where biosculptor technology produces cheaper sockets and faster process with digital function in the procedure, unlike the conventional manual technique. ?

"Tigecycline and inducible clindamycin resistance in clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from Terengganu, Malaysia",2019,"The spread of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a public health concern. The inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogrammin B (iMLSB ) phenotype (or inducible clindamycin resistance) is associated with false clindamycin susceptibility in routine laboratory testing and may lead to treatment failure. Tigecycline resistance remains rare in S. aureus worldwide. This study aims to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinical isolates of S. aureus obtained from the main tertiary hospital in Terengganu state, Malaysia, from July 2016 to June 2017. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 90 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 109 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were determined by disc diffusion with the iMLSB phenotype determined by D-test. Multidrug resistance (MDR) and the iMLSB phenotype were more prevalent in MRSA (84.4 and 46.7 ?%, respectively) compared to MSSA isolates. All five tigecycline-resistant isolates were MRSA. The high incidence of MDR and the iMLSB phenotype and the emergence of tigecycline resistance in the Terengganu S. aureus isolates warrants continuous vigilance.","antiinfective agent; clindamycin; tigecycline; drug effect; female; human; isolation and purification; Malaysia; male; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; multidrug resistance; phenotype; prevalence; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; tertiary care center; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Clindamycin; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Phenotype; Prevalence; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Tertiary Care Centers; Tigecycline"
"Evaluation of novel Parkinson's disease candidate genes in the Chinese population",2019,"Recent whole-exome sequencing studies in European patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have identified potential risk variants across 33 novel PD candidate genes. We aim to determine if these reported candidate genes are similarly implicated in Asians by assessing common, rare, and novel nonsynonymous coding variants by sequencing all 33 genes in 198 Chinese samples and genotyping coding variants in an independent set of 9756 Chinese samples. We carried out further targeted sequencing of CD36 in an additional 576 Chinese and Korean samples. We found that only 8 of 43 reported risk variants were polymorphic in our Chinese samples. We identified several heterozygotes for rare loss-of-function mutations, including the reported CD36 p.Gln74Ter variant, in both cases and controls. We also observed 2 potential compound heterozygotes among PD cases for rare loss-of-function mutations in CD36 and SSPO. The other reported variants were common in East Asians and not associated with PD, completely absent, or only found in controls. Therefore, the 33 reported candidate genes and associated variants are unlikely to confer significant PD risk in the East Asian population. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","CD36 antigen; CD36 antigen; Article; Asian; CD36 gene; Chinese; controlled study; evaluation study; gene; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic code; genetic variability; genotype; heterozygosity; human; Korean (people); loss of function mutation; major clinical study; Parkinson disease; population genetics; priority journal; SSPO gene; Asian continental ancestry group; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; heterozygote; Parkinson disease; risk; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; CD36 Antigens; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Heterozygote; Humans; Loss of Function Mutation; Parkinson Disease; Risk"
"Factors influencing the intention of Indonesian nursing students to work in rural areas",2019,"The aim of this study was to analyse the factors associated with the intention of Indonesian nursing students to work in rural areas. This was a cross-sectional study. The instrument used was a self-developed questionnaire consisting of 13 questions. The data were analysed using the χ 2 statistics test and binary logistic regression with a level of significance <0.05. The study was conducted at a public nursing school located in urban Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, in December 2017. A total of 714 nursing students from four different programmes were involved. This study found that almost 60% of nursing students were reluctant to work in rural areas. Of the three variables which were significant in the χ 2 analysis, only two were significant following the logistic regression test, namely the class programmes of undergraduate regulars (OR=2.274; 95% CI 1.326 to 3.900), profession regulars (OR=2.262; 95% CI 1.110 to 4.607) and rural place of origin (OR=1.405; 95% CI 1.036 to 1.906). The education programme and place of origin were associated with the intention of nursing students to work in rural areas. Therefore, the recruitment of prospective nurses should consider these factors by considering the local context. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"Pattern Matching for DNA Sequencing Data Using Multiple Bloom Filters",2019,"Storing and processing of large DNA sequences has always been a major problem due to increasing volume of DNA sequence data. However, a number of solutions have been proposed but they require significant computation and memory. Therefore, an efficient storage and pattern matching solution is required for DNA sequencing data. Bloom filters (BFs) represent an efficient data structure, which is mostly used in the domain of bioinformatics for classification of DNA sequences. In this paper, we explore more dimensions where BFs can be used other than classification. A proposed solution is based on Multiple Bloom Filters (MBFs) that finds all the locations and number of repetitions of the specified pattern inside a DNA sequence. Both of these factors are extremely important in determining the type and intensity of any disease. This paper serves as a first effort towards optimizing the search for location and frequency of substrings in DNA sequences using MBFs. We expect that further optimizations in the proposed solution can bring remarkable results as this paper presents a proof of concept implementation for a given set of data using proposed MBFs technique. Performance evaluation shows improved accuracy and time efficiency of the proposed approach. ? 2019 Maleeha Najam et al.","algorithm; Article; bioinformatics; chromosome 1; chromosome 12; chromosome 21; classification; DNA sequence; human; human chromosome; information storage; multiple bloom filter; biology; DNA sequence; measurement accuracy; probability; procedures; time factor; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Data Accuracy; Humans; Probability; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors"
"Predicting factors for survival of breast cancer patients using machine learning techniques",2019,"Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in women worldwide. Many studies have been conducted to predict the survival indicators, however most of these analyses were predominantly performed using basic statistical methods. As an alternative, this study used machine learning techniques to build models for detecting and visualising significant prognostic indicators of breast cancer survival rate. Methods: A large hospital-based breast cancer dataset retrieved from the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (n = 8066) with diagnosis information between 1993 and 2016 was used in this study. The dataset contained 23 predictor variables and one dependent variable, which referred to the survival status of the patients (alive or dead). In determining the significant prognostic factors of breast cancer survival rate, prediction models were built using decision tree, random forest, neural networks, extreme boost, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Next, the dataset was clustered based on the receptor status of breast cancer patients identified via immunohistochemistry to perform advanced modelling using random forest. Subsequently, the important variables were ranked via variable selection methods in random forest. Finally, decision trees were built and validation was performed using survival analysis. Results: In terms of both model accuracy and calibration measure, all algorithms produced close outcomes, with the lowest obtained from decision tree (accuracy = 79.8%) and the highest from random forest (accuracy = 82.7%). The important variables identified in this study were cancer stage classification, tumour size, number of total axillary lymph nodes removed, number of positive lymph nodes, types of primary treatment, and methods of diagnosis. Conclusion: Interestingly the various machine learning algorithms used in this study yielded close accuracy hence these methods could be used as alternative predictive tools in the breast cancer survival studies, particularly in the Asian region. The important prognostic factors influencing survival rate of breast cancer identified in this study, which were validated by survival curves, are useful and could be translated into decision support tools in the medical domain. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; artificial neural network; breast tumor; decision tree; female; human; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; support vector machine; Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Decision Trees; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neural Networks (Computer); Prognosis; Support Vector Machine"
"Partial remission in type 1 diabetes and associated factors: Analysis based on the insulin dose-adjusted hemoglobin A1c in children and adolescents from a regional diabetes center, Auckland, New Zealand",2019,"Background: Partial remission (PREM) by the insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) method has not been evaluated for the combined associations of ethnicity and socioeconomic status in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Objective: To investigate prevalence and predictors of PREM defined by IDAA1c. Methods: Six hundred fourteen of 678 children (aged <15 years) with new-onset T1D (2000-2013) from a regional pediatric diabetes service (Auckland, New Zealand). Results: Overall rate of PREM at 3 months was 42.4%, and lower in M?ori/Pacific children (28.6%; P =.006) and those of other ethnicities (28.8%; P =.030) compared with New Zealand Europeans (50.4%). Comparing the most and least deprived socioeconomic quintiles, the odds of PREM were lower among the most deprived (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.44; P =.019). Lower rates of PREM were seen in children aged 0 to 4.9 years (23.8%) and 10 to 14 years (40.9%) than in children aged 5 to 9.9 years (57.4%; P <.05). Further predictors of lower rates of PREM were ketoacidosis at diagnosis (aOR 0.54 with DKA; P =.002) and diabetes duration (aOR 0.84 per month; P <.0001). Patient's sex, body mass index standard deviation score, or autoantibodies were not associated with PREM. PREM at 3 months was associated with lower HbA1c over 18 months compared with children not in PREM (65.0 vs 71.3 mmol/mol; P <.0001), independent of ketoacidosis. Conclusions: This study on a regional cohort of youth with T1D showed social and ethnic disparities in rates of PREM defined by IDAA1c. Further research into reducing ketoacidosis rates at diagnosis and addressing factors associated with lower rates of PREM in non-European children are important health priorities. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Combined effects of knee brace, laterally wedged insoles, and toe-out gait on knee adduction moment and fall risk in moderate medial knee osteoarthritis patients",2019,"Background: Knee osteoarthritis is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. There is a need of reducing knee joint load and to improve balance and physical function among knee osteoarthritis patients. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that toe-out gait will reduce second peak knee adduction moment further and increase fall risk when combined with knee brace and laterally wedged insole in knee osteoarthritis patients. Study design: Single visit study with repeated measures. Methods: First and second peak knee adduction moments, fall risk and comfort level. First and second peak knee adduction moments were determined from three-dimensional gait analysis, completed under six randomized conditions: (1) natural, (2) knee brace, (3) knee brace + toe-out gait, (4) laterally wedged insole, (5) laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait, and (6) knee brace + laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait. Fall risk was assessed by Biodex Balance System using three randomized stability settings: (1) static, (2) moderate dynamic setting (FR12), and (3) high dynamic setting (FR8). Results: The reduction in first peak knee adduction moment and second peak knee adduction moment was greatest (7.16% and 25.55%, respectively) when toe-out gait combine with knee brace and laterally wedged insole. Significant increase in fall risk was observed with knee brace + laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait (42.85%) at FR12. Similar significant balance reductions were found at FR8 condition for knee brace + toe-out gait (35.71%), laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait (28.57%), and knee brace + laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait (50%) as compared to natural. However, knee brace decreased fall risk at FR12 by 28.57%. Conclusion: There is a synergistic effect of toe-out when combined with knee brace and laterally wedged insole concurrently in second peak knee adduction moment reduction but with a greater degree of fall risk. Simultaneous use of conservative treatments also decreases comfort level. Clinical relevance: Patients with mild and moderate knee osteoarthritis are usually prescribed conservative treatment techniques. This study will provide an insight whether or not a combination of these techniques have a synergistic effect in reducing knee joint load. ?

"Nucleoside analogs with selective antiviral activity against dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses",2019,"Dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are important arthropod-borne viruses from the Flaviviridae family. DENV is a global public health problem with significant social and economic impacts, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. JEV is a neurotropic arbovirus endemic to east and southeast Asia. There are no U.S. FDA-approved antiviral drugs available to treat or to prevent DENV and JEV infections, leaving nearly one-third of the world’s population at risk for infection. Therefore, it is crucial to discover potent antiviral agents against these viruses. Nucleoside analogs, as a class, are widely used for the treatment of viral infections. In this study, we discovered nucleoside analogs that possess potent and selective anti-JEV and anti-DENV activities across all serotypes in cell-based assay systems. Both viruses were susceptible to sugar-substituted 2=-C-methyl analogs with either cytosine or 7-deaza-7-fluoro-adenine nucleobases. Mouse studies confirmed the anti-DENV activity of these nucleoside analogs. Molecular models were assembled for DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) and JEV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase replication complexes bound to nucleotide inhibitors. These models show similarities between JEV and DENV-2, which recognize the same nucleotide inhibitors. Collectively, our findings provide promising compounds and a structural rationale for the development of direct-acting antiviral agents with dual activity against JEV and DENV infections.

"Exploiting the legacy of the arbovirus hunters",2019,"In recent years, it has become evident that a generational gap has developed in the community of arbovirus research. This apparent gap is due to the dis-investment of training for the next generation of arbovirologists, which threatens to derail the rich history of virus discovery, field epidemiology, and understanding of the richness of diversity that surrounds us. On the other hand, new technologies have resulted in an explosion of virus discovery that is constantly redefining the virosphere and the evolutionary relationships between viruses. This paradox presents new challenges that may have immediate and disastrous consequences for public health when yet to be discovered arboviruses emerge. In this review we endeavor to bridge this gap by providing a historical context for the work being conducted today and provide continuity between the generations. To this end, we will provide a narrative of the thrill of scientific discovery and excitement and the challenges lying ahead. ? 2019 by the authors.

"An analysis of the development assistance for health (DAH) allocations for STD control in Africa",2019,"The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations recognize the importance of making progress in the eradication and treatment of sexually transmitted deceases (STD). STD are among the most widespread diseases in the world and have the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study explored the associations between the allocation of the development assistance for health (DAH) in 54 African countries and key development indicators-STD incidence, Gross Domestic Product per capita, health expenditure, and life expectancy at birth. It employed descriptive statistical methods, the matrix scatter plot analysis and the Pearson correlation test for this purpose. The findings indicated that there was a considerable increase in the volume of the DAH given to control and prevent STD in Africa over the period of 2002-2011. A statistically significant positive association was detected between the STD incidence and the health aid allocations. At the same time, the imbalance in the distribution of the health aid between the major and minor aid recipients in the continent increased. The study concludes by discussing policy implications that can be drawn from these findings. Copyright ? Cambridge University Press 2019.",""
"Maternal, prenatal and traditional practice factors associated with perinatal mortality in Yemen",2019,"Background: Perinatal mortality remains a major international problem responsible for nearly six million stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Objectives: To estimate the perinatal mortality rate in Sana'a, Yemen and to identify risk factors for perinatal deaths. Methods: A community-based prospective cohort study was carried out between 2015 and 2016. Nine-hundred and eighty pregnant women were identified and followed up to 7 days following birth. A multi-stage cluster sampling was used to select participants from community households’, residing in the five districts of the Sana'a City, Yemen. Results: Total of 952 pregnant women were tracked up to 7 days after giving birth. The perinatal mortality rate, the stillbirth rate and the early neonatal mortality rate, were 89.3 per 1000, 46.2 per 1000 and 45.2 per 1000, respectively. In multivariable analysis older age (35+ years) of mothers at birth (Relative Risk = 2.83), teenage mothers’ age at first pregnancy (<18 years) (Relative Risk = 1.57), primipara mothers (Relative Risk = 1.90), multi-nuclear family (Relative Risk = 1.74), mud house (Relative Risk = 2.02), mothers who underwent female genital mutilation (Relative Risk = 2.92) and mothers who chewed khat (Relative Risk = 1.60) were factors associated with increased risk of perinatal death, whereas a positive mother's tetanus vaccination status (Relative Risk = 0.49) were significant protective factors against perinatal deaths. Conclusion: Rates of perinatal mortality were higher in Sana'a City compared to perinatal mortality at the national level estimated by World Health Organization. It is imperative there be sustainable interventions in order to improve the country's maternal and newborn health. ? 2018 Australian College of Midwives","adolescent mother; adult; Article; cohort analysis; disease association; female; female genital mutilation; follow up; health survey; human; live birth; major clinical study; male; maternal care; maternal death; newborn death; newborn mortality; outcome assessment; perinatal death; perinatal mortality; pregnant woman; prenatal care; primipara; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; stillbirth; tetanus prophylaxis; World Health Organization; Yemen; adolescent; epidemiology; pregnancy; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Perinatal Mortality; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stillbirth; Yemen; Young Adult"
"Heterogeneity of Colorectal Cancer Risk Factors by Anatomical Subsite in 10 European Countries: A Multinational Cohort Study",2019,"Background & Aims: Colorectal cancer located at different anatomical subsites may have distinct etiologies and risk factors. Previous studies that have examined this hypothesis have yielded inconsistent results, possibly because most studies have been of insufficient size to identify heterogeneous associations with precision. Methods: In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, we used multivariable joint Cox proportional hazards models, which accounted for tumors at different anatomical sites (proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum) as competing risks, to examine the relationships between 14 established/suspected lifestyle, anthropometric, and reproductive/menstrual risk factors with colorectal cancer risk. Heterogeneity across sites was tested using Wald tests. Results: After a median of 14.9 years of follow-up of 521,330 men and women, 6291 colorectal cancer cases occurred. Physical activity was related inversely to proximal colon and distal colon cancer, but not to rectal cancer (P heterogeneity = .03). Height was associated positively with proximal and distal colon cancer only, but not rectal cancer (P heterogeneity = .0001). For men, but not women, heterogeneous relationships were observed for body mass index (P heterogeneity = .008) and waist circumference (P heterogeneity = .03), with weaker positive associations found for rectal cancer, compared with proximal and distal colon cancer. Current smoking was associated with a greater risk of rectal and proximal colon cancer, but not distal colon cancer (P heterogeneity = .05). No heterogeneity by anatomical site was found for alcohol consumption, diabetes, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and reproductive/menstrual factors. Conclusions: The relationships between physical activity, anthropometry, and smoking with colorectal cancer risk differed by subsite, supporting the hypothesis that tumors in different anatomical regions may have distinct etiologies. ? 2019 AGA Institute","nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; alcohol consumption; anatomic landmark; anthropometry; Article; ascending colon; body mass; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cecum; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; descending colon; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug use; Europe; female; follow up; high risk patient; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; menstrual cycle; middle aged; physical activity; prevalence; rectum; rectum cancer; sex difference; smoking; tumor localization; tumor volume; waist circumference; waist hip ratio"
"Heptaplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the simultaneous detection of beef, buffalo, chicken, cat, dog, pork, and fish in raw and heat-treated food products",2019,"Species authentication of meat and fish products is crucial to safeguard public health, economic investment, and religious sanctity. We developed a heptaplex polymerase chain reaction assay targeting short amplicon length (73-198 bp) for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of cow, buffalo, chicken, cat, dog, pig, and fish species in raw and processed food using species-specific primers targeting mitochondrial cytb, ND5, and 16s rRNA genes. Assay validation of adulterated and various heat-treated meatball matrices showed excellent stability and sensitivity under all processing conditions. The detection limit was 0.01-0.001 ng of DNA under pure states and 0.5% meat in meatball products. Buffalo was detected in 86.7% (13 out of 15) of tested commercial beef products, while chicken, pork, and fish products were found to be pure. The developed assay was efficient enough to detect target species simultaneously, even in highly degraded and processed food products at reduced time. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Fish; Fish products; Food products; Mammals; Polymerase chain reaction; Processed foods; RNA; Thermal processing (foods); Amplicons; Detection limits; Heat treated foods; heptaplex PCR; Processing condition; Simultaneous detection; Species-specific primers; Target species; Meats; analysis; animal; bovine; buffalo; cat; chicken; dog; evaluation study; fish; food contamination; genetics; meat; pig; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; Animals; Buffaloes; Cats; Cattle; Chickens; Dogs; Fishes; Food Contamination; Meat Products; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Swine"
"Prevalence and risk factors of Strongyloides stercoralis infection among Orang Asli schoolchildren: New insights into the epidemiology, transmission and diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in Malaysia",2019,"This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of S. stercoralis infection among 1142 Orang Asli primary schoolchildren in six different states of Peninsular Malaysia. Fecal samples were examined using direct smear, formalin-ether sedimentation (FES), agar plate culture (APC) and PCR techniques. Overall, 15.8% of the children were found to be infected with S. stercoralis. The prevalence was 0.2, 1.3, 15.2 and 13.7% by direct smear, FES, APC and PCR, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that an age of >10 years, being male, belonging to a Proto-Malay tribe, belonging to the Senoi tribe, indiscriminate defecation, using an unimproved water source for drinking water and not wearing shoes when outside were the significant risk factors of infection among these children. In conclusion, we provide new evidence on the occurrence of S. stercoralis in Malaysia to show that there is a relatively high prevalence of infection among Orang Asli schoolchildren. Therefore, the use of specific methods for detecting S. stercoralis should be considered when screening these children for intestinal parasites. Moreover, prevention and control measures specific to S. stercoralis should be integrated into the intestinal parasitic infections control programme in Malaysia. ? 2019 Cambridge University Press.","agar; drinking water; Article; child; cross-sectional study; disease transmission; female; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; Orang Asli; personal hygiene; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; school child; sedimentation; strongyloidiasis; water supply"
"Potential anti-viral compounds from Malaysian Plant Natural Product Repository and Database (MyNature50000) for DENV2",2019,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a globally significant human pathogen that annually infects more than ?300 million of the Earth’s population. While the clinically approved anti-dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia is available for treating such infection, its treatment is limited to those infected with DENV of serotypes 3 and 4 only. However, the vaccine is no longer available to treat dengue infections following the suspended use of Dengvaxia after several discoveries on the side effects of the vaccine on humans. In view of this recent development, a collection of plant extracts in the MyNature50000 library showing potential anti-dengue activities were explored. In this work, the DENV2 NS2B-NS3 bioassay was setup and optimized to evaluate the potential inhibitory activity of plant extracts stored in the MyNature50000 natural product collections. A total of 150 plants were examined using the high-throughput screening assay, among which four candidate plants showed potential as inhibitors of the DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease, with exceptional inhibition activity &gt;95% with corresponding IC50 values ranging within 2 ? 5 ?g/mL. Two local plants, Syzygium campanulatum (‘Kelat Paya’) and Syzygium grande (‘Keriang Batu’), were phytochemically analyzed and the data revealed existence of cyclododecane, n-hexadecanoic acid and caryophyllene, all of which are compounds well-known for their inhibitory activity against DENV2 NS2B-NS3. Additionally, MTT assays showed that both plants were mildly cytotoxic on mammalian cell lines, with IC50 values &gt;20 ?g/mL, indicating their prospective use as drugs to combat DENV. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Biosensors Approach for Lung Cancer Diagnosis—A Review",2020,"Cancer is the number one cause of death around the world today, with the highest death rates among both men and women related to lung cancer. However, there is still a lack of awareness about early screening. Mortality rates have not yet reduced, and finding a way to lower them has become imperative. Attention must be paid to early-stage diagnosis of lung cancer in particular as the survival period has been extended. Over the years, screening modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scans (CT-scans), ultrasound machines, and positron emission tomography (PET) have been extensively employed; however, these techniques have some drawbacks, such as expense and the fact that they contain radioactive substances. Recently, sensor synchronizing in analysis is being used in early-stage screening due to its simplicity, portability, low cost, and ease of use. Biosensors have become the standard tools for cancer diagnosis in terms of medical application, and advanced development of sensors has been achieved. This review concisely outlines the research conducted into the application of biosensors on lung cancer. It concludes that the best and most used biosensor for early-phase lung cancer diagnosis is the electrochemical biosensor, which has been designed to bring significant benefits in portability, simplicity, reliability, non-invasiveness, cost-effectiveness, detection limit, sensitivity, and diagnostic specificity. Likewise, the attachment concerning towards the biorecognition element is much more considerable and substantial. ? Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",""
"Achieving the targets of sustainable development goals (2030 agenda) for congenital disorders in Asia: Bottlenecks and interventions",2019,"The United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in November 2015 which included a set of 17 measurable “sustainable development goals” (SDGs). The SDGs included targets to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age by 2030, universal health care coverage, reduction of premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by 33% as well as support the development and research for medicines for both communicable and NCDs. Although some successes were achieved in combating communicable diseases and improved childhood mortality rates, health systems in Asia are generally characterized by lack of accurate epidemiological information on congenital disorders, lack of human and financial resources, and inadequate focus on public health strategies to ensure targeted interventions, low level knowledge on congenital disorders amongst the community and healthcare providers and the ethical dilemma of managing rare congenital disorders in an environment of low national health expenditures. These bottlenecks must be addressed systematically and interventions such as the use of innovative epidemiological tools to overcome lack of data, increased efforts to standardize rare disease nomenclature and classification and renewed interest in birth defects registries by countries in the region must be considered. Targeted curative and public health approaches currently used in thalassaemia and neural tube defects may be used for other congenital disorders in Asian countries. The implementation of congenital disorders-related research, prevention, care, and treatment delivery services must be integrated into existing health systems in order to be effective to achieve the targets of SDG2030. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","folic acid; Asia; blood transfusion; childhood mortality; communicable disease; congenital disorder; diet supplementation; disease classification; disease registry; epidemiological data; financial management; genetic counseling; health care cost; health care delivery; health care system; health education; health insurance; human; information processing; iron chelation; medical ethics; medical research; medical terminology; neural tube defect; newborn mortality; non communicable disease; preimplantation genetic diagnosis; premature mortality; prenatal diagnosis; priority journal; public health service; Review; sustainable development; thalassemia"

"Treatment of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline",2019,"PURPOSE To provide resource-stratified, evidence-based recommendations on the treatment and follow-up of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer. METHODS ASCO convened a multidisciplinary, multinational Expert Panel that reviewed existing guidelines and conducted a modified ADAPTE process and a formal consensus process with additional experts for one round of formal ratings. RESULTS Existing sets of guidelines from 12 guideline developers were identified and reviewed; adapted recommendations from six guidelines form the evidence base and provide evidence to inform the formal consensus process, which resulted in agreement of 75% or more on all recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS For nonmaximal settings, the recommended treatments for colon cancer stages nonobstructing, I-IIA: in basic and limited, open resection; in enhanced, adequately trained surgeons and laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery, unless contraindicated. Treatments for IIB-IIC: in basic and limited, open en bloc resection following standard oncologic principles, if not possible, transfer to higher-level facility; in emergency, limit to life-saving procedures; in enhanced, laparoscopic en bloc resection, if not possible, then open. Treatments for obstructing, IIB-IIC: in basic, resection and/or diversion; in limited or enhanced, emergency surgical resection. Treatment for IIB-IIC with left-sided: in enhanced, may place colonic stent. Treatment for T4N0/T3N0 high-risk features or stage II high-risk obstructing: in enhanced, may offer adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment for rectal cancer cT1N0 and cT2n0: in basic, limited, or enhanced, total mesorectal excision principles. Treatment for cT3n0: in basic and limited, total mesorectal excision, if not, diversion. Treatment for high-risk patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy: in basic, limited, or enhanced, may offer adjuvant therapy. Treatment for resectable cT3N0 rectal cancer: in enhanced, base neoadjuvant chemotherapy on preoperative factors. For post-treatment surveillance, a combination of medical history, physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen testing, imaging, and endoscopy is performed. Frequency depends on setting.

"Intake of individual fatty acids and risk of prostate cancer in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition",2020,"The associations of individual dietary fatty acids with prostate cancer risk have not been examined comprehensively. We examined the prospective association of individual dietary fatty acids with prostate cancer risk overall, by tumor subtypes, and prostate cancer death. 142,239 men from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition who were free from cancer at recruitment were included. Dietary intakes of individual fatty acids were estimated using center-specific validated dietary questionnaires at baseline and calibrated with 24-h recalls. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After an average follow-up of 13.9 years, 7,036 prostate cancer cases and 936 prostate cancer deaths were ascertained. Intakes of individual fatty acids were not related to overall prostate cancer risk. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the association of some short chain saturated fatty acids with prostate cancer risk by tumor stage (pheterogeneity &lt; 0.015), with a positive association with risk of advanced stage disease for butyric acid (4:0; HR1SD = 1.08; 95%CI = 1.01–1.15; p-trend = 0.026). There were no associations with fatal prostate cancer, with the exception of a slightly higher risk for those who consumed more eicosenoic acid (22:1n-9c; HR1SD = 1.05; 1.00–1.11; p-trend = 0.048) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3c; HR1SD = 1.07; 1.00–1.14; p-trend = 0.045). There was no evidence that dietary intakes of individual fatty acids were associated with overall prostate cancer risk.

"Prevalence of obesity and its associated risk factors among post- basic renal care nursing students",2019,"Obesity is one of the most common, yet among the most neglected, public health problems around the world and it is strongly associated with various non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery diseases. Health care personal especially nurses play an important role in educating public to have healthy lifestyle. However, there is an alarming rate of increase in number of obesity among nursing students as well as staff nurses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the anthropometric measurements and its associated risks among post-basic renal care nursing students. Total of 142 post-basic renal care nursing students of five intakes were included in this cross-sectional study. The result of the study showed that 52% of participants were either overweight or obese although most of them were below 40 years of age. Majority of overweight or obese students were Malays and 78% of them being female. We also observed an association of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and waist circumference (WC)with increasing body mass index (BMI) (P= 0.001, P= 0.001 and P < 0.001) which were statistically significant. Wald criterion estimated that WC and DBP were the most important predictors of BMI in present study. Our study concluded that obesity is prevalent among post-basic renal care nursing students. Urgent and appropriate action should be taken to deter the growing problem of obesity among nursing students and to avoid its subsequent complications in Malaysia. ? 2019, Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association.",""
"Effects of vitamin D on disease activity and serum interleukin-6 in rheumatoid arthritis",2019,"Aim: Vitamin D 3 or 25(OH)D 3 may have a potential role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6). The aim of this study is to determine the clinical factors of vitamin D deficiency in multi-ethnic Malaysian RA patients and its association with disease activity, functional disability and serum IL-6 levels. Method: One hundred RA patients and 50 healthy controls, sex- and age-matched, were recruited. Disease Activity Score of 28 joints and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were assessed. Baseline serum 25(OH)D 3 and IL-6 were measured in all subjects. RA patients who were vitamin D deficient were given loading doses of vitamin D 3 and repeated assessments were done. Results: Vitamin D deficiency (&lt;50?nmol/L) was found in 63% of RA patients and 76% of healthy controls. Chinese RA patients and healthy controls had significantly more sufficient 25(OH)D 3 levels compared to Malays and Indians (P?&lt;?0.001). Serum 25(OH)D 3 level was still negatively associated with body mass index in RA patients (P?=?0.002) after adjustment for potential confounding variables. No significant association was seen between 25(OH)D 3 levels and disease activity or serum IL-6 levels in both pre- and post-treatment groups. A negative association was observed between serum 25(OH)D 3 and functional disability, including a 33% improvement post-treatment (mean?±?SD: 0.30?±?0.46 to 0.20?±?0.18). Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in Malaysian RA patients.

The authors present a case of a 5-year old boy with a 4-day history of fever, sore throat and painful cervical lymphadenopathy, whose clinical progression worsened despite being treated with recommended antibiotics as per WHO guidelines once the diagnosis of Tularaemia was confirmed by serologic tests. He developed a parapharyngeal abscess and a persistent left necrotic cervical lymph node, which both were surgically drained and excised, respectively, and an extended course of antibiotic was given. Subsequently, the patient fully recovered from the illness and the follow-up was negative for relapse. ? BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

"Volatile anesthetics versus total intravenous anesthesia for cardiac surgery",2019,"BACKGROUND Volatile (inhaled) anesthetic agents have cardioprotective effects, which might improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS We conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, single-blind, controlled trial at 36 centers in 13 countries. Patients scheduled to undergo elective CABG were randomly assigned to an intraoperative anesthetic regimen that included a volatile anesthetic (desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane) or to total intravenous anesthesia. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 1 year. RESULTS A total of 5400 patients were randomly assigned: 2709 to the volatile anesthetics group and 2691 to the total intravenous anesthesia group. On-pump CABG was performed in 64% of patients, with a mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass of 79 minutes. The two groups were similar with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, and the number of grafts. At the time of the second interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board advised that the trial should be stopped for futility. No significant difference between the groups with respect to deaths from any cause was seen at 1 year (2.8% in the volatile anesthetics group and 3.0% in the total intravenous anesthesia group; relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 1.29; P=0.71), with data available for 5353 patients (99.1%), or at 30 days (1.4% and 1.3%, respectively; relative risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.76), with data available for 5398 patients (99.9%). There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the secondary outcomes or in the incidence of prespecified adverse events, including myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing elective CABG, anesthesia with a volatile agent did not result in significantly fewer deaths at 1 year than total intravenous anesthesia.

"Induction of apoptosis by chalepin through phosphatidylserine externalisations and DNA fragmentation in breast cancer cells (MCF7)",2019,"Aims: Chalepin, a naturally occurring compound isolated from Ruta angustifolia have been shown to exert a promising anticancer activity through various mechanisms. Hence, the need to investigate the apoptotic inducing ability of chalepin in MCF7 cells by various detection assays. Materials and methods: Cytotoxicity screening of chalepin against MCF7 cells was conducted using SRB assay. Apoptosis induction was examined by established morphological and biochemical assays including phase contrast and Hoechst/PI staining fluorescence microscope. Similarly, Annexin-V/FITC and TUNEL assays were conducted using flow cytometry whereas caspase-3 activity was evaluated using microplate reader. Key findings: The result indicates remarkable cytotoxic activity against MCF7 cells, whereas it shows moderate cytotoxic activity against MDA-MB231 cells. Interestingly, chalepin did not present any toxicity against MRC5 normal cell line. Morphological examination using both phase contrast and fluorescence microscope displays typical apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and apoptotic bodies’ formation following chalepin treatment against MCF7 cells at different concentration for 48 h. Apoptosis induction is significantly associated with externalisation of phosphatidylserine, and DNA fragmentation in MCF7 cells chalepin treated cells when compared with control. The protein expressions of caspase-8, 9 and cleaved PARP1 were upregulated which correlated well with increased caspase-3 activity. Significance: From our recent findings, chalepin was able to induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells and therefore, could be evaluated further as a potential source of anticancer agent for cancer treatment such as breast cancer. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; chalepin; doxorubicin; fluorescein isothiocyanate; lipocortin 5; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; phosphatidylserine; unclassified drug; chalepin; furocoumarin derivative; phosphatidylserine; plant extract; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell structure; chromatin condensation; controlled study; DNA fragmentation; drug cytotoxicity; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; human; human cell; IC50; MAPK signaling; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231-BR cell line; MRC-5 cell line; phase contrast microscopy; proapoptotic activity; protein expression; TUNEL assay; upregulation; apoptosis; breast tumor; cell proliferation; DNA fragmentation; drug effect; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; tumor cell line; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; DNA Fragmentation; Furocoumarins; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Phosphatidylserines; Plant Extracts; Up-Regulation"
"Labor market returns to education and english language skills in the people’s republic of China: An update",2019,"We reexamine the economic returns to education in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) using data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2010. We find that the conventional ordinary least squares estimate of wage returns to schooling is 7.8%, while the instrumental variable estimate is 20.9%. The gains from schooling rise sharply with higher levels of education. The estimated returns are 12.2% in urban provinces and 10.7% in coastal provinces, higher than in rural and inland areas. In addition, the wage premium for workers with good English skills (speaking and listening) is 30%. These results are robust to controls for height, body mass index, and English language skills, and to corrections for sample selection bias. Our findings, together with a critical review of existing studies, confirm the growing significance of human capital as a determinant of labor market performance in postreform PRC. ? 2019 Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute.","health status; human capital; labor market; language; least squares method; returns to education; skilled labor; wage; China"

"Amplification-free and direct fluorometric determination of telomerase activity in cell lysates using chimeric DNA-templated silver nanoclusters",2019,"A fluorogenic probe has been developed for determination of telomerase activity using chimeric DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (AgNCs). The formation of AgNCs was investigated before (route A) and after (route B) telomerase elongation reaction. Both routes caused selective quenching of the yellow emission of the AgNCs (best measured at excitation/emission wavelength of 470/557?nm) in telomerase-positive samples. The quenching mechanism was studied using synthetically elongated DNA to mimic the telomerase-catalyzed elongation. The findings show that quenching is due to the formation of parallel G-quadruplexes with a –TTA– loop in the telomerase elongated products. The assay was validated using different cancer cell extracts, with intra- and interassay coefficients of variations of <9.8%. The limits of detection for MCF7, RPMI 2650 and HT29 cell lines are 15, 22 and 39 cells/μL. This represents a distinct improvement over the existing telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay in terms of time, sensitivity and cost.

"Potential antimicrobial applications of chitosan nanoparticles (ChNP)",2019,"Polymeric nanoparticles are widely used for drug delivery due to their biodegradability property. Among the wide array of polymers, chitosan has received growing interest among researchers. It was widely used as a vehicle in polymeric nanoparticles for drug targeting. This review explored the current research on the antimicrobial activity of chitosan nanoparticles (ChNP) and the impact on the clinical applications. The antimicrobial activities of ChNP were widely reported against bacteria, fungi, yeasts and algae, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. For pharmaceutical applications, ChNP were used as antimicrobial coating for promoting wound healing, preventing infections and combating the rise of infectious disease. Besides, ChNP also exhibited significant inhibitory activities on foodborne microorganisms, particularly on fruits and vegetables. It is noteworthy that ChNP can be also applied to deliver antimicrobial drugs, which further enhance the efficiency and stability of the antimicrobial agent. The present review addresses the potential antimicrobial applications of ChNP from these few aspects. ? 2019 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.","biopolymer; chitosan nanoparticle; copper ion; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; gelatin; isoniazid; montmorillonite; protein; small interfering RNA; tripolyphosphate; antiinfective agent; biomaterial; chitosan; drug carrier; nanoparticle; polymer; antiinfective agent; chitosan nanoparticle; antibacterial activity; antifungal activity; antimicrobial activity; Article; Aspergillus parasiticus; bacteriostatic activity; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli O157; Fusarium graminearum; human; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MIC50; molecular weight; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; particle size; pH; Rhizopus stolonifer; Staphylococcus aureus; static electricity; Streptococcus mutans; surface property; sustained drug release; thermostability; zeta potential; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; fungus; nanotechnology; biodegradability; drug efficacy; drug safety; infection prevention; minimum inhibitory concentration; pharmacological procedures; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacteria; Biocompatible Materials; Chitosan; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Fungi; Humans; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Polymers"
"Prognostic biomarkers in renal cell carcinoma: Is there a relationship with obesity?",2019,"Obesity is a recognized risk factor for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the commonest form of kidney cancer. Both obesity and RCC are serious diseases with increasing incidence yearly. This review examined certain obesity associated measurements and adipokines as detection/prognostic indicators for RCC. The obesity related measurements such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumstance (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR) in predicting RCC are valid when used in conjunction with other risk factors such as age and sex or with histological findings. The adipokine adiponectin holds promising outcomes as a predictive marker in assessing the risk of developing RCC. In addition, tissue leptin/leptin receptor may be a distinguishing marker for RCC subtypes. However, circulating leptin may not be a suitable detection or prognostic biomarker for RCC. The other less investigated adipokines; omentin, visfatin, apelin and resistin are also expressed in RCC but their prognostic capabilities are still inconclusive. BMI, WC and adipokines may be useful additions in a nomogram which includes TNM staging and pathological grading system to detect, confirm and follow-up RCC cases. ?

"Correlation between body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness in female adults of different Body Mass Index",2019,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has become a major public concern as it leads to significant health risk and economic burden especially to the developing countries. The prevalence of obesity is also significantly higher among the female adults. It is also known that low fitness level is a powerful and independent risk factor for premature mortality. However, the understanding of the relationship between overall body composition indices and cardiorespiratory fitness in adults remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between body composition with cardiorespiratory fitness among normal weight, overweight and obese in female adults. METHODS: Eighty-one female participants aged between 18 to 59 years who cleared the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into three groups; normal weight (N.=23), overweight (N.=29) and obese (N.=29). They went through bio-electrical impedance analysis measurement and cardiopulmonary fitness testing using ramp protocol in Sport Medicine human performance lab. RESULTS: It was noted that there was an inverse strong strength significant correlation between VO 2 max and Body Mass Index (r=-0.588, P&lt;0.001, Waist Hip Ratio (r=-0.596, P&lt;0.001), Percentage Body Fat (r=-0.684, P&lt;0.001) and Body Fat Mass (r=-0.667, P&lt;0.001). However, skeletal muscle mass showed no significant correlation with VO 2 max. There was also a high significant difference among the three groups in term of VO 2 max (F=7.683, P=0.001) after alleviating the age factor. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study showed significant correlation between VO 2 and body composition particularly percentage of body fat (%) and body fat mass (kg). It will be more convenience and cost-effective especially in developing countries, if body composition can be used as an independent entity to predict cardiorespiratory fitness among individual. Furthermore, cardiorespiratory exercise testing showed significant differences of VO 2 max among 3 groups. This will be beneficial if the VO 2 max is used as a tool to predict cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we would suggest in-depth studies to be done in the future to provide more knowledge regarding this important topic on a bigger scale subjects. ? 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","adult; anthropometry; Article; body composition; body fat; body mass; cardiorespiratory fitness; cross-sectional study; ergometry; exercise test; female; human; impedance; middle aged; muscle mass; normal human; obesity; oxygen consumption; skeletal muscle; waist hip ratio; young adult"
"Recommendations for improving clinical trial design to facilitate the study of youth-onset type 2 diabetes",2020,"Background: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing in youths and differs from adult-onset type 2 diabetes in its characteristics and progression. Currently, only two drugs are approved for youth-onset type 2 diabetes and many patients are not meeting glycemic targets. Clearly, there is an urgent need to complete clinical trials in youths with type 2 diabetes to increase the therapeutic choice for these patients. However, factors such as limited patient numbers, unwillingness of patients to participate in trials, failure to meet strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and poor clinic attendance have limited the size and number of trials in this complicated patient demographic. Recommendations: This is a narrative opinion piece on the design of clinical trials in youth-onset type 2 diabetes prepared by researchers who undertake this type of study in different countries. The review addresses possible ways to enhance trial designs in youth-onset type 2 diabetes to meet regulatory requirements, while minimizing the barriers to patients’ participation. The definition of adolescence, recruitment of sufficient patient numbers, increasing flexibility in selection criteria, improving convenience of trial visits, requirements of a control group, possible endpoints, and trial compliance are all considered. The authors recommend allowing extrapolation from adult data, using multiple interventional arms within future trials, broadening inclusion criteria, and focusing on endpoints beyond glucose control, among others, in order to improve the successful completion of more trials in this population. Conclusions: Improvements in trial design will enable better recruitment and retention and thereby more evidence for treatment outcomes for youth-onset type 2 diabetes. ?

"Prevalence and correlates of physical inactivity among older adults in Malaysia: Findings from the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015",2019,"Malaysia has an increasingly aging population. Despite the substantial benefits of physical activity for healthy aging, older adults are considered the most physically inactive segment of the Malaysian population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of physical inactivity among older adults in Malaysia and its correlates. We analysed data on adults aged ?60 years (n = 3790) from the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015, a cross-sectional, nationwide population-based survey covering information on socio-demographic characteristics, physical activity and other lifestyle-related variables, health conditions, and functional limitations. Individuals included in this study were classified as physically active or physically inactive. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with physical inactivity. The overall prevalence of physical inactivity among older adults aged ?60 years old was 48.8%. Physical inactivity was significantly more prevalent among females, older age groups, Indians, those being single/widowed/divorced, those with no formal education, those who reported high sedentary time (?7 h/day), those with diabetes, anaemia, and functional limitations (p < 0.001). In fully adjusted analyses, females, older age, high household income (?MYR4000), inadequate fruits and vegetables consumption (<5 servings/day), high sedentary time, having diabetes, and having mobility impairment were all associated with physical inactivity. Approximately half of the Malaysian older population are physically inactive. Identifying the correlates of physical inactivity among Malaysian older adults will help to develop public health policies and interventions that encourage active living among older people and promote healthy aging in Malaysia. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","age distribution; aged; Article; cognitive defect; communication disorder; diabetes mellitus; divorced person; educational status; female; fruit; hearing impairment; household income; human; Indian; Malaysian; male; physical inactivity; prevalence; priority journal; sex ratio; single (marital status); sitting; unhealthy diet; vegetable; very elderly; visual impairment; walking difficulty; widowed person; age; anemia; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diet; health survey; income; Malaysia; marriage; middle aged; sex factor; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anemia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Educational Status; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Malaysia; Male; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Mobility Limitation; Prevalence; Sedentary Behavior; Sex Factors"
"Effect of different habitat types on abundance and biting times of Anopheles balabacensis Baisas (Diptera: Culicidae) in Kudat district of Sabah, Malaysia",2019,"Background: We investigated the effect of five common habitat types on the diversity and abundance of Anopheles spp. and on the biting rate and time of Anopheles balabacensis (currently the only known vector for Plasmodium knowlesi in Sabah) at Paradason village, Kudat, Sabah. The habitats were forest edge, playground area, longhouse, oil palm plantation and shrub-bushes area. Sampling of Anopheles was done monthly using the human landing catch method in all habitat types for 14 months (October 2013 to December 2014, excluding June 2014). The Anopheles species were morphologically identified and subjected to PCR assay for the detection of Plasmodium parasites. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) were applied to test the variation in abundance and biting rates of An. balabacensis in different habitat types. Results: A total of 1599 Anopheles specimens were collected in the village, of which about 90% were An. balabacensis. Anopheles balabacensis was present throughout the year and was the dominant Anopheles species in all habitat types. The shrub bushes habitat had the highest Anopheles species diversity while forest edge had the greatest number of Anopheles individuals caught. GLMM analysis indicated that An. balabacensis abundance was not affected by the type of habitats, and it was more active during the early and late night compared to predawn and dawn. PCR assay showed that 1.61% of the tested An. balabacensis were positive for malaria parasites, most of which were caught in oil palm estates and infected with one to two Plasmodium species. Conclusions: The identification of infected vectors in a range of habitats, including agricultural and farming areas, illustrates the potential for humans to be exposed to P. knowlesi outside forested areas. This finding contributes to a growing body of evidence implicating environmental changes due to deforestation, expansion of agricultural and farming areas, and development of human settlements near to forest fringes in the emergence of P. knowlesi in Sabah. ? 2019 The Author(s).","palm oil; agricultural land; animal experiment; animal tissue; Anopheles; Anopheles balabacensis; Article; controlled study; deforestation; environmental management; forest; mosquito bite; nonhuman; parasite identification; Plasmodium knowlesi; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; Sabah; shrub; species diversity; species habitat; species identification; animal; Anopheles; ecosystem; insect bite; isolation and purification; malaria; Malaysia; mosquito vector; parasitology; physiology; statistical model; Animals; Anopheles; Ecosystem; Forests; Insect Bites and Stings; Linear Models; Malaria; Malaysia; Mosquito Vectors; Plasmodium knowlesi"
"Experimental methodologies and diagnostic procedures for acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND)",2019,"Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an emerging disease that has caused mass mortality in shrimp in many countries in Asia and South America. A new strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VpAHPND), carrying one or more extrachromosomal ~70 kbp plasmids that encode homologues of the Photorhabdus insect-related (Pir) binary toxins (PirAvp and PirBvp) is the causative agent of AHPND. Bioassay challenges using immersion, reverse gavage and per os (feeding) treatments have been shown to induce the pathology characteristics of AHPND in experimentally infected shrimp. Moreover, a number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have been found to facilitate early detection of the disease. However, non-V. parahaemolyticus species close to Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio owensii and Vibrio campbellii have recently been identified as carrying pVA1-like plasmids, signifying that these plasmids are capable of being transmitted to different Vibrio species. AHPND is thus a threat and a serious concern for the aquaculture industry. Against this background, this paper presents an overview of experimental methodologies and diagnostic procedures for AHPND. It also includes fundamental findings related to the disease as guidelines which may be useful for further experimental work on AHPND and other similar shrimp diseases. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","aquaculture industry; bacterial disease; bioassay; crustacean; detection method; infectious disease; mass mortality; methodology; pathogen; pathology; plasmid; toxin; Asia; South America; Decapoda (Crustacea); Hexapoda; Photorhabdus; Vibrio; Vibrio campbellii; Vibrio harveyi; Vibrio parahaemolyticus"

We report four cases of difficult airway encountered in our district hospital from November 2017 to December 2018, in which intubation was performed using a simple manoeuvre called supine left head rotation (LeHeR). In all these cases, LeHeR manoeuvre has proven to be successful after more than a single attempt at intubation using various methods. The manoeuvre improves drastically the laryngoscopic view of Cormack-Lehane from 3B and 4 to 1 and 2. ? 2019 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","adult; airway; anesthesia; article; case report; clinical article; emergency medicine; female; head movement; human; intubation; male; pediatrics; public hospital; resuscitation; adverse event; endotracheal intubation; fatality; infant; laryngoscopy; patient positioning; preschool child; procedures; respiration control; Adult; Airway Management; Child, Preschool; Fatal Outcome; Female; Humans; Infant; Intubation, Intratracheal; Laryngoscopy; Male; Patient Positioning"
"Diagnosing metabolic syndrome using genetically optimised Bayesian ARTMAP",2019,"Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) constitutes of metabolic abnormalities that lead to non-communicable diseases, such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Early and accurate diagnosis of this abnormality is required to prevent its further progression to these diseases. This paper aims to diagnose the risk of MetS using a new non-clinical approach called 'genetically optimized Bayesian adaptive resonance theory mapping' (GOBAM). We evolve the Bayesian adaptive resonance theory mapping (BAM) by using genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of BAM and its training input sequence. We use the GOBAM algorithm to classify individuals as either being at risk of MetS or not at risk of MetS with a related posterior probability, which ranges between 0 and 1. A data set of 11 237 Malaysians from the CLUSTer study stratified by age and gender into four subcategories was used to evaluate the proposed GOBAM algorithm. The comparative evaluation of our results suggested that the GOBAM performs significantly better than other classical adaptive resonance theory mapping models on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and others criteria. Our algorithm gives an AUC of 86.42 %, 87.04 %, 91.08 %, and 89.24 % for the young female, middle aged female, young male, and middle-aged male subcategories, respectively. The proposed model can be used to support medical practitioners in accurate and early diagnosis of MetS. ? 2013 IEEE.","Computer science; Diagnosis; Diseases; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mapping; Metabolism; Principal component analysis; Resonance; Adaptive resonance theory; Bayes method; Bayesian; Metabolic syndromes; Sociology; Clustering algorithms"
"Patient-reported outcome measures among breast cancer survivors: A cross-sectional comparison between Malaysia and high-income countries",2019,"Objectives: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in high-income countries (HICs) suggest that physical, emotional, and psychological needs are important in cancer care. To date, there have been few inconsistent descriptions of PROs in low-income and middle-income Asian countries. Using a standard questionnaire developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM), we compared the perceived importance of PROs between patients in Malaysia and those in HICs and between clusters of Malaysian women. Methods: Breast cancer patients were recruited from three Malaysian hospitals between June and November 2017. We compared the proportion of patients who rated PROs as very important (scored 7-9 on a 9-point Likert scale) between Malaysian patients and data collected from patients in HICs via the ICHOM questionnaire development process, using logistic regression. A two-step cluster analysis explored differences in PROs among Malaysian patients. Results: The most important PROs for both cohorts were survival, overall well-being, and physical functioning. Compared with HIC patients (n?=?1177), Malaysian patients (n?=?969) were less likely to rate emotional (78% vs 90%), cognitive (76% vs 84%), social (72% vs 81%), and sexual (30% vs 56%) functioning as very important outcomes (P?<?0.001). Cluster analysis suggests that older, parous, Malaysian women, who were less likely to have received breast reconstructive surgery, were more likely to rate body image and satisfaction with the breast as very important outcomes. Conclusion: Taking into account the differences in PROs by cultural and socioeconomic settings could improve patient expectation of services and refine the assessment of cancer care outcomes. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; aged; anxiety; Article; body image; breast cancer; cancer pain; cancer survival; cancer survivor; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; emotion; female; high income country; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; patient-reported outcome; physical performance; psychological well-being; questionnaire; reconstructive surgery; recurrence free survival; sexuality; social interaction; vasomotor disorder; breast tumor; cancer survivor; coping behavior; developing country; income; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; self concept; socioeconomics; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Body Image; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developed Countries; Female; Humans; Income; Malaysia; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Quality of Life; Self Concept; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity abnormalities in Guillain–Barr? syndrome: a pilot study",2019,"Objective: The current study aimed to investigate autonomic dysfunction in Guillain–Barr? syndrome (GBS) patients and describe the results of computational heart rate variability (HRV)/baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and autonomic challenge tests. Methods: GBS patients were consecutively recruited and the results were compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. A series of autonomic function tests including computation-dependent tests (power spectrum analysis of HRV and BRS at rest) and challenge maneuvers (deep breathing, eyeball compression, active standing, the Valsalva maneuver, sustained handgrip, and the cold pressor test) were performed. Results: Ten GBS patients (six men; mean age = 40.1 ± 13.9?years) and ten gender- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. The mean GBS functional grading scale at disease plateau was 3.4 ± 1.0. No patients required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. Low-frequency HRV (p = 0.027), high-frequency HRV (p = 0.008), and the total power spectral density of HRV (p = 0.015) were significantly reduced in patients compared to controls. The mean up slope (p = 0.034), down slope (p = 0.011), and total slope (p = 0.024) BRS were significantly lower in GBS patients. The diastolic rise in blood pressure in the cold pressor test was significantly lower in GBS patients compared to controls (p = 0.008). Interpretation: Computation-dependent tests (HRV and BRS) were more useful for detecting autonomic dysfunction in GBS patients, whereas the cold pressor test was the only reliable challenge test, making it useful as a bedside measure of autonomic function in GBS patients. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; aged; Article; autonomic dysfunction; clinical article; cold pressor test; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; eyeball; female; function test; Guillain Barre syndrome; hand grip; heart rate variability; human; hyperpnea; intensive care unit; male; pilot study; pressoreceptor reflex; provocation test; standing; Valsalva maneuver"
"Malabaricone C as Natural Sphingomyelin Synthase Inhibitor against Diet-Induced Obesity and Its Lipid Metabolism in Mice",2019,"The interaction between natural occurring inhibitors and targeted membrane proteins could be an alternative medicinal strategy for the treatment of metabolic syndrome, notably, obesity. In this study, we identified malabaricones A-C and E (1-4) isolated from the fruits of Myristica cinnamomea King as natural inhibitors for sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), a membrane protein responsible for sphingolipid biosynthesis. Having the most promising inhibition, oral administration of compound 3 exhibited multiple efficacies in reducing weight gain, improving glucose tolerance, and reducing hepatic steatosis in high fat diet-induced obesity mice models. Liver lipid analysis revealed a crucial link between the SMS activities of compound 3 and its lipid metabolism in vitro and in vivo. The nontoxic nature of compound 3 makes it a suitable candidate in search of drugs which can be employed in the treatment and prevention of obesity. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","glucose; malabaricone A; malabaricone B; malabaricone C; malabaricone D; malabaricone E; Myristica cinnamomea fruit extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; body weight loss; controlled study; diet-induced obesity; drug efficacy; drug isolation; fatty liver; glucose tolerance; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid analysis; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal"
"Nail bed and flap reconstructions for acute fingertip injuries – A case review and report of a chemical burn injury",2019,"Nail bed injuries were commonly found concomitantly with fingertip injuries. Reconstruction of fingertip including the nail bed should be attempted at acute stage. Aim of the surgery was to restore as much finger length and achieve normal nail growth. In chemical burns, the initial presentation might not reflect the exact extent of injury. Appropriate acute management must be initiated while waiting for demarcation. We report a case of young stewardess who presented with fingertip chemical burn injury. Surgical debridement was done on third day post-injury. A cross-finger flap to cover skin defect and split-thickness nail bed grafting from the remnant of injured finger were done. Excellent functional and cosmetic outcome was achieved in 6 months. Surgical treatment in a chemical burn was similar to traumatic injury. Nail bed graft was the best option for nail bed reconstruction. In cases of soft tissue loss, advancement or pedicle flaps are beneficial. ?

"Socioeconomic effect of education on pancreatic cancer risk in western Europe: An update on the EPIC cohorts study",2019,"Background: To analyze the potential effect of social inequality on pancreatic cancer risk in Western Europe, by reassessing the association within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study, including a larger number of cases and an extended follow-up. Methods: Data on highest education attained were gathered for 459,170 participants (70% women) from 10 European countries. A relative index of inequality (RII) based on adult education was calculated for comparability across countries and generations. Cox regression models were applied to estimate relative inequality in pancreatic cancer risk, stratifying by age, gender, and center, and adjusting for known pancreatic cancer risk factors. Results: A total of 1,223 incident pancreatic cancer cases were included after a mean follow-up of 13.9 (4.0) years. An inverse social trend was found in models adjusted for age, sex, and center for both sexes [HR of RII, 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.59], which was also significant among women (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05-1.92). Further adjusting by smoking intensity, alcohol consumption, body mass index, prevalent diabetes, and physical activity led to an attenuation of the RII risk and loss of statistical significance. Conclusions: The present reanalysis does not sustain the existence of an independent social inequality influence on pancreatic cancer risk in Western European women and men, using an index based on adult education, the most relevant social indicator linked to individual lifestyles, in a context of very low pancreatic cancer survival from (quasi) universal public health systems. Impact: The results do not support an association between education and risk of pancreatic cancer. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","somatomedin binding protein 3; somatomedin C; adult; adult education; age; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; cancer risk; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; family history; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; pancreas cancer; physical activity; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; social status; socioeconomics; Western Europe"
"Anthropometric and reproductive factors and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer by subtype and subsite: Results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort",2020,"Obesity has been associated with upper gastrointestinal cancers; however, there are limited prospective data on associations by subtype/subsite. Obesity can impact hormonal factors, which have been hypothesized to play a role in these cancers. We investigated anthropometric and reproductive factors in relation to esophageal and gastric cancer by subtype and subsite for 476,160 participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox models. During a mean follow-up of 14 years, 220 esophageal adenocarcinomas (EA), 195 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 243 gastric cardia (GC) and 373 gastric noncardia (GNC) cancers were diagnosed. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with EA in men (BMI ?30 vs. 18.5–25 kg/m2: HR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.25–3.03) and women (HR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.15–6.19); however, adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) attenuated these associations. After mutual adjustment for BMI and HC, respectively, WHR and waist circumference (WC) were associated with EA in men (HR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.99–6.06 for WHR &gt;0.96 vs. &lt;0.91; HR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.52–4.72 for WC &gt;98 vs. &lt;90 cm) and women (HR = 4.40, 95% CI: 1.35–14.33 for WHR &gt;0.82 vs. &lt;0.76; HR = 5.67, 95% CI: 1.76–18.26 for WC &gt;84 vs. &lt;74 cm). WHR was also positively associated with GC in women, and WC was positively associated with GC in men. Inverse associations were observed between parity and EA (HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14–0.99; &gt;2 vs. 0) and age at first pregnancy and GNC (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32–0.91; &gt;26 vs. &lt;22 years); whereas bilateral ovariectomy was positively associated with GNC (HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.04–3.36).

"Hepatitis B virus infection: Epidemiology and seroprevalence rate amongst negrito tribe in Malaysia",2019,"Introduction: Prevalence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among the non-indigenous people in Malaysia has been well established and range between 3% and 5%. However, data from the indigenous (Orang Asli) people is still lacking. The Negrito population is the most remotely located Orang Asli tribe with limited access to health care facilities. This study was undertaken to determine the epidemiology and seroprevalence of HBV infection among the Negrito. Methods: Surveys were conducted in five Negrito settlements in Kelantan and Perak states in Malaysia. A total of 150 participants were recruited. Clinical history was taken and physical examination was performed. Five millilitres of whole blood were collected and tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Results: Participants were mainly from the Bateq (49.3%) and Mendriq (29.4%) sub-tribes. Overall, 13 subjects (8.7 %); nine males and four females were HBsAg positive. Nine of the HBsAg positive subjects were ?35 years old. All of them had history of home deliver without evidence of antenatal record. Six (46%) of the HBsAg positive subjects had tattoo and body piercing in the past. Conclusion: The prevalence of HBV infection rate amongst the Negrito tribe is almost three-fold compared to the national rates. The reason for this finding remains unclear. Tattooing, body piercing and vertical transmission could be the main possible routes of transmission of HBV among the Negrito population in Malaysia. ? 2019, Malaysian Medical Association.

"Low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polypols diet and irritable bowel syndrome in Asia",2019,"Functional bowel disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are a chronic condition that can significantly reduce patients’ quality of life. Therefore, this paper will review the roles of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polypols (FODMAP) diet in treating IBS, particularly in an Asian setting. About 20% of the general population is diagnosed with IBS. However, there are limited effective medical therapies available for treating IBS. Therefore, IBS presents a major challenge to the health-care providers. Recently, there is an increasing interest in the use of a diet low in FODMAP for the treatment of IBS. A low FODMAP diet can decrease the delivery of readily fermentable substrates to the small intestine and colon, thereby improving functional gastrointestinal symptoms. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Oncogenic signaling in tumorigenesis and applications of siRNA nanotherapeutics in breast cancer",2019,"Overexpression of oncogenes and cross-talks of the oncoproteins-regulated signaling cascades with other intracellular pathways in breast cancer could lead to massive abnormal signaling with the consequence of tumorigenesis. The ability to identify the genes having vital roles in cancer development would give a promising therapeutics strategy in combating the disease. Genetic manipulations through siRNAs targeting the complementary sequence of the oncogenic mRNA in breast cancer is one of the promising approaches that can be harnessed to develop more efficient treatments for breast cancer. In this review, we highlighted the effects of major signaling pathways stimulated by oncogene products on breast tumorigenesis and discussed the potential therapeutic strategies for targeted delivery of siRNAs with nanoparticles in suppressing the stimulated signaling pathways. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 signalling, metabolism and its therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disease",2019,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the largest number of deaths worldwide, necessitating the development of novel treatments and prevention strategies. Given the huge energy demands placed on the heart, it is not surprising that changes in energy metabolism play a key role in the development of cardiac dysfunction in CVD. A reduction in oxygen delivery to the heart, hypoxia, is sensed and responded to by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and its family of proteins, by regulating the oxygen-dependent signalling cascade and subsequent response. Hypoxia is one of the main drivers of metabolic change in ischaemic disease and myocardial infarction, and we therefore suggest that HIF may be an attractive therapeutic target. In this review, we assess cardiac energy metabolism in health and disease, and how these can be regulated by HIF-1α activation. We then present an overview of research in the field of hypoxia-mimetic drugs recently developed in other treatment fields, which provide insight into the potential of systemic HIF-1α activation therapy for treating the heart. ? 2018","hypoxia inducible factor 1; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; procollagen proline 2 oxoglutarate 4 dioxygenase; hypoxia inducible factor 1; aerobic metabolism; angiogenesis; cardiovascular disease; cell energy; DNA responsive element; energy metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid transport; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; heart function; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle metabolism; human; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; priority journal; Review; signal transduction; animal; cardiac muscle; cardiovascular disease; metabolism; upregulation; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1; Myocardium; Signal Transduction; Up-Regulation"
"Association between subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1103 Clinical Sciences",2019,"Background: Although depression is associated with changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, its relationship with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is controversial. To date, there is a lack of data on the improvement of depressive symptoms with levothyroxine therapy among individuals with coexistent SCH. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between SCH and depression including 1) the prevalence of depression in SCH (with a sub-analysis of the geriatric cohort), 2) thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level among patients with depression and 3) the effect of levothyroxine therapy among patients with SCH and coexistent depression. Results: In a pooled analysis of 12,315 individuals, those with SCH had higher risk of depression than euthyroid controls (relative risk 2.35, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.84 to 3.02; p < 0.001). Geriatric cohort with SCH had a 1.7-fold higher risk of depression compared with healthy controls (odds ratio 1.72, CI, 1.10 to 2.70; p = 0.020). There was no difference in the mean TSH level between individuals with depression and healthy controls (2.30 ± 1.18 vs. 2.13 ± 0.72 mIU/L, p = 0.513). In individuals with SCH and coexistent depression, levothyroxine therapy was neither associated with improvement in the Beck Depression Inventory scoring (pooled d + = - 1.05, CI -2.72 to 0.61; p = 0.215) nor Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (pooled d + = - 2.38, CI -4.86 to 0.10; p = 0.060). Conclusion: SCH has a negative impact on depression. Early and routine screening of depression is essential to prevent morbidity and mortality. However, the use of levothyroxine among patients with SCH and coexistent depression needs to be individualized. ? 2019 The Author(s).","levothyroxine; liotrix; thyrotropin; Beck Depression Inventory; correlational study; depression; disease association; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; high risk population; human; hypothyroidism; meta analysis; prevalence; Review; scoring system; systematic review; thyrotropin blood level; case control study; cohort analysis; depression; hypothyroidism; psychological rating scale; psychology; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Depression; Humans; Hypothyroidism; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"
"Re-Excision Rates in Breast-Conserving Surgery for Invasive Breast Cancer after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy with and without the Use of a Radiopaque Tissue Transfer and X-ray System",2019,"Background: Significant re-excision rates in breast-conserving surgery (BCS) after neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy may result from difficulties in defining the surgical target particularly in cases with excellent treatment response. Devices allowing an exact topographic localisation of the lesion in the resected tissue could reduce re-excision rates by optimising the intraoperative detection of involved margins. Methods: 80 patients with invasive breast cancer receiving BCS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included in this non-randomized case-control study. 40 patients with specimen radiography performed in a standard approach (control group) were compared to 40 patients with use of a radiopaque tissue transfer system (study group). Results: 19/80 (23.75%) patients required re-excision because of involved margins; among those, 14/40 (35%) were in the control group and 5/40 (12.5%) in the study group. The association between the use of the radiopaque tissue transfer system and the lower re-excision rate was statistically significant (p = 0.023). Conclusion: Our analysis provides a rationale for the routine use of a radiopaque tissue transfer system for specimen radiography in BCS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer in order to reduce re-excision rates. ? 2018 S.

"Care of adolescents and young adults with cancer in Asia: Results of an ESMO/SIOPE/SIOP Asia survey",2019,"Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer require dedicated management encompassing both adult and paediatric cancer services. Following a European survey, the European Society for Medical Oncology, the European Society for Paediatric Oncology and the Asian continental branch of International Society of Paediatric Oncology undertook a similar survey to assess AYA cancer care across Asia. Methods A link to the online survey was sent to healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Asia interested in AYA cancer care. Questions covered the demographics and training of HCPs, their understanding of AYA definition, availability and access to specialised AYA services, the support and advice offered during and after treatment, and factors of treatment non-compliance. Results We received 268 responses from 22 Asian countries. There was a striking variation in the definition of AYA (median lower age 15 years, median higher age 29 years). The majority of the respondents (78%) did not have access to specialised cancer services and 73% were not aware of any research initiatives for AYA. Over two-thirds (69%) had the option to refer their patients for psychological and/or nutritional support and most advised their patients on a healthy lifestyle. Even so, 46% did not ask about smokeless tobacco habits and only half referred smokers to a smoking cessation service. Furthermore, 29% did not promote human papillomavirus vaccination for girls and 17% did not promote hepatitis B virus vaccination for high-risk individuals. In terms of funding, 69% reported governmental insurance coverage, although 65% reported that patients self-paid, at least partially. Almost half (47%) reported treatment non-compliance or abandonment as an issue, attributed to financial and family problems (72%), loss of follow-up (74%) and seeking of alternative treatments (77%). Conclusions Lack of access to and suboptimal delivery of AYA-specialised cancer care services across Asia pose major challenges and require specific interventions. ?

"How Common Is Medial and Lateral Shoulder Discordance in Lenke 1 and 2 Curves?: A Preoperative Analysis of Medial and Lateral Shoulder Balance among 151 Lenke 1 and 2 Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Patients",2019,"Study Design.Retrospective study of prospectively collected data.Objective.To analyze the incidence and the patterns of medial and lateral shoulder discordance among Lenke 1 and 2 patients.Summary of Background Data.Postoperative shoulder imbalance (PSI) is still common in Lenke 1 and 2 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). This could be due to presence of medial dan lateral shoulder discordance.Methods.One hundred fifty-one Lenke 1 and 2 AIS patients were recruited. Lenke 1 curves were subclassified into Lenke 1-ve (flexible) (proximal thoracic side bending [PTSB] Cobb angle <15°) and 1+ve curves (stiff) (PTSB Cobb angle between 15° and 24.9°). T1 tilt represented ""medial shoulder balance"" and radiological shoulder height (RSH) represented ""lateral shoulder balance."" We categorized patients into three concordant shoulder pattern types (medial balanced/lateral balanced [MBLB], medial imbalanced+ve/lateral imbalanced+ve (MI+ve/LI+ve), medial imbalanced-ve/lateral Imbalanced-ve (MI-ve/LI-ve), and six discordant shoulder pattern types.Results.The mean age was 16.2±5.7 years. Eighty-one patients (53.6%) had concordant pattern and 70 patients (46.4%) had discordant pattern. Lateral shoulder imbalance was noted in 35.1% of patients and medial shoulder imbalance in 43.7% of patients. In Lenke 1-ve curves, 35 patients (68.6%) had concordant shoulder imbalance with medial imbalanced-ve/lateral imbalanced-ve (MI-ve/LI-ve) being the commonest pattern (68.6%). In Lenke 1+ve curves, 33 patients (55.0%) had concordant shoulder pattern with medial balanced/lateral balanced (MB/LB) being the commonest type (57.6%). In Lenke 2 AIS, 27 patients (67.5%) had discordant pattern with medial imbalanced+ve/lateral balanced (MI+ve/LB) being the commonest pattern (44.4%) (P value=0.002).Conclusion.46.4% Lenke 1 and 2 AIS patients had shoulder discordant pattern. This was more prevalent in Lenke 2 curves (67.5%). In Lenke 1-ve (flexible) curves, MI-ve/LI-ve pattern was the commonest pattern. In Lenke 1+ve curves (stiff), there were almost equal number of concordant and discordant shoulder pattern.

"Squamous Cell Carcinoma Biomarker Sensing on a Strontium Oxide-Modified Interdigitated Electrode Surface for the Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer",2019,"Cervical cancer is a life-threatening complication, appearing as the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the cervix. Every year, increasing numbers of cervical cancer cases are reported worldwide. Different identification strategies were proposed to detect cervical cancer at the earlier stages using various biomarkers. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) is one of the potential biomarkers for this diagnosis. Nanomaterial-based detection systems were shown to be efficient with different clinical biomarkers. In this study, we have demonstrated strontium oxide-modified interdigitated electrode (IDE) fabrication by the sol-gel method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy and high-power microscopy. Analysis of the bare devices indicated the reproducibility with the fabrication, and further pH scouting on the device revealed that the reliability of the working pH ranges from 3 to 9. The sensing surface was tested to detect SCC-Ag against its specific antibody; the detection limit was found to be 10 pM, and the sensitivity was in the range between 1 and 10 pM as calculated by 3σ. The specificity experiment was carried out using major proteins from human serum, such as albumin and globulin. SCC-Ag was shown to be selectively detected on the strontium oxide-modified IDE surface. ? 2019 Hongqing Wang et al.","albumin; cancer antibody; globulin; protein antibody; squamous cell carcinoma antibody; squamous cell carcinoma antigen; unclassified drug; oxide; serine proteinase inhibitor; squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen; strontium; tumor antigen; tumor marker; analytic method; antibody detection; antibody specificity; Article; cancer diagnosis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; female; human; limit of detection; microscopy; microtechnology; pH; reproducibility; scanning electron microscopy; sensitivity and specificity; serum; sol gel method; surface property; uterine cervix cancer; electrode; metabolism; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor recurrence; uterine cervix; uterine cervix tumor; Antigens, Neoplasm; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cervix Uteri; Electrodes; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Oxides; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serpins; Strontium; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"
"Enantiomeric pairs of ternary copper(ii) complexes and their aldol-type condensation products: Synthesis, characterization, and anticancer and epigenetic properties",2019,"Chiral enantiomers [Cu(phen)(l-ser)(H 2 O)]NO 3 1 and [Cu(phen)(d-ser)(H 2 O)]NO 3 2 (ser = serinato) underwent aldol-type condensation with formaldehyde, with retention of chirality, to yield their respective enantiomeric ternary copper(ii) complexes, viz. l- and d-[Cu(phen)(OCA)(H 2 O)]NO 3 ·xH 2 O (3 and 4; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline; OCA = oxazolidine-4-carboxylate; x = 1/2, 0-2) respectively. These chiral complexes were characterized by FTIR, elemental analysis, circular dichroism, UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy (FL), molar conductivity measurement, ESI-MS and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of 1 and 3 showed both the cationic complexes to have a square pyramidal geometry. These complexes were about nine fold more potent than cisplatin against metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, inducing apoptotic cell death via ROS generation and a massive drop in mitochondrial membrane potential. The results of monitoring EZH1, EZH2 and H3K27me3 revealed that the mode of action of 1-4 also involved the downregulation of EZH2 and it seemed to be independent of the H3K27me3 status. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Carboxylation; Cell death; Cell membranes; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Condensation; Dichroism; Enantiomers; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Ketones; Mitochondria; Synthesis (chemical); Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray crystallography; 1 ,10-phenanthroline; Aldol-type condensation; Apoptotic cell death; Mitochondrial membrane potential; Molar conductivities; Square-pyramidal geometry; Ternary copper complexes; UV visible spectroscopy; Copper compounds; antineoplastic agent; coordination compound; copper; cell proliferation; chemistry; conformation; dose response; drug effect; drug screening; genetic epigenesis; human; stereoisomerism; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Coordination Complexes; Copper; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Molecular Conformation; Stereoisomerism; Structure-Activity Relationship"
"Does body mass index and height influence the incident risk of ischemic stroke in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes subjects?",2019,"Objective. To estimate the incident risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects according to different body mass index (BMI) and height categories. Methods. A total of 25,130 newly diagnosed T2D subjects were included in this study. All T2D subjects were enrolled consecutively from the Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CDSS) of Ningbo. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) stratified by BMI categories and height quartiles were used to estimate the incident risk of IS in T2D subjects. Results. In total, 22,795 subjects completed the follow-up. Among them, 1268 newly diagnosed IS cases were identified, with 149,675 person-years. The SIRs of normal BMI (18.5–24.0 kg/m2), overweight (24.0–28.0 kg/m2), and obese (?28.0 kg/m2) in overall subjects were 2.56 (95% CI 1.90–3.13), 2.13 (95% CI 1.90–3.13), and 1.87 (95% CI 1.29–2.43), respectively (Ptrend &lt; 0 01), comparing to the general population of Ningbo. For each 1 kg/m2 increment in BMI, the SIR was 0.948 (95% CI 0.903–0.999). For height quartiles, the SIRs of male subjects in quartile 1 (&lt;160 cm), quartile 2 (161–165 cm), quartile 3 (165–170 cm), and quartile 4 (?171 cm) were 2.27 (95% CI 1.99–2.56), 2.01 (95% CI 1.67–2.45), 1.37 (95% CI 1.05–1.68), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.40–1.32), respectively (Ptrend &lt; 0 01). While for female subjects, the SIRs in quartile 1 (&lt;155 cm), quartile 2 (156–160 cm), quartile 3 (161–165 cm), and quartile 4 (?166 cm) were 3.57 (95% CI 3.11–3.49), 2.96 (95% CI 2.61–3.31), 1.94 (95% CI 1.51–2.36), and 1.71 (95% CI 0.95–2.47), respectively (Ptrend &lt; 0 01). Conclusion. Compared to the general population of Ningbo, T2D subjects had a higher incident risk of IS. Furthermore, the IS incident risk was not only higher in newly diagnosed T2D subjects with normal BMI but also lower in taller newly diagnosed T2D subjects.

"In vivo administration of quercetin ameliorates sperm oxidative stress, inflammation, preserves sperm morphology and functions in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced adult male diabetic rats",2019,"Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been associated with sperm damage. In view of the fact that quercetin possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, this compound may help to protect sperm against damage in DM. In this study, in-vivo effects of quercetin on sperm parameters in DM were investigated. Material and methods: Quercetin (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg/b.w.) was given orally to streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced adult male diabetic rats for 28 days. Following treatment completion, rats were sacrificed and sperm were harvested from the cauda epididymis. Sperm count, motility, viability, hyperosmotic swelling (HOS) tail-coiled sperm and morphology were assessed. Levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) in sperm with and without H 2 O 2 incubation were determined by biochemical assays. Expression levels of SOD, CAT and GPx mRNAs in sperm were evaluated by qPCR. Sperm DNA integrity was estimated by flow cytometry while expression levels of the inflammatory markers NF-κβ and TNF-α in sperm were determined by Western blotting. Results: In diabetic rats receiving quercetin, sperm count and motility, viability and HOS tail-coiled sperm increased (p &lt; 0.05) while sperm with abnormal morphology decreased. Moreover, sperm SOD, CAT, GPx activities and their mRNA expression levels increased while sperm LPO, NF-κβ and TNF-α levels decreased. In normal and diabetic rat sperm incubated with H 2 O 2 , a further increase in MDA and further decreases in SOD, CAT and GPx were observed, and these were ameliorated by quercetin treatment. Conclusions: In-vivo administration of quercetin to diabetic rats helps to ameliorate sperm damage and improves sperm morphology and functions in DM. ? 2018 Termedia & Banach.","catalase; glutathione peroxidase; hydrogen peroxide; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; nicotinamide; quercetin; streptozocin; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; biochemical analysis; controlled study; epididymis; flow cytometry; gene expression; in vivo study; inflammation; lipid peroxidation; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; sperm quality; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon motility; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; Western blotting"
"Does the Severity of the Curve in Lenke 1 and 2 Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Patients Affect the Distance and Position of the Aorta from Vertebra?",2019,"Study Design.Retrospective study of a prospectively-collected data.Objective.To determine whether the severity of the curve magnitude in Lenke 1 and 2 Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) patients affects the distance and position of the aorta from the vertebra.Summary of Background Data.There were studies that looked into the position of the aorta in scoliotic patients but none of them documented the change in distance of the aorta to the vertebra in relation to the magnitude of the scoliosis.Methods.Patients with Lenke 1 and 2 AIS who underwent posterior spinal fusion using pedicle screw construct and had a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan performed were recruited. The radiological parameters measured on preoperative CT scan were: Aortic-Vertebral Distance (AVD), Entry-Aortic Distance (EAD), Aortic-Vertebral angle (AVA), Pedicle Aorta angle/Aortic Alpha angle (α angle), and Aortic Beta angle (β angle).Results.Thirty-nine patients were recruited. Significant moderate to strong positive correlation was found between AVD and Cobb angle from T8 to T12 vertebrae (r=0.360 to 0.666). The EAD was generally small in the thoracic region (T4-T10) with mean EAD of less than 30mm. Among all apical vertebrae, the mean AVD was 5.9±2.2mm with significant moderate-strong positive correlation to Cobb angle (r=0.580). The mean α angle was 37.7±8.7° with significant weak positive correlation with Cobb angle (r=0.325).Conclusion.The larger the scoliotic curve, the aorta was located further away from the apical vertebral wall. The aorta has less risk of injury from the left lateral pedicle screw breach in larger scoliotic curve at the apical region. The distance from the pedicle screw entry point to the wall of the aorta was generally small (less than 30mm) in the thoracic region (T4-T10).Level of Evidence: 4. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Diabetic retinopathy detection through artificial intelligent techniques: a review and open issues",2019,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the disease caused by uncontrolled diabetes that may lead to blindness among the patients. Due to the advancements in artificial intelligence, early detection of DR through an automated system is more beneficial over the manual detection. At present, there are several published studies on automated DR detection systems through machine learning or deep learning approaches. This study presents a review on DR detection techniques from five different aspects namely, datasets, image preprocessing techniques, machine learning-based approaches, deep learning-based approaches, and performance measures. Moreover, it also presents the authors’ observation and significance of the review findings. Furthermore, we also discuss nine new research challenges in DR detection. After a rigorous selection process, 74 primary publications were selected from eight academic databases for this review. From the selected studies, it was observed that many public datasets are available in the field of DR detection. In image preprocessing techniques, contrast enhancement combined with green channel extraction contributed the most in classification accuracy. In features, shape-based, texture-based and statistical features were reported as the most discriminative in DR detection. The Artificial Neural Network was proven eminent classifier compared to other machine learning classifiers. In deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network outperformed compared to other deep learning networks. Finally, to measure the classification performance, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics were mostly employed. This review presents a comprehensive summary of DR detection techniques and will be proven useful for the community of scientists working in the field of automated DR detection techniques. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Automation; Convolution; Eye protection; Image enhancement; Neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Diabetic retinopathy; DIARETDB1; Image preprocessing; Transfer learning; Deep learning"
"An inverse association between the Mediterranean diet and bladder cancer risk: a pooled analysis of 13 cohort studies",2020,"Purpose: The role of diet in bladder carcinogenesis has yet to be established. To date most studies have investigated dietary components individually, rather than as dietary patterns, which may provide stronger evidence for any influence of diet on bladder carcinogenesis. The Mediterranean diet has been associated with many health benefits, but few studies have investigated its association with bladder cancer risk. Methods: We investigated the potential association between the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and risk of developing bladder cancer by pooling 13 prospective cohort studies included in the BLadder cancer Epidemiology and Nutritional Determinants (BLEND) study and applying a Cox regression analysis. Results: Dietary data from 646,222 study participants, including 3639 incident bladder cancer cases, were analysed. We observed an inverse association between Mediterranean diet and bladder cancer risk (HRhigh 0.85 [95% CI 0.77, 0.93]). When stratifying the results on non-muscle-invasive or muscle-invasive disease or sex the association remained similar and the HR estimate was consistently below 1.00 both for medium and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. A consistent association was observed when disregarding fat or alcohol intake. Conclusion: We found evidence that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced risk of developing bladder cancer, suggesting a positive effect of the diet as a whole and not just one component. ? 2019, The Author(s).","olive oil; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; bladder cancer; caloric intake; cancer epidemiology; cancer risk; cancer staging; cohort analysis; current smoker; dietary compliance; dietary pattern; fat intake; female; food frequency questionnaire; human; major clinical study; male; Mediterranean diet; middle aged; muscle invasive bladder cancer; never smoker; non muscle invasive bladder cancer; prospective study"

"Wound healing property of curcuminoids as a microcapsule-incorporated cream",2019,"Curcuminoids have been used for the management of burns and wound healing in traditional Chinese medicine practices but the wide application of curcuminoids as a healing agent for wounds has always been a known problem due to their poor solubility, bioavailability, colour staining properties, as well as due to their intense photosensitivity and the need for further formulation approaches to maximise their various properties in order for them to considerably contribute towards the wound healing process. In the present study, a complex coacervation microencapsulation was used to encapsulate curcuminoids using gelatin B and chitosan. This study also focused on studying and confirming the potential of curcuminoids in a microencapsulated form as a wound healing agent. The potential of curcuminoids for wound management was evaluated using an in vitro human keratinocyte cell (HaCaT) model and the in vivo heater-inflicted burn wound model, providing evidence that the antioxidant activities of both forms of curcuminoids, encapsulated or not, are higher than those of butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene in trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) (DPPH) studies. However, curcuminoids did not have much impact towards cell migration and proliferation in comparison with the negative control in the in vitro HaCaT study. The micoencapsulation formulation was shown to significantly influence wound healing in terms of increasing the wound contraction rate, hydroxyproline synthesis, and greater epithelialisation, which in turn provides strong justification for the incorporation of the microencapsulated formulation of curcuminoids as a topical treatment for burns and wound healing management as it has the potential to act as a crucial wound healing agent in healthcare settings. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The predictors of users’ satisfaction in an anonymous environment: the role of the negative true self",2020,"The anonymity of cyberspace enables people to express themselves more freely than in the physical world. Thus, when interacting with others online, some people choose to reconstruct a virtual identity that is partly or even totally different from their physical identity. Using the advanced self-discrepancy theory and the framework of psychological well-being, the current study theoretically modelled the expression of three domains of the self (the ought self, the ideal self and the negative true self) that affects the fulfilment of autonomy and self-acceptance, further influencing people’s overall satisfaction in an anonymous online environment. The data (n = 837) were collected from QQ, an anonymous social networking platform from China. The results suggested that virtual identity reconstruction in the online world was significantly associated with the fulfilment of autonomy and self-acceptance. Additionally, autonomy and self-acceptance played important roles in shaping user satisfaction. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Information technology; anonymity; autonomy; Online environments; Physical world; Psychological well-being; Self discrepancies; self-acceptance; User satisfaction; Social sciences; article; China; controlled study; human; identity; major clinical study; psychological well-being; satisfaction; social network; theoretical study"
"Study of Primordial 226Ra, 228Ra, and 40K Concentrations in Dietary Palm Dates and Concomitant Radiological Risk",2019,"The presence of natural radionuclides in the food chain point to a need to assess concentration levels and concomitant radiological risk. Highly popular and forming a staple part of the diet in North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and West Asia, palm dates growing naturally there have even greater marketability than simple satisfaction of domestic demand, the palm dates representing a valuable export item. Accurate knowledge of the levels of natural radioactivity in the fruit is thus of importance. In this study, using high-purity germanium gamma-ray spectrometry, quantification has been made of natural radionuclide concentrations in imported dates originating from Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. Sample analyses reveal respective mean activity concentrations of 1.4 ± 0.3, 0.8 ± 0.4, and 186 ± 9 Bq kg-1 dry weight for 226Ra, 228Ra, and 40K. For each nuclide, the mean concentration varies little between the dates of the three represented regions. The estimated committed effective dose resulting from the consumption of date fruits for a typical adult was found to be 29.9 μSv y-1, well below the global internal dose of 290 μSv y-1 assessed by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation to be due to food and water intake. Similarly, the excess lifetime cancer risk due to naturally occurring radioactive material exposure via date fruit consumption is seen to be below the International Commission on Radiological Protection cancer risk factor of 2.5 × 10-3 based on the additional annual dose limit of 1 mSv for a member of the general public. The results show no significant uptake in the analyzed date fruits. ?

"The antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of capsaicin on an oral squamous cancer cell line of asian origin, ORL-48",2019,"Background and Objectives: The antitumor activities of capsaicin on various types of cancer cell lines have been reported but the effect of capsaicin on oral cancer, which is prevalent among Asians, are very limited. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of capsaicin on ORL-48, an oral cancer cell line of Asian origin. Materials and Methods: Morphological changes of the ORL-48 cells treated with capsaicin were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. The apoptotic-inducing activity of capsaicin was further confirmed by Annexin V-Fluorescein isothiocyanate/Propidium iodide (V-FITC/PI) staining using flow cytometry. In order to establish the pathway of apoptosis triggered by the compound on ORL-48 cells, caspase activity was determined and the mitochondrial pathway was verified by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay. Cell cycle analysis was also performed to identify the cell cycle phase of ORL-48 cells being inhibited by the capsaicin compound. Results: Fluorescence microscopy exhibited the presence of apoptotic features in capsaicin-treated ORL-48 cells. Apoptosis of capsaicin-treated ORL-48 cells revealed disruption of the mitochondrial-membrane potential, activation of caspase-3,-7 and-9 through an intrinsic apoptotic pathway and subsequently, apoptotic DNA fragmentation. The cell cycle arrest occurred in the G1-phase, confirming antiproliferative effect of capsaicin in a time-dependent manner. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that capsaicin is cytotoxic against ORL-48 cells and induces apoptosis in ORL-48 cells possibly through mitochondria mediated intrinsic pathway resulting in cell cycle arrest. ? 2019 by the authors.","capsaicin; growth inhibitor; apoptosis; Asian continental ancestry group; cell line; drug effect; genetics; human; pathology; squamous cell carcinoma; Apoptosis; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Capsaicin; Cell Line; Growth Inhibitors; Humans; Neoplasms, Squamous Cell"
"The associations of anthropometric, behavioural and sociodemographic factors with circulating concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 in a pooled analysis of 16,024 men from 22 studies",2019,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) have been implicated in the aetiology of several cancers. To better understand whether anthropometric, behavioural and sociodemographic factors may play a role in cancer risk via IGF signalling, we examined the cross-sectional associations of these exposures with circulating concentrations of IGFs (IGF-I and IGF-II) and IGFBPs (IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3). The Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group dataset includes individual participant data from 16,024 male controls (i.e. without prostate cancer) aged 22–89 years from 22 prospective studies. Geometric means of protein concentrations were estimated using analysis of variance, adjusted for relevant covariates. Older age was associated with higher concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 and lower concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3. Higher body mass index was associated with lower concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2. Taller height was associated with higher concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and lower concentrations of IGFBP-1. Smokers had higher concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 and lower concentrations of IGFBP-3 than nonsmokers. Higher alcohol consumption was associated with higher concentrations of IGF-II and lower concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-2. African Americans had lower concentrations of IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 and Hispanics had lower IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 than non-Hispanic whites. These findings indicate that a range of anthropometric, behavioural and sociodemographic factors are associated with circulating concentrations of IGFs and IGFBPs in men, which will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms through which these factors influence cancer risk. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Integration of omics research in discovery of biomarkers for leptospirosis diagnosis and vaccine development",2019,"Leptospirosis, a life-threatening disease caused by Leptospira spp, is a serious global public health issue, especially in humid tropical and subtropical countries. Humans commonly are infected through occupational, recreational or domestic contact with urine of carrier animals. Despite numerous tests having been developed, availability of sensitive and specific biomarkers for diagnostic and vaccination purposes remains an issue, mainly due to the existence of more than 250 Leptospira serovars and limited knowledge on Leptospira pathogenesis. Bacterial virulence factors are often targeted and developed as biomarkers to leptospirosis detection and vaccination development. Here, we review studies using genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics approaches on pathogenic, intermediate pathogenic and saprophytic Leptospira. In addition, the challenges facing biomarker discovery and suggestions to improve the overall output of the biomarker discovery are addressed. ? 2019, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved.",""
"Sociodemographic Characteristics as Determinants and Physical Performance Measures as Correlates of Falls among Malaysian Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Prospective Study",2019,"There is limited information regarding combined sociodemographic data and physical performance measures as determinants and correlates of falls among community-dwelling older adults. In this study, we aimed to identify whether sociodemographic data and physical performance measures are significant determinants and correlates for falls in community-dwelling older adults. Three hundred twenty-five Malaysian community-dwelling older adults (145 men and 180 women), aged 60 to 89 (M = 67.64, SD = 5.56) years, were recruited through multistage random samplings for this prospective study (with 6 months' follow-up). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed on the sociodemographic data and physical performance measures to determine the determinants and correlates of falls among these participants. The Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) was the only significant (P <.05) physical performance measure that correlated with falls. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test and education levels were significant correlates and determinants of falls in this population, with the absence of PPA in the model. The PPA is the best physical performance measure correlate of falls among Malaysian community-dwelling older adults. However, when the PPA is not available, the TUG Test, although a simple performance tool, may be used to predict falls among community-dwelling older adults. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Stem Cells from Human Extracted Deciduous Teeth Expanded in Foetal Bovine and Human Sera Express Different Paracrine Factors After Exposure to Freshly Prepared Human Serum",2019,"Background: The response of stem cells to paracrine factors within the host’s body plays an important role in the regeneration process after transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the viability and paracrine factor profile of stem cells from human extracted deciduous teeth (SHED) pre-cultivated in media supplemented with either foetal bovine serum (FBS) or pooled human serum (pHS) in the presence of individual human sera (iHS). Methods: SHED (n=3) from passage 4 were expanded in FBS (FBS-SHED) or pHS (pHS-SHED) supplemented media until passage 7. During expansion, the proliferation of SHED was determined. Cells at passage 7 were further expanded in human serum from four individual donors (iHS) for 120h followed by assessment of cell viability and profiling of the secreted paracrine factors. Results: Proliferation of SHED was significantly higher in pHS supplemented media compared to FBS supplemented media. pHS-SHED also maintained their higher proliferation rate compared to FBS-SHED in the presence of iHS. In iHS supplemented media, FBS-SHED expressed significantly higher levels of SDF-1A after h compared to pHS-SHED. Similar results were found for HGF PDGF-BB (p&lt;0.05), SDF-1A (p&lt;0.01), and IL-10 (p&lt;0.05) when cell culture supernatants from FBS-SHED were profiled 120h post-incubation. Conclusion: SHED expanded in pHS instead of FBS have higher proliferative capacity and show an altered secretion profile.

We investigated the association between patterns in baseline plasma metabolite profile and subsequent prostate cancer risk, using data from 3,057 matched case–control sets from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). We measured 119 metabolite concentrations in plasma samples, collected on average 9.4 years before diagnosis, by mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit, Biocrates Life Sciences AG). Metabolite patterns were identified using treelet transform, a statistical method for identification of groups of correlated metabolites. Associations of metabolite patterns with prostate cancer risk (OR1SD) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Supplementary analyses were conducted for metabolite patterns derived using principal component analysis and for individual metabolites. Men with metabolite profiles characterized by higher concentrations of either phosphatidylcholines or hydroxysphingomyelins (OR1SD = 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.66–0.89), acylcarnitines C18:1 and C18:2, glutamate, ornithine and taurine (OR1SD = 0.72, 0.57–0.90), or lysophosphatidylcholines (OR1SD = 0.81, 0.69–0.95) had lower risk of advanced stage prostate cancer at diagnosis, with no evidence of heterogeneity by follow-up time. Similar associations were observed for the two former patterns with aggressive disease risk (the more aggressive subset of advanced stage), while the latter pattern was inversely related to risk of prostate cancer death (OR1SD = 0.77, 0.61–0.96). No associations were observed for prostate cancer overall or less aggressive tumor subtypes. In conclusion, metabolite patterns may be related to lower risk of more aggressive prostate tumors and prostate cancer death, and might be relevant to etiology of advanced stage prostate cancer. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Polymorphisms in the host CYP2C19 gene and antibiotic-resistance attributes of Helicobacter pylori isolates influence the outcome of triple therapy",2019,"Eradication of Helicobacter pylori is influenced by susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, elevated bacterial load and degree of acid inhibition, which can be affected by genotypes of drug-metabolizing enzymes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism]. Theoretically, the choice and dose of proton pump inhibitor may also influence the suppression of H. pylori infection. The CYP2C19 genotype has recently been found to have an impact on peptic ulcer healing, H. pylori eradication and therapeutic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors. Methods: Here, we investigated the impact of the CYP2C19 genotype polymorphism and the success of triple therapy (fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin) on antibiotic-resistant strains in eradicating H. pylori in human subjects with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), in human subjects with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and in asymptomatic human subjects (positive and negative for H. pylori infection). Results: Based on the CYP2C19 genotypes, determined by Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis, we found 11.2%, 62.5% and 26.3% corresponding to rapid metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. However, we did not find any significant effect for homozygous ABCB1 or CYP2C19?2 and CYP2C193 alleles. We detected several participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C192, CYP2C19?3 and CYP2C19?17 loci. The participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C19?2 and?3 loci should be defined as intermediate and poor metabolizers according to the haplotype analysis in the NUD, PUD and asymptomatic subjects. Conclusions: Consequently, fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin-based triple therapies can be used to eradicate H. pylori infection, if one does not know the CYP2C19 genotype of the patient. ? 2018.

"From nanoengineering to nanomedicine: A facile route to enhance biocompatibility of graphene as a potential nano-carrier for targeted drug delivery using natural deep eutectic solvents",2019,"Graphene has attracted massive interest in numerous biomedical applications such as anti-cancer therapy, drug delivery, bio-imaging and gene delivery. Therefore, it is important to ensure that graphene is nontoxic, and that its cellular biological behavior is safe and biocompatible. Herein, a new route was used to enhance the biocompatibility of graphene, using several natural deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as functionalizing agents, owing to their capability to introduce various functional groups and surface modifications. Characterization of the physicochemical changes in DES-functionalized graphene were conducted by FE-SEM, FTIR, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. There were considerable improvements in the cytotoxicity profile of DES-functionalized graphene compared to pristine graphene and oxidized graphene, as demonstrated by cell viability, cell cycle progression, and reactive oxygen species evaluation assays. We also studied the association between cellular toxicity of DES-functionalized graphene and their physicochemical properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the cytotoxicity profile improvement of graphene using DESs as functionalizing agents, and its cellular biological behavior. The application of DESs as functionalizing agents, especially for DES choline chloride (ChCl):malonic acid (1:1), significantly reduced the cytotoxicity level of graphenes. DES ChCl:malonic acid (1:1) also demonstrated higher tamoxifen entrapment efficiency and loading capacity in comparison to the functionalization with DES ChCl:glucose (2:1), ChCl:fructose (2:1) and ChCl:sucrose (2:1). Therefore, DES ChCl:malonic acid (1:1) is considered the most promising nano-carrier for drug delivery applications, owing to its lower cytotoxicity and higher drug loading capacity. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biocompatibility; Carboxylic acids; Chlorine compounds; Controlled drug delivery; Cytotoxicity; Diseases; Eutectics; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gene therapy; Gene transfer; Graphene; Ionic liquids; Medical applications; Medical nanotechnology; Breast Cancer; Drug delivery applications; Functionalized graphene; Nanotoxicology; Physico-chemical changes; Physicochemical property; Reactive oxygen species; Superoxide ion; Targeted drug delivery"
"The use of next generation sequencing for improving food safety: Translation into practice",2019,"Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) combined with powerful bioinformatic approaches are revolutionising food microbiology. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of single isolates allows the most detailed comparison possible hitherto of individual strains. The two principle approaches for strain discrimination, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and genomic multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) are showing concordant results for phylogenetic clustering and are complementary to each other. Metabarcoding and metagenomics, applied to total DNA isolated from either food materials or the production environment, allows the identification of complete microbial populations. Metagenomics identifies the entire gene content and when coupled to transcriptomics or proteomics, allows the identification of functional capacity and biochemical activity of microbial populations. The focus of this review is on the recent use and future potential of NGS in food microbiology and on current challenges. Guidance is provided for new users, such as public health departments and the food industry, on the implementation of NGS and how to critically interpret results and place them in a broader context. The review aims to promote the broader application of NGS technologies within the food industry as well as highlight knowledge gaps and novel applications of NGS with the aim of driving future research and increasing food safety outputs from its wider use. ? 2018","biology; devices; DNA sequence; food control; food industry; food safety; genomics; high throughput sequencing; multilocus sequence typing; practice guideline; single nucleotide polymorphism; standards; trends; Computational Biology; Food Industry; Food Microbiology; Food Safety; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Sequence Analysis, DNA"
"Gravid oviposition sticky trap and dengue non-structural 1 antigen test for early surveillance of dengue in multi-storey dwellings: Study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Dengue is a global disease, transmitted by the Aedes vectors. In 2018, there were 80 615 dengue cases with 147 deaths in Malaysia. Currently, the nationwide surveillance programs are dependent on Aedes larval surveys and notifications of lab-confirmed human infections. The existing, reactive programs appear to lack sensitivity and proactivity. More efficient dengue vector surveillance/control methods are needed. Methods: A parallel, cluster, randomized controlled, interventional trial is being conducted for 18 months in Damansara Damai, Selangor, Malaysia, to determine the efficacy of using gravid oviposition sticky (GOS) trap and dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen test for early surveillance of dengue among Aedes mosquitoes to reduce dengue outbreaks. Eight residential apartments were randomly assigned into intervention and control arms. GOS traps are set at the apartments to collect Aedes weekly, following which dengue NS1 antigen is detected in these mosquitoes. When a dengue-positive mosquito is detected, the community will be advised to execute vector search-and-destroy and protective measures. The primary outcome concerns the the percentage change in the (i) number of dengue cases and (ii) durations of dengue outbreaks. Whereas other outcome measures include the change in density threshold of Aedes and changes in dengue-related knowledge, attitude and practice among cluster inhabitants. Discussion: This is a proactive and early dengue surveillance in the mosquito vector that does not rely on notification of dengue cases. Surveillance using the GOS traps should be able to efficiently provide sufficient coverage for multistorey dwellings where population per unit area is likely to be higher. Furthermore, trapping dengue-infected mosquitoes using the GOS trap, helps to halt the dengue transmission carried by the mosquito. It is envisaged that the results of this randomized controlled trial will provide a new proactive, cheap and targeted surveillance tool for the prevention and control of dengue outbreaks. ? 2019 The Author(s).","viral protein; virus antigen; Aedes; animal; Dengue virus; egg laying; health survey; isolation and purification; physiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); virology; Aedes; Animals; Antigens, Viral; Dengue Virus; Oviposition; Population Surveillance; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Viral Nonstructural Proteins"
"Dispensation of antiretroviral therapy and methadone maintenance therapy at the same facility in a low-barrier setting linked to optimal adherence to HIV treatment",2019,"Objectives: We sought to examine the association between dispensation of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the same facility, across multiple low-barrier dispensing outlets, and achieving optimal adherence to ART among people who use illicit drugs (PWUD). Methods: We used data from the AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate Exposure to Survival Services (ACCESS) study, a long-running study of a community-recruited cohort of HIV-positive PWUD, linked to comprehensive HIV clinical records in Vancouver, Canada, a setting of no-cost, universal access to HIV care. The longitudinal relationship between MMT-ART dispensation at the same facility and the odds of ??95% ART adherence was analysed using multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modelling. We conducted a further analysis using a marginal structural mode with inverse probability of treatment weights as a sensitivity analysis. Results: This study included data on 1690 interviews of 345 ART- and MMT-exposed participants carried out between June 2012 and December 2017. In the final multivariable model, MMT-ART dispensation, compared with nondispensation at the same facility, was associated with greater odds of achieving ??95% adherence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–1.96]. A marginal structural model estimated a 1.48 (95% CI 1.15–1.80) greater odds of ??95% adherence among participants who reported MMT-ART dispensation at the same facility compared with those who did not. Conclusions: The odds of achieving optimal adherence to ART were 56% higher during periods in which MMT and ART medications were dispensed at the same facility, in a low-barrier setting. Our findings highlight the need to consider a simpler integrated approach with medication dispensation at the same facility in low-threshold settings. ? 2019 British HIV Association","methadone; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; cohort analysis; female; health care access; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; methadone treatment; observational study; patient compliance; priority journal; prospective study; self report; sensitivity analysis; structural model"
"Tai Chi with music improves quality of life among community-dwelling older persons with mild to moderate depressive symptoms: A cluster randomized controlled trial",2019,"Depression leads to a poorer quality of life (QOL) which is a determinant of healthy ageing.

"Try to remember: Interplay between memory and substance use disorder",2019,"Memories associated with substance use disorders, or substance-associated cues increase the likelihood of craving and relapse during abstinence. There is a growing consensus that manipulation of synaptic plasticity may reduce the strength of substance abuse-related memories. On the biological front, there are new insights that suggest memories associated with substance use disorder may follow unique neurobiological pathways that render them more accessible to pharmacological intervention. In parallel to this, research in neurochemistry has identified several potential candidate molecules that could influence the formation and maintenance of long-term memory. Drugs that target these molecules (blebbistatin, isradipine and zeta inhibitory peptide) have shown promise at the preclinical stage. In this review, we shall provide an overview of the evolving understanding on the biochemical mechanisms involved in memory formation and expound on the premise that substance use disorder is a learning disorder. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","actin; blebbistatin; chlorpheniramine maleate plus phenylephrine; isradipine; myosin; protein interacting with protein kinase C; protein kinase C; basolateral amygdala; blood brain barrier; chronic brain disease; congestive heart failure; drug dependence; gene expression; hippocampus; homeostasis; human; learning disorder; long term depression; long term memory; memory; nerve cell network; neurochemistry; neurophysiology; neurotransmission; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; protein synthesis; Review; substance abuse; ventral tegmentum"
"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to sarcoma in recurrent lung adenosquamous carcinoma following adjuvant chemotherapy",2019,"Adjuvant chemotherapy has long been indicated to extend survival in completely resected stage IB to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there is accumulating evidence that chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in disseminated or circulating NSCLC cells. Here, we describe the first case of EMT as the cause of recurrence and metastasis in a patient with resected stage IIB lung adenosquamous carcinoma after adjuvant chemotherapy. We review the literature and explore the possible mechanisms by which EMT occurs in disseminated tumor cells (DTC) or circulating tumor cells (CTC) in response to adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin) as a stressor. We also explore the possible therapeutic strategies to reverse EMT in patients with recurrence. In summary, although adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in resected NSCLC does extend survival, it may lead to the adverse phenomenon of EMT in disseminated tumor cells (DTC) or circulating tumor cells (CTC) causing recurrence and metastasis. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Risk quantif cation of metabolic syndrome with quantum particle swarm optimisation",2019,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a combination of interrelated risk factors associated with an increased risk of developing type II diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), stroke and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The economic, social and medical burden coupled with increased morbidity of the aforementioned diseases makes their prevention an active research area. Currently, the traditional method of MetS diagnosis is based on dichotomised definitions provided by various expert health organisations. However, this method is laced with the in-determination of MetS in individuals with borderline risk factor values due to a binary diagnosis and the assumption of equal weighting for all risk factors during diagnosis. The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of the MetS areal similarity degree risk analysis based on weighted radar charts comprising of diagnostic thresholds and risk factor results of an individual. We further enhance this risk quantification method by applying quantum particle swarm optimization to derive the weights. The proposed risk quantification was carried out using a sample of 528 individuals from an examination survey conducted between 2007 and 2014 in Serbia. The results are evaluated with the traditional dichotomised method of MetS diagnosis, in this case the joint interim statement (JIS). The results obtained showed that the proposed risk quantification method outperformed the dichotomised method at diagnosing MetS even in individuals who present risk factor examination values at the threshold borderlines. ? 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.","Diagnosis; Diseases; Metabolism; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Risk assessment; Risk perception; World Wide Web; Cardiovascular disease; Metabolic syndromes; Quantum particle swarm optimization; Quantum particles; Risk factors; Risk quantification; Similarity degree; Type ii diabetes mellitus; Risk analysis"

Regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with all-cause mortality. Incidence rates ranged from 135.18 to 156.50/100 000 and were higher for HCWs compared with the general population (risk ratio = 1.70-1.96). The mean age at notification was 34.6 ± 10.55 years; 68.9% were female. Most were paramedics (44.3%) followed by other HCWs (41.9%) and doctors (13.8%). Nearly a quarter (23.8%) had extrapulmonary tuberculosis. There were 23 deaths giving a case fatality rate of 2.4%. Factors associated with death were older age (odds ratio [OR] =1.05; confidence interval [CI] =1.01-1.10), diabetes (OR = 3.83; CI = 1.32-11.08), HIV positivity (OR = 18.16; CI = 4.60-71.68), and not receiving directly observed therapy (DOTS) (OR = 10.97; CI = 3.61-33.38).

"Cytotoxicity assay of plant-mediated synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles using Juglans regia green husk extract",2020,"Synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles has attracted increasing interest due to their importance in biomedical and technological applications. To investigate the ability of Juglans regia (J. regia) green husk extract in iron oxide nanoparticles size control, they were synthesized through co-precipitation method with J. regia extract and without it. For both tests, other experimental conditions were same. According to High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, the mean diameter and standard deviation of iron oxide nanoparticles and J. regia/iron oxide nanoparticles synthesized using co-precipitation method were 12.60 ± 2.87 and 5.77 ± 1.66 nm respectively. These results showed that J. regia/iron oxide nanoparticles synthesized using extract have a smaller size than nanoparticles fabricated by co-precipitation method; moreover, green husk extract plays the main role as size control. The obtained results of Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) are in good agreement with each other and confirm the high purity of fabricated magnetic nanoparticles using J. regia extract. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) revealed that the J. regia/iron oxide nanoparticles due to their proper magnetic properties have high saturation magnetization and low coercivity. According to FTIR spectrum, the J. regia would be coated on the iron oxide nanoparticles surface in a successful manner. The non-toxic effect of J. regia/iron oxide nanoparticles concentration below 1000 ?g/ml was observed in the studies of in vitro cytotoxicity on normal and cancerous cell lines, respectively. The dose-dependent toxicity made it a suitable candidate for various medical applications. ? 2018 King Saud University","Cell culture; Coprecipitation; Cytotoxicity; Field emission microscopes; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Medical applications; Metal nanoparticles; Nanomagnetics; Saturation magnetization; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Cytotoxicity assays; Green husk; Green synthesis; Iron oxide nanoparticle; Juglans regia; Iron oxides"
"Increased Coffee Intake Reduces Circulating HBV DNA and HBsAg Levels in HBeAg-Negative Infection: A Cohort Study",2019,"Coffee is hepatoprotective and potentially antiviral; however, its anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV) property is not known in humans. This study investigated the influence of coffee drinking behaviour as well as clinical and biochemical profiles of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative participants on circulating HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels at a 24-week interval. Exactly 114 chronically HBV-infected adult participants were enrolled from the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Malaysia. A significant reduction of HBV DNA level was observed in those drinking three or more cups of coffee per day, with a median reduction of 523 IU/mL (P = 0.003). Reduction of HBsAg level was observed in those drinking two cups per day, with a median reduction of 37 IU/mL (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that increased coffee intake (P = 0.015) and lower ALT level (P = 0.033) were the significant predictors for a lower HBV DNA level, whereas increased coffee intake (P = 0.002) and having a family history of HBV infection (P = 0.021) were the significant predictors for a lower HBsAg level. These data suggest that drinking three cups or more coffee per day reduces circulating HBV DNA and HBsAg levels.",""
"Islamic Perspectives on CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Human Germline Gene Editing: A Preliminary Discussion",2020,"The recent development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has rekindled the ethical debate concerning human germline modification that has begun decades ago. This inexpensive technology shows tremendous promise in disease prevention strategies, while raising complex ethical concerns about safety and efficacy of the technology, human dignity, tampering with God’s creation, and human genetic enhancement. Germline gene editing may result in heritable changes in the human genome, therefore the question of whether it should be allowed requires deep and careful discussion from various perspectives. This paper explores Islamic perspectives on the concerns raised and highlights the ethical principles in Islam that should be taken into consideration when assessing the permissibility of CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated human germline gene editing. As argued in this paper, human germline gene editing would be considered lawful for medical purpose under certain conditions. It should not be applied on humans until the safety and efficacy issues are resolved. Robust ethical guidelines and strict regulations are necessary to preserve human dignity and to prevent premature and misuse of the technology. Maqasid al-shariah’s principles of preservation of human life, lineage, and dignity and ‘preventing harm takes precedence over securing benefit’ are among the guiding principles in assessing the permissibility of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated human germline editing from an Islamic perspective. Further discussions are important to address the controversies as well as to explore the related ethical principles. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",""
"Whole genome sequencing of amplified Plasmodium knowlesi DNA from unprocessed blood reveals genetic exchange events between Malaysian Peninsular and Borneo subpopulations",2019,"The zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi parasite is the most common cause of human malaria in Malaysia. Genetic analysis has shown that the parasites are divided into three subpopulations according to their geographic origin (Peninsular or Borneo) and, in Borneo, their macaque host (Macaca fascicularis or M. nemestrina). Whilst evidence suggests that genetic exchange events have occurred between the two Borneo subpopulations, the picture is unclear in less studied Peninsular strains. One difficulty is that P. knowlesi infected individuals tend to present with low parasitaemia leading to samples with insufficient DNA for whole genome sequencing. Here, using a parasite selective whole genome amplification approach on unprocessed blood samples, we were able to analyse recent genomes sourced from both Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. The analysis provides evidence that recombination events are present in the Peninsular Malaysia parasite subpopulation, which have acquired fragments of the M. nemestrina associated subpopulation genotype, including the DBPβ and NBPXa erythrocyte invasion genes. The NBPXb invasion gene has also been exchanged within the macaque host-associated subpopulations of Malaysian Borneo. Our work provides strong evidence that exchange events are far more ubiquitous than expected and should be taken into consideration when studying the highly complex P. knowlesi population structure. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"High-quality Schistosoma haematobium genome achieved by single-molecule and long-range sequencing",2019,"Background: Schistosoma haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease affecting >100 million people worldwide. Chronic infection with this parasitic trematode can lead to urogenital conditions including female genital schistosomiasis and bladder cancer. At the molecular level, little is known about this blood fluke and the pathogenesis of the disease that it causes. To support molecular studies of this carcinogenic worm, we reported a draft genome for S. haematobium in 2012. Although a useful resource, its utility has been somewhat limited by its fragmentation. Findings: Here, we systematically enhanced the draft genome of S. haematobium using a single-molecule and long-range DNA-sequencing approach. We achieved a major improvement in the accuracy and contiguity of the genome assembly, making it superior or comparable to assemblies for other schistosome species. We transferred curated gene models to this assembly and, using enhanced gene annotation pipelines, inferred a gene set with as many or more complete gene models as those of other well-studied schistosomes. Using conserved, single-copy orthologs, we assessed the phylogenetic position of S. haematobium in relation to other parasitic flatworms for which draft genomes were available. Conclusions: We report a substantially enhanced genomic resource that represents a solid foundation for molecular research on S. haematobium and is poised to better underpin population and functional genomic investigations and to accelerate the search for new disease interventions. ? 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

"Comprehensive functional profiling of long non-coding RNAs through a novel pan-cancer integration approach and modular analysis of their protein-coding gene association networks",2019,"Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulators of cellular processes in diseases such as cancer, although the functions of most remain poorly understood. To address this, here we apply a novel strategy to integrate gene expression profiles across 32 cancer types, and cluster human lncRNAs based on their pan-cancer protein-coding gene associations. By doing so, we derive 16 lncRNA modules whose unique properties allow simultaneous inference of function, disease specificity and regulation for over 800 lncRNAs. Results: Remarkably, modules could be grouped into just four functional themes: transcription regulation, immunological, extracellular, and neurological, with module generation frequently driven by lncRNA tissue specificity. Notably, three modules associated with the extracellular matrix represented potential networks of lncRNAs regulating key events in tumour progression. These included a tumour-specific signature of 33 lncRNAs that may play a role in inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition through modulation of TGFβ signalling, and two stromal-specific modules comprising 26 lncRNAs linked to a tumour suppressive microenvironment and 12 lncRNAs related to cancer-associated fibroblasts. One member of the 12-lncRNA signature was experimentally supported by siRNA knockdown, which resulted in attenuated differentiation of quiescent fibroblasts to a cancer-associated phenotype. Conclusions: Overall, the study provides a unique pan-cancer perspective on the lncRNA functional landscape, acting as a global source of novel hypotheses on lncRNA contribution to tumour progression. ? 2019 The Author(s).","long untranslated RNA; small interfering RNA; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; Article; cancer genetics; cancer growth; epithelial mesenchymal transition; extracellular matrix; fibroblast; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene knockdown; gene regulatory network; genetic association; genetic code; immune system; nervous system; phenotype; protein RNA binding; RNA analysis; stroma cell; TGF beta signaling; tissue specificity; transcription regulation; tumor microenvironment; biology; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic association study; genetics; human; neoplasm; pathology; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Neoplasms; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Microenvironment"
"High seroprevalence against typhus group and spotted fever group rickettsiae in rural indigenous populations of peninsular Malaysia",2019,"Rickettsioses of the typhus group (TG) and spotted fever group (SFG) are emerging bacterial infections worldwide, especially in the tropics. Only a few studies on these pathogens and their respective clinical diseases have been conducted in Malaysia. Here, we performed a seroprevalence study among 544 healthy, afebrile indigenous people (Orang Asli) from peninsular Malaysia for TG and SFG rickettsioses in nine rural and peri-urban settlements. The study population encompassed children, adolescents, and adults. The overall seroprevalence of rickettsiosis in the Orang Asli was 48.5%, with 27.9% seroprevalence against TG rickettsiae and 20.6% seroprevalence against SFG rickettsiae. In 7.9% of the study participants, antibodies against both rickettsial groups were found. The highest seropositivity rates against TG and SRG rickettsiae were detected in young children and adults. Overall, there were no gender differences. Seroprevalences were similar among inhabitants of different settlements, except for two localities. More studies are needed to shed more light on the ecology and risk factors for TG and SFG rickettsioses in Malaysia. ?

"Francisella spp. detected in Dermacentor ticks in Malaysian forest reserve areas",2019,"Limited information is available on tropical ticks and tick-borne bacteria affecting the health of humans and animals in the Southeast Asia region. Francisella tularensis is a tick-borne bacterium which causes a potentially life-threatening disease known as tularemia. This study was conducted to determine the occurrence of Francisella spp. in questing ticks collected from Malaysian forest reserve areas. A total of 106 ticks (mainly Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis spp.) were examined for Francisella DNA using a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting the bacterial 16S rDNA. Francisella DNA was detected from 12 Dermacentor ticks. Sequence analysis of the amplified 16S rDNA sequences (1035 bp) show >99% identity with that of Francisella endosymbiont reported in a tick from Thailand. A dendrogram constructed based on the bacterial 16S rDNA shows that the Francisella spp. were distantly related to the pathogenic strains of F. tularensis. Three Francisella-positive ticks were identified as Dermacentor atrosignatus, based on sequence analysis of the tick mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Further screening of cattle and sheep ticks (Haemaphysalis bispinosa and Rhipicephalus microplus) and animal samples (cattle, sheep, and goats) did not yield any positive findings. Our findings provide the first molecular data on the occurrence of a Francisella strain with unknown pathogenicity in Dermacentor questing ticks in Malaysia. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNA 16S; RNA 16S; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium detection; bovine; Dermacentor; Dermacentor atrosignatus; DNA extraction; forest; Francisella tularensis; gene sequence; goat; Haemaphysalis; Haemaphysalis bispinosa; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus; sequence analysis; sheep; tularemia"
"Position Statement on Secukinumab in the Management of Plaque Psoriasis: The Malaysian Perspective",2019,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting nearly 10% of dermatologic patients in Malaysia. Treatment options include topical agents and phototherapy as well as nonbiologic and biologic systemic therapy. Mild psoriasis can often be managed with topical agents. However, managing moderate to severe psoriasis is more challenging and may require systemic treatment with nonbiologics or biologics. Despite the availability of several biologics, there are many unmet clinical needs, which may be addressed by secukinumab, an IL-17A inhibitor. This position statement is based on an expert panel discussion and is intended to provide dermatologists an overview of existing options as well as to provide a better understanding of secukinumab and how it can be integrated into current practice. During the discussion, panel members examined current approaches and the role of secukinumab in plaque psoriasis management. Panel members estimated that up to 30% of patients have moderate to severe psoriasis but only 1-2% receive biologics. Highlights from the discussion were that (i) the threshold for biologic use should be lower, in line with international guidelines; (ii) studies have shown that secukinumab has several advantages over other biologics which are greater efficacy, sustained efficacy over time, rapid onset of action, and early evidence of possible disease-modifying potential; and (iii) ideal candidates for secukinumab are all patients of moderate to severe psoriasis, including those with history of treatment failure, difficult-to-treat patterns of psoriasis (nail, scalp, and palmoplantar psoriasis), psoriatic arthritis, and comorbidities and those aiming for clear skin. Panel members recommend that secukinumab be considered first line option among biologic therapies. ? 2019 Asmah Johar et al.","secukinumab; biological therapy; Dermatology Life Quality Index; disease severity; drug safety; human; Malaysia; nail psoriasis; patient monitoring; phototherapy; physician global assessment; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; psoriasis vulgaris; psoriatic arthritis; pustulosis palmoplantaris; Review; scalp psoriasis; scoring system; treatment failure; treatment response"

"Lipid lowering effect of Eurycoma longifolia Jack aqueous root extract in hepatocytes",2019,"An aqueous root extract of Eurycoma longifolia Jack, or natively known in Malay as Tongkat Ali, is traditionally used to overcome a plethora of health conditions, especially in andrological related maladies. There is compiling evidence that corroborates the therapeutic effects of this plant extract as an efficacious concoction. Recently, the potential for the plant extract to be used for the regulation of fat metabolism has also been proposed. Results from in vivo and human trials were unable to determine if a decrease in lipid deposits was caused by E. longifolia root extract or that it was merely a side effect of the reported physiological changes. Therefore, this study adopted an in vitro model to investigate whether E. longifolia root extract possesses lipid lowering and/or absorption inhibitory potentials. The human hepatic cell line WRL-68 (normal and fat fed) was treated with various concentrations (1, 2, 4 and 8 ?g/ml) of E. longifolia root extract. The results showed reductions in intracellular fatty acids build-up of up to ~72%, in treated cells when compared to untreated control cells. However, treatments with E. longifolia did not show any significant inhibition of fatty acids absorption when compared to the respective control cells. This study, therefore, unraveled a novel potential of intracellular lipid lowering effect of E. longifolia. The findings warrant further studies to elucidate the intracellular signaling mechanisms that may explain the phenomenon. ? 2019 University of Kuwait. All rights reserved.",""
"Cross cultural adaptation and validation of the Malay Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36?)",2019,"Background: In Malaysia, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is high (9.1%). To date, no questionnaire that specifically assesses the health-related quality of life of patients with chronic kidney disease has been validated in Malaysia. Malay is the national language of Malaysia and spoken by the majority of its citizens. Therefore, the aim of our study was to cross-culturally adapt and validate the Malay Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 (KDQOL-36) among patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods: The English version of the KDQOL-36 was translated according to international guidelines to Malay. Content validity was verified by an expert panel and piloted in five patients. Our instrument was then administered to patients with chronic kidney disease stage 1-3A and patients on hemodialysis at baseline and 4 weeks later. Results: A total of 181/232 patients agreed to participate (response rate = 78.0%). The majority were male (69.6%) with a median age of 51.0 years. Exploratory factor analysis found that the KDQOL-36 had three domains. All three domains showed low to moderate correlation (Spearman's Rho = 0.297-0.610) with the Europe Quality of Life Five Dimension questionnaire. Patients on hemodialysis (physical component summary = 39.8; mental component summary = 53.1;burden of disease = 37.5; symptoms/burden list = 75.0; effects of kidney disease on daily life = 68.8) had significantly worse quality of life than patients with chronic kidney disease stage 1-3A (physical component summary = 49.9; mental component summary = 52.9; burden of disease = 75.0; symptoms/burden list = 85.4; effects of kidney disease on daily life = 93.8, p < 0.001) except for the mental component summary. This indicates that the Malay KDQOL-36 has achieved adequate known-groups validity. Cronbach alpha ranged from 0.872-0.901, indicating adequate internal consistency. At retest, intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.584-0.902, indicating moderate to good correlation. Conclusion: The Malay Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 was found to be a valid and reliable tool to assess the quality of life in patients with chronic kidney disease. This tool can now be used to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic kidney disease, as HRQOL is an important independent predictor of patient outcome. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adaptation; adult; aged; Article; chronic kidney failure; clinical assessment tool; content validity; controlled study; cultural anthropology; disease burden; Europe Quality of Life Five Dimension questionnaire; exploratory factor analysis; female; hemodialysis; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; Malay (language); Malay Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36; male; medical expert; middle aged; practice guideline; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; symptom; validation study"
"One-carbon metabolism biomarkers and risk of urothelial cell carcinoma in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition",2019,"Published associations between dietary folate and bladder cancer risk are inconsistent. Biomarkers may provide more accurate measures of nutrient status. This nested case–control analysis within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) investigated associations between pre-diagnostic serum folate, homocysteine, vitamins B6 and B12 and the risk of urothelial cell carcinomas of the bladder (UCC). A total of 824 patients with newly diagnosed UCC were matched with 824 cohort members. Serum folate, homocysteine, and vitamins B6 and B12 were measured. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total, aggressive, and non-aggressive UCC were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for smoking status, smoking duration and intensity, and other potential confounders. Additionally, statistical interaction with smoking status was assessed. A halving in serum folate concentrations was moderately associated with risk of UCC (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.98–1.43), in particular aggressive UCC (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02–1.75; p-heterogeneity = 0.19). Compared to never smokers in the highest quartile of folate concentrations, this association seemed only apparent among current smokers in the lowest quartile of folate concentrations (OR: 6.26; 95% CI: 3.62–10.81, p-interaction = 0.07). Dietary folate was not associated with aggressive UCC (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.81–1.95; p-heterogeneity = 0.14). No association was observed between serum homocysteine, vitamins B6 and B12 and risk of UCC. This study suggests that lower serum folate concentrations are associated with increased UCC risk, in particular aggressive UCC. Residual confounding by smoking cannot be ruled out and these findings require confirmation in future studies with multiple measurements. ? 2019 The Authors.

"DTI profiles for rapid description of cohorts at the clinical-research interface",2019,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a syndrome comprising gait disturbance, cognitive decline and urinary incontinence that is an unique model of reversible brain injury, but it presents as a challenging spectrum of disease cohorts. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), with its ability to interrogate structural white matter patterns at a microarchitectural level, is a potentially useful tool for the confirmation and characterization of disease cohorts at the clinical-research interface. However, obstacles to its widespread use involve the need for consistent DTI analysis and interpretation tools across collaborator sites. We present the use of DTI profiles, a simplistic methodology to interpret white matter injury patterns based on the morphology of diffusivity parameters. We examined 13 patients with complex NPH, i.e., patients with NPH and overlay from multiple comorbidities, including vascular risk burden and neurodegenerative disease, undergoing extended CSF drainage, clinical assessments, and multi-modal MR imaging. Following appropriate exclusions, we compared the morphology of DTI profiles in such complex NPH patients (n = 12, comprising 4 responders and 8 non-responders) to exemplar DTI profiles from a cohort of classic NPH patients (n = 16) demonstrating responsiveness of white matter injury to ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. In the cohort of complex NPH patients, mean age was 71.3 ± 7.6 years (10 males, 2 females) with a mean MMSE score of 21.1. There were 5 age-matched healthy controls, mean age was 73.4 ± 7.2 years (1 male, 4 females) and mean MMSE score was 26.8. In the exemplar cohort of classic NPH patients, mean age was 74.7 ± 5.9 years (10 males, 6 females) and mean MMSE score was 24.1. There were 9 age-matched healthy controls, mean age was 69.4 ± 9.7 years (4 males, 5 females) and mean MMSE score was 28.6. We found that, despite the challenges of acquiring DTI metrics from differing scanners across collaborator sites and NPH patients presenting as differing cohorts along the spectrum of disease, DTI profiles for responsiveness to interventions were comparable. Distinct DTI characteristics were demonstrated for complex NPH responders vs. non-responders. The morphology of DTI profiles for complex NPH responders mimicked DTI patterns found in predominantly shunt-responsive patients undergoing intervention for classic NPH. However, DTI profiles for complex NPH non-responders was suggestive of atrophy. Our findings suggest that it is possible to use DTI profiles to provide a methodology for rapid description of differing cohorts of disease at the clinical-research interface. By describing DTI measures morphologically, it was possible to consistently compare white matter injury patterns across international collaborator datasets. ? 2019 Lock, Kwok, Kumar, Ahmad-Annuar, Narayanan, Ng, Tan, Kandiah, Tan, Czosnyka, Czosnyka, Pickard and Keong.","aged; Article; brain atrophy; brain injury; brain ventricle peritoneum shunt; cerebrospinal fluid drainage; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical research; cognition assessment; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; degenerative disease; diffusion tensor imaging; diffusivity; disease burden; female; gait; human; male; Mini Mental State Examination; morphology; multimodal imaging; normotensive hydrocephalus; prospective study; urine incontinence; white matter; white matter injury"
"The influence of age-associated comorbidities on responses to combination antiretroviral therapy in older people living with HIV",2019,"Introduction: Multiple comorbidities among HIV-positive individuals may increase the potential for polypharmacy causing drug-to-drug interactions and older individuals with comorbidities, particularly those with cognitive impairment, may have difficulty in adhering to complex medications. However, the effects of age-associated comorbidities on the treatment outcomes of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are not well known. In this study, we investigated the effects of age-associated comorbidities on therapeutic outcomes of cART in HIV-positive adults in Asian countries. Methods: Patients enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database cohort and on cART for more than six months were analysed. Comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and impaired renal function. Treatment outcomes of patients ?50?years of age with comorbidities were compared with those <50?years and those ?50?years without comorbidities. We analysed 5411 patients with virological failure and 5621 with immunologic failure. Our failure outcomes were defined to be in-line with the World Health Organization 2016 guidelines. Cox regression analysis was used to analyse time to first virological and immunological failure. Results: The incidence of virologic failure was 7.72/100 person-years. Virological failure was less likely in patients with better adherence and higher CD4 count at cART initiation. Those acquiring HIV through intravenous drug use were more likely to have virological failure compared to those infected through heterosexual contact. On univariate analysis, patients aged <50?years without comorbidities were more likely to experience virological failure than those aged ?50?years with comorbidities (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.33, p?<?0.001). However, the multivariate model showed that age-related comorbidities were not significant factors for virological failure (hazard ratio 1.31, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.74, p?=?0.07). There were 391 immunological failures, with an incidence of 2.75/100 person-years. On multivariate analysis, those aged <50?years without comorbidities (p?=?0.025) and age <50?years with comorbidities (p?=?0.001) were less likely to develop immunological failure compared to those aged ?50?years with comorbidities. Conclusions: In our Asia regional cohort, age-associated comorbidities did not affect virologic outcomes of cART. Among those with comorbidities, patients <50?years old showed a better CD4 response. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Malignant Transformation of a Rosette-Forming Glioneuronal Tumor with IDH1 Mutation: A Case Report and Literature Review",2019,"Background: Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (World Health Organization grade I) is considered as a benign tumor with very low potential for progression. The potential for malignant transformation of this tumor is not known and has never been reported before in literature. Case Description: We report a 42-year-old man, diagnosed with rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor of the fourth ventricle with a positive isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation, progressed to glioblastoma after 6 years from diagnosis. We discuss the clinical history, radiological findings, and histopathological characteristic with immunohistochemistry findings observed in this unique case. Conclusions: Despite being acceptable as benign, based on our observations in this case, there is a potential for malignant transformation of rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor. The role of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation leading to malignant transformation could not be established as our finding is novel and further prospective studies are required to prove this association. ? 2019 The Author(s)","glial fibrillary acidic protein; isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; Ki 67 antigen; synaptophysin; adult; Article; ataxia; benign nervous system tumor; brain fourth ventricle; cancer surgery; case report; clinical article; craniotomy; gene mutation; glioblastoma; headache; histopathology; human; human tissue; hydrocephalus; immunohistochemistry; male; malignant transformation; medical history; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; rosette forming glioneuronal tumor; unsteady gait"
"Using clinical practice guidelines to manage dengue: A qualitative study in a Malaysian hospital",2019,"Background: Malaysia has rising dengue incidence. World Health Organization clinical practice guidelines for managing dengue have been adapted by the Ministry of Health in Malaysia, with evidence of good awareness by clinicians. However, dengue mortality has not reduced. This study aimed to explore the challenges of dengue management for Medical Officers, with a particular focus on use of clinical practice guidelines. Methods: Qualitative study using six focus groups and 14 semi-structured interviews with doctors responsible for dengue management at a large tertiary hospital in Malaysia. Results: Dengue was recognised as difficult to diagnose and manage. Wide awareness and use of both WHO and Ministry of Health guidelines was reported, but several limitations noted in their coverage of particular patient groups. However, the phrase 'guidelines' also referred to local algorithms for fluid management, which were less clinically evidence-based. Where Medical Officers were well trained in the appropriate use of evidence-based guidelines, barriers to use included: the potential for 'following the algorithm' to undermine junior clinicians' claims to clinical expertise; inability to recognise the pattern of clinical progress; and lack of clinical experience. Other reported barriers to improved case management were resource constraints, poor referral practices, and insufficient awareness of the need for timely help seeking. Conclusions: Awareness of clinical practice guidelines is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for optimal dengue management. In high prevalence settings, all clinical staff would benefit from regular dengue management training which should include diagnosis, practice in monitoring disease progression and the use of clinical practice guidelines in a range of clinical contexts. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; awareness; cohort analysis; dengue; disease exacerbation; evidence based practice; fluid therapy; help seeking behavior; human; incidence; Malaysia; medical personnel; patient care; patient monitoring; practice guideline; primary medical care; qualitative research; semi structured interview; World Health Organization; dengue; health care personnel; information processing; patient referral; physician; practice guideline; tertiary care center; Dengue; Focus Groups; Health Personnel; Humans; Malaysia; Physicians; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Referral and Consultation; Tertiary Care Centers; World Health Organization"

"The effect of acute coronary syndrome care pathways on in-hospital patients: A systematic review",2019,"Background: Health care institutions need to construct management strategies for patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that focus on evidence-based treatments, adherence to treatment guidelines, and organized care. These help to reduce variations as well as the mortality and morbidity rates, which indicates the critical need for standardized care and adherence to evidence-based practices for patients hospitalized with ACS. The care pathways translate research and guidelines into clinical practice to close the gap between the guidelines and the clinical practices. Objectives: This review focuses on identifying the indicators used to evaluate ACS care pathways and their effect on the care process and clinical outcomes. Methods: This review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The systematic research was conducted using five research databases. Two groups were created by dividing the studies according to their year of publication. The first group included those studies published from 1997 to 2007 (“Group 1”), while the second included those published from 2008 to 2018 (“Group 2”). Selected studies were screened using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Results: Seventeen studies were included in this review. One study was a randomized controlled trial, 14 were predesigns and postdesigns, and two were longitudinal observational designs. The Group 1 studies demonstrated that ACS care pathways had a positive effect on reducing the length of the hospital stay and the door-to-balloon times. Similar effects were observed for the Group 2 studies. Conclusion: Implementing ACS care pathway helps to organize care processes and decrease treatment delays as well as improve the patient outcomes without adverse consequences for patients or additional resources and costs. While the current level of evidence is inadequate to warrant a formal recommendation, there is a need for more studies with an emphasis on well-designed randomization to measure patient outcomes. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",""
"A Community-Based Fault Isolation Approach for Effective Simultaneous Localization of Faults",2019,"During program testing, software programs may be discovered to contain multiple faults. Multiple faults in a program may reduce the effectiveness of the existing fault localization techniques due to the complex relationship between faults and failures in the presence of multiple faults. In an ideal case, faults are isolated into fault-focused clusters, each targeting a single fault for developers to localize them simultaneously in parallel. However, the relationship between faults and failures is not easily identified and depends solely on the accuracy of clustering, such as existing clustering algorithms are not able to isolate failed tests to their causative faults effectively which hinder localization effectiveness. This paper proposes a new approach that makes use of a divisive network community clustering algorithm to isolate faults into separate fault-focused communities that target a single fault each. A community weighting and a selection mechanism that aids in prioritizing highly important fault-focused communities to the available developers to debug the faults simultaneously in parallel is also proposed. The approach is evaluated on eight subject programs ranging from medium-sized to large-sized programs (tcas, replace, gzip, sed, flex, grep, make, and ant). Overall, 540 multiple-fault versions of these programs were generated with 2-5 faulty versions. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach performs significantly better in terms of localization effectiveness in comparison with two other parallel debugging approaches for locating multiple faults in parallel. ? 2013 IEEE.","Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Software testing; Complex relationships; Fault isolation; Fault localization; Multiple faults; Network communities; Parallel debugging; Selection mechanism; Software program; Program debugging"
"P53, stem cell biology and childhood blastomas",2019,"Purpose of reviewChildhood blastomas, unlike adult cancers, originate from developing organs in which molecular and cellular features exhibit differentiation arrest and embryonic characteristics. Conventional cancer therapies, which rely on the generalized cytotoxic effect on rapidly dividing cells, may damage delicate organs in young children, leading to multiple late effects. Deep understanding of the biology of embryonal cancers is crucial in reshaping the cancer treatment paradigm for children.Recent findingsp53 plays a major physiological role in embryonic development, by controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and responses to cellular stress. Tumor suppressor function of p53 is commonly lost in adult cancers through genetic alterations. However, both somatic and germline p53 mutations are rare in childhood blastomas, suggesting that in these cancers, p53 may be inactivated through other mechanisms than mutation. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about p53 pathway inactivation in childhood blastomas (specifically neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumor) through various upstream mechanisms. Laboratory evidence and clinical trials of targeted therapies specific to exploiting p53 upstream regulators are discussed.SummaryDespite the low rate of inherent TP53 mutations, p53 pathway inactivation is a common denominator in childhood blastomas. Exploiting p53 and its regulators is likely to translate into more effective targeted therapies with minimal late effects for children.

"Outcome of expandable endoprosthesis: A single centre retrospective review",2019,"Purpose: Expandable endoprosthesis allows limb salvage in children with an option to leading a better life. However, the revision rate and implant-related complications impose as a limitation in the skeletal immature. This study investigates the functional outcomes and complications related to expandable endoprosthesis in our centre. Materials and Methods: Twenty surviving patients with expandable endoprosthesis from 2006 till 2015 were scored using Musculoskeletal Tumour Society (MSTS) outcomes instrument and reviewed retrospectively for range of motion of respected joints, limb length discrepancy, number of surgeries performed, complications and oncological outcomes. Patients with less than 2 years of follow-up were excluded from this study. Results: Forty-five percentage patients reached skeletal maturity with initial growing endoprosthesis and 25% of patients were revised to adult modular prosthesis. One hundred fifty-seven surgeries were performed over the 9-year period. The average MSTS score was 90.83%. The mortality rate was 10% within 5 years due to advanced disease. Infection and implant failure rate was 15% each. The event-free survival was 50% and overall survival rate was 90%. Conclusion: There is no single best option for reconstruction in skeletally immature. This study demonstrates a favourable functional and survival outcome of paediatric patients with expandable endoprosthesis. The excellent MSTS functional scores reflect that patients were satisfied and adjusted well to activities of daily living following surgery despite the complications. ?

"Real-world experience of first-line afatinib in patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC: A multicenter observational study",2019,"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, side-effects and resistance mechanisms of first-line afatinib in a real-world setting. Methods: This is a multicenter observational study of first-line afatinib in Malaysian patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients' demographic, clinical and treatment data, as well as resistance mechanisms to afatinib were retrospectively captured. The statistical methods included Chi-squared test and independent t-test for variables, Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test for survival, and Cox regression model for multivariate analysis. Results: Eighty-five patients on first-line afatinib from 1st October 2014 to 30th April 2018 were eligible for the study. EGFR mutations detected in tumors included exon 19 deletion in 80.0%, exon 21 L858R point mutation in 12.9%, and rare or complex EGFR mutations in 7.1% of patients. Among these patients, 18.8% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2-4, 29.4% had symptomatic brain metastases and 17.6% had abnormal organ function. Afatinib 40 mg or 30 mg once daily were the most common starting and maintenance doses. Only one-tenth of patients experienced severe side-effects with none having grade 4 toxicities. The objective response rate was 76.5% while the disease control rate was 95.3%. At the time of analysis, 56 (65.9%) patients had progression of disease (PD) with a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 14.2 months (95% CI, 11.85-16.55 months). Only 12.5% of the progressed patients developed new symptomatic brain metastases. The overall survival (OS) data was not mature. Thirty-three (38.8%) patients had died with a median OS of 28.9 months (95% CI, 19.82-37.99 months). The median follow-up period for the survivors was 20.0 months (95% CI, 17.49-22.51 months). Of patients with PD while on afatinib, 55.3% were investigated for resistance mechanisms with exon 20 T790 M mutation detected in 42.0% of them. Conclusions: Afatinib is an effective first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC with a good response rate and long survival, even in patients with unfavorable clinical characteristics. The side-effects of afatinib were manageable and T790 M mutation was the most common resistance mechanism causing treatment failure. ? 2019 The Author(s).","afatinib; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; aged; clinical trial; female; genetics; human; lung tumor; male; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Afatinib; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; ErbB Receptors; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"
"Acceptability of Women Self-Sampling versus Clinician-Collected Samples for HPV DNA Testing: A Systematic Review",2019,"Objectives Female self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is an alternative screening method that can potentially increase cervical cancer screening coverage. This review addresses the acceptability of HPV DNA testing using self-sampling compared with conventional clinician-collected sampling. Barriers to and others factors associated with acceptability of either method were also examined. Methods The following electronic resources were searched: Medline @EBSCOHOST(Medline), Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL databases. Manual searches were also conducted. The main outcome of interest was the acceptability of HPV DNA testing by self-sampling in comparison with clinician-collected sampling. Results In total, 23 articles were included in this systematic review. The majority (19 studies) were quantitative intervention studies and 4 studies were qualitative observational studies. Eleven studies reported a preference for self-sampling by women compared with clinician-collected sampling (64.7%-93%). The remaining studies found that women preferred clinician-collected sampling because mainly of respondents' lack of confidence in their ability to complete self-sampling correctly. In most articles reviewed, the studied associated factors, such as demographic factors (age, marital status, and ethnicity), socioeconomic factors (income, education level), reproductive factors (condom use, number of children, current use of contraception, and number of partners), and habits (smoking status) were not found to be significantly associated with preference. Conclusions Both methods of sampling were found to be acceptable to women. Self-sampling is cost-effective and could increase the screening coverage among underscreened populations. However, more information about the quality, reliability, and accuracy of self-sampling is needed to increase women's confidence about using to this method. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","age; child; Cinahl; clinician; condom use; contraception; controlled study; disease course; education; Embase; ethnicity; female; habit; human; human experiment; human tissue; intervention study; marriage; Medline; nonhuman; observational study; outcome assessment; Papanicolaou test; reliability; review; sampling; smoking; socioeconomics; systematic review; Wart virus; adolescent; adult; aged; comparative study; isolation and purification; mass screening; middle aged; Papillomaviridae; papillomavirus infection; patient attitude; procedures; self examination; specimen handling; very elderly; young adult; virus DNA; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; DNA, Viral; Female; Humans; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Papillomaviridae; Papillomavirus Infections; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Self-Examination; Specimen Handling; Young Adult"

"Population indices measuring health outcomes: A scoping review",2019,"Background Population health indices such as disability adjusted life years (DALY) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) are often used in an effort to measure health of populations and identify areas of concern that require interventions. There has been an increase of number of population health indices since the last review published more than a decade ago. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of existing population health indices and examine the methods used to develop them. Methods The search was conducted across three databases: PubMed, CINAHL and Emerald using four key concepts: 'health', 'index', 'context', 'develop', which was supplemented with Google searching and reference scanning. A researcher screened the titles, abstracts and subsequently full texts and confirmed the findings with the research team at each stage. Data charting was performed according to the included publications and identified indices. The collation was performed by describing the indices and made observation on its development method using a priori framework consist of four processes: underpinning theory, model or framework; data selection and processing; formation of index; testing of index. Results Twenty-six publications describing population health indices were included, and 27 indices were identified. These indices covered the following health topics: overall health outcomes (n = 15), outcomes for specific health topics (n = 4), diseases outcome (n = 6), assist health resource allocation for priority minority subgroup or geographic area (n = 4), quality of health or health care (n = 2). Twenty-one indices measure health for general populations while six measure defined subpopulations. Fourteen of the indices reported at least one of the development processes according to the a priori framework: underpinning theory, model or framework (n = 7); data selection and processing (n = 8); formation of index (n = 12); testing of index (n = 9). Conclusions Few population health indices measure specific health topics or health of specific sub-population. There is also a lack of usage of theories, models or framework in developing these indices. Efforts to develop a guideline is proposed on how population health indices can be developed systematically and rigorously to ensure validity and comprehensive assessment of the indices. ? 2019 The Author(s) JoGH.","health status indicator; human; population health; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Population Health"
"Religion, Spirituality and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease: A Matched Case–Control Study and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Although the association between religion/spirituality (R/S) and psychological outcomes is well established, current understanding of the association with cardiovascular disease remains limited. We sought to investigate the association between Islamic R/S and coronary heart disease (CHD), and place these findings in light of a meta-analysis. In this case–control study, 190 cases with non-fatal CHD were identified and individually matched with 383 hospital-based controls. R/S was measured by self-administered 102 items questionnaire. A tabular meta-analysis was performed of observational studies on R/S (high level versus low level) and CHD. In addition, a dose–response meta-analysis was conducted using generalized least-squares regression. Participants in the top quartile had decreased odds of CHD comparing to participants in the lowest quartile of religious belief (OR 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06–0.59), religious commitment (OR 0.36, CI 95% 0.13–0.99), religious emotions (OR 0.39, CI 95% 0.18–0.87), and total R/S score (OR 0.30, CI 95% 0.13–0.67). The meta-analysis study showed a significant relative risk of 0.88 (CI 95% 0.77–1.00) comparing individuals in high level versus low level of R/S. In dose–response meta-analysis, comparing people with no religious services attendance, the relative risks of CHD were 0.77 (CI 95% 0.65–0.91) for one times attendance and 0.27 (CI 95% 0.11–0.65) for five times attendance per month. R/S was associated with a significantly decreased risk of CHD. The possible causal nature of the observed associations warrants randomized clinical trial with large sample size. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Assessing mental health and service needs among refugees in Malaysia",2019,"Refugees in Malaysia often experience economic insecurity and poverty, poor health, poor mental wellbeing and limited legal rights. Using a survey with quantitative measures and open-ended questions, we assessed socio-demographic characteristics, mental health (RHS-15), and service needs, including interest in group support services, among 86 Dari- and Arabic-speaking refugees living in Kuala Lumpur. High levels of emotional distress were found, as nearly all participants scored positive for distress and average scores were 2.5 times above the cut-off signifying distress. Distress scores did not vary based on most factors examined, although being married was associated with lower levels of distress. All but one participant expressed interest in participating in a support group. Barriers to potential participation included childcare, sickness and transportation. Additional mental health and social supports are needed among refugees residing in Malaysia. Key Practitioner Message: ? Emotional distress is high among Dari- and Arabic-speaking refugees sampled in Malaysia; ? Participants expressed strong interest in accessing supportive mental health services, including group supports. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Role of coaggregation in the pathogenicity and prolonged colonisation of Vibrio cholerae",2019,"Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The pathogen is known for its ability to form biofilm that confers protection against harsh environmental condition and as part of the colonisation process during infection. Coaggregation is a process that facilitates the formation of biofilm. In a preliminary in vitro study, high coaggregation index and biofilm production were found between V. cholerae with human commensals namely Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Building upon these results, the effects of coaggregation were further evaluated using adult BALB/c mouse model. The animal study showed no significant differences in mortality and fluid accumulation ratio between treatment groups infected with V. cholerae alone and those infected with coaggregation partnership (V. cholerae with E. coli or V. cholerae with E. cloacae). However, mild inflammation was detected in both partnering pairs. Higher density of V. cholerae was recovered from faecal samples of mice co-infected with E. coli and V. cholerae in comparison with other groups at 24?h post-infection. This partnership also elicited slightly higher levels of interleukin-5 (IL-5) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Nonetheless, the involvement of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) as the signalling molecules in quorum sensing system is not evident in this study. Since E. coli is one of the common commensals, our result may suggest the involvement of commensals in cholera development. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","interleukin 10; interleukin 5; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterial count; bacterial virulence; Bagg albino mouse; bioaccumulation; biofilm; cholera; commensal Escherichia coli; controlled study; disease severity; Enterobacter cloacae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; Escherichia coli infection; feces microflora; female; in vitro study; inflammation; microbial activity; mixed infection; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; quorum sensing; signal transduction; Vibrio cholerae"
"A review on the accuracy of bladder cancer detection methods",2019,"Background and purpose: Bladder cancer is the most common malignant tumour in the urinary system, with a high incidence and recurrence rate. While the incidence of bladder cancer has been rising in recent years, the prevalence of bladder carcinoma is showing an increasing tendency in the younger age group. There are several methods to detect bladder cancer, but different methods have varying degrees of accuracy which intrinsically depends on the method’s sensitivity and specificity. Our aim was to comprehensively summarize the current detection methods for bladder cancer based on the available literature, and at the same time, to find the best combination of different effective methods which can produce a high degree of accuracy in detecting the presence of cancerous cells in the bladder. Materials and Methods: We used key word retrieval method for searching related references in English that had been indexed in PubMed and Medline. Results and Discussion: This paper discussed the different detection methods and their sensitivities/specificities as well as the advantages and disadvantages. We summarized the best identified cancer cell detection methods with higher sensitivity/specificity. Conclusion: The results of this review can positively help to identify accurate methods for detecting bladder cancer and highlight areas to be further improved for future research work. ?

"In-vitro cytotoxicity of Trigona itama honey against human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549)",2019,"Introduction: Many efforts have been made to identify natural alternatives to reduce the side effects of cytotoxic drugs in cancer treatment. With this in mind, the current study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity effects of one of the multifloral Malaysian honey, Kelulut honey (Trigona itama), as a potential natural anticancer agent in stimulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest to a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549). Methods: The cells were treated with various concentrations of T. itama honey for 24, 48 and 72 h. The cytotoxicity and cell viability were determined using trypan blue exclusion assay (TBEA) and flow cytometric analysis. Results: The moisture content in the analysed honey was 14.3 ± 0.8%, which was within the accepted international standard. The pH, electrical conductivity and proline content were 3.17 ± 0.02, 0.47 mS/cm - 0.55 mS/cm and 19.1 mg/kg 20.2 mg/kg respectively. The findings demonstrated a significant dose and time-dependent inhibitory effect of T. itama honey with the maximum cytotoxic effects observed at 72 h with 20% concentration of T. itama honey, indicating 100% growth inhibition. Meanwhile, IC50 of T. itama honey treatment for A549 cells was determined as 0.62% v/v. Moreover, T. itama honey had a promising cytotoxic effect and proven capable of inducing cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase at 72 h of exposure with IC50 concentration. Conclusion: This study provided prefatory evidence on T. itama honey's significant anticancer activity against human lung cancer cell lines. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH","proline; proline; A-549 cell line; A-549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer inhibition; cell viability; cell viability; concentration response; concentration response; controlled study; controlled study; cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity; electric conductivity; electric conductivity; flow cytometry; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; honey; honey; human; human; human cell; human cell; IC50; IC50; in vitro study; in vitro study; lung adenocarcinoma cell line; lung adenocarcinoma cell line; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; moisture; moisture; nonhuman; nonhuman; pH; pH; priority journal; priority journal; trypan blue assay; trypan blue assay"
"Numerical modeling of hybrid supercapacitor battery energy storage system for electric vehicles",2019,"Electric vehicle (EV) has been steadily gaining attention and as a viable alternative to mitigate pressing global energy crisis and environmental issues caused by conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Nonetheless, the dynamic operation of EV encompassing high charging and discharging currents generated from regenerative braking and acceleration, respectively, may adversely affect the cycle life of the conventional energy storage system. Hence, incorporation of supercapacitors into the energy storage system is recommended in view of its superior cycle efficiency and high power density, which aids in relieving the battery's stress and thus extends its cycle life. In this study, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors are modeled to evaluate its electrical and thermal performances under different driving cycles. The results obtained reveal that the dynamic stress, peak power demand and thermal performance of the battery have been significantly improved by incorporating supercapacitors into the battery pack in HESS. In comparison with the conventional battery energy storage system, the peak current demands of the battery in HESS for UDDS and US06 cycles have been reduced by 63%, 72.9% and 71.7%, respectively. This approach has shown to be effective in extending the battery's lifespan and is able to improve the safety and reliability of the conventional battery energy storage system. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Cynometra cauliflora Linn. Attenuates metabolic abnormalities in high-fat diet-induced obese mice",2019,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cynometra cauliflora Linn. belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known locally in Malaysia as nam-nam. Traditionally, a decoction of the C. cauliflora leaves is used for treating hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate the anti-obesity and lipid lowering effects of ethanolic extract of C. cauliflora leaves and its major compound (vitexin) in C57BL/6 obese mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD), as well as to further identify the molecular mechanism underlying this action. Methods and material: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with HFD (60% fat) for 16 weeks to become obese. The treatment started during the last 8 weeks of HFD feeding and the obese mice were treated with C. cauliflora leaf extract at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day, orlistat (10 mg/kg) and vitexin (10 mg/kg). Results: The oral administration of C. cauliflora (400 and 200 mg/kg) and vitexin significantly reduced body weight, adipose tissue and liver weight and lipid accumulation in the liver compared to control HFD group. Both doses of C. cauliflora also significantly (P ? 0.05) decreased serum triglyceride, LDL, lipase, IL-6, peptide YY, resistin levels, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia compared to the control HFD group. Moreover, C. cauliflora significantly up-regulated the expression of adiponectin, Glut4, Mtor, IRS-1 and InsR genes, and significantly decreased the expression of Lepr in white adipose tissue. Furthermore, C. cauliflora significantly up-regulated the expression of hypothalamus Glut4, Mtor and NF-kB genes. GC-MS analysis of C. cauliflora leaves detected the presence of phytol, vitamin E and β-sitosterol. Besides, the phytochemical evaluation of C. cauliflora leaves showed the presence of flavonoid, saponin and phenolic compounds. Conclusion: This study shows interesting outcomes of C. cauliflora against HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities. Therefore, the C. cauliflora extract could be a potentially effective agent for obesity management and its related metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adiponectin; alpha tocopherol; antiobesity agent; Cynometra cauliflora extract; glucose transporter 4; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insulin receptor substrate 1; interleukin 6; low density lipoprotein; mammalian target of rapamycin; peptide YY; phytol; plant extract; resistin; sitosterol; tetrahydrolipstatin; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; vitexin; antiobesity agent; cytokine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; plant extract; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; body weight loss; controlled study; Cynometra cauliflora; diet induced obesity; Fabaceae; gene; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hyperleptinemia; hypothalamus; insr gene; lepr gene; lipid storage; liver weight; male; mass fragmentography; mouse; nonhuman; plant leaf; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; chemistry; drug effect; enzymology; Fabaceae; isolation and purification; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; liver; metabolism; obesity; oral drug administration; Administration, Oral; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Cytokines; Diet, High-Fat; Fabaceae; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Plant Extracts; Triglycerides"
"Immune responses against enterovirus A71 infection: Implications for vaccine success",2019,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) from the Picornaviridae family is an important emerging pathogen causing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks worldwide. EV-A71 also caused fatal neurological complications in young children especially in Asia. On the basis of seroepidemiological studies from many Asian countries, EV-A71 infection is very common. Children of very young age are particularly vulnerable. Large-scale epidemics that occur every 3 to 4 years are associated with accumulation of an immunologically naive younger population. Capsid proteins especially VP1 with the presence of major B- and T-cell epitopes are the most antigenic proteins. The nonstructural proteins mainly contribute to T-cell epitopes that induce cross-reactive immune responses against other enteroviruses. Dominant epitopes and their neutralization magnitudes differ in mice, rabbits, and humans. Neutralizing antibody is sufficient for immune protection, but poorer cellular immunity may lead to severe neurological complications and deaths. Some chemokines/cytokines are consistently found in severely ill patients, for example, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, MCP-1, IL-8, MIG, IP-10, IFN-γ, and G-CSF. An increase in white cell counts is a risk factor for severe HFMD. Recent clinical trials on EV-A71 inactivated vaccine showed >90% efficacy and a robust neutralization response that was protective, indicating neutralizing antibody correlates for protection. No protection against other enteroviruses was observed. A comprehensive understanding of the immune responses to EV-A71 infection will benefit the development of diagnostic tools, potential therapeutics, and subunit vaccine candidates. Future development of a multivalent enterovirus vaccine will require knowledge of correlates of protection, understanding of cross-protection and memory T-cell responses among enteroviruses. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Enterovirus vaccine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; inactivated vaccine; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; neutralizing antibody; protein VP1; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; cellular immunity; cross protection; disease exacerbation; Enterovirus A71; Enterovirus infection; human; humoral immunity; immune response; innate immunity; Leporidae; leukocyte count; memory T lymphocyte; mouse; nonhuman; prevention and control; Review; seroepidemiology"
"Prevalence of limited health literacy among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review",2019,"BACKGROUND: Health literacy (HL) skills are essential to enable self-management and shared decision-making in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Limited HL in these patients is associated with poorer outcomes. It is not clear what the burden of limited HL in patients with T2DM across countries and what factors influence it. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017056150). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ERIC for articles published up to January 2017. Articles that measured HL levels in adult patients with T2DM; that used validated HL tools; and that were reported in English were included. Two reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and quality, and extracted the data. Prevalence of limited HL is calculated from the number of patients with less than adequate HL over the total number of patients with T2DM in the study. Meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were conducted using the Open Meta-analyst software. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies involving 13,457 patients with T2DM from seven countries were included. In total, seven different HL measurement tools were used. The prevalence of limited HL ranged from 7.3% to 82%, lowest in Switzerland and the highest in Taiwan. Meta-regression analysis of all included studies showed the country of study (p<0.001), HL tool used (p = 0.002), and the country's region (p<0.001) contributed to the variation findings. Thirteen studies in the USA measured functional HL. The pooled prevalence of inadequate functional HL among patients with T2DM in the USA was 28.9% (95% CI: 20.4-37.3), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 97.9%, p <0.001). Studies were done in the community as opposed to a hospital or primary care (p = 0.005) and populations with education level lower than high school education (p = 0.009) reported a higher prevalence of limited HL. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of limited HL in patients with T2DM varied widely between countries, HL tools used and the country's region. Pooled prevalence showed nearly one in three patients with T2DM in the USA had limited functional HL. Interactions with healthcare providers and educational attainment were associated with reported of prevalence in the USA.","adult; health literacy; human; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prevalence; Adult; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Health Literacy; Humans; Prevalence"
"Financial toxicity and its associations with health-related quality of life among urologic cancer patients in an upper middle-income country",2020,"Purpose: This study examined the prevalence of financial toxicity (FT) and associated factors among urologic cancer patients. The association between FT and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was also investigated. Methods: A total of 429 respondents diagnosed with urologic cancers (prostate cancer, bladder and renal cancer) from Sarawak General Hospital and Subang Jaya Medical Centre in Malaysia were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Objective and subjective FT were measured by catastrophic health expenditure (healthcare-cost-to-income ratio greater than 40%) and the Personal Financial Well-being Scale, respectively. HRQoL was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General 7 Items scale. Results: Objective and subjective FT were experienced by 16.1 and 47.3% of the respondents, respectively. Respondents who sought treatment at a private hospital and had out-of-pocket health expenditures were more likely to experience objective FT, after adjustment for covariates. Respondents who were female and had a monthly household income less than MYR 5000 were more likely to experience average to high subjective FT. Greater objective FT (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.09–6.95) and subjective FT (OR = 4.68, 95% CI 2.63–8.30) were associated with poor HRQoL. Conclusions: The significant association between both objective and subjective FT and HRQoL highlights the importance of reducing FT among urologic cancer patients. Subjective FT was found to have a greater negative impact on HRQoL. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","antineoplastic agent; hormone; aged; Article; bladder cancer; cancer hormone therapy; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; cross-sectional study; female; financial deficit; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy; general hospital; health care cost; household income; human; kidney cancer; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle income country; prevalence; priority journal; private hospital; prospective study; prostate cancer; public hospital; quality of life; structured questionnaire; tertiary care center; urinary tract cancer"
"Chitosan complexed carboxymethylated iota-carrageenan oral insulin particles: Stability, permeability and in vivo evaluation",2019,"We previously reported that insulin-entrapped chitosan complexed carboxymethylated iota-carrageenan (CS/CMCi) particles exhibit pH-responsive swelling behavior. However, the particles’ stability in the enzymatic gastrointestinal environment, their drug permeability mechanism, and related in vivo studies have not been discussed to date. In this study, we investigated the stability, muco-adhesiveness, transport mechanism and in vivo assessment of the particles. The particles retained their bioactivity and displayed a generally stable behavior in the simulated enzymatic environment of the gastrointestinal tract with high muco-adhesiveness (79.1 ± 4.3%). The results of cellular membrane permeability experiments further suggested that insulin from the insulin-entrapped particles was transported across the Caco-2 cell monolayers mainly via the paracellular pathway. This activity was inferred by the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of the insulin-entrapped particles (22-fold greater than control insulin solution), suggesting that the opening of tight junctions (TJs) of Caco-2 cells was involved in the process. The particles did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at 0.5–10.0 mg/mL based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salts (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Additionally, an in vivo study with diabetic Sprague Dawley (SD) rats revealed an extended blood glucose-lowering effect for up to 36 h (Cmax: 175.1 ± 23.7 mIU/L, Tmax: 5 h, AUC: 1789.4 ± 158.6). The estimated bioavailability of insulin from CS/CMCi particles in humans was 44.7–46.9%, which may be increased three fold compared with rats. Thus, the above results support the effectiveness of chitosan-complexed carboxymethylated iota-carrageenan particles as an oral insulin delivery system for extended glycemic control in basal insulin therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adhesives; Biochemistry; Cell membranes; Chitosan; Controlled drug delivery; Cytotoxicity; Rats; Diabetes mellitus; Electrical resistances; Gastrointestinal tract; Glycemia; Intestinal transport; Lactate dehydrogenase assays; pH-responsive swellings; Proteolytic; Insulin"
"Environmental study of developing index on the health and well-being of occupants in affordable housing in Malaysia",2019,"The rise of affordable housing in Malaysia has inspired a study on the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of affordable housing. This is because there are several studies that have proven that IEQ influences the health and wellbeing of the residents. The study was conducted in four different apartment developments in Klang Valley, Malaysia, by using a questionnaire survey. The Human Development Index (HDI) is developed based on the data collected from the study, using the formula provided by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Malaysia in their annual Malaysia Youth Index report (IBM). The HDI has indicated that the health and well-being of the occupants in Malaysian affordable housing developments are at the neutral category, scoring 72.16 over 100. Physical condition stands at an index score of 74.29 whilst no fatigue is at poor level with a score of 56.82, whereas for psychological condition, all the indicators are in the neutral category except for No annoyance item, which is in the good category. The index was developed for IEQ factors in affordable housing with data collected from the questionnaire survey. The index developed has shown that factors of IEQ are in both the Extremely disappointed range and the Extremely important range. The acoustic comfort factor gained the lowest score for level of satisfaction whilst indoor air quality gained the highest score for level of importance of IEQ. Noise level scored the lowest in the level of satisfaction and state of health scored the highest score for level of importance. This study aims to provide an overview on the health and wellbeing of occupants in Malaysian affordable housing and to assist the improvement of affordable housing for future development in order to improve the quality of life of residents in affordable housing developments. ?

"Carnosine exhibits significant antiviral activity against Dengue and Zika virus",2019,"Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are flaviviruses transmitted to humans by their common vector, Aedes mosquitoes. DENV infection represents one of the most widely spread mosquito-borne diseases whereas ZIKV infection occasionally re-emerged in the past causing outbreaks. Although there have been considerable advances in understanding the pathophysiology of these viruses, no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of carnosine, an endogenous dipeptide (β-alanyl-l-histidine), against DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) and ZIKV infection in human liver cells (Huh7). Computational studies were performed to predict the potential interactions between carnosine and viral proteins. Biochemical and cell-based assays were performed to validate the computational results. Mode-of-inhibition, plaque reduction, and immunostaining assays were performed to determine the antiviral activity of carnosine. Exogenous carnosine showed minimal cytotoxicity in Huh7 cells and rescued the viability of infected cells with EC50 values of 52.3 and 59.5 μM for DENV2 and ZIKV infection, respectively. Based on the mode-of-inhibition assays, carnosine inhibited DENV2 mainly by inhibiting viral genome replication and interfering with virus entry. Carnosine antiviral activity was verified with immunostaining assay where carnosine treatment diminished viral fluorescence signal. In conclusion, carnosine exhibited significant inhibitory effects against DENV2 and ZIKV replication in human liver cells and could be utilized as a lead peptide for the development of effective and safe antiviral agents against DENV and ZIKV. ? 2019 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carnosine; viral protein; antivirus agent; carnosine; antiviral activity; Article; cell viability; dengue; Dengue virus; Dengue virus 2; EC50; Huh-7 cell line; immunohistochemistry; liver cell; mosquito; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; protein interaction; Vero cell line; virus entry; virus genome; virus load; virus replication; virus titration; virus transmission; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; cell survival; Chlorocebus aethiops; dengue; drug effect; human; microbial sensitivity test; Zika fever; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Carnosine; Cell Survival; Chlorocebus aethiops; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Vero Cells; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection"
"A Cytotoxic Indole Characterized by Incorporation of a Unique Carbon-Nitrogen Skeleton and Two Pentacyclic Corynanthean Alkaloids Incorporating a Substituted Tetrahydrofuranone Ring from Kopsia arborea",2019,"Three new alkaloids were isolated from the bark extract of the Malayan Kopsia arborea, viz., arbophyllidine (1), an unusual pentacyclic, monoterpenoid indole characterized by an absence of oxygen atoms and incorporating a new carbon-nitrogen skeleton, and arbophyllinines A (2) and B (3), two pentacyclic corynanthean alkaloids incorporating a hydroxyethyl-substituted tetrahydrofuranone ring. The structures of the alkaloids were deduced based on analysis of the MS and NMR data and confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses. The absolute configuration of arbophyllidine (1) was established based on experimental and calculated ECD data, while that of arbophyllinine A was based on X-ray diffraction analysis (Cu Kα). A reasonable biosynthetic route to arbophyllidine (1) from a pericine precursor is presented.

"Inhibition of oncogenic kinases: An in vitro validated computational approach identified potential multi-target anticancer compounds",2019,"Tumorigenesis in humans is a multistep progression that imitates genetic changes leading to cell transformation and malignancy. Oncogenic kinases play a central role in cancer progression, rendering them putative targets for the design of anti-cancer drugs. The presented work aims to identify the potential multi-target inhibitors of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and serine/threonine kinases (STKs). For this, chemoinformatics and structure-based virtual screening approaches were combined with an in vitro validation of lead hits on both cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. A total of 16 different kinase structures were screened against ~739,000 prefiltered compounds using diversity selection, after which the top hits were filtered for promising pharmacokinetic properties. This led to the identification of 12 and 9 compounds against RTKs and STKs, respectively. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to better comprehend the stability of the predicted hit kinase-compound complexes. Two top-ranked compounds against each kinase class were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity, with compound F34 showing the most promising inhibitory activity in HeLa, HepG2, and Vero cell lines with IC50 values of 145.46 μM, 175.48 μM, and 130.52 μM, respectively. Additional docking of F34 against various RTKs was carried out to support potential multi-target inhibition. Together with reliable MD simulations, these results suggest the promising potential of identified multi-target STK and RTK scaffolds for further kinase-specific anti-cancer drug development toward combinatorial therapies. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Mindfulness-based stress reduction for psychological distress among nurses: A systematic review",2019,"Aims and objectives: To explore the studies that used interventions based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for decreasing psychological distress among nurses. Background: Because of the demanding nature of their work, nurses often have significantly high levels of stress, anxiety and depression. MBSR has been reported to be an effective intervention to decrease psychological distress. Design: Systematic review. Methods: The databases included were Science Direct, PubMed, EBSCO host, Springer Link and Web of Science from 2002 to 2018. Interventional studies published in English that used MBSR among nurses to reduce their psychological distress were retrieved for review. The PRISMA guideline was used in this systematic review. The included studies were assessed for quality using “The Quality Assessment Tool For Quantitative Studies (QATFQS).”. Results: Nine studies were found to be eligible and included in this review. Many benefits, including reduced stress, anxiety, depression, burnout and better job satisfaction, were reported in these studies. Conclusion: The adapted/brief versions of MBSR seem promising for reducing psychological distress in nurses. Future research should include randomised controlled trials with a larger sample size and follow-up studies. There should also be a focus on creative and effective ways of delivering MBSR to nurses. Relevance to clinical practice: The results of this review are substantial for supporting the use of MBSR for nurses’ psychological well-being. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","anxiety; depression; distress syndrome; female; human; job satisfaction; mental stress; mindfulness; nurse; psychology; therapy; Anxiety; Depression; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Mindfulness; Nurses; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological"

"Designed antiviral ankyrin – A computational approach to combat HIV-1 via intracellular pathway by targeting the viral capsid of HIV-1",2019,"Scaffold known as designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) have been utilized by scientists extensively in protein binding, as they acquire remarkable binding properties. Trimodular ankyrin repeat protein (Ank1D4) is a potential macromolecular and antiviral intracellular inhibitor that aims the N-terminal domain capsid protein (NTDCA) of viral Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) at the virus assembly and budding machinery process. The protein-protein interaction between Ank1D4 and the viral capsid CA alpha helixes H1 and H7 have been studied in depth and point mutation strategy at the S451D4 key residue position was conducted to further improve the binding interaction and efficacy on the wildtype Ank1D4 structure with NTDCA. A computational approach via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been fully utilized in this study to simulate both the wildtype and potential novel complexes. Free energy contributions on the modified Ank1D4-NTDCA (H1, H7) complexes were acquired by using vigorous scoring functions of implicit solvent models; Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA), respectively. The wildtype structure of Ank1D4-NTDCA H7 has been proven to possess better binding stability than the H1 complex. From there, two mutants of H7 complex were generated and the computed ?Gbind values based on both models have revealed that S45Y-H7 has the lowest binding free energy compared to both S45W-H7 and S45-H7 (Wildtype).

"Association between solar insolation and a history of suicide attempts in bipolar I disorder",2019,"In many international studies, rates of completed suicide and suicide attempts have a seasonal pattern that peaks in spring or summer. This exploratory study investigated the association between solar insolation and a history of suicide attempt in patients with bipolar I disorder. Solar insolation is the amount of electromagnetic energy from the Sun striking a surface area on Earth. Data were collected previously from 5536 patients with bipolar I disorder at 50 collection sites in 32 countries at a wide range of latitudes in both hemispheres. Suicide related data were available for 3365 patients from 310 onset locations in 51 countries. 1047 (31.1%) had a history of suicide attempt. There was a significant inverse association between a history of suicide attempt and the ratio of mean winter solar insolation/mean summer solar insolation. This ratio is smallest near the poles where the winter insolation is very small compared to the summer insolation. This ratio is largest near the equator where there is relatively little variation in the insolation over the year. Other variables in the model that were positively associated with suicide attempt were being female, a history of alcohol or substance abuse, and being in a younger birth cohort. Living in a country with a state-sponsored religion decreased the association. (All estimated coefficients p < 0.01). In summary, living in locations with large changes in solar insolation between winter and summer may be associated with increased suicide attempts in patients with bipolar disorder. Further investigation of the impacts of solar insolation on the course of bipolar disorder is needed. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; alcohol abuse; Article; bipolar I disorder; demography; electromagnetic radiation; environmental factor; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; religion; sex difference; solar radiation; substance abuse; suicide attempt; summer; sunlight; surface area; winter"
"Clinical Validation of the cobas HPV Test on the cobas 6800 System for the Purpose of Cervical Screening",2019,"This study demonstrates that the clinical sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the novel cobas human papillomavirus (HPV) test on the cobas 6800 system for high-risk HPV types fulfills the criteria for use in population-based cervical screening. The criteria were formulated by an international consortium, using the cobas 4800 HPV test as a validated reference assay. The cobas HPV test detected over 98% of histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) lesions in women age 30 years or older, with a specificity of 98.9% compared with the reference cobas 4800 test. Both the intra- and interlaboratory agreement for the cobas HPV test were 98%. The clinical performance of the cobas HPV test is comparable to those of longitudinally validated HPV assays and fulfills the criteria for its use in primary cervical screening.

"Application of Ti3C2 MXene Quantum Dots for Immunomodulation and Regenerative Medicine",2019,"Inflammation is tightly linked to tissue injury. In regenerative medicine, immune activation plays a key role in rejection of transplanted stem cells and reduces the efficacy of stem cell therapies. Next-generation smart biomaterials are reported to possess multiple biologic properties for tissue repair. Here, the first use of 0D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene quantum dots (MQDs) for immunomodulation is presented with the goal of enhancing material-based tissue repair after injury. MQDs possess intrinsic immunomodulatory properties and selectively reduce activation of human CD4+IFN-γ+ T-lymphocytes (control 87.1 ± 2.0%, MQDs 68.3 ± 5.4%) while promoting expansion of immunosuppressive CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (control 5.5 ± 0.7%, MQDs 8.5 ± 0.8%) in a stimulated lymphocyte population. Furthermore, MQDs are biocompatible with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived fibroblasts. Finally, Ti3C2 MQDs are incorporated into a chitosan-based hydrogel to create a 3D platform with enhanced physicochemical properties for stem cell delivery and tissue repair. This composite hydrogel demonstrates increased conductivity while maintaining injectability and thermosensitivity. These findings suggest that this new class of biomaterials may help bridge the translational gap in material and stem cell-based therapies for tissue repair and treatment of inflammatory and degenerative diseases. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Identification of Host Proteins Interacting with Toxoplasma gondii SAG1 by Yeast Two-Hybrid Assay",2019,"Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most successful human pathogens. To eliminate the infection, identification of receptors or binding partners from humans is indeed urgent. T. gondii surface antigen is the ultimate component involved during the attachment of parasite into host cell. However, mechanism of invasion between SAG and host-cell membrane remains unclear. Yeast two-hybrid experiment was used to identify the binding partners from cDNA human library by using T. gondii SAG1 as bait. Mated yeast cells were plated on DDO/X plates to confirm only prey plasmid that expressing interacting protein was selected. We detected 39 clones interacted with SAG1 based on a series of the selection procedures. After colony PCR, only 29 clones were positive and subsequently sent for sequencing. The yeast plasmids for true positive clones were rescued by transformation into E. coli TOP 10F′ cells. Twenty-two clones were further examined by small-scale Y2H experiment. The results indicated that a strong interaction existed between Homo sapiens lysine-rich coil-coiled and SAG1 protein, which could activate the expressions of the reporter genes in diploid yeast. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment result indicated the binding between this prey and SAG1 protein was significant (Mann–Whitney U test, Z = ? 1.964, P = 0.05). H. sapiens lysine-rich coil-coiled protein was found to be interacted with SAG1. This prey protein may serve as the potential drug target in vaccination study. ? 2019, Witold Stefa?ski Institute of Parasitology, Polish Academy of Sciences.","parasite antigen; protein; protein binding; protozoal protein; SAG1 antigen, Toxoplasma; genetics; host parasite interaction; human; metabolism; parasitology; Toxoplasma; toxoplasmosis; two hybrid system; Antigens, Protozoan; Host-Parasite Interactions; Humans; Protein Binding; Proteins; Protozoan Proteins; Toxoplasma; Toxoplasmosis; Two-Hybrid System Techniques"
"The emergence of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from swine in Malaysia",2019,"Objective: Colistin is the last line of therapy for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The objective of this study was to determine the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) isolated from swine samples in Malaysia. Methods: A total of 46 swine K. pneumoniae strains isolated from 2013–2015 in Malaysia were analysed for the production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases and carbapenemase. The resistance traits and genetic diversity of these strains were characterised by polymerase chain reaction, conjugation, plasmid analysis, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Results: Nineteen of 46 strains were multidrug resistant while 13 were resistant to colistin. The majority of colistin-resistant strains harboured blaTEM gene (92.3%), followed by blaSHV (69.23%), blaCTXM-1 (38.46%), and blaMCR-1 (23.08%). All three colistin-resistant strains had transferable plasmids and the colistin resistance gene blaMCR-1. Genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed high genetic diversity among the K. pneumoniae and that the colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae strains were heterogenous. Conclusion: It is believed that this is the first report of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae among swine strains associated with mcr-1 plasmid in Malaysia. Due to the emergence of β-lactam, carbapenem and colistin resistance, the use of colistin in animal husbandry and agriculture should be avoided to prevent treatment failure. ? 2019 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer","amikacin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; aztreonam; beta lactamase; beta lactamase CTX M; beta lactamase MCR 1; beta lactamase SHV; beta lactamase TEM; carbapenemase; cefoperazone; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; ciprofloxacin; colistin; gentamicin; imipenem; meropenem; nalidixic acid; penicillinase; tazobactam; tetracycline; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; colistin resistance; controlled study; genetic variability; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Malaysia; nonhuman; pig; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; pulsed field gel electrophoresis"
"Association of Unrecognized Obstructive Sleep Apnea with Postoperative Cardiovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Major Noncardiac Surgery",2019,"Importance: Unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea increases cardiovascular risks in the general population, but whether obstructive sleep apnea poses a similar risk in the perioperative period remains uncertain. Objectives: To determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and 30-day risk of cardiovascular complications after major noncardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study involving adult at-risk patients without prior diagnosis of sleep apnea and undergoing major noncardiac surgery from 8 hospitals in 5 countries between January 2012 and July 2017, with follow-up until August 2017. Postoperative monitoring included nocturnal pulse oximetry and measurement of cardiac troponin concentrations. Exposures: Obstructive sleep apnea was classified as mild (respiratory event index [REI] 5-14.9 events/h), moderate (REI 15-30), and severe (REI >30), based on preoperative portable sleep monitoring. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial injury, cardiac death, heart failure, thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, and stroke within 30 days of surgery. Proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative cardiovascular complications. Results: Among a total of 1364 patients recruited for the study, 1218 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 9] years; 40.2% women) were included in the analyses. At 30 days after surgery, rates of the primary outcome were 30.1% (41/136) for patients with severe OSA, 22.1% (52/235) for patients with moderate OSA, 19.0% (86/452) for patients with mild OSA, and 14.2% (56/395) for patients with no OSA. OSA was associated with higher risk for the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.19-2.01]; P =.01); however, the association was significant only among patients with severe OSA (adjusted HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.49-3.34]; P =.001) and not among those with moderate OSA (adjusted HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.98-2.09]; P =.07) or mild OSA (adjusted HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.97-1.91]; P =.08) (P =.01 for interaction). The mean cumulative duration of oxyhemoglobin desaturation less than 80% during the first 3 postoperative nights in patients with cardiovascular complications (23.1 [95% CI, 15.5-27.7] minutes) was longer than in those without (10.2 [95% CI, 7.8-10.9] minutes) (P <.001). No significant interaction effects on perioperative outcomes were observed with type of anesthesia, use of postoperative opioids, and supplemental oxygen therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Among at-risk adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery, unrecognized severe obstructive sleep apnea was significantly associated with increased risk of 30-day postoperative cardiovascular complications. Further research would be needed to assess whether interventions can modify this risk.. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"Development of electronic medical records for clinical and research purposes: The breast cancer module using an implementation framework in a middle income country- Malaysia",2019,"Background: Advances in medical domain has led to an increase of clinical data production which offers enhancement opportunities for clinical research sector. In this paper, we propose to expand the scope of Electronic Medical Records in the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC) using different techniques in establishing interoperability functions between multiple clinical departments involving diagnosis, screening and treatment of breast cancer and building automatic systems for clinical audits as well as for potential data mining to enhance clinical breast cancer research in the future. Results: Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) was adopted to develop the breast cancer module as part of the in-house EMR system used at UMMC, called i-Pesakit?. The completion of the i-Pesakit? Breast Cancer Module requires management of clinical data electronically, integration of clinical data from multiple internal clinical departments towards setting up of a research focused patient data governance model. The 14 QIF steps were performed in four main phases involved in this study which are (i) initial considerations regarding host setting, (ii) creating structure for implementation, (iii) ongoing structure once implementation begins, and (iv) improving future applications. The architectural framework of the module incorporates both clinical and research needs that comply to the Personal Data Protection Act. Conclusion: The completion of the UMMC i-Pesakit? Breast Cancer Module required populating EMR including management of clinical data access, establishing information technology and research focused governance model and integrating clinical data from multiple internal clinical departments. This multidisciplinary collaboration has enhanced the quality of data capture in clinical service, benefited hospital data monitoring, quality assurance, audit reporting and research data management, as well as a framework for implementing a responsive EMR for a clinical and research organization in a typical middle-income country setting. Future applications include establishing integration with external organization such as the National Registration Department for mortality data, reporting of institutional data for national cancer registry as well as data mining for clinical research. We believe that integration of multiple clinical visit data sources provides a more comprehensive, accurate and real-time update of clinical data to be used for epidemiological studies and audits. ? 2018 The Author(s).","Data integration; Data mining; Diagnosis; Diseases; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Information management; Integration; Interoperability; Medical computing; Quality assurance; Architectural frameworks; Breast Cancer; Electronic medical record; Epidemiological studies; Medical systems; Middle-income countries; Multi-disciplinary collaborations; Research data managements; Clinical research; breast tumor; computer interface; developing country; economics; electronic health record; female; human; income; information retrieval; Malaysia; measurement accuracy; medical research; pathology; Biomedical Research; Breast Neoplasms; Data Accuracy; Developing Countries; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Income; Information Storage and Retrieval; Malaysia; User-Computer Interface"
"Monitoring Insecticide Resistance Profiles of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Sunda Islands of Indonesia Based on Diagnostic Doses of Larvicides",2019,"This study was conducted to monitor the susceptibility status of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) larvae in the Sunda Islands of Indonesia against various organophosphates and organochlorines. Larval bioassay was performed in accordance with the World Health Organization standard protocol. Field-collected and reference strains of Ae. aegypti larvae were tested against diagnostic doses of eight larvicides belonging to organophosphates and organochlorines, namely bromophos (0.050 mg/liter), chlopyrifos (0.002 mg/liter), fenitrothion (0.020 mg/liter), fenthion (0.025 mg/liter), malathion (0.125 mg/liter), temephos (0.012 mg/liter), DDT (0.012 mg/liter), and dieldrin (0.025 mg/liter). Mortality rates of larvae were recorded at 24-h posttreatment. This study showed that Ae. aegypti larvae from Padang, Samarinda, Manggarai Barat, and South Central Timor were susceptible to both fenitrothion and dieldrin (mortality rates ? 98%). About 6 out of 10 field strains of Ae. aegypti larvae were resistant (<80% mortality rates) against fenthion, whereas Ae. aegypti larvae from Kuningan, Samarinda, Sumba, and South Central Timor exhibited some degrees of resistance (mortality rates 80-98%). All field-collected Ae. aegypti larvae were resistant against diagnostic doses of chlorpyrifos, malathion, temephos, and DDT with mortality rates ranging from 0 to 74.67%. Continued insecticide susceptibility studies are essential to identify the efficacy of insecticides for an improved dengue vector control and to delay the development of insecticide resistance. ?

"Online media’s role in public health information and communication sharing in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory coast)",2019,"The effects of health communication interventions are to reach a large number of individuals and communities, as Rogers and Storey, (1987) stated that these are possible within a specified period of time and through an organized set of communication activities. Hence, to promote vaccination and its well-being through health communication campaigns, as in the United States it requires efforts to inform the public about infectious diseases and the benefits of immunization (Paisley, 2001). Nowadays, health communication campaigns and interventions have used a variety of ways to send healthcare messages. However, the role and effectiveness of health communication has been discussed recently without information and communication technologies (ICTs) in improving health systems and healthcare services, particular in the developing countries, including Cote d’Ivoire. The hospitals in Cote d’Ivoire were lacking proper medical infrastructures, or they had outdated equipment. This has revealed the vulnerability of a few healthcare issues, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, etc. as they are quite widespread among the population. ? BEIESP.",""
"Lung nodule classification using deep Local–Global networks",2019,"Purpose: Lung nodules have very diverse shapes and sizes, which makes classifying them as benign/malignant a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the malignancy of nodules that have the capability to analyze the shape and size of a nodule using a global feature extractor, as well as the density and structure of the nodule using a local feature extractor. Methods: We propose to use Residual Blocks with a 3 × 3 kernel size for local feature extraction and Non-Local Blocks to extract the global features. The Non-Local Block has the ability to extract global features without using a huge number of parameters. The key idea behind the Non-Local Block is to apply matrix multiplications between features on the same feature maps. Results: We trained and validated the proposed method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset which contains 1018 computed tomography scans. We followed a rigorous procedure for experimental setup, namely tenfold cross-validation, and ignored the nodules that had been annotated by < 3 radiologists. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results with AUC = 95.62%, while significantly outperforming other baseline methods.

"Survey of knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting among community pharmacists in Selangor, Malaysia",2019,"Background: Community pharmacists play a pivotal role in adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting because they provide services to a large proportion of the community. Although ADR reporting by healthcare providers in Malaysia is increasing, few ADR reports are submitted by community pharmacists. Aim: This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practice of ADR reporting, as well as barriers and facilitators of ADR reporting, among community pharmacists in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional 52-item validated questionnaire was distributed to 278 community pharmacists in Selangor, Malaysia, in 2015. Multistage sampling was performed whereby community pharmacists from three of the nine administrative districts in the region were eligible for inclusion. Community pharmacies were then randomly sampled from the selected districts. Data are reported using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 219 pharmacists responded to the survey, giving a response rate of 78.8%. These community pharmacists self-reported a positive attitude towards ADR reporting. Nevertheless, less than half (34.2%; n?=?75) had previously reported an ADR. Lack of information provided by the patient, insufficient clinical knowledge and uncertainty relating to the association between the adverse reaction and the drug were the main barriers to ADR reporting. Conclusions: The attitude and practices among community pharmacists indicates there is room for improvement in ADR reporting in Malaysia. Ongoing education and training on ADR reporting for community pharmacists is required to ensure delivery of high-quality care to the community. ? 2019 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia","adult; adverse drug reaction; Article; community pharmacist; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drug industry; drug surveillance program; female; health care personnel; health survey; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; pharmacist attitude; pharmacovigilance; pharmacy (shop); practice guideline; professional knowledge; uncertainty"
"In-hospital mortality of cardiogenic shock complicating ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Malaysia: A retrospective analysis of the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Database (NCVD) registry",2019,"Objectives Cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) carries an extremely high mortality. The clinical pattern of this life threatening complication has never been described in Malaysian setting. This study is to investigate the incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of STEMI patients with CS in our population. Design A retrospective analysis of STEMI patients from 18 hospitals across Malaysia contributing to the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Database-acute coronary syndrome) registry (NCVD-ACS) year 2006-2013. Participants 16 517 patients diagnosed of STEMI from 18 hospitals in Malaysia from the year 2006 to 2013. Primary outcome measures In-hospital and 30 day post-discharge mortality. Results CS complicates 10.6% of all STEMIs in this study. They had unfavourable premorbid conditions and poor outcomes. The in-hospital mortality rate was 34.1% which translates into a 7.14 times mortality risk increment compared with STEMI without CS. Intravenous thrombolysis remained as the main urgent reperfusion modality. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in CS conferred a 40% risk reduction over non-invasive therapy but were only done in 33.6% of cases. Age over 65, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic lung and kidney disease conferred higher risk of mortality. Conclusion Mortality rates of CS complicating STEMI in Malaysia are high. In-hospital PCI confers a 40% mortality risk reduction but the rate of PCI among our patients with CS complicating STEMI is still low. Efforts are being made to increase access to invasive therapy for these patients. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"Parameter-driven state-space model for integer-valued time series with application",2019,"Time series of counts occur in many different contexts, the counts being usually of certain events or objects in specified time intervals. In this paper we introduce a model called parameter-driven state-space model to analyse integer-valued time series data. A key property of such model is that the distribution of the observed count data is independent, conditional on the latent process, although the observations are correlated marginally. Our simulation shows that the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm and the particle method are useful for the parameter estimation of the proposed model. In the application to Malaysia dengue data, our model fits better when compared with several other models including that of Yang et?al.

"Restoring prolonged standing via functional electrical stimulation after spinal cord injury: A systematic review of control strategies",2019,"Background: Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) technologies can facilitate standing in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), and prolonged standing elicited via FES may offer both functional and therapeutic benefits to users. However, the current attainable FES-evoked standing duration is typically short and below the threshold for clinical efficacy. To promote the objective selection of suitable control strategies to restore prolonged and higher-quality standing duration, this study summarised current and emerging approaches to FES standing. Method: PubMed, IEEE Xplore,Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant studies on FES-evoked standing after SCI between the earliest return date and December 2017. Thereafter, the quality of all included studies was objectively evaluated using the Downs and Black methodological assessment checklist. Results: Twenty-five full-length articles, with mean methodological quality score of 56%, met the inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis. Recent advancements to promote prolonged standing relied greatly on the use of voluntary upper extremities for balancing with arm engaged or disengaged. Some widely-reported constraints were issues of unpredictable postural sway, and unusual muscle responses and perturbations, such as spasm or spasticity, which diminished the reliability of the standing control sensors and algorithms. Conclusion: Closed-loop control of FES-supported standing with arms-free modality and voluntary upper extremity balancing promoted the “longest” standing duration and “highest” efficacy among the reported methods, albeit with a limited successful transfer of the technology into the routine clinical practice or community deployment. However, open-loop control of FES standing appeared popular, particularly for its therapeutic gains, simplicity of use and other health and psychological benefits associated with weight bearing through the legs. The information from this study could stimulate useful knowledge that may promote clinically significant FES-supported standing duration. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Functional electric stimulation; Clinical practices; Closed-loop control; Control strategies; Functional electri-cal stimulations; Functional electrical stimulation technologies; Spinal cord injuries (SCI); Standing; Therapeutic benefits; Quality control; body position; control strategy; functional electrical stimulation; ground reaction force; human; lower limb; muscle contraction; muscle excitation; muscle fatigue; muscle spasm; muscle strength; neuromuscular function; object manipulation; paraplegia; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; quadriplegia; range of motion; Review; spasticity; spinal cord injury; spinal cord stimulation; standing; systematic review; thigh muscle; torque; upper limb"
"Effects of palbociclib in oral squamous cell carcinoma and the role of PIK3CA in conferring resistance",2019,"Objective: Lack of effective therapies remains a problem in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), especially in patients with advanced tumors. OSCC development is driven by multiple aberrancies within the cell cycle pathway, including amplification of cyclin D1 and loss of p16. Hence, cell cycle inhibitors of the CDK4/6-cyclin D axis are appealing targets for OSCC treatment. Here, we determined the potency of palbociclib and identified genetic features that are associated with the response of palbociclib in OSCC. Methods: The effect of palbociclib was evaluated in a panel of well-characterized OSCC cell lines by cell proliferation assays and further confirmed by in vivo evaluation in xenograft models. PIK3CA-mutant isogenic cell lines were used to investigate the effect of PIK3CA mutation towards palbociclib response. Results: We demonstrated that 80% of OSCC cell lines are sensitive to palbociclib at sub-micromolar concentrations. Consistently, palbociclib was effective in controlling tumor growth in mice. We identified that palbociclib-resistant cells harbored mutations in PIK3CA. Using isogenic cell lines, we showed that PIK3CA mutant cells are less responsive to palbociclib as compared to wild-type cells with concurrent upregulation of CDK2 and cyclin E1 protein levels. We further demonstrated that the combination of a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (PF-04691502) and palbociclib completely controlled tumor growth in mice. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the potency of palbociclib in OSCC models and provides a rationale for the inclusion of PIK3CA testing in the clinical evaluation of CDK4/6 inhibitors and suggests combination approaches for further clinical studies.

"Liking, sharing, commenting and reacting on Facebook: User behaviors’ impact on sentiment intensity",2019,"The form of communication on Facebook is not only limited to posting and commenting, but also includes sharing, liking and reacting. This study looks into how a Facebook diabetes community uses like, comment, share and reaction in expressing themselves online and how these distinctions can be used to improve sentiment classification from text extracted from the said group. An intensity formula using those behaviors was proposed and experimentations conducted using Weka. The findings reveal a model encompassing user behaviors is able to determine sentiment more accurately compared to one without, with a 94.6 percentage of accuracy. Additional analyses reveal behaviors such as liking, commenting and sharing to contribute more to the sentiment classification compared to reacting. This further cement the need to include such behavioral aspects into sentiment polarity calculation, as it would help algorithms achieve better predictability when classifying sentiment. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Social networking (online); Text processing; Comment; Facebook; Like; Reaction; Sentiment intensity; Share; Behavioral research"

"Financial Toxicity After Cancer in a Setting With Universal Health Coverage: A Call for Urgent Action",2019,"BACKGROUND: Financial toxicity negatively affects the well-being of cancer survivors. We examined the incidence, cost drivers, and factors associated with financial toxicity after cancer in an upper-middle-income country with universal health coverage. METHODS: Through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Costs in Oncology study, 1,294 newly diagnosed patients with cancer (Ministry of Health [MOH] hospitals [n = 577], a public university hospital [n = 642], private hospitals [n = 75]) were observed in Malaysia. Cost diaries and questionnaires were used to measure incidence of financial toxicity, encompassing financial catastrophe (FC; out-of-pocket costs ? 30% of annual household income), medical impoverishment (decrease in household income from above the national poverty line to below that line after subtraction of cancer-related costs), and economic hardship (inability to make necessary household payments). Predictors of financial toxicity were determined using multivariable analyses. RESULTS: One fifth of patients had private health insurance. Incidence of FC at 1 year was 51% (MOH hospitals, 33%; public university hospital, 65%; private hospitals, 72%). Thirty-three percent of households were impoverished at 1 year. Economic hardship was reported by 47% of families. Risk of FC attributed to conventional medical care alone was 18% (MOH hospitals, 5%; public university hospital, 24%; private hospitals, 67%). Inclusion of expenditures on nonmedical goods and services inflated the risk of financial toxicity in public hospitals. Low-income status, type of hospital, and lack of health insurance were strong predictors of FC. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer may not be fully protected against financial hardships, even in settings with universal health coverage. Nonmedical costs also contribute as important drivers of financial toxicity in these settings.","adult; article; disaster; driver; female; household income; human; incidence; lowest income group; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; medical care; middle income country; oncology; poverty; private health insurance; questionnaire; tumor-related gene; university hospital"
"Temporal changes in obesity and sleep habits in Hong Kong Chinese school children: a prospective study",2019,"We examined the temporal changes in obesity and sleep habits and their relationship in a prospective cohort of healthy Chinese adolescents. We collected data on anthropometric and questionnaire-measured sleep parameters in 2007–2008. 516 participants returned for examinations in 2013–2015. General obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ?age- and sex-specific 95 th percentile or ?25 kg/m 2 for participants aged &lt;18 or ?18 years, respectively. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference (WC) ? age- and sex-specific 90 th percentile or using adult cut-offs. After a mean follow-up of 6.2 ± 0.5 years, the mean BMI increased from 18.5 ± 3.1 to 20.9 ± 3.4 kg/m 2 . The corresponding WC were 63.7 ± 8.9 and 69.8 ± 9.7 cm. General obesity rate increased from 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.1–11.1) to 11.3% (8.7–14.4; p = 0.034). Central obesity rate decreased from 16.9% (13.7–20.4) to 13.5% (10.6–16.8; p = 0.034). During follow-up, more participants reported short sleep (&lt;7 hours/day during weekday: 20.5% [17.1–24.2] vs. 15.3% [12.3–18.8]; p = 0.033) and bedtime after midnight (60.5% [56.2–64.8] vs. 16.2% [13.1–19.7]; p &lt; 0.001) than baseline. The relative risk of overweight/obesity in participants with short sleep and late bedtime was 1.30 (0.48–3.47) and 1.46 (0.70–3.05), respectively. Despite rising rates of unhealthy sleep habits and general obesity, their associations were not significant at 6-year of follow-up. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Phytochemical screening, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of limonium socotranum and peperomia blanda extracts",2019,"Limonium socotranum and Peperomia blanda are used in ethnomedicine to treat several diseases, such as infection, cancer, and inflammation. P. blanda (family: Piperaceae) is from the genus Peperomia, and mostly found in Madagascar, Yemen, USA to South America, while L. socotranum (family: Plumbaginaceae) from the genus Limonium and this species is found only on Socotra Island, Yemen. These plants have attracted great interest in recent years because of their phytochemical contents. Consequently, the current study is aimed to investigate the phytochemical constituents, the cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of L. socotranum (leaves and stem) and P. blanda extracts. Successive extraction had been performed which resulted in nine crude extracts. Phytochemical screening of the extracts was then conducted using qualitative chemical analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts was determined using the well diffusion method against eleven selected pathogenic microbes and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were measured. The cytotoxic activities of the plant extracts against MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines were investigated using sulforhodamine B assay. It was noted that methanol leaves extract from L. socotranum exhibited higher antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus (MIC 15.6 μg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 125 μg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 125 μg/mL), than stem parts, while petroleum ether extract displayed stronger antifungal activity, with MIC of 125 μg/mL. On the other hand, petroleum ether extract of P. blanda was effective against Gram-positive bacteria and exhibited moderate antifungal activity. Petroleum ether extract of P. blanda displayed cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells, with an IC50 of 4.60 ± 0.02 μg/mL, while the methanol extracts showed higher activity against the HepG2 cell line, with an IC50 of 13.90 ± 0.14 μg/mL. Phytochemical findings confirmed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenoids. The promising obtained results suggest the potential use of these plants in cancer and antimicrobial therapies. ? 2019, Malaysian Society for Parasitology. All rights reserved.",""

Variable periods of higher transmission occurred inconsistently, in November to December, January to March, July to September, or a combination of these. These coincide with seasons in the nearby southeast Asian countries or winter seasons of the northern and southern hemispheres. Changes in the predominant circulating influenza type were only sometimes associated with increased transmission.

"Neck stiffness in a post-irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma adult: An unusual diagnosis",2019,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a neoplasm commonly found in population of South East Asia. The mainstay of treatment is high dose irradiation. Complications from radiotherapy are not uncommon especially to those nearby structures such as vertebrae and spinal cord. A 57 year-old gentleman with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who was treated with chemo-radiation (total of 35 fractions,70 Gy) presented to us 6 months post therapy with bilateral nasal discharge and progressive neck stiffness. Nasoendoscopy showed inflamed nasophayngeal mucosa and Computed Tomography (CT) brain and cervical spine showed retropharyngeal and anterior epidural collection with extension into atlantoaxial bone and spinal cord compression. Histopathological specimen revealed features of chronic inflammations with multiple actinomycetes colonies. Our patient suffered severe neck stiffness and loss of sensations on both upper limbs. He was treated conservatively with Halo vest and intravenous antibiotics for 8 weeks and recovered fully. Irradiation in NPC is known to cause devastating complications to cervical spine such as osteoradionecrosis, osteomyelitis. It also renders tissues hypoxic and risk of getting rare infection like actinomycosis. This report can represent a great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with differentials of tumor recurrence, osteoradionecrosis or osteomyelitis.

"Paediatric asthma clinical pathway: Impact on cost and quality of care",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Uncontrolled asthma may cause an increase in healthcare utilisation, hospital admission and productivity loss. With the increasing burden of asthma in Malaysia, strategies aimed at reducing cost of care should be explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine if a clinical pathway (CPW) for inpatient paediatric asthma would reduce average length of stay (ALOS), improve asthma management and decrease cost. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, pre-post study was used to evaluate the CPW effectiveness. Paediatric inpatients aged 5-18 years old, admitted for acute asthma exacerbation from September 2015 to April 2016 were prospectively recruited. Data from patients admitted from January-July 2015 were used as control. CPW training was carried out in August 2015 using standardised modules. Direct admission cost from the provider’s prospective was calculated. Outcomes compared were differences in ALOS, discharge medication, readmission within 28 days of discharge and cost. RESULTS: ALOS is 26 hours lower in the CPW group for severe exacerbations and underlying uncontrolled asthma (19.2 hours) which is clinically significant as patients have shorter hospital stay. More newly-diagnosed intermittent asthmatics were discharged with relievers in the CPW group (p-value 0.006). None of the patients in the CPW group had readmissions (p-value 0.16). Mean treatment cost for patients in the intervention group is higher at RM843.39 (SD ±48.99, versus RM779.21 SD±44.33). CONCLUSION: This study found that management using a CPW may benefit asthmatic patients with uncontrolled asthma admitted with severe exacerbation. Further studies will be needed to explore CPW’s impact on asthma management starting from the emergency department. ? 2019, Malaysian Medical Association.

"Overexpression of miR-361-5p plays an oncogenic role in human lung adenocarcinoma through the regulation of SMAD2",2019,"The silencing of Bcl-xL in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, downregulates miR-361-5p expression. This study aimed to determine the biological effects of miR-361-5p on NSCLC, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which apoptosis is regulated. MicroRNA (miRNA or miR) functional analyses were performed via transfection of miR-361-5p mimics and inhibitors, demonstrating that the inhibition of miR-361-5p induced the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. To elucidate the function of miR-361-5p in vivo, cells transfected with miR-361-5p inhibitors were microinjected into zebrafish embryos, and immunostained using antibodies to detect the active form of caspase-3. Co-transfection with siBcl-xL and miR-361-5p mimics illustrated the association between Bcl-xL, miR-361-5p and apoptosis; miR-361-5p mimics blocked the apoptosis initiated by siBcl-xL. Luciferase reporter assays identified mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2) as a novel target of miR-361-5p and the reduction of its protein level was validated by western blot analysis. To confirm the molecular mechanisms through which apoptosis is regulated, gene rescue experiments revealed that the ectopic expression of SMAD2 attenuated the inhibitory effects on apoptosis induced by miR-361-5p. In this study, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that miR-361-5p functions as an oncomiR in A549 and SK-LU-1 cells through the regulation of SMAD2, suggesting that miR-361-5p may be employed as a potential therapeutic target for the miRNA-based therapy of NSCLC. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

In comparison to the placebo cohort, the levosimendan cohort showed a significant reduction in mortality (TSA = inconclusive; ρ = 0.002; I2 = 0%; FEM: OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39, 0.80), especially in the subgroups of preoperative severe low LVEF ? 30% (ρ = 0.003; OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16, 0.69), preoperative administering of levosimendan (ρ = 0.001; OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.29, 0.74) and patients who had bolus followed by infusion of levosimendan (ρ = 0.005; OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.30, 0.81). However, the effect on mortality was not significant in the subgroup analysis of high quality trials (ρ = 0.14; OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.47, 1.12). The levosimendan cohort showed a significantly lower incidence of low-cardiac-output-syndrome (ρ &lt; 0.001; OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46, 0.74) and lesser need for mechanical support of cardiac assist devices (ρ = 0.02; OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.18, 0.86). Conclusions: Given the low level of evidence and inconclusive TSA, the results of this meta-analysis neither support nor oppose the use of levosimendan in cardiac patients with preoperative low LVEF ? 50%. Therefore, multi-centre, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials are warranted.

"Baicalein and baicalin as Zika virus inhibitors",2019,"At present, there is no effective antiviral agent for Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus that is known for its teratogenic effects on newborns. Baicalein and baicalin were found to be capable of downregulating ZIKV replication up to 10 hours postinfection, while prophylactic effects were evident in pre-treated cells. Baicalein exhibited its highest potency during intracellular ZIKV replication, whereas baicalin was most effective against virus entry. Our in silico interaction assays predicted that both compounds exhibited the strongest binding affinities towards ZIKV NS5, while the virus envelope glycoprotein was the least likely target protein. These findings serve as a crucial platform for further in-depth studies to decipher the underlying anti-ZIKV mechanism(s) of each compound. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","antivirus agent; baicalein; baicalin; flavanone derivative; flavonoid; virus envelope protein; drug effect; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; metabolism; physiology; virology; virus entry; virus replication; Zika fever; Zika virus; Antiviral Agents; Flavanones; Flavonoids; Humans; Viral Envelope Proteins; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection"
"The functional ALDH2 polymorphism is associated with breast cancer risk: A pooled analysis from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium",2019,"Background: Epidemiological studies consistently indicate that alcohol consumption is an independent risk factor for female breast cancer (BC). Although the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) polymorphism (rs671: Glu>Lys) has a strong effect on acetaldehyde metabolism, the association of rs671 with BC risk and its interaction with alcohol intake have not been fully elucidated. We conducted a pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies, with individual data on Asian ancestry women participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Methods: We included 12,595 invasive BC cases and 12,884 controls for the analysis of rs671 and BC risk, and 2,849 invasive BC cases and 3,680 controls for the analysis of the gene-environment interaction between rs671 and alcohol intake for BC risk. The pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with rs671 and its interaction with alcohol intake for BC risk were estimated using logistic regression models. Results: The Lys/Lys genotype of rs671 was associated with increased BC risk (OR?=?1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.30, p?=?0.014). According to tumor characteristics, the Lys/Lys genotype was associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p?=?0.008), progesterone receptor (PR)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.03–1.36, p?=?0.015), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative BC (OR?=?1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.48, p?=?0.012). No evidence of a gene-environment interaction was observed between rs671 and alcohol intake (p?=?0.537). Conclusion: This study suggests that the Lys/Lys genotype confers susceptibility to BC risk among women of Asian ancestry, particularly for ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-negative tumor types. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Dietary and physical activity patterns related to cardio-metabolic health among Malaysian adolescents: A systematic review",2019,"Background: A sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet are major factors in the increasing prevalence of obesity among Malaysian adolescents. The purpose of this systematic review is to compile the evidence from observational and intervention studies among Malaysian adolescents to evaluate the associations between diet and physical activity (PA) as determinants of cardio-metabolic risk factors. Methods: A systematic search of Medline via the PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Review and Web of Science databases was conducted for studies on the associations between diet and PA factors and cardio-metabolic risk factors among Malaysian adolescents aged 13-18 years that were published until 31 August 2017. The search results were independently screened and extracted by two reviewers. Results: From over 2,410 references retrieved, 20 full texts articles were screened as potentially relevant. Seventeen (16 cross-sectional and one intervention) met the inclusion criteria for data extraction and analysis. All 17 studies were rated as poor quality and the majority had made insufficient adjustment for confounders. As regards the effect of diet and PA on cardio-metabolic health, the intakes of energy (n = 4) and macronutrients (n = 3) and meal frequency (n = 5) were the most commonly studied dietary factors, while the PA score and level were the most commonly studied PA factors. In addition, BMI and body weight were the most common cardio-metabolic health outcomes. The studies showed that obese and overweight adolescents consume significantly more energy and macronutrients. They are also more likely to skip their daily meals compared to their normal weight peers. In most studies, the direction of the PA effect on body weight was unclear. Some studies found that higher PA is associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity. However, the associations are often small or inconsistent, with few studies controlling for confounding factors. Conclusions: This review identified a lack of evidence and well-conducted prospective studies on the effect of diet and PA on cardio-metabolic health of Malaysian adolescents. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; adolescent behavior; cross-sectional study; eating; exercise; feeding behavior; female; health status; human; Malaysia; male; physiology; prospective study; psychology; risk factor; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Eating; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Status; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"Clinical, biochemical and genetic profiles of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (Morquio A syndrome) in Malaysia: The first national natural history cohort study",2019,"Background: Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease due to N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) deficiency. It results in accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate, leading to skeletal and other systemic impairments. Data on MPS IVA in Asian populations are scarce. Methods: This is a multicentre descriptive case series of 21 patients comprising all MPS IVA patients in Malaysia. Mutational analysis was performed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the GALNS gene in 17 patients. Results: The patients (15 females and 6 males) had a mean age (± SD) of 15.5 (± 8.1) years. Mean age at symptom onset was 2.6 (± 2.1) years and at confirmed diagnosis was 6.9 (± 4.5) years. The study cohort included patients from all the main ethnic groups in Malaysia - 57% Malay, 29% Chinese and 14% Indian. Common presenting symptoms included pectus carinatum (57%) and genu valgum (43%). Eight patients (38%) had undergone surgery, most commonly knee surgeries (29%) and cervical spine decompression (24%). Patients had limited endurance with lower mean walking distances with increasing age. GALNS gene analysis identified 18 distinct mutations comprising 13 missense, three nonsense, one small deletion and one splice site mutation. Of these, eight were novel mutations (Tyr133Ser, Glu158Valfs?12, Gly168?, Gly168Val, Trp184?, Leu271Pro, Glu320Lys, Leu508Pro). Mutations in exons 1, 5 and 9 accounted for 51% of the mutant alleles identified. Conclusions: All the MPS IVA patients in this study had clinical impairments. A better understanding of the natural history and the clinical and genetic spectrum of MPS IVA in this population may assist early diagnosis, improve management and permit timely genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","glutamine; glycine; leucine; lysine; n acetylgalactosamine 6 sulfatase; proline; serine; tryptophan; tyrosine; valine; adolescent; adult; allele; Article; biochemical analysis; child; Chinese; clinical article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; endurance; exon; female; GALNS gene; gene deletion; gene identification; genetic counseling; human; Indian; knee surgery; Malay (people); Malaysia; male; missense mutation; Morquio A syndrome; Morquio syndrome; mutational analysis; nonsense mutation; onset age; pigeon thorax; polymerase chain reaction; prenatal diagnosis; retrospective study; RNA splice site; Sanger sequencing; spinal cord decompression; valgus knee"
"Relationship between various cytokines implicated in asthma",2019,"Asthma is a complex disorder involving immunologic, environmental, genetic and other factors. Today, asthma is the most common disease encountered in clinical medicine in both children and adults worldwide. Asthma is characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree resulting in chronic swelling and inflammation of the airways recognized to be controlled by the T-helper 2 (Th2) lymphocytes, which secrete cytokines to increase the production of IgE by B cells. There are many cytokines implicated in the development of the chronic inflammatory processes that are often observed in asthma. Ultimately, these cytokines cause the release of mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes (LT), which in turn promote airway remodeling, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and bronchoconstriction. The CD4+ T-lymphocytes from the airways of asthmatics express a panel of cytokines that represent the Th2 cells. The knowledge derived from numerous experimental and clinical studies have allowed physicians and scientists to understand the normal functions of these cytokines and their roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. The main focus of this review is to accentuate the relationship between various cytokines implicated in human asthma. However, some key findings from animal models will be highlighted to support the discoveries from clinical studies. ? 2019 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics","cytokine; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; interleukin 22; interleukin 23; interleukin 3; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; interleukin 9; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; immunoglobulin E; asthma; human; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; adult; animal; asthma; biosynthesis; child; genetics; hypersensitivity; immunology; knockout mouse; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; mouse; pathology; single nucleotide polymorphism; Th2 cell; Adult; Animals; Asthma; Child; Cytokines; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Th2 Cells"
"Synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of silver(I) complexes with mixed-ligands of thiosemicarbazones and diphenyl(p-tolyl)phosphine as biological agents",2019,"Five new silver(I) complexes were synthesized with mixed ligands of thiosemicarbazone derivatives and diphenyl(p-tolyl)phosphine in search of new biologically active compounds. A CHN elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data and several spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, 1 H, 13 C, and 31 P{ 1 H} NMR were performed to elucidate the structure of these complexes. Elemental analysis suggested that the stoichiometry of the complexes formed by the reaction of silver nitrate with thiosemicarbazone in the presence of (p-tolyl)PPh 2 was indeed 1:2:1 molar ratio. The silver ions were discovered to be coordinated to the sulfur of thiosemicarbazone and phosphorus of (p-tolyl)PPh 2 , having a tetrahedral geometry based on the spectroscopic data obtained. The PXRD patterns were studied to see the degree of crystallinity of the complexes. The in vitro antiproliferative activity of these complexes was investigated toward the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, as well as the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, which yielded IC 50 values in low micromolar range. The antiplasmodial activity of these complexes was also examined against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasite which demonstrated good activity and further tested for their selectivity index. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""

"Circulating insulin-like growth factor I in relation to melanoma risk in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition",2019,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, and is thought to play a role in tumour development. Previous prospective studies have shown that higher circulating concentrations of IGF-I are associated with a higher risk of cancers at specific sites, including breast and prostate. No prospective study has examined the association between circulating IGF-I concentrations and melanoma risk. A nested case–control study of 1,221 melanoma cases and 1,221 controls was performed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, a prospective cohort of 520,000 participants recruited from 10 European countries. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for incident melanoma in relation to circulating IGF-I concentrations, measured by immunoassay. Analyses were conditioned on the matching factors and further adjusted for age at blood collection, education, height, BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake, marital status, physical activity and in women only, use of menopausal hormone therapy. There was no significant association between circulating IGF-I concentration and melanoma risk (OR for highest vs lowest fifth = 0.93 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.22]). There was no significant heterogeneity in the association between IGF-I concentrations and melanoma risk when subdivided by gender, age at blood collection, BMI, height, age at diagnosis, time between blood collection and diagnosis, or by anatomical site or histological subtype of the tumour (Pheterogeneity?0.078). We found no evidence for an association between circulating concentrations of IGF-I measured in adulthood and the risk of melanoma. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Ambient BTEX levels over urban, suburban and rural areas in Malaysia",2019,"Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers (BTEX) are volatile organic air pollutants of concern which arise from natural and anthropogenic sources. This study aims to determine and evaluate the BTEX levels in ambient air in selected areas of Malaysia, namely: Kuala Lumpur (KL-urban), Penang (PG-urban), Bangi (BG-suburban), Langkawi (LGK-suburban) and the Danum Valley (DV-rural). Active sampling with sorbent tubes was applied in this study and samples were analysed using thermal desorption (TD) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results show that the urban area of KL had the highest ΣBTEX (40.36 ± 6.99?μg/m 3 ) followed by PG (30.82 ± 8.06?μg/m 3 ). ΣBTEX concentrations in the suburban areas of LGK and BG were measured as 20.22 ± 11.42?μg/m 3 and 12.36 ± 2.26?μg/m 3 , respectively. The rural area of DV had the lowest concentration of ΣBTEX (5.55 ± 2.54?μg/m 3 ). The average toluene to benzene (T:B) ratio at KL, PG and LG were found to be within the range of 2.00–5.00 thus indicating vehicle emissions as the main source. The benzene level at both KL (7.43?μg/m 3 ) and PG (5.12?μg/m 3 ) were found to be slightly higher than the annual benchmark of 5?μg/m 3 as suggested by the European Union (EU).

"Factors influencing women in physical activity programs in Malaysia",2019,"The majority of research on factors associated with women participation in physical activity (PA) has been in developed countries with limited research in developing countries. Few women in Malaysia are active at the recommended levels for health, and activity rates are less than developed countries. Little research has focused specially on physically active Malaysian women and the factors that contribute to them becoming and staying active in PA programs. This lack of knowledge hinders the tailored development and implementation of PA programs to meet their needs. The aim of this study was to identify the factors of participation in PA programs for Malaysian women. The social- ecological model was used to investigate and theme the factors. Focus group discussion was conducted with participants in six PA programs targeted specifically to women. Thirty-seven women were involved in the focus group discussion, with ages ranging from 19 to 82 years. Inductive and deductive content analysis was conducted from verbatim transcripts using NVivo. Inductive content analysis allowed raw data and second-order themes to emerge. Findings revealed social support structures, tailored programs for women, and location were key contributors that encouraged women to participate in these programs. The similarity in contributors between women in non-western and western countries signifies a prime opportunity for bi-lateral relationships to be formed to enable the enhancement of program development relevant to different ethnicities and cultures within or across countries. ?

"Evaluation of anti-tumorigenic effects of diosmetin against human colon cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice",2019,"Colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the world. Diosmetin (Dis), a natural O-methylated flavone, has been reported to have anti-cancer effects against different types of cancer. Although the mechanisms of action of Dis against several cancer cell lines are well reported, in vivo anti-tumorigenesis properties of this compound are still obscure. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-tumorigenesis properties of Dis against HCT-116 colon cancer xenografts in nude mice. HCT-116 colon cancer cells were injected in NCr nu/nu nude mice and treatment with Dis was initiated after the tumor volumes reached 100 mm3 and continued for four weeks. On the sacrificing date nude mice treated with 100 mg/kg of Dis showed significant lower tumor volume (264 ± 238.3 mm3) as compared to the untreated group (1428.8 ± 459.6 mm3). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was significantly downregulated, while apoptotic protein (Bax) was significantly overexpressed in nude mice treated with 100 mg/kg Dis as compared to untreated mice. In conclusion, our in vivo results indicate that Dis significantly reduces tumor growth rate of HCT-116 colon cancer cells in nude mice at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and has no toxic effects in ICR mice up to 2000 mg/kg. ? 2019 by the authors.","analgesic agent; diosmetin; flavonoid; animal; apoptosis; colon tumor; disease model; drug effect; drug screening; female; HCT 116 cell line; human; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; toxicity testing; tumor cell line; tumor volume; Analgesics; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Flavonoids; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, Nude; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Tumor Burden; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Coffee and tea drinking in relation to the risk of differentiated thyroid carcinoma: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study",2019,"Purpose: Coffee and tea constituents have shown several anti-carcinogenic activities in cellular and animal studies, including against thyroid cancer (TC). However, epidemiological evidence is still limited and inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to investigate this association in a large prospective study. Methods: The study was conducted in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort, which included 476,108 adult men and women. Coffee and tea intakes were assessed through validated country-specific dietary questionnaires. Results: During a mean follow-up of 14 years, 748 first incident differentiated TC cases (including 601 papillary and 109 follicular TC) were identified. Coffee consumption (per 100?mL/day) was not associated either with total differentiated TC risk (HRcalibrated 1.00, 95% CI 0.97–1.04) or with the risk of TC subtypes. Tea consumption (per 100?mL/day) was not associated with the risk of total differentiated TC (HRcalibrated 0.98, 95% CI 0.95–1.02) and papillary tumor (HRcalibrated 0.99, 95% CI 0.95–1.03), whereas an inverse association was found with follicular tumor risk (HRcalibrated 0.90, 95% CI 0.81–0.99), but this association was based on a sub-analysis with a small number of cancer cases.

"Microbiota and potential opportunistic pathogens associated with male and female fruit flies of Malaysian Bactrocera carambolae (Insecta: Tephritidae)",2019,"Bactrocera carambolae Drew & Hancock is an agricultural pest that causes considerable damage to various fruit crops in Southeast Asia and South America. We report here the bacterial communities associated with field-caught male and female adult flies from University Malaya campus. The microbiota was determined by targeted 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4 region) sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq. At 97% similarity, four bacterial phyla (with relative abundance of ?1% in at least one specimen) – Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Tenericutes – were recovered from the adult flies. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in all the samples, with the female flies (86.81 ± 6.57%) having higher mean relative abundance than the male flies (71.57 ± 18.37%). The Firmicutes was more abundant in the male flies (14.47 ± 17.30%) than female flies (0.69 ± 1.25%). There were in total seven classes, nine orders, 13 families, 23 genera, and 31 putative species. Thirteen genera had higher mean relative abundance in male flies, and nine in female flies. Klebsiella was the predominant genus in female flies, while Desulfovibrio was more abundant in some male flies. The mean relative abundances of the putative species Orbus sasakiae and Enterococcus moraviensis were significantly higher in male than female flies, while female flies had significantly higher mean relative abundance for Escherichia fergusonii and Klebsiella variicola. Alpha diversity indices indicated that the bacterial diversity varied within and between male and female flies, and the mean bacterial diversity was significantly higher in male flies. The differences in bacterial diversity and relative abundance may be reasonably attributed to stochastic processes, in part to environmental factors such as food resources and habitats. It is significant that several putative bacterial species recovered in the present study have not been reported in Bactrocera fruit flies. Sixteen of the 31 detected putative bacterial species are potential opportunistic pathogens of medical/public health importance. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","RNA 16S; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; Bactrocera; Bactrocera carambolae; bioinformatics; Chlamydiae; Desulfovibrio; Desulfovibrionaceae; Desulfovibrionales; DNA extraction; Enterobacter; Escherichia; female; Firmicutes; Flavobacteriaceae; Gammaproteobacteria; gene sequence; Klebsiella; male; microbial community; microflora; Mollicutes; nonhuman; Porphyromonadaceae; priority journal; Proteobacteria; Rhodospirillales"
"Deep learning-based breast cancer classification through medical imaging modalities: state of the art and research challenges",2019,"Breast cancer is a common and fatal disease among women worldwide. Therefore, the early and precise diagnosis of breast cancer plays a pivotal role to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease. Several studies have developed automated techniques using different medical imaging modalities to predict breast cancer development. However, few review studies are available to recapitulate the existing literature on breast cancer classification. These studies provide an overview of the classification, segmentation, or grading of many cancer types, including breast cancer, by using traditional machine learning approaches through hand-engineered features. This review focuses on breast cancer classification by using medical imaging multimodalities through state-of-the-art artificial deep neural network approaches. It is anticipated to maximize the procedural decision analysis in five aspects, such as types of imaging modalities, datasets and their categories, pre-processing techniques, types of deep neural network, and performance metrics used for breast cancer classification. Forty-nine journal and conference publications from eight academic repositories were methodically selected and carefully reviewed from the perspective of the five aforementioned aspects. In addition, this study provided quantitative, qualitative, and critical analyses of the five aspects. This review showed that mammograms and histopathologic images were mostly used to classify breast cancer. Moreover, about 55% of the selected studies used public datasets, and the remaining used exclusive datasets. Several studies employed augmentation, scaling, and image normalization pre-processing techniques to minimize inconsistencies in breast cancer images. Several types of shallow and deep neural network architecture were employed to classify breast cancer using images. The convolutional neural network was utilized frequently to construct an effective breast cancer classification model. Some of the selected studies employed a pre-trained network or developed new deep neural networks to classify breast cancer. Most of the selected studies used accuracy and area-under-the-curve metrics followed by sensitivity, precision, and F-measure metrics to evaluate the performance of the developed breast cancer classification models. Finally, this review presented 10 open research challenges for future scholars who are interested to develop breast cancer classification models through various imaging modalities. This review could serve as a valuable?resource for beginners on medical image classification and for advanced scientists focusing on deep learning-based breast cancer classification through different medical imaging modalities. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Diseases; Grading; Image classification; Network architecture; Neural networks; Area under the curves; Automated techniques; Breast cancer classifications; Conference publications; Convolutional neural network; Imaging modality; Machine learning approaches; Performance metrics; Medical imaging"
"Prostate cancer in Asia: design of a patient registry to inform real-world treatments, outcomes, and quality of life",2019,"Background: The incidence of prostate cancer (PC) in Asian countries is increasing for reasons that are not clear. Data describing how PC is diagnosed and treated are fragmented across Asia, with marked intercountry and intracountry differences in outcome and knowledge gaps in clinical diagnostic and treatment practices. To address these knowledge gaps, we have established a PC disease registry with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of PC diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and outcome, population characteristics, and comorbidities in real-world clinical practice in Asia. Methods: This is a multinational, multicenter, longitudinal, and observational registry of PC patients presenting to participating tertiary-care hospitals in eight Asian countries (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02546908. Registry Identifier: NOPRODPCR4001). Approximately 3500-4000 eligible patients with existing or newly diagnosed high-risk localized PC (cohort 1), nonmetastatic biochemically recurrent PC (cohort 2), or metastatic PC (cohort 3) will be consecutively enrolled and followed-up for 5 years. An enrollment cap of 600 patients each will be applied to cohorts 1 and 2. Disease status is collected at enrollment, and outcome variables captured at 3-monthly intervals include diagnostic/staging, treatments including reason for change, laboratory results, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. Treatments and survival outcomes will be captured real time until study end. Patient-reported quality-of-life will be measured every 6 months, and medical resource utilization summarized at study end. Data analysis will include exploratory analyses of potential associations between multiple risk factors and socioeconomic variables with disease progression and evaluation of various treatments for PC including novel therapies on clinical outcome and health-related quality-of-life outcomes. Results: 3636 men with PC were enrolled until July 2018; 416 in cohort 1, 399 in cohort 2 and 2821 in cohort 3. Discussion: A total of 3636 patients were enrolled until July 2018. The prospective disease registry will provide comprehensive and wide-ranging real-world information on how PC is diagnosed and treated in Asia. Such information can be used to inform policy development for best practice and direct clinical study design evaluating new treatments. ? 2019","adult; Article; Asia; biochemical recurrence; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical outcome; clinical practice; cohort analysis; comorbidity; digital rectal examination; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate; Gleason score; high risk patient; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; metastasis; metastasis free survival; multicenter study; observational study; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; prostate cancer; quality of life; risk factor; young adult"
"Development of high-performance two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for human hair shaft proteome",2019,"The primary components of human hair shaft—keratin and keratin-associated proteins (KAPs), together with their cross-linked networks—are the underlying reason for its rigid structure. It is therefore requisite to overcome the obstacle of hair insolubility and establish a reliable protocol for the proteome analysis of this accessible specimen. The present study employed an alkaline-based method for the efficient isolation of hair proteins and subsequently examined them using gel-based proteomics. The introduction of two proteomic protocols, namely the conventional and modified protocol, have resulted in the detection of more than 400 protein spots on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). When compared, the modified protocol is deemed to improve overall reproducibility, whilst offering a quick overview of the total protein distribution of hair. The development of this high-performance protocol is hoped to provide a new approach for hair analysis, which could possibly lead to the discovery of biomarkers for hair in health and diseases in the future. ? 2019 Wong et al.

"Aqueous leaf extract of Clinacanthus nutans improved metabolic indices and sorbitol-related complications in type II diabetic rats (T2D)",2019,"Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau (C.?nutans) has been reported to lower blood glucose level; however, evidence on its efficacy in lowering diabetic complications is limited. The antidiabetic properties of C.?nutans aqueous leaf extract on serum metabolic indices, sorbitol production, and aldose reductase enzyme activities in the kidneys, lens, and sciatic nerve of type II diabetic (T2D) rats were evaluated. All rats except normal control rats were fed with a high-fat diet for 8?weeks to induce obesity and subsequently injected with 35?mg/kg streptozotocin to induce type II diabetes. Aqueous leaf extract of C.?nutans (100 and 200?mg?kg ?1 ?day ?1 ) and quercetin (10?mg?kg ?1 ?day ?1 ) were fed orally for 4?weeks. Diabetic rats administered with C.?nutans at 100, 200?mg?kg ?1 ?day ?1 and quercetin had significantly (p?&lt;?0.05) lower fasting blood glucose levels post-intervention: 14.2, 14.0, and 19.9?mm, respectively, compared with the untreated group (22.1?mm). Total cholesterol was significantly (p?&lt;?0.05) lower in the C.?nutans groups in comparison with the diabetic control group. Levels of F2-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, were attenuated in the presence of the extract. Aldose reductase enzyme activity increased by 64, 99, and 0% and total antioxidant activities by 22, 29, and 126%, respectively. Sorbitol levels in the kidney, lens, and nerve were reduced in diabetic rats administered with C.?nutans and quercetin group (by 8, 16, and 3%, respectively). The protective effect of the extract to the liver and kidney was confirmed through liver and kidney enzyme markers and histological analyses. The C.?nutans has the potential to attenuate T2D-induced metabolic perturbations and complications related to sorbitol accumulation. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Acceptance of interprofessional learning between medical and pharmacy students in a prescribing skills training workshop: pre-post intervention study",2019,"Background: The success of interprofessional collaboration in healthcare services requires a paradigm shift in the training of future health profession practitioners. This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument to measure Student Acceptance of Interprofessional Learning (SAIL) in Malaysia, and to assess this attribute among medical and pharmacy students using a prescribing skills training workshop. Methods: The study consisted of two phases. In Phase 1, a 10-item instrument (SAIL-10) was developed and tested on a cohort of medical and pharmacy students who attended the workshop. In Phase 2, different cohorts of medical and pharmacy students completed SAIL-10 before and after participating in the workshop. Results: Factor analysis showed that SAIL-10 has two domains: “facilitators of interprofessional learning” and “acceptance to learning in groups”. The overall SAIL-10 and the two domains have adequate internal consistency and stable reliability. The total score and scores for the two domains were significantly higher after students attended the prescribing skills workshop. Conclusions: This study produced a valid and reliable instrument, SAIL-10 which was used to demonstrate that the prescribing skills workshop, where medical and pharmacy students were placed in an authentic context, was a promising activity to promote interprofessional learning among future healthcare professionals. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; factor analysis; human; internal consistency; intervention study; learning; Malaysia; medical student; pharmacy student; prescription; skill; validation process; adverse drug reaction; education; health personnel attitude; medication error; pilot study; prescription; prevention and control; professional competence; public relations; reproducibility; standards; statistics and numerical data; validation study; Attitude of Health Personnel; Drug Prescriptions; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Education; Education, Pharmacy; Educational Measurement; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Medication Errors; Pilot Projects; Professional Competence; Reproducibility of Results; Students, Medical; Students, Pharmacy"
"Cycloartane triterpenoid (23R, 24E)-23-acetoxymangiferonic acid inhibited proliferation and migration in B16-F10 melanoma via MITF downregulation caused by inhibition of both β-catenin and c-Raf–MEK1–ERK signaling axis",2019,"We recently reported that (23R, 24E)-23-acetoxymangiferonic acid (23R-AMA), a cycloartane triterpenoid isolated by activity-guided separation from a methanol extract of Garcinia sp. bark, inhibited melanin production via inhibition of tyrosinase (TYR) expression in the B16-F10 melanoma cell line. Since 23R-AMA also inhibited microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) expression, an upstream factor of TYR, these features of 23R-AMA were thought to be appropriate for development of whitening cosmetics. However, 23R-AMA exhibited growth inhibition other than inhibition of melanin production in B16-F10 cells. Therefore, we investigated biological activities of 23R-AMA in detail, focused on its application as an anti-melanoma compound. In this study, we demonstrated that 23R-AMA inhibited cell proliferation and basic FGF (bFGF)-induced migration in B16-F10 cells. Furthermore, 23R-AMA promoted ser45/thr41 phosphorylation of β-catenin and suppressed its intranuclear accumulation, which was suggested to be related to inhibition of MITF expression. The transcriptional activity of MITF is known to be regulated by phosphorylation via activated ERK. Further investigation revealed that 23R-AMA inhibited phosphorylation of c-Raf, MEK-1, and ERK, and also that of upstream molecules including FAK and c-Src. These results suggested that 23R-AMA inhibited growth and migration of B16-F10 melanoma by regulating both MITF expression and its activity. The activities of 23R-AMA reported in this study are new aspects of cycloartane triterpenoids. ? 2018, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","23 acetoxymangiferonic acid; arbutin; autophagy related protein; basic fibroblast growth factor receptor; beta catenin; FAK protein; integrin; lactate dehydrogenase; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; protein kinase Fyn; protein kinase p60; protein tyrosine kinase; triterpenoid; unclassified drug; beta catenin; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; Raf protein; antineoplastic activity; Article; B16-F10 cell line; cancer inhibition; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; enzyme phosphorylation; MAPK signaling; melanoma cell line; nucleolus; protein expression; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; cell motion; cell proliferation; chemistry; experimental melanoma; Garcinia; genetics; human; metabolism; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; beta Catenin; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Garcinia; Humans; Melanoma, Experimental; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Phosphorylation; raf Kinases; Signal Transduction"
"Validation of the Malay Version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III in Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia",2019,"Background/Aims: This study aimed to investigate the validity and reliability of the Malay version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Methods: A total of 152 participants (dementia = 53, MCI = 38, controls = 61) were recruited from two teaching hospitals. The Malay version of ACE-III was translated following the standard guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of measure. All the participants were assessed with the Malay version of ACE-III and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: The reliability of the Malay version of ACE-III was good with Cronbach's α coefficient of 0.829 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.959. There was a strong positive correlation between the Malay version of ACE-III and MMSE (r = 0.806). Age (r = -0.335) and years of education (r = 0.536) exerted a significant correlation with total score performance. The cutoff score to discriminate dementia from healthy controls was 74/75 (sensitivity = 90.6%, specificity = 82.0%) whereas to discriminate MCI, the cutoff score was 77/78 (sensitivity = 63.2%, specificity = 63.9%). The diagnostic accuracy of ACE-III was higher than that of MMSE in the detection of dementia (area under the curve: ACE-III = 0.929 vs. MMSE = 0.915). Conclusions: The Malay version of ACE-III demonstrated to be a reliable and valid screening tool for dementia. ? 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

"Risk of all-cause and CHD mortality in women versus men with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Objective: Previous studies have shown sex-specific differences in all-cause and CHD mortality in type 2 diabetes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a global picture of the estimated influence of type 2 diabetes on the risk of all-cause and CHD mortality in women vs men. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for studies published from their starting dates to Aug 7, 2018. The sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and their pooled ratio (women vs men) of all-cause and CHD mortality associated with type 2 diabetes were obtained through an inverse variance-weighted random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were used to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. Results: The 35 analyzed prospective cohort studies included 2 314 292 individuals, among whom 254 038 all-cause deaths occurred. The pooled women vs men ratio of the HRs for all-cause and CHD mortality were 1.17 (95% CI: 1.12–1.23, I 2 = 81.6%) and 1.97 (95% CI: 1.49–2.61, I 2 = 86.4%), respectively. The pooled estimate of the HR for all-cause mortality was approximately 1.30 in articles in which the duration of follow-up was longer than 10 years and 1.10 in articles in which the duration of follow-up was less than 10 years. The pooled HRs for all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes was 2.33 (95% CI: 2.02–2.69) in women and 1.91 (95% CI: 1.72–2.12) in men, compared with their healthy counterparts. Conclusions: The effect of diabetes on all-cause and CHD mortality is approximately 17 and 97% greater, respectively, for women than for men. ? 2019 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","all cause mortality; cardiovascular mortality; cause of death; diabetic patient; female; human; ischemic heart disease; male; meta analysis; mortality rate; mortality risk; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; Review; sex difference; systematic review; congenital heart malformation; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; prospective study; risk factor; sexual characteristics; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Male; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Characteristics"
"A novel and non-invasive approach utilising nasal washings for the detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma",2019,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial cancer of the nasopharynx which is highly associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Worldwide, most of the top 20 countries with the highest incidence and mortality rates of NPC are low- and middle-income countries. Many studies had demonstrated that EBV could be detected in the tissue, serum and plasma of NPC patients. In this study, we explored the potential of assays based on non-invasive nasal washings (NW) as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for NPC. A total of 128 patients were evaluated for NW EBV DNA loads and a subset of these samples were also tested for 27 EBV and human miRNAs shortlisted from literature. EBV DNA and seven miRNAs showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of more than 0.7, suggestive of their potential utility to detect NPC. Logistic regression analyses suggested that combination of two NW assays that test for EBNA-1 and hsa-miR-21 had the best performance in detecting NPC. The trend of NW EBV DNA load matched with clinical outcome of 71.4% (10 out of 14) NPC patients being followed-up. In summary, the non-invasive NW testing panel may be particularly useful for NPC screening in remote areas where healthcare facilities and otolaryngologists are lacking, and may encourage frequent testing of individuals in the high risk groups who are reluctant to have their blood tested. However, further validation in an independent cohort is required to strengthen the utility of this testing panel as a non-invasive detection tool for NPC. ? 2019 The Authors.

"An Efficient Bio-inspired Bees Colony for Breast Cancer Prediction",2019,"Breast cancer has increased mortality rate, one out of eight women have these diseases. The breast cancer is viewed as the second most common type of cancer and it is a big threat to women health and survival. Accurate prediction is a challenging problem with a significant experimental interest. One of the popular methods to predict breast cancer is using the bio-inspired computing. Bio-inspired computing approaches are global optimization algorithms motivated by the natural behaviors of swarms such as ants, birds, fishes and bees. Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) is a well-known bio-inspired algorithm, which is robust, easy to implement and has few setting parameters. However, one of ABC disadvantages is that of slow convergence due to poor exploration and exploitation processes. In this paper, a hybrid search strategy namely: Global Guided Artificial Bee Colony (GGABC) algorithm proposed for Recurrent Neural Network training. The proposed GGABC employs a new hybrid population based on a metaheuristic approach to circumvent the deficiency of the standard ABC. The GGABC algorithm was applied to predict the patient’s status of breast cancer. The approach was simulated by the foraging behavior of global best and guided honey bees. The simulation comparative analysis suggested that the GGABC algorithm was found to converge to the optimal solution faster than the ABC, Guided ABC and Global ABC with an improved accuracy. The results of this research can provide critical information to health authorities to effectively manage the risk factors of the breast cancer in an early stage. ?

"Quantification of berberine in berberis vulgaris L. Root extract and its curative and prophylactic role in cisplatin-induced in vivo toxicity and in vitro cytotoxicity",2019,"Cisplatin is amongst the most potent chemotherapeutic drugs with applications in more than 50% of cancer treatments, but dose-dependent side effects limit its usefulness. Berberis vulgaris L. (B. vulgaris) has a proven role in several therapeutic applications in the traditional medicinal system. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify berberine, a potent alkaloid in the methanolic root extract of B. vulgaris (BvRE). Berberine chloride in BvRE was found to be 10.29% w/w. To assess the prophylactic and curative protective effects of BvRE on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and hyperlipidemia, in vivo toxicity trials were carried out on 25 healthy male albino Wistar rats (130–180 g). Both prophylactic and curative trials included a single dose of cisplatin (4 mg/kg, i.p.) and nine doses of BvRE (500 mg/kg/day, orally). An array of marked toxicity effects appeared in response to cisplatin dosage evident by morphological condition, biochemical analysis of serum (urea, creatinine, total protein, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride), and organ tissue homogenates (malondialdehyde and catalase). Statistically-significant (p < 0.05) variations were observed in various parameters. Moreover, histological studies of liver and kidney tissues revealed that the protective effect of BvRE effectively minimized and reversed nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, and hyperlipidemic effects caused by cisplatin in both prophylactic and curative groups with relatively promising ameliorative effects in the prophylactic regimen. The in vitro cell viability effect of cisplatin, BvRE, and their combination was determined on HeLa cells using the tetrazolium (MTT) assay. MTT clearly corroborated that HeLa cells appeared to be less sensitive to cisplatin and berberine individually, while the combination of both at the same concentrations resulted in growth inhibition of HeLa cells in a remarkable synergistic way. The present validated the use of BvRE as a protective agent in combination therapy with cisplatin. ? 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",""
"Purification and identification of novel cytotoxic oligopeptides from soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum [?珊瑚Sarcophyton glaucum 中新型?胞毒性寡 ?的?化与?定]",2019,"Globally, peptide-based anticancer therapies have drawn much attention. Marine organisms are a reservoir of anticancer peptides that await discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify cytotoxic oligopeptides from Sarcophyton glaucum. Peptides were purified from among the S. glaucum hydrolysates produced by alcalase, chymotrypsin, papain, and trypsin, guided by a methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on the human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line for cytotoxicity evaluation. Purification techniques adopted were membrane ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, solid phase extraction (SPE), and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Purified peptides were identified by de novo peptide sequencing. From papain hydrolysate, three peptide sequences were identified: AGAPGG, AERQ, and RDTQ (428.45, 502.53, and 518.53 Da, respectively). Peptides synthesized from these sequences exhibited cytotoxicity on HeLa cells with median effect concentration (EC 50 ) values of 8.6, 4.9, and 5.6 mmol/L, respectively, up to 5.8-fold stronger than the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil. When tested at their respective EC 50 , AGAPGG, AERQ, and RDTQ showed only 16%, 25%, and 11% cytotoxicity to non-cancerous Hek293 cells, respectively. In conclusion, AERQ, AGAPGG, and RDTQ are promising candidates for future development as peptide-based anticancer drugs. ? 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cytotoxic agent; fluorouracil; oligopeptide; antineoplastic agent; cytotoxin; marine toxin; oligopeptide; amino acid sequence; Article; controlled study; coral; drug cytotoxicity; drug identification; drug purification; EC50; female; gel filtration chromatography; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; peptide synthesis; priority journal; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; Sarcophyton glaucum; sequence analysis; solid phase extraction; animal; Anthozoa; chemistry; drug development; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrolysis; isolation and purification; reversed phase liquid chromatography; size exclusion chromatography; tandem mass spectrometry; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anthozoa; Antineoplastic Agents; Chromatography, Gel; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chromatography, Reverse-Phase; Cytotoxins; Drug Discovery; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hydrolysis; Marine Toxins; Oligopeptides; Solid Phase Extraction; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"
"Analysis of dental services distribution in Malaysia: a geographic information systems – based approach",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse, in detail, the distribution of primary dental clinics in relation to the Malaysian population and relative population wealth, to test the hypothesis that an uneven distribution of dental services exists in Malaysia. Method: This 2016 study located every dental practice in Malaysia (private and public) and mapped these practices against population, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. Population clusters within 5, 10 and 20 km of a dental clinic were identified, and clinic-to-population ratios were ascertained. Population data were obtained from the Population and Housing Census of Malaysia 2010. Population relative wealth was obtained from the 2014 Report on Household Income and Basic Amenities Survey for Malaysia. The physical address for each dental practice in Malaysia was gathered from the Official Portal of Ministry of Health Malaysia. All data for analysis were extracted from the integrated database in Quantum GIS (QGIS) into Microsoft Excel. Result: The population of Malaysia (24.9 million) was distributed across 127 districts, with 119 (94%) having at least one dental clinic. Sixty-four districts had fewer than 10 dental clinics, and 11.3% of Malaysians did not reside in the catchment of 20 km from any dental clinic. The total dental clinic-to-population ratio was 1:9,000: for public dental clinics it was 1:38,000 and for private clinics it was 1:13,000. Conclusion: Dental services were distributed relative to high population density, were unevenly distributed across Malaysia and the majority of people with the highest inaccessibility to a dental service resided in Malaysian Borneo. ? 2018 FDI World Dental Federation","article; catchment; dental clinic; dental practice; dentist; geographic information system; household income; housing; human; Malaysia; Malaysian; population density; software; dental procedure; health care delivery; Malaysia; Dental Care; Dental Clinics; Geographic Information Systems; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Malaysia"
"Screening for microsatellite instability in colorectal carcinoma: Practical utility of immunohistochemistry and pcr with fragment analysis in a diagnostic histopathology setting",2019,"Since 2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has recommended that colorectal carcinoma (CRC) be universally tested for high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) which is present in 15% of such cancers. Fidelity of resultant microsatellites during DNA replication is contingent upon an intact mismatch repair (MMR) system and lack of fidelity can result in tumourigenesis. Prior to commencing routine screening for MSI-H, we assessed two commonly used methods, immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of loss of MMR gene products viz MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 against PCR amplification and subsequent fragment analysis of microsatellite markers, BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250 (Bethesda markers) in 73 unselected primary CRC. 15.1% (11/73) were categorized as MSI-H while deficient MMR (dMMR) was detected in 16.4% (12/73). Of the dMMR, 66.7% (8/12) were classified MSI-H, while 33.3% (4/12) were microsatellite stable/low microsatellite instability (MSS/MSI-L). Of the proficient MMR (pMMR), 95.1% (58/61) were MSS/MSI-L and 4.9% (3/61) were MSI-H. The Κ value of 0.639 (standard error =0.125; p = 0.000) indicated substantial agreement between detection of loss of DNA mismatch repair using immunohistochemistry and the detection of downstream microsatellite instability using PCR. After consideration of advantages and shortcomings of both methods, it is our opinion that the choice of preferred technique for MSI analysis would depend on the type of laboratory carrying out the testing. ? 2019, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

"An Asian consensus on standards of diagnostic upper endoscopy for neoplasia",2019,"Background This is a consensus developed by a group of expert endoscopists aiming to standardise the preparation, process and endoscopic procedural steps for diagnosis of early upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Method The Delphi method was used to develop consensus statements through identification of clinical questions on diagnostic endoscopy. Three consensus meetings were conducted to consolidate the statements and voting. We conducted a systematic literature search on evidence for each statement. The statements were presented in the second consensus meeting and revised according to comments. The final voting was conducted at the third consensus meeting on the level of evidence and agreement. Results Risk stratification should be conducted before endoscopy and high risk endoscopic findings should raise an index of suspicion. The presence of premalignant mucosal changes should be documented and use of sedation is recommended to enhance detection of superficial upper GI neoplasms. The use of antispasmodics and mucolytics enhanced visualisation of the upper GI tract, and systematic endoscopic mapping should be conducted to improve detection. Sufficient examination time and structured training on diagnosis improves detection. Image enhanced endoscopy in addition to white light imaging improves detection of superficial upper GI cancer. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging is recommended for characterisation of upper GI superficial neoplasms. Endoscopic characterisation can avoid unnecessary biopsy. Conclusion This consensus provides guidance for the performance of endoscopic diagnosis and characterisation for early gastric and oesophageal neoplasia based on the evidence. This will enhance the quality of endoscopic diagnosis and improve detection of early upper GI cancers. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Some compounds showed very good acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. N′-(1,3-Benzothiazol-2-yl)- and N′-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzamidines were the most active α-glucosidase inhibitors with IC50 values of 134.2 and 244.57 ?M, respectively. N′-(1,3-Benzothiazol-2-yl)benzamidine also inhibited urease. Most of the obtained compounds showed inhibitory activity against reverse transcriptase (anti-HIV activity), presumably due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, good solubility, and hydrophilicity. ? 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",""
"Advanced glycation end products-related modulation of cathepsin L and NF-κB signalling effectors in retinal pigment epithelium lead to augmented response to TNFα",2019,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a central role in neuroretinal homoeostasis throughout life. Altered proteolysis and inflammatory processes involving RPE contribute to the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but the link between these remains elusive. We report for the first time the effect of advanced glycation end products (AGE)—known to accumulate on the ageing RPE's underlying Bruch's membrane in?situ—on both key lysosomal cathepsins and NF-κB signalling in RPE. Cathepsin L activity and NF-κB effector levels decreased significantly following 2-week AGE exposure. Chemical cathepsin L inhibition also decreased total p65 protein levels, indicating that AGE-related change of NF-κB effectors in RPE cells may be modulated by cathepsin L. However, upon TNFα stimulation, AGE-exposed cells had significantly higher ratio of phospho-p65(Ser536)/total p65 compared to non-AGEd controls, with an even higher fold increase than in the presence of cathepsin L inhibition alone. Increased proportion of active p65 indicates an AGE-related activation of NF-κB signalling in a higher proportion of cells and/or an enhanced response to TNFα. Thus, NF-κB signalling modulation in the AGEd environment, partially regulated via cathepsin L, is employed by RPE cells as a protective (para-inflammatory) mechanism but renders them more responsive to pro-inflammatory stimuli. ? 2018 The Authors.

"A Stepwise Approach to a National Hepatitis C Screening Strategy in Malaysia to Meet the WHO 2030 Targets: Proposed Strategy, Coverage, and Costs",2019,"Background: In Malaysia, more than 330 000 individuals are estimated to be chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), but less than 2% have been treated to date. Objectives: To estimate the required coverage and costs of a national screening strategy to inform the launch of an HCV elimination program. Methods: We designed an HCV screening strategy based on a “stepwise” approach. This approach relied on targeting of people who inject drugs in the early years, with delayed onset of widespread general population screening. Annual coverage requirements and associated costs were estimated to ensure that the World Health Organization elimination treatment targets were met. Results: In total, 6 million individuals would have to be screened between 2018 and 2030. Targeting of people who inject drugs in the early years would limit annual screening coverage to less than 1 million individuals from 2018 to 2026. General population screening would have to be launched by 2026. Total costs were estimated at MYR 222 million ($58 million). Proportional to coverage targets, 60% of program costs would fall from 2026 to 2030. Conclusions: This exercise was one of the first attempts to conduct a detailed analysis of the required screening coverage and costs of a national HCV elimination strategy. These findings suggest that the stepwise approach could delay the onset of general population screening by more than 5 years after the program's launch. This delay would allow additional time to mobilize investments required for a successful general population screening program and also minimize program costs. This strategy prototype could inform the design of effective screening strategies in other countries. ? 2019 ISPOR–The professional society for health economics and outcomes research","Article; controlled study; disease elimination; health care cost; health care planning; health insurance; health program; hepatitis C; human; injection drug user; Malaysia; mass screening; national health service; prevalence; priority journal; economics; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; mass screening; pathogenicity; procedures; strategic planning; antivirus agent; Antiviral Agents; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Humans; Malaysia; Mass Screening; Strategic Planning"
"Potentiating the anti-cancer profile of tamoxifen-loaded graphene using deep eutectic solvents as functionalizing agents",2020,"Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are an alternative to conventional functionalizing agents. These neoteric functionalizing agents have been reported to improve the dispersibility and biocompatibility of graphene in the cellular environment. DES-functionalized graphene also has significantly greater tamoxifen (TAM)-loading capacity than non-functionalized graphene. Therefore, this study investigated the anti-cancer properties of TAM-loaded graphene against cancerous cells. TAM-loaded, DES-functionalized graphene showed a significant increase in anti-cancer activity, especially in the case of DES ChCl:fructose (2:1), as validated by cell viability, reactive oxygen species, and cell cycle progression assays. The cytotoxicity profile of TAM-loaded graphene against cancerous cells was confirmed by real-time cell growth analysis. Across all tested cellular kinetic models, the most significant reduction in the growth rate constant of cancerous cells was obtained using graphene functionalized with DES ChCl:fructose (2:1). All told, DES-functionalized graphene demonstrated improved anti-cancer activity compared to non-functionalized graphene. ? 2019, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.",""
"Genetic diversity of merozoite surface protein-1 gene block 2 allelic types in plasmodium falciparum isolates from malaysia and thailand",2019,"Malaria is the most common vector-borne parasitic disease in Malaysia and Thailand, especially in Malayan Borneo and along the Thailand border areas, but little is known about the genetic diversity of the parasite. Present study aims to investigate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates in these two countries and eventually contributes to more effective malaria control strategies, particularly in vaccine and antimalarial treatment. One hundred and seventy three P. falciparum isolates were collected from Malaysia (n = 67) and Thailand (n = 106) and genotyped using nested PCR targeting the polymorphic region of MSP-1, block 2. Sequence analysis was conducted to investigate the allele diversity of the isolates. Three allelic families were identified in Malaysian and Thailand P. falciparum isolates, MAD20, K1 and RO33. Sequence analysis revealed that there were 5 different MAD20, 1 K1 and 2 different RO33 for Malaysian isolates. Thailand isolates exhibited greater polymorphism because there were 13 different MAD20, 6 different K1 and 2 different RO33 identified in this study. Multiclonal infections were observed for the isolates in both countries, however, low multiplicity of infection (MOI) was observed for Malaysian (1.1) and Thailand (1.2) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that P. falciparum isolates of Malaysia and Thailand were clustered in the same group for all the allelic families. Population structure of P. falciparum isolates in Malaysia and Thailand exhibit extensive genetic polymorphism but showed high similarities as well as comparable MOI. ? 2019, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

"Hybrid nanocomposite curcumin-capped gold nanoparticle-reduced graphene oxide: Antioxidant potency and selective cancer cytotoxicity",2019,"Nanotechnology-based antioxidants and therapeutic agents are believed to be the next generation tools to face the ever-increasing cancer mortality rates. Graphene stands as a preferred nano-therapeutic template, due to the advanced properties and cellular interaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, majority of graphene-based composites suffer from hindered development as efficient cancer therapeutics. Recent nano-toxicology reviews and recommendations emphasize on the preliminary synthetic stages as a crucial element in driving successful applications results. In this study, we present an integrated, green, one-pot hybridization of target-suited raw materials into curcumin-capped gold nanoparticle-conjugated reduced graphene oxide (CAG) nanocomposite, as a prominent anti-oxidant and anticancer agent. Distinct from previous studies, the beneficial attributes of curcumin are employed to their fullest extent, such that they perform dual roles of being a natural reducing agent and possessing antioxidant anti-cancer functional moiety. The proposed novel green synthesis approach secured an enhanced structure with dispersed homogenous AuNPs (15.62 ± 4.04 nm) anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, surpassing other traditional chemical reductants. On the other hand, safe, non-toxic CAG elevates biological activity and supports biocompatibility. Free radical DPPH inhibition assay revealed CAG antioxidant potential with IC50(324.1 ± 1.8%) value reduced by half compared to that of traditional citrate-rGO-AuNP nanocomposite (612.1 ± 10.1%), which confirms the amplified multi-potent antioxidant activity. Human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and SW-948) showed concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity for CAG, as determined by optical microscopy images and WST-8 assay, with relatively low IC50values (~100 μg/ml), while preserving biocompatibility towards normal human colon (CCD-841) and liver cells (WRL-68), with high selectivity indices ( 2.0) at all tested time points. Collectively, our results demonstrate effective green synthesis of CAG nanocomposite, free of additional stabilizing agents, and its bioactivity as an antioxidant and selective anti-colon cancer agent. ? 2019 Al-Ani et al.

"Risks of stillbirth and neonatal death with advancing gestation at term: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of 15 million pregnancies",2019,"Background: Despite advances in healthcare, stillbirth rates remain relatively unchanged. We conducted a systematic review to quantify the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death at term (from 37 weeks gestation) according to gestational age. Methods and findings: We searched the major electronic databases Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar (January 1990–October 2018) without language restrictions. We included cohort studies on term pregnancies that provided estimates of stillbirths or neonatal deaths by gestation week. We estimated the additional weekly risk of stillbirth in term pregnancies that continued versus delivered at various gestational ages. We compared week-specific neonatal mortality rates by gestational age at delivery. We used mixed-effects logistic regression models with random intercepts, and computed risk ratios (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Thirteen studies (15 million pregnancies, 17,830 stillbirths) were included. All studies were from high-income countries. Four studies provided the risks of stillbirth in mothers of White and Black race, 2 in mothers of White and Asian race, 5 in mothers of White race only, and 2 in mothers of Black race only. The prospective risk of stillbirth increased with gestational age from 0.11 per 1,000 pregnancies at 37 weeks (95% CI 0.07 to 0.15) to 3.18 per 1,000 at 42 weeks (95% CI 1.84 to 4.35). Neonatal mortality increased when pregnancies continued beyond 41 weeks; the risk increased significantly for deliveries at 42 versus 41 weeks gestation (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.86, p = 0.012). One additional stillbirth occurred for every 1,449 (95% CI 1,237 to 1,747) pregnancies that advanced from 40 to 41 weeks. Limitations include variations in the definition of low-risk pregnancy, the wide time span of the studies, the use of registry-based data, and potential confounders affecting the outcome. Conclusions: Our findings suggest there is a significant additional risk of stillbirth, with no corresponding reduction in neonatal mortality, when term pregnancies continue to 41 weeks compared to delivery at 40 weeks.

"Evaluating Physicians’ Intention to Discriminate Against Patients Living with HIV in Malaysia",2019,"People with HIV (PWH) in Malaysia experience high levels of stigma, which may act as a barrier to accessing healthcare. Stigma against PWH in medical settings is understudied in Malaysia. In the present study, we examine factors associated with physicians’ intention to discriminate against PWH in Malaysia. A cross-sectional online survey was emailed to all 1431 physicians at two major university hospitals in Malaysia; 568 (39.6%) participants completed the survey and were included in this analysis. Measures included intention to discriminate against PWH, stigma-related constructs, and socio-demographic characteristics. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify factors associated with intention to discriminate against PWH. Participants were comprised of women (53.5%), Malays (43.1%), and Chinese (35.0%) with nearly 10?years of clinical experience. Most participants were from non-surgical specialties (77.6%). The final multivariate linear regression showed that physicians who expressed greater discriminatory intent against PWH also expressed more negative feelings toward PWH, more HIV-related shame, were more fearful of HIV, and believed that PWH do not deserve good care. Physicians from surgical-based specialties were also significantly more likely to endorse discriminatory intent toward PWH. Stigma and intentions to discriminate against a class of patients, including PWH, can undermine engagement in care, which is central to international HIV prevention and treatment strategies. Interventions that reduce stigma toward PWH among physicians are crucial to ensuring equitable and stigma-free healthcare. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; linear regression analysis; Malay (people); Malaysia; multicenter study; physician; shame; stigma; surgery; university hospital; behavior; cross-sectional study; ethnology; fear; health personnel attitude; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Malaysia; male; middle aged; perceptive discrimination; physician; prejudice; psychology; questionnaire; social stigma; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Discrimination (Psychology); Fear; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Intention; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Physicians; Prejudice; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"A Preliminary Study in Search of Potential Peptide Candidates for a Combinational Therapy with Cancer Chemotherapy Drug",2019,"Cancer which caused by the growth and spreading of abnormal cells in an uncontrolled manner remains a major cause of death affecting millions of people. The current cancer chemotherapy treatment modalities have several disadvantages, mostly related to their undesirable side effects. In this study, we explore the potencies of selected cell penetrating antimicrobial peptides in combination with the widely used chemotherapy drug, Doxorubicin (DOX), to increase the specificity of anticancer chemotherapy. Screening the potential peptide candidates to be developed into chemotherapy drug combination led to identification of two most potent peptides, Tachyplesin 1 (TCH) and Latarcin 1 (LTC). Cell viability of normal liver cells was reduced to 50% by 20??M of TCH or LTC, while liver cancer cell lines lost 50% of their viability at approximately 4??M of these peptides. The combination of DOX with TCH peptide showed the higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage from cancer cells (80%) compared to normal cells (30%). The combinational treatment DOX-peptide showed significant (P < 0.01) increase in caspase 3/7 activity compared to DOX alone. Pre-treatment of the cells with TCH peptides prior to DOX treatment considerably increased the Caspase 3/7 activities in both cell types with significant increase (P < 0.05) in cancer cells compared to normal cells. Our study demonstrate that TCH peptide is a potential anticancer peptide that could be used in combinational therapy with cancer chemotherapy drugs. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; caspase 7; doxorubicin; lactate dehydrogenase; latarcin 1; polypeptide antibiotic agent; tachyplesin; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cell viability; enzyme activity; human; human cell; liver cancer cell line; liver cell"
"Comparison of Shear Wave Elastography and Conventional Ultrasound in Assessing Kidney Function as Measured Using 51 Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid and 99 Tc-Dimercaptosuccinic Acid",2019,"The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of shear wave elastography (SWE)as an indicator of abnormal kidney function defined by radiolabeled glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Fifty-seven patients referred for 51 Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid GFR and 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy were included. Young's modulus (YM)measured with SWE and kidney length, volume, cortical thickness and parenchymal echogenicity measured with conventional ultrasound were correlated with patients' GFR and renal scintigraphy results. Spearman correlation coefficients between SWE and GFR were negative for the right (r = –0.635, p &lt; 0.0001)and left (r = –0.817, p &lt; 0.0001)kidneys. Positive correlations between left renal cortical thickness (r = 0.381, p = 0.04)and left kidney volume (r = 0.356, p = 0.019)with GFR were reported. SWE correctly predicted the dominant functioning kidney in 94.7% of cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for SWE (0.800)was superior to that for conventional ultrasound (0.252–0.415). The cutoff value of ?5.52 kPa suggested a kidney function ?60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (82.4% sensitivity and 76.2% specificity).

"Dynamics and binding interactions of peptide inhibitors of dengue virus entry",2019,"In this study, we investigate the binding interactions of two synthetic antiviral peptides (DET2 and DET4) on type II dengue virus (DENV2) envelope protein domain III. These two antiviral peptides are designed based on the domain III of the DENV2 envelope protein, which has shown significant inhibition activity in previous studies and can be potentially modified further to be active against all dengue strains. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina and the best-ranked peptide-domain III complex was further explored using molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular mechanics-Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) was used to calculate the relative binding free energies and to locate the key residues of peptide–protein interactions. The predicted binding affinity correlated well with the previous experimental studies. DET4 outperformed DET2 and is oriented within the binding site through favorable vdW and electrostatic interactions. Pairwise residue decomposition analysis has revealed several key residues that contribute to the binding of these peptides. Residues in DET2 interact relatively lesser with the domain III compared to DET4. Dynamic cross-correlation analysis showed that both the DET2 and DET4 trigger different dynamic patterns on the domain III. Correlated motions were seen between the residue pairs of DET4 and the binding site while binding of DET2 results in anti-correlated motion on the binding site. This work showcases the use of computational study in elucidating and explaining the experiment observation on an atomic level. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","peptide DET1; peptide DET2; peptide DET3; peptide DET4; synthetic peptide; unclassified drug; virus envelope protein; virus fusion inhibitor; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; correlational study; Dengue virus 2; drug protein binding; hydrogen bond; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular mechanics; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein structure; static electricity; structure activity relation; surface area; virus entry; virus strain"
"Effect of Blastocystis sp. In dengue patients—Increase in the treatment cost and exacerbation of symptoms",2019,"Increasing incidences of dengue have become a global health threat with major clinical manifestation including high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms were also expressed among Blastocystis sp. infected individuals, a parasite commonly seen in human stools. This parasite has been previously reported to replicate faster upon exposure to high temperature. The present study is a hospitalized-based cross-sectional study involved the collection of faecal sample from dengue patients. Stool examination was done by in vitro cultivation to isolate Blastocystis sp. Growth pattern of all the positive isolates were analyzed to identify the multiplication rate of Blastocystis sp. isolated from dengue patients. Distribution of Blastocystis sp. among dengue patients was 23.6%. Dengue patients who were positive for Blastocystis sp. infection denoted a significantly higher fever rate reaching 38.73C (p<0.05) compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients (38.44C). It was also found that Blastocystis sp. infected patients complained of frequenting the toilet more than five times a day (p<0.05) compared to those who were non-Blastocystis sp. infected. At the same time, the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer (p<0.05) for Blastocystis sp. infected dengue patients compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients. Besides, Blastocystis sp. isolated from dengue patients (in vivo thermal stress) showed a higher growth rate compared to the non-dengue isolated which was exposed to high temperature (in vitro thermal stress). Our findings suggest that presence of Blastocystis sp. during dengue infection could trigger the increase of temperature which could be due to highly elevated pro inflammatory cytokines by both parasitic and virus infection. This could justify why the temperature in Blastocystis sp. infected dengue patients is higher compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients. Higher temperature could have triggered a greater parasite multiplication rate that contributed to the aggravation of the gastrointestinal symptoms. ? 2019 Thergarajan et al.

"Nobiletin and derivatives: Functional compounds from citrus fruit peel for colon cancer chemoprevention",2019,"The search for effective methods of cancer treatment and prevention has been a continuous effort since the disease was discovered. Recently, there has been increasing interest in exploring plants and fruits for molecules that may have potential as either adjuvants or as chemopreventive agents against cancer. One of the promising compounds under extensive research is nobiletin (NOB), a polymethoxyflavone (PMF) extracted exclusively from citrus peel. Not only does nobiletin itself exhibit anti-cancer properties, but its derivatives are also promising chemopreventive agents; examples of derivatives with anti-cancer activity include 3′-demethylnobiletin (3′-DMN), 4′-demethylnobiletin (4′-DMN), 3′,4′-didemethylnobiletin (3′,4′-DMN) and 5-demethylnobiletin (5-DMN). In vitro studies have demonstrated differential efficacies and mechanisms of NOB and its derivatives in inhibiting and killing of colon cancer cells. The chemopreventive potential of NOB has also been well demonstrated in several in vivo colon carcinogenesis animal models. NOB and its derivatives target multiple pathways in cancer progression and inhibit several of the hallmark features of colorectal cancer (CRC) pathophysiology, including arresting the cell cycle, inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, preventing tumour formation, reducing inflammatory effects and limiting angiogenesis. However, these substances have low oral bioavailability that limits their clinical utility, hence there have been numerous efforts exploring better drug delivery strategies for NOB and these are part of this review. We also reviewed data related to patents involving NOB to illustrate the extensiveness of each research area and its direction of commercialisation. Furthermore, this review also provides suggested directions for future research to advance NOB as the next promising candidate in CRC chemoprevention. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Seroprevalence of borrelia burgdorferi among the indigenous people (Orang asli) of peninsular malaysia",2019,"Introduction: Lyme disease has been well-described in the North America and European countries. However, information is still very limited in the developing countries including Malaysia. The Orang Asli (OA), the indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia reside mostly in the forest and forest fringe areas abundant with the vector for Lyme disease. Here, we described the seroprevalence of Borellia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) among the OA and demographic variables that could be associated with seroprevalence. Methodology: A total of 16 OA villages distributed across 8 states in Peninsular Malaysia participated in this study. Sera obtained from 904 OA volunteers were screened for anti-B. burgdorferi IgG antibodies. ELISA results obtained and demographic information collected were analysed to identify possible variables associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 73 (8.1%) OA tested positive for anti-B. burgdorferi IgG antibodies. Among all the variables examined, village of residence (p = 0.045) was the only significant predictor for seropositivity. High (> 10.0%) prevalence was associated with three OA villages. Those living in one particular village were 1.65 times more likely to be seropositive as compared to other OA villages. Age, gender, marital status, household size, level of education, monthly household income and occupation were not significant predictors for seropositivity. Conclusion: Results of the present study support earlier findings that B. burgdorferi infection among Malaysians is currently under-recognized. Further studies will be needed at these locations to confirm the presence of Lyme disease among these populations. ? 2019 Khor et al.","immunoglobulin G; adolescent; adult; Article; Borrelia burgdorferi; child; cross-sectional study; education; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; household income; human; indigenous people; Lyme disease; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; prevalence; questionnaire; retrospective study; seroprevalence; vaccination"
"Global Disparities in Breast Cancer Genetics Testing, Counselling and Management",2019,"Hereditary breast cancers, mainly due to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, account for only 5–10% of this disease. The threshold for genetic testing is a 10% likelihood of detecting a mutation, as determined by validated models such as BOADICEA and Manchester Scoring System. A 90–95% reduction in breast cancer risk can be achieved with bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy in unaffected BRCA mutation carriers. In patients with BRCA-associated breast cancer, there is a 40% risk of contralateral breast cancer and hence risk-reducing contralateral mastectomy is recommended, which can be performed simultaneously with surgery for unilateral breast cancer. Other options for risk management include surveillance by mammogram and breast magnetic resonance imaging, and chemoprevention with hormonal agents. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and development of multigene panel testing, the cost and time taken for genetic testing have reduced, making it possible for treatment-focused genetic testing. There are also drugs such as the PARP inhibitors that specifically target the BRCA mutation. Risk management multidisciplinary clinics are designed to quantify risk, and offer advice on preventative strategies. However, such services are only possible in high-income settings. In low-resource settings, the prohibitive cost of testing and the lack of genetic counsellors are major barriers to setting up a breast cancer genetics service. Family history is often not well documented because of the stigma associated with cancer. Breast cancer genetics services remain an unmet need in low- and middle-income countries, where the priority is to optimise access to quality treatment. ? 2019, Soci?t?

"A Systematic Review and International Web-Based Survey of Randomized Controlled Trials in the Perioperative and Critical Care Setting: Interventions Reducing Mortality",2019,"The authors aimed to identify interventions documented by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reduce mortality in adult critically ill and perioperative patients, followed by a survey of clinicians’ opinions and routine practices to understand the clinicians’ response to such evidence. The authors performed a comprehensive literature review to identify all topics reported to reduce mortality in perioperative and critical care settings according to at least 2 RCTs or to a multicenter RCT or to a single-center RCT plus guidelines. The authors generated position statements that were voted on online by physicians worldwide for agreement, use, and willingness to include in international guidelines. From 262 RCT manuscripts reporting mortality differences in the perioperative and critically ill settings, the authors selected 27 drugs, techniques, and strategies (66 RCTs, most frequently published by the New England Journal of Medicine [13 papers], Lancet [7], and Journal of the American Medical Association [5]) with an agreement ?67% from over 250 physicians (46 countries). Noninvasive ventilation was the intervention supported by the largest number of RCTs (n = 13). The concordance between agreement and use (a positive answer both to “do you agree” and “do you use”) showed differences between Western and other countries and between anesthesiologists and intensive care unit physicians. The authors identified 27 clinical interventions with randomized evidence of survival benefit and strong clinician support in support of their potential life-saving properties in perioperative and critically ill patients with noninvasive ventilation having the highest level of support. However, clinician views appear affected by specialty and geographical location. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article; clinical practice; critically ill patient; human; intensive care; intensive care unit; mortality; noninvasive ventilation; perioperative period; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; critical illness; intensive care; Internet; mortality; physician; procedures; questionnaire; trends; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Internet; Mortality; Physicians; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Exploring Intimate Partner Violence Among Women Attending Malaysian Primary Care Clinics",2019,"Victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) are frequent attendees at health care facilities. Although most literature on this subject focuses on developed or Western countries, there is a dearth of information from Asian countries. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of IPV among women attending urban primary care services in Malaysia and to identify the risk factors associated with IPV. Six out of 15 available public primary care clinics in the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were randomly selected. The sampling size for each clinic was conducted proportionate to the clinic’s average daily patient attendance. A total of 882 women participated in this study via a self-administered questionnaire. We administered the women’s experience with battering scale (WEB-scale) to estimate the prevalence of psychological violence and included a screening question for physical and sexual assault. The results showed that 22.0% of the women surveyed reported experiencing IPV. Ethnicity appears to be a significant predictor, with Chinese and Indian women reporting IPV at a higher rate than Malay women. Women with IPV are more likely to come from lower income households, have witnessed parental IPV, receive less social support, and have poorer psychological well-being. Our findings indicate that the prevalence of IPV among women attending urban public primary care clinics is high. Health care providers should pay close attention during clinical encounters for any sign of IPV, particularly among those presenting with risk factors. ?

"Cognitive dysfunction in Malaysian patients with major depressive disorder: A subgroup analysis of a multicountry, cross-sectional study",2019,"Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction has been significantly associated with functional impairment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: This is a subgroup analysis of 211 Malaysian patients recruited from the multicountry, multicenter, cross-sectional Cognitive Dysfunction in Asian patients with Depression (CogDAD) study. Depression severity, cognitive dysfunction, and functional disability were assessed and compared with the overall CogDAD study population. Factors associated with functional disability were also evaluated in this Malaysian patient population. Results: Approximately half of the Malaysian patients were in their first depressive episode, with the majority being treated for mild-to-moderate depression. Furthermore, Malaysian patients experienced cognitive dysfunction, with self-reported Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ-D) scores falling within the third quartile of PDQ-D severity. Malaysian patients also reported functional disability evidenced by a mean total Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) score of 11.47?±?6.68, with the highest SDS score reported in the “Social Life/Leisure Activities” domain. Compared with the overall CogDAD study population, the Malaysian patient population had comparable patient demographics in terms of marital and working status; outcome scores for PHQ-9 (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for self-reported depression severity), PDQ-D and SDS; and worst perceived cognitive dysfunction reported in the “Attention/Concentration” domain. Factors found to be significantly associated with functional disability were PDQ-D score, sick leave taken, and antidepressant treatment (P?<?0.05). Discussion: Findings from this subgroup analysis highlight the significance of treating cognitive dysfunction in patients with MDD and its correlation to functional disability. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adult; aged; Article; attention; Clinical Global Impression scale; cognitive defect; comparative study; cross-sectional study; disability; disease severity; family life; female; functional assessment; human; leisure; major clinical study; major depression; Malaysian; male; medical leave; mental concentration; observational study; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; perceived deficits questionnaire; priority journal; Sheehan Disability Scale; social life; clinical trial; cognitive defect; complication; major depression; Malaysia; middle aged; multicenter study; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; young adult; Adult; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult"
"Edible mushrooms from Malaysia; a literature review on their nutritional and medicinal properties",2019,"Mushrooms have been consumed by mankind for millennia. In Malaysia, there are many species of edible mushrooms which are either cultivated (Agaricus spp., Auricularia spp., Pleurotus spp.) or harvested in the wild (Ganoderma spp., Polyporus spp., Termitomyces spp.). With the advancement of technology, numerous discoveries have been made that elucidated the nutritional (high in fibres, proteins, vitamins; low in fats, cholesterols, sodium) and medicinal (anti-oxidative, anti-hypertensive, neuritogenesis) properties of edible mushrooms, all of which are highly beneficial for the maintenance of human health and well-being. This review thus compiles and documents the available literatures on edible mushrooms reported from Malaysia complete with scientific, English, and vernacular names for future references; provides a comprehensive and updated overview on the nutritional and medicinal properties edible mushrooms reported from Malaysia; and identifies the research gaps to promote further research and development on edible mushrooms reported from Malaysia. Overall, Malaysia is and remains a natural repository for wild and cultivated edible mushrooms. Deeper investigation on their nutritional and medicinal properties will certainly serve as an impetus for economic as well as scientific progress. ? All Rights Reserved.",""
"Disseminated takayasu arteritis with neurovascular small and medium vessel involvement",2019,"Takayasu arteritis is a rare granulomatous vasculitis that is commonly classified as a large vessel disease. Small and medium vessel involvement are extremely rare, with only a few case reports describing neurovascular, ocular and cutaneous involvement. We describe a 21 year old Malaysian woman with pre-existing Takayasu arteritis confined to the large vessels, presenting one year later to our centre with status epilepticus. Extensive radiologic studies revealed diffuse encephalopathic changes and multifocal neurovascular involvement, with the vasculitis progressing to encompass the large, medium and small vessels. The patient was treated with high dose steroid therapy and discharged well with long term steroid and immunosuppressive therapy. Follow up MRI with vessel wall imaging sequence (VW-MR) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion imaging demonstrated intra and extracranial vessel wall inflammation, with generalized reduction in left sided cerebral blood flow. This case demonstrates that Takayasu arteritis is not exclusively a large vessel vasculitis, and that small and medium vessel involvement does not preclude its diagnosis. ? 2019, ASEAN Neurological Association.

"In vitro functional evaluation of isolaureline, dicentrine and glaucine enantiomers at 5-HT2 and α1 receptors",2019,"Compounds with activity at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT2 and α1 adrenergic receptors have potential for the treatment of central nervous system disorders, drug addiction or overdose. Isolaureline, dicentrine and glaucine enantiomers were synthesized, and their in vitro functional activities at human 5-HT2 and adrenergic α1 receptor subtypes were evaluated. The enantiomers of isolaureline and dicentrine acted as antagonists at 5-HT2 and α1 receptors with (R)-isolaureline showing the greatest potency (pKb?=?8.14 at the 5-HT2C receptor). Both (R)- and (S)-glaucine also antagonized α1 receptors, but they behaved very differently to the other compounds at 5-HT2 receptors: (S)-glaucine acted as a partial agonist at all three 5-HT2 receptor subtypes, whereas (R)-glaucine appeared to act as a positive allosteric modulator at the 5-HT2A receptor. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S","adrenergic receptor; dicentrine; glaucine; isolaureline; serotonin 1A receptor; serotonin 2 receptor; serotonin antagonist; unclassified drug; alpha 1 adrenergic receptor; alpha 1 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; aporphine derivative; dicentrine; glaucine; serotonin; serotonin 2 agonist; serotonin 2A receptor; antagonist potency; Article; controlled study; drug synthesis; enantiomer; in vitro study; priority journal; stereoselectivity; binding site; chemistry; genetics; HEK293 cell line; human; kinetics; metabolism; molecular docking; protein tertiary structure; stereoisomerism; structure activity relation; Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Agonists; Aporphines; Binding Sites; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Kinetics; Molecular Docking Simulation; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1; Serotonin; Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Agonists; Stereoisomerism; Structure-Activity Relationship"
"The forward-backward and dual-panel translation methods are comparable in producing semantic equivalent versions of a heart quality of life questionnaire",2019,"Aim: To investigate semantic equivalence between two translated versions of the heart quality of life (HeartQoL) questionnaire produced by the forward-backward and dual-panel methods. Methods: The forward-backward and dual-panel versions of HeartQoL were self-administered among 60 participants who met the inclusion criteria of being a native Bahasa Malaysia-speaking Malay, aged 18 and older, having an indexed diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease and being cognitively fit. The administration sequence of the two versions was randomized. Additionally, three sociolinguists, who were blinded to translation processes and survey findings, rated the translated versions against the source version on three aspects of semantic equivalence. Results: Textual content in both translated versions was considerably similar (n?=?9/14 items, ?64%). The overall results from weighted kappa, raw agreement, intraclass correlations, and Wilcoxon signed-rank as well as experts' ratings were confirmative of semantic equivalence between the forward-backward and dual-panel versions of the HeartQoL. However, some mixed findings were indicative of potential gaps in both translated versions against the source version. Conclusion: Both the forward-backward and dual-panel methods produced semantically equivalent versions of HeartQoL; but translation alone is insufficient to narrow the subtle gaps caused by differences in culture and linguistic style. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","coronary artery disease; female; human; Malaysia; male; middle aged; psychology; publication; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; Coronary Disease; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translations"
"Vitamin C - A wonder drug from nature's own pharmacopeia?",2019,"This review outlays the biological chemistry of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that explains its increasing therapeutic use in orthomolecular medicine. Even in mega doses that are often mostly and safely administered as intravenous infusions, the vitamin, as such or in its potent transportable form dehydroascorbic acid, does not affect healthy cells and targets only cancerous cells. The review proposes the need for clinicians in mainstream medicine to explore more intimately vitamin C's integrative use in treating many modern-day health problems, such as non-hormone dependent cancers, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and sepsis, based on a proper appreciation of the strengths and limitations of both RCTs (efficacy studies) and observational studies (effectiveness studies). Vitamin C is a first line antioxidant. Its known pro-oxidant effects in killing cancer cells, along with its ubiquitous roles as an enzyme cofactor, offer much potential to be tapped in cancer therapy, either alone or in combination with other therapies. An adequate intake of dietary and supplemental vitamin C (90-120mg/day), is seen as a pivotal need for both young and old to ward off a plethora of health problems. ? 2019 Akademi Sains Malaysia.",""
"Novel Peptides Inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3 Serine Protease and Virus Replication in Human Hepatic Cell Line",2019,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a Flavivirus associated with several neurological complications. Currently, there are no vaccines or cures available and an efficient antiviral treatment is urgently needed to combat ZIKV infection. Herein, we targeted ZIKV NS2B-NS3 serine protease with short peptides to inhibit ZIKV replication in human hepatic cell line (WRL-68). The short peptide inhibitors were designed using Hyperchem 8.0.10 software. Docking energy and binding configuration were calculated using HADDOCK webserver. ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease was produced as a recombinant single peptide in Escherichia coli and the protease activity was examined by measuring the cleavage of a fluorescent substrate in the presence of the peptides or aprotinin as a standard protease inhibitor. Computational analysis revealed that the short peptides, AYA2 and AYA9, exhibited lower docking energy to ZIKV protease than aprotinin. Both peptides also possessed lower half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), 30.9 and 22.1??M respectively, against ZIKV protease activity when compared to aprotinin (35.4??M). Interestingly, AYA2 and AYA9 exhibited minimal cytotoxic effects in WRL-68 cells and showed considerable inhibition against ZIKV replication in vitro at half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 40.73 ± 2.3??M and 34.65 ± 1.8??M respectively. Fusion of these two peptides to MAP30 peptide substantially reduced the IC50 of ZIKV protease inhibition to 1.1??M and inhibited ZIKV replication at EC50 of 0.5157 ± 0.03??M. In sum, we reported novel peptides that effectively inhibited ZIKV replication in vitro. This study represents a cost-effective strategy of developing peptide inhibitors by shortening the peptides and producing them in recombinant form. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","antivirus agent; aprotinin; AYA2 MAP30 AYA9 fusion peptide; AYA2 peptide; AYA9 peptide; nonstructural protein 2; nonstructural protein 3; NS2B NS3 serine protease; serine proteinase inhibitor; unclassified drug; Article; controlled study; EC50; human; human cell; IC50; molecular docking; nonhuman; protein purification; virostatic activity; virus replication; WRL 68 cell line; Zika virus"
"Protective effect of myricetin derivatives from syzygium malaccense against hydrogen peroxide-induced stress in ARPE-19 cells",2019,"Purpose: Oxidative stress is implicated in the etiology of diabetes and its debilitating complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). Various flavonoids have been reported to be useful in reducing DR progression. Myricetin derivatives (F2) isolated from leaf extract of Syzygium malaccense have the potential to serve as functional food as reported previously. The present study was performed with the aim of determining the antioxidant potential and protective effect of myricetin derivatives (F2) isolated from leaf extract of S. malaccense against glucose oxidase (GO)-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2) production that causes oxidative stress in ARPE-19 (RPE) cells. Methods: Antioxidant properties were assessed through various radical (DPPH, ABTS, and nitric oxide) scavenging assays and determination of total phenolic content and ferric reducing antioxidant power level. ARPE-19 cells were preincubated with samples before the addition of GO (to generate H2 O2). Cell viability, change in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), H2 O2 levels in cell culture supernatant, and gene expression were assessed. Results: F2 showed higher antioxidant levels than the extract when assessed for radical scavenging activities and ferric reducing antioxidant power. F2 protected the ARPE-19 cells against GO-H2 O2-induced oxidative stress by reducing the production of H2 O2 and intracellular reactive oxygen species. This was achieved by the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD2), as well as downregulation of nitric oxide producer (NOS2) at the transcriptional level. Conclusions: The results showed that myricetin derivatives from S. malaccense have the capacity to exert considerable exogenous antioxidant activities and stimulate endogenous antioxidant activities. Therefore, these derivatives have excellent potential to be developed as therapeutic agents for managing DR. ? 2019 Molecular Vision.","antioxidant; flavone derivative; glucose oxidase; hydrogen peroxide; inducible nitric oxide synthase; manganese superoxide dismutase; myricetin; myricetin derivative; myricitrin; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; Syzygium malaccense extract; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl; 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid; antioxidant; benzothiazole derivative; biphenyl derivative; flavonoid; glucose oxidase; hydrogen peroxide; inducible nitric oxide synthase; myricetin; myricitrin; NFE2L2 protein, human; nitric oxide; NOS2 protein, human; picric acid; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; sulfonic acid derivative; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; antioxidant activity; Article; controlled study; diabetic retinopathy; down regulation; ferric reducing antioxidant power assay; free radical scavenging assay; gene; genetic transcription; human; human cell; NFE2L2 gene; NOS2 gene; oxidative stress; priority journal; retina pigment cell; retinal pigment epithelium; SOD2 gene; agonists; antagonists and inhibitors; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; epithelium cell; gene expression regulation; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; oxidative stress; plant leaf; retinal pigment epithelium; Syzygium; Antioxidants; Benzothiazoles; Biphenyl Compounds; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Epithelial Cells; Flavonoids; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose Oxidase; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II; Oxidative Stress; Picrates; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Reactive Oxygen Species; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Sulfonic Acids; Superoxide Dismutase; Syzygium"
"Clinical prediction models for ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae colonization or infection: a systematic review",2019,"Background: β-Lactamase resistance among certain Gram-negative bacteria has been associated with increased mortality, length of hospitalization, and hospital costs. Aim: To identify and critically appraise existing clinical prediction models of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-EKP) infection or colonization. Methods: Electronic databases, reference lists, and citations were searched from inception to April 2018. Papers were included in any language describing the development or validation, or both, of models and scores to predict the risk of ESBL-EKP infection or colonization. Findings: In all, 1795 references were screened, of which four articles were included in the review. The included studies were carried out in different geographical locations with differing study designs, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most if not all studies lacked external validation and blinding of reviewers during the evaluation of the predictor variables and outcome. All studies excluded missing data and most studies did not report the number of patients excluded due to missing data. Fifteen predictors of infection or colonization with ESBL-EKP were identified. Commonly included predictors were previous antibiotic use, previous hospitalization, transfer from another healthcare facility, and previous procedures (urinary catheterization and invasive procedures). Conclusion: Due to limitations and variations in the study design, clinicians would have to take these differences into consideration when deciding on how to use these models in clinical practice. Due to lack of external validation, the generalizability of these models remains a question. Therefore, further external validation in local settings is needed to confirm the usefulness of these models in supporting decision-making. ? 2019 The Healthcare Infection Society","antibiotic therapy; bacterial colonization; bacterium culture; bladder catheterization; clinical assessment; Enterobacteriaceae infection; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae; hospital infection; hospitalization; human; invasive procedure; nonhuman; patient transport; prediction; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; aged; decision support system; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; enzymology; female; heterozygote; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; middle aged; beta lactamase; Aged; beta-Lactamases; Carrier State; Decision Support Techniques; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors"
"Factors influencing childhood anaemia in Bangladesh: A two level logistic regression analysis",2019,"Background: Anemia is not only a major public health problem among children in developing countries, it is also an important predictor for their future growth and development. The objective of this study was to identify possible factors associated with anemia among pre-school children in Bangladesh after removing a cluster effect of the population, and to determine the prevalence of this condition. Methods: Data for this study was extracted from the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS-2011). In this survey, data was collected using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling approach. The chi-square test and a two-level logistic regression model were used for further analysis. Results: Data from 2231 children aged 6-59 months were included for analysis. The prevalence of child anemia was noted to be 52.10%. Among these anemic children, 48.40% where from urban environment and 53.90% were from rural areas. The prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anemia among children was 57.10, 41.40 and 1.50% respectively. The two-level logistic regression model revealed that the following factors were associated with childhood anemia: children of anemic mothers (p < 0.01), undernourished children (p < 0.05), younger children (age < 2 years) (p < 0.01) and children from poor family (p < 0.05). Lastly, anemia was more common among children living in Barisal and Rangpur divisions compared to those from Dhaka division (p < 0.01), and among non-Muslims than Muslim (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study showed that prevalence of anemia among pre-school children in Bangladesh was very high (52.10%). We noted that young children of anemic mothers, from poor families, and being undernourished were at higher risk of developing anemia. Since most of these risk factors were related to socioeconomic conditions, they were potentially modifiable. Therefore, our findings may be useful for the health authorities to identify children at risk for remedial action and to plan for preventive measures. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; age distribution; anemia; Article; Bangladesh; chi square test; child; controlled study; data extraction; demography; disease severity; female; geographic distribution; health survey; human; infant; information processing; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; Muslim; parental behavior; population research; preschool child; prevalence; risk factor; rural area; sampling; socioeconomics; urban area"
"Bioanalysis of tetrahydrobiopterin with liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric and its application for pharmacokinetics in apolipoprotein E knockout mice",2019,"Decreased level of endogenous tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) has been associated with endothelial dysfunction, which is involved in vascular diseases. Despite its chemical instability due to auto-oxidation, exogenous supplementation of BH4 can reverse this dysfunction. Thus, a sensitive and simple liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) method was developed and validated for the measurement of BH4 in plasma after its oral or intravenous administration in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice. Human plasma samples were prepared from protein precipitation, and chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with methanol-water mobile phases and a run time of 7 minutes with ion detection at m/z 242. The limit of quantitation was 10 ng/mL and inaccuracy and imprecision were ?15%. In the presence of antioxidant dithioerythritol, recovery of BH4 was 80% and stable for 24 h post sample collection. Following oral or intravenous administration of BH4 in ApoE mice, the maximum concentrations detected were 102 and 483 ng/mL, respectively. Area under the curve values for oral BH4 were three time lower than those of intravenous BH4. The half-life of BH4 was 1.6 h, and it demonstrated low oral bioavailability (15%). Results of this study provide the basis for further studies of future clinical applications of BH4. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biochemistry; Coenzymes; Lipoproteins; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Pharmacokinetics; Precipitation (chemical); ApoE mice; Apolipoprotein E (apoE); Chromatographic separations; Endothelial dysfunction; Intravenous administration; LC-MS; Method development; Tetrahydrobiopterin; Mammals; apolipoprotein E; dithioerythritol; tetrahydrobiopterin; animal experiment; area under the curve; Article; chromatography; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; elimination rate constant; environmental temperature; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; maximum concentration; mouse; nonhuman; pharmacokinetic parameters; precipitation; time to maximum plasma concentration"
"Tocotrienols Modulate Breast Cancer Secretomes and Affect Cancer-Signaling Pathways in MDA-MB-231 Cells: A Label-Free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis",2019,"Tocotrienols (T3), a family of vitamin E, are reported to possess potent anti-cancer effects but the molecular mechanisms behind these effects still remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate how T3 exert anti-cancer effects on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The MDA-MB-231 cells were chosen for this study as they are triple-negative and highly metastatic cells, which form aggressive tumors in experimental models. The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with varying concentrations (0–20 ?g?mL?1) of gamma (γ) or delta (δ) T3 and the secretome profiles of these cells treated with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of γT3 (5.8 ?g?mL?1) or δT3 (4.0 ?g?mL?1) were determined using label-free quantitative proteomic strategy. A total of 103, 174 and 141 proteins were identified with ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) score of more than 200 and above 25% sequence coverage in the untreated control and T3-treated cell culture supernatant respectively. A total of 18 proteins were dysregulated between untreated control and T3 (δT3 or γT3) treated conditions. The results showed that T3 treatment downregulated the exogenous Cathepsin D and Serpine1 proteins but upregulated Profilin-1 protein, which play a key role in breast cancer in the MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings strongly suggest that T3 may induce differential expression of secreted proteins involved in the cytoskeletal regulation of RHO GTPase signaling pathway. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","actin; actin cytoplasmic 1; alpha tocotrienol; beta 2 microglobulin; cathepsin D; cystatin C; delta tocotrienol; epididymal secretory protein; epididymal secretory protein e1; galectin 3; gamma tocotrienol; metalloproteinase inhibitor; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; pote ankyrin domain family member f; pote ankyrin domain family member j; potem protein; profilin 1; protein; putative beta actin like protein 3; Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein; somatomedin binding protein 7; thrombospondin 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; Article; breast cancer; cell culture; cell viability; concentration response; down regulation; drug effect; human; human cell; IC50; MDA-MB-231 cell line; protein analysis; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein secretion; proteomics; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; upregulation"
"Modelling the impact of migration on HIV persistency in Ghana",2019,"Migrants may be exposed to health risks before, during and after leaving their countries of origin. Unfortunately, knowledge about the health status of migrants is often limited because they are often excluded from surveys. This paper extends the susceptible-exposed-infective-removed model to handle the assumption of homogeneous mixing, the incorporation of migration and the induced death rates of the disease in modelling the spread of HIV/AIDS. These extensions demonstrate that the impact of migration on HIV persistency is critical when attempting to predict where and how fast the disease will propagate. The spectral analysis of a time series was used to determine the frequency at which the disease is spread and its equilibrium levels. The results indicate that with the persistent flow of migration into a country, the disease status changes from epidemic to endemic. If the direct flow of migration into the population is restricted, the persistent spread of the disease can be minimised. ? 2019 International Academic Press.",""
"Economic and Social Well-Being of Asian Labour Migrants: A Literature Review",2019,"In this research article, we discussed the economic and social well-being of the Asian labour migrants in Asia. We are arguing that this issue is rarely addressed in the literature. The major characteristics of the migrant workers in Asian countries are seriously exploited, marginalized, and infrequently looked from human rights perspective. A Qualitative Interpretative Meta-Synthesis was conducted to analyze the contextual socio-economic factors that characterized intra-Asian migrant workers’ economic and social well-being. It is perceived that in most of the recruiting countries, there are lacks of government commitments to the international protocols, conventions and laws that they ratified towards safeguarding migrant workers’ economic and social well-being. The review results showed that despite some opportunities, the migrant workers had lack of job security, poor salary, long working hours, low access to the public services, poor health, poor living and working conditions, lack of legal rights, and physical and mental threats towards their economic and social well-being. The finding would be important guideline to the governments, policy makers, legal rights practitioners, and human rights organizations. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Asian immigrant; developing world; human rights; literature review; migrant worker; qualitative analysis; socioeconomic status; Asia"
"Malaysian females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia: Surgical outcomes and attitudes",2019,"Background: Girls born with congenital adrenal hyperplasia have virilized external genitalia. There is considerable debate regarding both the outcomes of feminizing genitoplasty and timing of the surgery in this population. Objective: To investigate outcomes of females 46,XX individuals with CAH in Malaysia, the surgical outcomes of feminizing genitoplasty (FG) and their attitudes toward surgery. Study Design: This is a cross-sectional study involving the two main tertiary centers in Malaysia. All 46,XX patients with CAH and raised female, who had undergone FG were identified and invited to participate. Data on socio-demographic, medical profiles, and attitudes toward surgery were collected. A standardized evaluation of the external genitalia was undertaken including the anatomic and cosmetic evaluation by independent gynecologists. Results: Of 61 individuals identified, 59 participated-consisting of children (n = 12), adolescents (n = 29) and adults (n = 18). All but one had classical CAH (98.3%) and had undergone FG (n = 55, 93.2%) with surgery mostly undertaken by pediatric surgeons trained in DSD work (n = 44, 74.6%). Complications overall were low (20.3%), with repeat surgery rate of 9.1%. External genital examination was performed in 38 participants. Overall 36.8% had absent clitoral glands and 39.5% had a persistent urogenital sinus and in 10.5%, no vaginal orifices were seen. Poor cosmetic outcomes were present in 42.1% with 55.3% recommended for further assessment under general anesthetic. Almost half participants did not venture an opinion on FG, those who did varied from having a positive attitude toward it (18 participants) to 3 opining that it should not be done, or avoided or delayed. From the participants, 35.5% preferred FG to be done early in life compared to 44.0% of the parents. Conclusions: The reoperation rates of the feminizing genitoplasty surgeries were low however due to the anatomic and cosmetic outcomes, reassessment of the external genitalia of these CAH patients may be required once they consider becoming sexually active as they may require further treatment. Many factors such as cultural sensitivities and access to medical treatment and late diagnoses have an impact on attitudes toward FG. ? 2019 Zainuddin, Grover, Soon, Nur Azurah, Mahdy, Wu, Rasat, Harun, Chia and Shamsuddin.","anesthetic agent; cosmetic; adolescent; adult; Article; child; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; cross-sectional study; demography; excessive remaining labial skin; female; feminizing genitoplasty; general anesthesia; gynecologist; hematoma; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; Malaysian; patient attitude; pediatric surgeon; postoperative complication; scar formation; school child; small haematoma; urinary tract disease; urogenital sinus; urologic surgery; vaginal stenosis"

The use of nanotechnology in medicine and, more specifically, drug delivery is set to spread even more rapidly than it has over the past two decades. Currently, many nanoparticles (NPs) are under investigation for drug delivery including those for cancer therapy. Targeted nanomaterials bind selectively to cancer cells and greatly affect them with only a minor effect on healthy cells. Gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), specifically, have been identified as significant candidates for new cancer therapeutic modalities because of their biocompatibility, easy functionalization and fabrication, optical tunable characteristics, and chemophysical stability. In the last decade, there has been significant research on Au-NPs and their biomedical applications. Functionalized Au-NPs represent highly attractive and promising candidates for drug delivery, owing to their unique dimensions, tunable surface functionalities, and controllable drug release. Further, iron oxide NPs due to their “superparamagnetic” properties have been studied and have demonstrated successful employment in numerous applications. In targeted drug delivery systems, drug-loaded iron oxide NPs can accumulate at the tumor site with the aid of an external magnetic field. This can lead to incremental effectiveness in drug release to the tumor site and vanquish cancer cells without harming healthy cells. In order for the application of iron oxide NPs in the human body to be realized, they should be biodegradable and biocompatible to minimize toxicity. This review illustrates recent advances in the field drug and small molecule delivery such as fluorouracil, folic acid, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and daunorubicin, specifically when using gold and iron oxide NPs as carriers of anticancer therapeutic agents. ? 2019 Jahangirian et al.","daunorubicin; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; folic acid; gold nanoparticle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging agent; paclitaxel; ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide; antineoplastic agent; gold; iron; metal nanoparticle; conjugation; drug delivery system; drug release; drug structure; drug targeting; human; nonhuman; Review; surface plasmon resonance; animal; chemistry; particle size; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Delivery Systems; Gold; Humans; Iron; Metal Nanoparticles; Particle Size"
"Improving awareness, knowledge, and attitude among Malaysian parents of children with epilepsy using an Interactive Animated Epilepsy Education Programme (IAEEP)",2019,"Background: An information technology (IT)-based epilepsy educational program, the Interactive Animated Epilepsy Education Programme (IAEEP), can potentially help improve awareness, knowledge, and attitude (AKA) of parents of children with epilepsy (CWE) enabling CWE to lead a normal life. Our study aimed to assess the following: i) baseline level of epilepsy AKA of Malaysian parents of CWE and explore potential characteristics associated with low levels of AKA; ii) effectiveness of the IAEEP in improving parental AKA, and whether these effects remained stable over time; and iii) effects of the IAEEP on parental mental state and perception of their child's quality of life. Methods: This prospective study includes parents of CWE aged 8–18 years old with no comorbidities. Epilepsy education was delivered using the IAEEP. Parents completed an AKA questionnaire before (time point 1 [TP1]), immediately after (TP2), and 4–6 months (TP3) after the provision of IAEEP. Parent proxy report of Health-Related Quality of Life Measurement for Children with Epilepsy (CHEQOL)-25 questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21 questionnaire was completed at TP1 and TP3. Results: A total of 78 parents participated in the study. At baseline (TP1), parental responses were rated as “moderate” for awareness domain, “high” for knowledge domain, “very positive” for attitude domain, and “good” for total AKA score domain. No epilepsy or parental characteristics were associated with the low baseline parental AKA levels. After IAEEP intervention, there was a significant increase in all AKA subdomain scores. Post-IAEEP, the AKA of parents were rated as “very high” for awareness domain, “very high” for knowledge domain, “very positive” for attitude domain, and “excellent” for total AKA domain at both TP2 and TP3. Parent proxy CHEQOL-25 report showed significant increments in interpersonal/social and secrecy scale scores between TP1 and TP3. There were no significant differences in the DASS-21 scores between TP1 and TP3. Conclusion: The IAEEP is an effective epilepsy educational tool to increase the levels of AKA among parents of CWE. Following the use of the IAEEP, parents of CWE also reported an improvement of their child's quality of life in the interpersonal/social and epilepsy secrecy CHEQOL-25 domains. There was no impact on parental mental health following exposure to the IAEEP. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; awareness; benign childhood epilepsy; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; education program; female; Health Related Quality of Life Measurement for Children with Epilepsy; human; human experiment; human relation; knowledge; Malaysian; male; normal human; parental attitude; prospective study; quality of life; quality of life assessment; questionnaire; simulation training; social behavior"
"Multi-platform discovery of haplotype-resolved structural variation in human genomes",2019,"The incomplete identification of structural variants (SVs) from whole-genome sequencing data limits studies of human genetic diversity and disease association. Here, we apply a suite of long-read, short-read, strand-specific sequencing technologies, optical mapping, and variant discovery algorithms to comprehensively analyze three trios to define the full spectrum of human genetic variation in a haplotype-resolved manner. We identify 818,054 indel variants (<50 bp) and 27,622 SVs (?50 bp) per genome. We also discover 156 inversions per genome and 58 of the inversions intersect with the critical regions of recurrent microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Taken together, our SV callsets represent a three to sevenfold increase in SV detection compared to most standard high-throughput sequencing studies, including those from the 1000 Genomes Project. The methods and the dataset presented serve as a gold standard for the scientific community allowing us to make recommendations for maximizing structural variation sensitivity for future genome sequencing studies. ? 2019, The Author(s).","cell; genetic variation; genome; genomics; identification method; ultrastructure; algorithm; Article; DNA sequence; gene expression; gene frequency; genetic variability; genotype; haplotype; human; human genome; next generation sequencing; principal component analysis; quality control; single nucleotide polymorphism; chromosomal mapping; genetic database; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; haplotype; high throughput sequencing; indel mutation; procedures; whole genome sequencing; Algorithms; Chromosome Mapping; Databases, Genetic; Genome, Human; Genomic Structural Variation; Genomics; Haplotypes; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; INDEL Mutation; Whole Genome Sequencing"
"Organisational climate and employee health outcomes: A systematic review",2019,"Organisational climate, particularly safety climate, has been documented as a crucial element in promoting occupational health and safety. However, most previous studies have focused more on safety issues (e.g., injuries and accidents) rather than health outcomes (e.g., illnesses, stress, etc). A comprehensive review is also lacking in relation to understanding the organisational climate–health relationship between different levels of analysis, different data sources and different analytical procedures. We conducted a systematic review to investigate previous scholarly contributions to organisational climate and health. The reviewed articles were obtained from three databases: ISI Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost Academic Premier Search. After reading the abstracts and full texts, we included 56 articles in our review. We found that the influence of organisational climate on employee health has been supported in prior research. However, hypotheses at the individual level are more frequently supported than those at the organisational level. Even though most studies analysed self-reported data and, thus, possibly suffered from common method bias, half of the studies were explicitly or implicitly trying to reduce the bias. Studies with and without remedies for reducing common method bias yielded similar results, suggesting that common method bias has little impact on organisational climate research. Overall, almost no differences were found among the different organisational climate constructs. The current review includes several recommendations for future research. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Industrial hygiene; Personnel; Analytical procedure; Common method bias; Individual levels; Levels of analysis; Occupational health and safety; Organisational climates; Organisational level; Systematic Review; Health; employee attitude; geographic distribution; human; methodology; occupational health; occupational safety; organization and management; organizational climate; organizational policy; priority journal; psychological aspect; Review; self report; systematic review; workplace"
"Large scale multifactorial likelihood quantitative analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants: An ENIGMA resource to support clinical variant classification",2019,"The multifactorial likelihood analysis method has demonstrated utility for quantitative assessment of variant pathogenicity for multiple cancer syndrome genes. Independent data types currently incorporated in the model for assessing BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants include clinically calibrated prior probability of pathogenicity based on variant location and bioinformatic prediction of variant effect, co-segregation, family cancer history profile, co-occurrence with a pathogenic variant in the same gene, breast tumor pathology, and case-control information. Research and clinical data for multifactorial likelihood analysis were collated for 1,395 BRCA1/2 predominantly intronic and missense variants, enabling classification based on posterior probability of pathogenicity for 734 variants: 447 variants were classified as (likely) benign, and 94 as (likely) pathogenic; and 248 classifications were new or considerably altered relative to ClinVar submissions. Classifications were compared with information not yet included in the likelihood model, and evidence strengths aligned to those recommended for ACMG/AMP classification codes. Altered mRNA splicing or function relative to known nonpathogenic variant controls were moderately to strongly predictive of variant pathogenicity. Variant absence in population datasets provided supporting evidence for variant pathogenicity. These findings have direct relevance for BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant evaluation, and justify the need for gene-specific calibration of evidence types used for variant classification. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; Article; breast tumor; clinical classification; family history; genetic analysis; genetic variability; human; pathogenicity; population genetics; priority journal; probability; quantitative analysis; RNA splicing"
"The Effect of 20-Minute Mindful Breathing on the Rapid Reduction of Dyspnea at Rest in Patients With Lung Diseases: A Randomized Controlled Trial",2019,"Context: Dyspnea is a common and distressing symptom in respiratory diseases. Despite advances in the treatment of various lung diseases, the treatment modalities for dyspnea remain limited. Objectives: This study aims to examine the effect of 20-minute mindful breathing on the rapid reduction of dyspnea at rest in patients with lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. Methods: We conducted a parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial of standard care plus 20-minute mindful breathing vs. standard care alone for patients with moderate to severe dyspnea due to lung disease, named previously, at the respiratory unit of University Malaya Medical Centre in Malaysia, from August 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. Results: Sixty-three participants were randomly assigned to standard care plus a 20-minute mindful breathing session (n = 32) or standard care alone (n = 31), with no difference in their demographic and clinical characteristics. There was statistically significant reduction in dyspnea in the mindful breathing group compared with the control group at minute 5 (U = 233.5, n 1 = 32, n 2 = 31, mean rank 1 = 23.28, mean rank 2 = 37.72, z = ?3.574, P &lt; 0.001) and minute 20 (U = 232.0, n 1 = 32, n 2 = 31, mean rank 1 = 23.00, mean rank 2 = 36.77, z = ?3.285, P = 0.001).

"Methodological issues in a prospective study on plasma concentrations of persistent organic pollutants and pancreatic cancer risk within the EPIC cohort",2019,"Background: The use of biomarkers of environmental exposure to explore new risk factors for pancreatic cancer presents clinical, logistic, and methodological challenges that are also relevant in research on other complex diseases. Objectives: First, to summarize the main design features of a prospective case-control study –nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort– on plasma concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and pancreatic cancer risk. And second, to assess the main methodological challenges posed by associations among characteristics and habits of study participants, fasting status, time from blood draw to cancer diagnosis, disease progression bias, basis of cancer diagnosis, and plasma concentrations of lipids and POPs. Results from etiologic analyses on POPs and pancreatic cancer risk, and other analyses, will be reported in future articles. Methods: Study subjects were 1533 participants (513 cases and 1020 controls matched by study centre, sex, age at blood collection, date and time of blood collection, and fasting status) enrolled between 1992 and 2000. Plasma concentrations of 22 POPs were measured by gas chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). To estimate the magnitude of the associations we calculated multivariate-adjusted odds ratios by unconditional logistic regression, and adjusted geometric means by General Linear Regression Models. Results: There were differences among countries in subjects’ characteristics (as age, gender, smoking, lipid and POP concentrations), and in study characteristics (as time from blood collection to index date, year of last follow-up, length of follow-up, basis of cancer diagnosis, and fasting status). Adjusting for centre and time of blood collection, no factors were significantly associated with fasting status. Plasma concentrations of lipids were related to age, body mass index, fasting, country, and smoking. We detected and quantified 16 of the 22 POPs in more than 90% of individuals. All 22 POPs were detected in some participants, and the smallest number of POPs detected in one person was 15 (median, 19) with few differences by country. The highest concentrations were found for p,p’-DDE, PCBs 153 and 180 (median concentration: 3371, 1023, and 810 pg/mL, respectively). We assessed the possible occurrence of disease progression bias (DPB) in eight situations defined by lipid and POP measurements, on one hand, and by four factors: interval from blood draw to index date, tumour subsite, tumour stage, and grade of differentiation, on the other. In seven of the eight situations results supported the absence of DPB. Conclusions: The coexistence of differences across study centres in some design features and participant characteristics is of relevance to other multicentre studies. Relationships among subjects’ characteristics and among such characteristics and design features may play important roles in the forthcoming analyses on the association between plasma concentrations of POPs and pancreatic cancer risk. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; alpha hexachlorocyclohexane; chlorphenotane; cholesterol; dioxin; hexachlorobenzene; lindane; lipid; nonachlor; organochlorine pesticide; oxychlordane; pentachlorobenzene; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; triacylglycerol; polychlorinated biphenyl; biomarker; body mass; cancer; cohort analysis; detection method; epidemiology; health risk; lipid; methodology; numerical method; persistent organic pollutant; plasma; risk factor; tumor; adult; age; aged; Article; blood level; body mass; cancer grading; cancer risk; cancer staging; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; fasting; female; follow up; gas chromatography; human; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; methodology; multicenter study; pancreas cancer; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; prospective study; smoking; triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; environmental exposure; mass fragmentography; pancreas tumor; plasma; pollutant; tandem mass spectrometry; Case-Control Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Plasma; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Prospective Studies; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"
"Consensus statement from the International Consensus Meeting on the Role of Decompressive Craniectomy in the Management of Traumatic Brain Injury: Consensus statement",2019,"Background: Two randomised trials assessing the effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy (DC) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) were published in recent years: DECRA in 2011 and RESCUEicp in 2016. As the results have generated debate amongst clinicians and researchers working in the field of TBI worldwide, it was felt necessary to provide general guidance on the use of DC following TBI and identify areas of ongoing uncertainty via a consensus-based approach. Methods: The International Consensus Meeting on the Role of Decompressive Craniectomy in the Management of Traumatic Brain Injury took place in Cambridge, UK, on the 28th and 29th September 2017. The meeting was jointly organised by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS), AO/Global Neuro and the NIHR Global Health Research Group on Neurotrauma. Discussions and voting were organised around six pre-specified themes: (1) primary DC for mass lesions, (2) secondary DC for intracranial hypertension, (3) peri-operative care, (4) surgical technique, (5) cranial reconstruction and (6) DC in low- and middle-income countries. Results: The invited participants discussed existing published evidence and proposed consensus statements. Statements required an agreement threshold of more than 70% by blinded voting for approval. Conclusions: In this manuscript, we present the final consensus-based recommendations. We have also identified areas of uncertainty, where further research is required, including the role of primary DC, the role of hinge craniotomy and the optimal timing and material for skull reconstruction. ? 2019, The Author(s).","consensus; cranioplasty; decompressive craniectomy; global health; human; intracranial hypertension; low income country; middle income country; neurosurgeon; perioperative period; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; surgical technique; traumatic brain injury; uncertainty; United Kingdom"
"Investigation into the Molecular Mechanisms underlying the Anti-proliferative and Anti-tumorigenesis activities of Diosmetin against HCT-116 Human Colorectal Cancer",2019,"Diosmetin (Dis) is a bioflavonoid with cytotoxicity properties against variety of cancer cells including hepatocarcinoma, breast and colorectal (CRC) cancer. The exact mechanism by which Dis acts against CRC however, still remains unclear, hence in this study, we investigated the possible molecular mechanisms of Dis in CRC cell line, HCT-116. Here, we monitored the viability of HCT-116 cells in the presence of Dis and investigated the underlying mechanism of Dis against HCT-116 cells at the gene and protein levels using NanoString and proteome profiler array technologies. Findings demonstrated that Dis exhibits greater cytotoxic effects towards HCT-116 CRC cells (IC50 = 3.58 ± 0.58 ?g/ml) as compared to the normal colon CCD-841 cells (IC50 = 51.95 ± 0.11 ?g/ml). Arrests of the cells in G2/M phase confirms the occurrence of mitotic disruption via Dis. Activation of apoptosis factors such as Fas and Bax at the gene and protein levels along with the release of Cytochrome C from mitochondria and cleavage of Caspase cascades indicate the presence of turbulence as a result of apoptosis induction in Dis-treated cells. Moreover, NF-?B translocation was inhibited in Dis-treated cells. Our results indicate that Dis can target HCT-116 cells through the mitotic disruption and apoptosis induction. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

This study aimed to investigate the association between CKD-associated pruritus and the quality of life in patients undergoing hemodialysis in Pakistan. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out from July 2016 to April 2017 in 2 tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan. Patients aged 18 years and above of both genders, undergoing hemodialysis, understood the Urdu language, and were willing to participate; were included. Of 354 recruited patients with a response rate of 100%, majority (66.1%) of the patients were males. The median (intra-quartile range [IQR]) age of patients was 42.0 [34.0-50.0] years. The prevalence of pruritus was 74%. The median [IQR] score for pruritus was 10.0 (out of possible 25) [8.0-12.0]. Multivariate linear regression revealed a statistically significant association between CKD-associated pruritus with age of patients (β=0.031; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.002-0.061; P=.038), duration of CKD (β=-0.013; 95% CI=-0.023 - 0.003; P=.014) and quality of life (β= -0.949; 95% CI=-1.450; -0.449). The median [IQR] score for health-related quality of life was 52.00 [43.00-58.00].Prevalence of CKD-associated pruritus was reported to be 74% and it negatively affected the patient's quality of life.

"Functional analysis and fine mapping of the 9p22.2 ovarian cancer susceptibility locus",2019,"Genome-wide association studies have identified 40 ovarian cancer risk loci. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive. In this study, we conducted a two-pronged approach to identify candidate causal SNPs and assess underlying biological mechanisms at chromosome 9p22.2, the first and most statistically significant associated locus for ovarian cancer susceptibility. Three transcriptional regulatory elements with allele-specific effects and a scaffold/matrix attachment region were characterized and, through physical DNA interactions, BNC2 was established as the most likely target gene. We determined the consensus binding sequence for BNC2 in vitro, verified its enrichment in BNC2 ChIP-seq regions, and validated a set of its downstream target genes. Fine-mapping by dense regional genotyping in over 15,000 ovarian cancer cases and 30,000 controls identified SNPs in the scaffold/matrix attachment region as among the most likely causal variants. This study reveals a comprehensive regulatory landscape at 9p22.2 and proposes a likely mechanism of susceptibility to ovarian cancer. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","basonuclin; basonuclin 2; unclassified drug; BNC2 protein, human; cell cycle protein; CNTLN protein, human; DNA; DNA binding protein; allele; Article; binding affinity; BNC2 gene; cancer susceptibility; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromosome 9p; chromosome 9p22 2; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene; gene function; gene identification; gene locus; gene mapping; genome-wide association study; genotype; human; human cell; in vitro study; matrix attachment region; ovary cancer; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; risk reduction; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; chromosomal mapping; chromosome 9; cystadenocarcinoma; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic predisposition; genetics; HEK293 cell line; nucleotide sequence; ovary tumor; tumor cell line; Base Sequence; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous; DNA, Neoplasm; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Ovarian Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"
"In-vivo Barretts esophagus digital pathology stage classification through feature enhancement of confocal laser endomicroscopy",2019,"Barretts esophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition that has an increased risk to turn into esophageal adenocarcinoma. Classification and staging of the different changes (BE in particular) in the esophageal mucosa are challenging since they have a very similar appearance. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is one of the newest endoscopy tools that is commonly used to identify the pathology type of the suspected area of the esophageal mucosa. However, it requires a well-trained physician to classify the image obtained from CLE. An automatic stage classification of esophageal mucosa is presented. The proposed model enhances the internal features of CLE images using an image filter that combines fractional integration with differentiation. Various features are then extracted on a multiscale level, to classify the mucosal tissue into one of its four types: normal squamous (NS), gastric metaplasia (GM), intestinal metaplasia (IM or BE), and neoplasia. These sets of features are used to train two conventional classifiers: support vector machine (SVM) and random forest. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of 96 patients with 557 images of different histopathology types. The SVM classifier achieved the best performance with 96.05 accuracy based on a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. Additionally, the dataset was divided into 60 training and 40 testing; the model achieved an accuracy of 93.72 for the testing data using the SVM. The presented model showed superior performance when compared with four state-of-the-art methods. Accurate classification is essential for the intestinal metaplasia grade, which most likely develops into esophageal cancer. Not only does our method come to the aid of physicians for more accurate diagnosis by acting as a second opinion, but it also acts as a training method for junior physicians who need practice in using CLE. Consequently, this work contributes to an automatic classification that facilitates early intervention and decreases samples of required biopsy. ? 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Decision trees; Diagnosis; Pathology; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Automatic classification; Barrets esophagus; Confocal laser endomicroscopy; Conventional classifier; Digital pathologies; Fractional differentiation and integrations; Fractional integration; State-of-the-art methods; Image enhancement; Article; Barrett esophagus; cancer diagnosis; cancer staging; clinical feature; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; esophagus cancer; esophagus mucosa; histopathology; human; human tissue; in vivo study; intestine metaplasia; major clinical study; random forest; support vector machine"
"Zerumbone induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells by targeting αvβ3 integrin upon co-administration with TP5-iRGD Peptide",2019,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are highly promising tools to deliver therapeutic molecules into tumours. αVβ3 integrins are cell–matrix adhesion receptors, and are considered as an attractive target for anticancer therapies owing to their roles in the process of metastasis and angiogenesis. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of co-administration of zerumbone (ZER) and ZERencapsulated in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin with TP5-iRGD peptide towards cell cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and proliferation of normal and cancerous breast cells utilizing in vitro assays, as well as to study the molecular docking of ZER in complex with TP5-iRGD peptide. Cell viability assay findings indicated that ZER and ZERencapsulated in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (ZER-HPβCD) inhibited the growth of estrogen receptor positivebreast cancer cells (ER+ MCF-7) at 72 h treatment with an inhibitory concentration (IC)50 of 7.51 ± 0.2 and 5.08 ± 0.2 ?g/mL, respectively, and inhibited the growth of triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with an IC50 of 14.96 ± 1.52 ?g/mL and 12.18 ± 0.7 ?g/mL, respectively. On the other hand, TP5-iRGD peptide showed no significant cytotoxicity on both cancer and normal cells. Interestingly, co-administration of TP5-iRGD peptide in MCF-7 cells reduced the IC50 of ZER from 7.51 ± 0.2 ?g/mL to 3.13 ± 0.7 ?g/mL and reduced the IC50 of ZER-HPβCD from 5.08 ± 0.2 ?g/mL to 0.49 ± 0.004 ?g/mL, indicating that the co-administration enhances the potency and increases the efficacy of ZER and ZER-HPβCD compounds. Acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI) staining under fluorescence microscopy showed evidence of early apoptosis after 72 h from the co-administration of ZER or ZER-HPβCD with TP5-iRGD peptide in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The findings of the computational modelling experiment provide novel insights into the ZER interaction with integrin αvβ3 in the presence of TP5-iRGD, and this could explain why ZER has better antitumor activities when co-administered with TP5-iRGD peptide. ? 2019 by the authors","antineoplastic agent; N-end cysteine peptide tumor-homing peptide; oligopeptide; sesquiterpene; vitronectin receptor; zerumbone; apoptosis; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; conformation; dose response; drug effect; female; human; metabolism; molecular model; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; Integrin alphaVbeta3; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Oligopeptides; Sesquiterpenes"
"Prevention of oral carcinogenesis in rats by Dracaena cinnabari resin extracts",2019,"Objectives: In vivo study was performed to determine the chemopreventive efficacy of the DC resin methanol extract on a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) oral cancer animal model. Materials and methods: This study involves administration of 4NQO solution for 8?weeks alone (cancer induction) or with Dracaena cinnabari (DC) extract at 100, 500, and 1000?mg/kg. DC extract administration started 1?week before exposure until 1?week after the carcinogen exposure was stopped. All rats were sacrificed after 22?weeks, and histological analysis was performed to assess any incidence of pathological changes. Immunohistochemical expressions of selected tumor marker antibodies were analyzed using an image analyzer computer system, and the expression of selected genes involved in apoptosis and proliferative mechanism related to oral cancer were evaluated using RT 2 -PCR. Results: The incidence of OSCC decreased with the administration of DC extract at 100, 500, and 1000?mg/kg compared to the induced cancer group. The developed tumor was also observed to be smaller when compared to the induced cancer group. The DC 1000?mg/kg group inhibits the expression of Cyclin D1, Ki-67, Bcl-2, and p53 proteins. It was observed that DC 1000?mg/kg induced apoptosis by upregulation of Bax and Casp3 genes and downregulation of Tp53, Bcl-2, Cox-2, Cyclin D1, and EGFR genes when compared to the induced cancer group. Conclusions: The data indicated that systemic administration of the DC resin methanol extract has anticarcinogenic potency on oral carcinogenesis. Clinical relevance: Chemoprevention with DC resin methanol extract may significantly reduce morbidity and possibly mortality from OSCC. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide; plant extract; animal; carcinogenesis; chemistry; Dracaena; female; male; mouth tumor; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; 4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Dracaena; Female; Male; Mouth Neoplasms; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley"
"A qualitative study on parents’ reasons and recommendations for childhood vaccination refusal in Malaysia",2020,"Background: Vaccine-related diseases are increasing in developing countries. This study aimed to explore parents’ reasons for refusal of childhood vaccinations in Malaysia and their recommendations on addressing their concerns. Methods: A qualitative study design involving individual both face-to-face and online in-depth interview was used. The topic guide was developed from the Health Belief Model theoretical framework. Seven face-to-face and seven online interviews were conducted with parents in the Klang Valley (an urban area) who had refused childhood vaccination. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked. Thematic approach was used to analyze the data. Data was collected until data saturation was reached. Results: Findings were summarized into two main categories: Personal Health Beliefs and Vaccine Related Concerns. Six personal health beliefs were identified: lack of confidence in modern medicine and health care personnel, pharmaceutical conspiracy to sell medicines, preference to a natural approach to health, personal instincts, religious beliefs and having a partner with similar beliefs. Four main vaccine-related concerns were identified: negative effects and content concerns, doubts of necessity and lack of information and knowledge regarding vaccines. Parents recommended that more empathy from healthcare professionals and evidence on safety and content purity would help them reconsider vaccination. Conclusion: Parents had multiple reasons for refusing childhood vaccinations but felt that communication and empathy from healthcare professionals was lacking. Besides individual consultations with parents, addressing these concerns at multiple levels in the health care system and society may help to increase the uptake of childhood vaccinations in the future. ? 2020 The Authors","adult; Article; child; comprehension; conceptual framework; empathy; female; health belief; Health Belief Model; health care personnel; human; interview; knowledge; Malaysia; male; parental attitude; patient safety; priority journal; qualitative research; religion; urban area; vaccination; vaccination refusal"
"Physical activity and health-related quality of life among low-income adults in metropolitan kuala lumpur",2019,"Background: The aim of this research is to assess the level of physical activity (PA) in relation to different socio-economic factors and to examine the effect of the recommended level of PA on the domains of quality of life (QoL) among residents of low-income housing in the metropolitan area of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that included 680 respondents from community housing projects. Reported PA was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) short form version 2. The SF-12v2 was administered to assess the health-related QoL (HRQoL) among the study population. Respondents were grouped into “active” and “insufficient” groups according to reported weekly PA level. One-way analysis of variance, analysis of co-variance, and multiple linear regression were used in the analysis. Results: Overall, 17.6% (95% CI, 14.3-20.9) of the respondents did not achieve the recommended levels of PA (?600 metabolic equivalent [MET]-minutes week -1 ). Level of achieving recommended PA was higher among younger participants, females, members belonging to nuclear families, and in self-employed participants. The group that fulfilled recommended PA levels (active) has higher levels of QoL in all domains except physical functioning. Conclusions: Almost one out of five low-income urban residents were physically inactive. In addition, individuals who attained recommended PA levels had better scores on some domains of HRQOL than those who did not. Our findings call for tailormade public health interventions to improve PA levels among the general population and particularly for low-income residents. ? 2018 Tin Tin Su et al.","adult; analysis of covariance; analysis of variance; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur; female; housing; human; human experiment; lowest income group; major clinical study; mental health; metabolic equivalent; multiple linear regression analysis; nuclear family; physical activity; public health; quality of life; questionnaire; urban population; adolescent; exercise; Malaysia; male; middle aged; poverty; practice guideline; protocol compliance; statistics and numerical data; urban health; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Guideline Adherence; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Public Housing; Quality of Life; Sedentary Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Health; Urban Population; Young Adult"
"Optimization of hyperglycemic induction in zebrafish and evaluation of its blood glucose level and metabolite fingerprint treated with psychotria malayana Jack Leaf extract",2019,"A standard protocol to develop type 1 diabetes in zebrafish is still uncertain due to unpredictable factors. In this study, an optimized protocol was developed and used to evaluate the anti-diabetic activity of Psychotria malayana leaf. The aims of this study were to develop a type 1 diabetic adult zebrafish model and to evaluate the anti-diabetic activity of the plant extract on the developed model. The ability of streptozotocin and alloxan at a different dose to elevate the blood glucose levels in zebrafish was evaluated. While the anti-diabetic activity of P. malayana aqueous extract was evaluated through analysis of blood glucose and LC-MS analysis fingerprinting. The results indicated that a single intraperitoneal injection of 300 mg/kg alloxan was the optimal dose to elevate the fasting blood glucose in zebrafish. Furthermore, the plant extract at 1, 2, and 3 g/kg significantly reduced blood glucose levels in the diabetic zebrafish. In addition, LC-MS-based fingerprinting indicated that 3 g/kg plant extract more effective than other doses. Phytosterols, sugar alcohols, sugar acid, free fatty acids, cyclitols, phenolics, and alkaloid were detected in the extract using GC-MS. In conclusion, P. malayana leaf aqueous extract showed anti-diabetic activity on the developed type 1 diabetic zebrafish model. ? 2019 by the authors.","antidiabetic agent; plant extract; animal; blood; chemistry; evaluation study; experimental diabetes mellitus; Psychotria; zebra fish; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Hypoglycemic Agents; Plant Extracts; Psychotria; Zebrafish"
"Histological, Biochemical, and Hematological Effects of Goniothalamin on Selective Internal Organs of Male Sprague-Dawley Rats",2019,"Goniothalamin (GTN) is an isolated compound from several plants of the genus Goniothalamus, and its anticancer effect against several cancers was reported. However, there is no scientific data about effects of its higher doses on internal organs. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the acute and subacute effects of higher doses of GTN on the hematology, biochemistry, and histology of selected internal organs of male Sprague-Dawley rats. In acute study, 35 rats were distributed in 5 groups (n=7) which were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with a single dose of either 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg of GTN, while extra 7 rats serve as a normal control. In subacute study, 7 rats were IP-injected with a daily dose of 42 mg/kg of GTN for 14 days, while another 7 rats serve as a normal control group. The normal controls in both studies were IP-injected simultaneously with 2 ml/kg of 10% DMSO in PBS. At the end of both tests, rats were sacrificed to collect blood for hematology and biochemistry and harvest livers, kidneys, lungs, hearts, spleens, and brains for histology. During acute and subacute exposure, no abnormal changes were observed in the hematology, biochemistry, and histology of the internal organs. However, the 300, 400, and 500 mg/kg of GTN during acute exposure were associated with morbidities and mortalities. Ultimately, GTN could be safe up to the dose of 200 mg/kg, and the dose of 42 mg/kg of GTN was tolerated well. ? 2019 Fahmi Kaid et al.","goniothalamin; plant medicinal product; unclassified drug; acute toxicity; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; biochemical analysis; brain histology; controlled study; drug effect; drug exposure; drug safety; drug tolerability; Goniothalamus; heart; hematological parameters; histology; histopathology; kidney; liver histology; male; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; rat; spleen; Sprague Dawley rat"
"Factors influencing patients' hypertension self-management and sustainable self-care practices: a qualitative study",2019,"Objective: The objective of this study was to explore factors influencing patients with hypertension to participating in a hypertension self-management education (HSME) programme and challenges of sustaining the learnt self-care practices. Study design: This was a qualitative study with focus group discussions. Methods: Focus group discussions using a semistructured moderator guide were conducted among participants who had attended the HSME programme. Data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: Three focus groups involving 19 participants were conducted. Four major themes emerged from the data collected. Most participants enjoyed the group-based HSME sessions because sharing experiences with those having similar health problems can reduce their sense of isolation. However, the participants highlighted the difficulty in sustaining self-care practices in the presence of friends and family influences. Conclusion: A number of patient-, family- and community-level motivators and barriers to patients' hypertension self-management have been identified. Efforts to tailor behavioural interventions to sustain daily self-care activities during social and cultural events are imperative. ? 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health","education; health care; hypertension; public health; qualitative analysis; self assessment; sustainability; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; education; female; group therapy; health program; human; hypertension; information processing; isolation; male; personal experience; public health problem; qualitative research; self care; self concept; semi structured interview; thematic analysis; aged; attitude to health; health education; hypertension; middle aged; motivation; patient education; psychology; self care; Aged; Female; Focus Groups; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Patient Education as Topic; Qualitative Research; Self Care; Self-Management"
"Association of Interleukin-10 genotypes and oral cancer susceptibility in selected Malaysian Population: A case- control study",2019,"Background: Interleukin-10 (IL10) genotypes have been closely correlated to the susceptibility for oral squamous cell carcinoma. More than half of oral cancers in the world occur in Asia with estimated 168,850 new cases were diagnosed in this geographical region alone. Considering the rising numbers of oral cancer cases in Malaysia, association of IL10 A1082G gene polymorphism was correlated. Methodology: 41 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cases and 48 healthy controls of comparable age, gender, and with habits like smoking, alcohol consumption and betel quid chewing were selected. In this case-control study, samples were collected from the Oral Cancer Research and Coordinating Centre (OCRCC), Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Malaysia. Genotyping conditions were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The PCR products were subjected to digestion by MnlI enzyme (NEB, UK) to screen for the IL10 A-1082G. Digested DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% (w/v) agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and imaged under UV illumination. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test were used in statistical analysis. Results: AG genotypes were present in 81.3% and 86.0% of healthy control and OSCC cases respectively (OR=0.468, 95% CI=0.133-1.653). No significant association was found between IL10 A1082G polymorphism with risk habits, clinico-pathological parameters and 5-years overall survival. The findings also show no significant correlation between the IL10 genotype and features of OSCC within the case group as measured by tumor size, lymph node involvement, stage, invasive front, grading, depth, pattern of invasion. Conclusion: This study suggests that functional polymorphism AG of IL10 A1082G may have no influence with OSCC susceptibility. However, further investigation with larger sample sizes can be conducted to provide additional evidence to support the lack of association of IL10 A1082G polymorphism in oral cancer. ? 2019 IL10 Gene Polymorphism in Oral Cancer.","IL10 protein, human; interleukin 10; case control study; female; follow up; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; human; lymph node metastasis; Malaysia; male; middle aged; mouth tumor; pathology; prevalence; prognosis; secondary; single nucleotide polymorphism; squamous cell carcinoma; survival rate; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Interleukin-10; Lymphatic Metastasis; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prevalence; Prognosis; Survival Rate"
"Determination of Nutrition Risk and Status in Critically Ill Patients: What Are Our Considerations?",2019,"The stress catabolism state predisposes critically ill patients to a high risk of malnutrition. This, coupled with inadequate or delayed nutrition provision, will lead to further deterioration of nutrition status. Preexisting malnutrition and iatrogenic underfeeding are associated with increased risk of adverse complications. Therefore, accurate detection of patients who are malnourished and/or with high nutrition risk is important for timely and optimal nutrition intervention. Various tools have been developed for nutrition screening and assessment for hospitalized patients, but not all are studied or validated in critically ill populations. In this review article, we consider the pathophysiology of malnutrition in critical illness and the currently available literature to develop recommendations for nutrition screening and assessment. We suggest the use of the (modified) Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (mNUTRIC) for nutrition risk screening and the subjective global assessment (SGA) together with other criteria relevant to the critically ill patients, such as gastrointestinal function, risk of aspiration, determination of sarcopenia and frailty, and risk of refeeding syndrome for nutrition assessment. Further research is needed to identify suitable nutrition monitoring indicators to determine the response to the provision of nutrition. ? 2018 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition","abdominal compartment syndrome; aspiration; catabolism; critically ill patient; diarrhea; digestive system function disorder; food regurgitation; frailty; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; gastrointestinal symptom; gastrointestinal tract function; Global Assessment of Functioning; intestine distension; intraabdominal hypertension; malnutrition; NUTRIC score; nutrition; nutrition Risk; nutrition risk in the critically ill; nutritional assessment; pathophysiology; refeeding syndrome; Review; risk assessment; sarcopenia; scoring system; screening; stress; vomiting; adult; aged; critical illness; human; malnutrition; middle aged; nutritional status; physiology; Adult; Aged; Critical Illness; Humans; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Risk Assessment"
"Gender difference in understanding ageing and retirement",2019,"The age-old wisdom is that “women live longer than men”. Gender difference in life expectancy is becoming a worldwide phenomenon both in developed and developing countries. The process of ageing may be viewed from the perspectives of physical, psychological, and social-economic wellbeing. We investigated gender difference in understanding ageing in relation to life expectancy, fears relating to diseases and deteriorating economic status, and perceived old age comfort and their preparedness. Data were obtained from an online survey and in-person interview of 518 respondents aged 40 years and older residing in Malaysia, which was based on a convenience sample collected from May 2015 to January 2016. Data were analysed using chi-squared tests and multinomial logistic regression. There were varying views between men and women when it came to understanding ageing in relation to life expectancy, fears of ageing, deteriorating economic status and their perception of old age comfort. Women were more optimistic about living longer compared to men but feared more the consequences of old age diseases. In spite of displaying less concern about financial preparedness, women were, however, willing to cut down expenses, while men would prefer longer working hours to ensure a comfortable retirement. ? 2019, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

"Predictors of Quality of Life among Older People with Mild Cognitive Impairment Attending Urban Primary Care Clinics",2019,"Objectives: To study the prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) among older people attending primary care clinics and its predictors of QOL. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at two primary care clinics in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, recruiting 271 participants by utilizing the universal sampling method. Every patient who attended both the clinics during the study period and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were approached and briefed about the study. Patients who gave consent were recruited as study participants. Information on sociodemographic, medical condition, and lifestyle behaviors were obtained. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to screen for MCI at a score < 23. The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to evaluate QOL. Results: Prevalence of MCI was 27.3%. Lower QOL scores were found in the physical (67.3?±?1.4), psychological (67.3?±?1.4), social (66.9?±?1.6) and environmental (71.3?±?1.3) domains among participants with MCI. Among them, predictors of QOL were depression in the physical domain, age and stroke in the psychological domain, presence of other types of disorders in the social domain and diabetes and stroke in the environmental domain. Conclusions: MCI was prevalent among study participants and were associated with poorer QOL in all domains of QOL. A better understanding of predictors of QOL in older people with MCI is deemed important. Clinical implication: Routine cognitive screening at primary care clinics will facilitate early recognition of MCI and facilitates referral to memory clinics for further assessment and treatment. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.",""
"Use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and multiple cardiovascular risk factors: An Asian perspective and expert recommendations",2019,"Diabetes mellitus in Asia accounts for more than half of the global prevalence. There is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the region among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and it is often associated with multiple risk factors including hypertension, renal disease and obesity. The early onset of T2DM and the eventual long disease duration portends an increasing proportion of the population to premature CVD. In addition to lowering blood glucose, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors exert favourable effects on multiple risk factors (including blood pressure, body weight and renal function) and provide an opportunity to reduce the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM. In this article, we consolidated the existing literature on SGLT-2 inhibitor use in Asian patients with T2DM and established contemporary guidance for clinicians. We extensively reviewed recommendations from international and regional guidelines, published data from clinical trials in the Asian population (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin, luseogliflozin and tofogliflozin), CVD outcomes trials (EMPAREG-OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58) and real-world evidence studies (CVD-REAL, EASEL, CVD-REAL 2 and OBSERVE-4D). A series of clinical recommendations on the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in Asian patients with T2DM was deliberated among experts with multiple rounds of review and voting. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that SGLT-2 inhibitors represent an evidence-based therapeutic option for the primary prevention of heart failure hospitalization and secondary prevention of CVD in patients with T2DM, and should be considered early on in the treatment algorithm for patients with multiple risk factors, or those with established CVD. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Risk factors of cardiovascular disease among st-elevation myocardial infarction male patients in Malaysia from 2006 to 2013",2019,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Malaysia and globally. This study aimed to identify associated risk factors in cardiovascular disease among ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) male patients and obtain a feasible model to describe the data. A total of 16,673 STEMI male patients from 18 participating hospitals across Malaysia in the National Cardiovascular Disease Database-Acute Coronary Syndrome (NCVD-ACS) registry year 2006-2013 were analysed. Univariate analysis was conducted. Significant variables from the univariate analysis were further analysed by a multivariate logistic analysis to identify the prognostic factors. The most prevalent risk factor for male patients was smoking (79.3%), followed by hypertension (54.9%) and diabetes mellitus (40.4%). At univariate level, this study is consistent with the findings from the Malaysian National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) where smoking is a significant risk factor. After adjustment in multivariate logistic model, the risk factors for cardiovascular death among male patients are related to age, premorbid condition such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, family history of CVD, Killip class, type of treatment such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and relevant comorbidity such as renal disease. Drastic efforts in the management of all risk factors in males is needed to improve adherence outcomes. ? 2019, Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.",""
"HOspitalised Pneumonia Extended (HOPE) Study to reduce the long-term effects of childhood pneumonia: Protocol for a multicentre, double-blind, parallel, superiority randomised controlled trial",2019,"Introduction Early childhood pneumonia is a common problem globally with long-term complications that include bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is biologically plausible that these long-term effects may be minimised in young children at increased risk of such sequelae if any residual lower airway infection and inflammation in their developing lungs can be treated successfully by longer antibiotic courses. In contrast, shortened antibiotic treatments are being promoted because of concerns over inducing antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, the optimal treatment duration remains unknown. Outcomes from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on paediatric pneumonia have focused on short-term (usually <2 weeks) results. Indeed, no long-term RCT-generated outcome data are available currently. We hypothesise that a longer antibiotic course, compared with the standard treatment course, reduces the risk of chronic respiratory symptoms/signs or bronchiectasis 24 months after the original pneumonia episode. Methods and analysis This multicentre, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial involving seven hospitals in six cities from three different countries commenced in May 2016. Three-hundred-and-fourteen eligible Australian Indigenous, New Zealand M? ori/Pacific and Malaysian children (aged 0.25 to 5 years) hospitalised for community-acquired, chest X-ray (CXR)-proven pneumonia are being recruited. Following intravenous antibiotics and 3 days of amoxicillin-clavulanate, they are randomised (stratified by site and age group, allocation-concealed) to receive either: (i) amoxicillin-clavulanate (80 mg/kg/day (maximum 980 mg of amoxicillin) in two-divided doses or (ii) placebo (equal volume and dosing frequency) for 8 days. Clinical data, nasopharyngeal swab, bloods and CXR are collected. The primary outcome is the proportion of children without chronic respiratory symptom/signs of bronchiectasis at 24 months. The main secondary outcomes are ? clinical cure' at 4 weeks, time-to-next respiratory-related hospitalisation and antibiotic resistance of nasopharyngeal respiratory bacteria.

"Vitamin D non-sufficiency is prevalent in children with chronic liver disease in a tropical country",2019,"Background: To determine vitamin D status in children with chronic liver disease (CLD) in a tropical country. Methods: Cross-sectional study in Malaysian children with CLD. Factors affecting serum vitamin D level (definition: deficient < 30 nmol/L; insufficient 30–50 nmol/L; sufficient ? 50 nmol/L) was analyzed. Results: Of the 59 children studied (males 32, 54%; median age 6.8 ± 5.3 years), the three most common causes were biliary atresia (n = 25), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 16) and sclerosing cholangitis (n = 6). The overall mean daily vitamin D intake was 715 ± 562 units/day. Thirteen (22%) patients had at least one clinical signs of rickets. Seventeen (29%) had serum bilirubin level ? 34 μmol/L. Eight (14%) children were deficient in vitamin D, eight (14%) were vitamin D-insufficient and 43 (73%) were sufficient. As compared with children with serum bilirubin <34 μmol/L, those with serum bilirubin ?34 μmol/L were more likely to have rickets (24% vs. 65%; P < 0.002) and a lower serum vitamin D level (86.0 ± 54.9 nmol/L vs. 65.4 ± 48.2 nmol/L; P = 0.05) despite being given a significantly higher vitamin D dose (608 ± 571 vs. 970 ± 543 units/day; P = 0.008). The proportion of children with either deficient or insufficient vitamin D status was significantly higher in children with bilirubin level ?34 μmol/L than in children <34 μmol/L (47% vs. 19%; P = 0.028). Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is common in children with CLD in a tropical country. Regular monitoring of vitamin D status and screening for metabolic bone disease in all children with CLD is recommended.

"Effective bioremediation of heavy metal–contaminated landfill soil through bioaugmentation using consortia of fungi",2020,"Purpose: Heavy metals’ contamination of soil is a serious concern as far as public health and environmental protection are concerned. As a result of their persistent and toxic properties, heavy metals need to be removed from contaminated environments using an efficient technology. This study is aimed to determine the heavy metals’ (Ni, Pb, and Zn) bioremoval capacity of consortia of filamentous fungi from landfill leachate-contaminated soil. Materials and methods: Three different groups of consortia of fungi, namely all isolated fungi, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota, were employed for the bioremediation of the contaminated soil. A total of thirteen fungal species were used to make up the three consortia. The setup was kept for 100?days during which regular watering was carried out. Soil subsamples were collected at day 20, day 60, and 100 for monitoring of heavy metal concentration, fungal growth, and other physicochemical parameters. Results and discussion: Highest tolerance index of 1.0 was recorded towards Ni and Zn concentrations. The maximum metal bioremoval efficiency was observed for soil bioaugmented with the all isolated fungi for Ni and Pb with the removal efficiencies as 52% and 44% respectively. However, 36% was realized as the maximum removal for Zn, and was for Ascomycota consortium-treated soil. The order for the heavy metal removal for Ni and Pb is all isolated fungi &gt; Basidiomycota &gt; Ascomycota, while for Zn is Basidiomycota &gt; all isolated fungi &gt; Ascomycota. Spectra analysis revealed the presence of peaks (1485–1445?cm?1) only in the consortia-treated soil which corresponded to the bending of the C–H bond which signifies the presence of methylene group. Conclusions: Soil treated using bioaugmentation had the best heavy metal removal as compared to that of the control. This suggests the contribution of fungal bioaugmentation in the decontamination of heavy metal–contaminated soil. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bioaugmentation; bioremediation; contaminated land; environmental protection; fungus; heavy metal; landfill; public health; soil pollution; toxicity; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota; Fungi"

Methods: All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies were systematically searched in the databases of CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed from their inception until January 2018. Case reports, case series and non-systematic reviews were excluded. Results: Seventy-three studies (6 RCTs and 67 observational studies) were eligible (n = 169,236) for inclusion in the data synthesis. In comparison with the CLS arm, RAS cohort was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of conversion to open surgery (ρ &lt; 0.001, I 2 = 65%; REM: OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.30,0.53), all-cause mortality (ρ &lt; 0.001, I 2 = 7%; FEM: OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.36,0.64) and wound infection (ρ &lt; 0.001, I 2 = 0%; FEM: OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.11,1.39). Patients who received RAS had a significantly shorter duration of hospitalization (ρ &lt; 0.001, I 2 = 94%; REM: MD ? 0.77; 95% CI 1.12, ? 0.41; day), time to oral diet (ρ &lt; 0.001, I 2 = 60%; REM: MD ? 0.43; 95% CI ? 0.64, ? 0.21; day) and lesser intraoperative blood loss (ρ = 0.01, I 2 = 88%; REM: MD ? 18.05; 95% CI ? 32.24, ? 3.85; ml). However, RAS cohort was noted to require a significant longer duration of operative time (ρ &lt; 0.001, I 2 = 93%; REM: MD 38.19; 95% CI 28.78,47.60; min). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that RAS provides better clinical outcomes for colorectal cancer patients as compared to the CLS at the expense of longer duration of operative time. However, the inconclusive trial sequential analysis and an overall low level of evidence in this review warrant future adequately powered RCTs to draw firm conclusion. ? 2019, Soci?t?

"A pilot study on anti-obesity mechanisms of kappaphycus alvarezii: The role of native κ-carrageenan and the leftover sans-carrageenan fraction",2019,"Kappaphycus is a commercially important edible red alga widely cultivated for carrageenan production. Here, we aimed to investigate the anti-obesity mechanism of Kappaphycus alvarezii by comparing the effects of whole seaweed (T), extracted native κ-carrageenan (CGN), and the leftover fraction sans-carrageenan (SCGN) supplementations (5%, w/w) on diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. A high-fat diet induced both a raised body fat percentage and serum cholesterol level, increased adipocytes size, abnormal levels of adipocytokines, and promoted gut dysbiosis. Our results showed that, overall, both CGN and SCGN were more effective in reversing obesity and related metabolic syndromes to normal levels than T. Furthermore, these findings suggested that CGN-and SCGN-modulated gut dysbiosis induced by a high-fat diet, which may play an influencing role in adiponectin dysregulation. Our data also showed some evidence that CGN and SCGN have distinct effects on selected genes involved in lipid metabolism. In conclusion, both κ-carrageenan and SCGN have novel anti-obesity potential with possible different mechanisms of action. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Machine learning-based coronary artery disease diagnosis: A comprehensive review",2019,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and often leads to a heart attack. It annually causes millions of deaths and billions of dollars in financial losses worldwide. Angiography, which is invasive and risky, is the standard procedure for diagnosing CAD. Alternatively, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used in the literature as fast, affordable, and noninvasive approaches for CAD detection. The results that have been published on ML-based CAD diagnosis differ substantially in terms of the analyzed datasets, sample sizes, features, location of data collection, performance metrics, and applied ML techniques. Due to these fundamental differences, achievements in the literature cannot be generalized. This paper conducts a comprehensive and multifaceted review of all relevant studies that were published between 1992 and 2019 for ML-based CAD diagnosis. The impacts of various factors, such as dataset characteristics (geographical location, sample size, features, and the stenosis of each coronary artery) and applied ML techniques (feature selection, performance metrics, and method) are investigated in detail. Finally, the important challenges and shortcomings of ML-based CAD diagnosis are discussed. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Computer aided diagnosis; Data mining; Diseases; Heart; Learning systems; Losses; Machine learning; Sampling; Cardiovascular disease; Coronary arteries; Coronary artery disease; Coronary artery disease diagnosis; Data collection; Geographical locations; Performance metrics; Standard procedures; Feature extraction; algorithm; coronary artery disease; data mining; left coronary artery; machine learning; priority journal; Review; World Health Organization"
"Effects of swimming towards mental health in collegiate male adults",2019,"Sports can be a non-pharmacological way to improve general human health. This study aimed at evaluating mental health among healthy male adults following swimming intervention as one of the recommended sports in Islam. A total of 28 adults aged 19-33 years old were randomly divided into two groups, swimming group (n=14) and control group (n=14). Two sets of questionnaires were employed, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Profile of Mood State (POMS), which examined six domains i.e tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion, and vigour pre and post-intervention. The swimming group underwent an exercise program three times per week for eight weeks while the control group maintained their usual daily lifestyle. At baseline, there were significant differences were identified for all parameters measured in DASS and POMS excepts total mood disturbance and vigour domain between the two groups. While at post-intervention, there were significant differences between groups in anxiety and stress in DASS, as well as vigour domain in POMS (p< 0.05). After eight weeks of exercise, swimming group showed a significant reduction in all outcomes measured compared to the control group (p< 0.05). This study shows that eight weeks of swimming can exert positive effects on mental health in healthy male collegiate adults. ? 2019 Malaysian Applied Biology. All rights reserved.",""
"Tri-parent Baby Technology and Preservation of Lineage: An Analysis from the Perspective of Maqasid al-Shari’ah Based Islamic Bioethics",2019,"Tri-parent baby technology is an assisted reproductive treatment which aims to minimize or eliminate maternal inheritance of mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The technology became popular following the move by the United Kingdom in granting license to a group of researchers from the Newcastle Fertility Centre, Newcastle University to conduct research on the symptoms of defective mtDNA. This technology differs from other assisted reproductive technology because it involves the use of gamete components retrieved from three different individuals. Indirectly, it affects the preservation of lineage which is important from an Islamic point of view. This paper aims to analyze and discuss the implications of the tri-parent technology on preservation of lineage from the perspective of Maqasid al-Shari’ah based the Islamic bioethics. The analysis shows that there are a few violations of the preservation of lineage, hence the tri-parent baby technology should not be permitted. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","mitochondrial DNA; bioethics; child parent relation; disorders of mitochondrial functions; ethics; genetics; germ cell; human; infertility therapy; Islam; morality; mother; mutation; religion; technology; United Kingdom; Bioethics; DNA, Mitochondrial; Germ Cells; Humans; Islam; Mitochondrial Diseases; Morals; Mothers; Mutation; Parents; Religion and Medicine; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Technology; United Kingdom"
"Religious Coping, Religiosity, Depression and Anxiety among Medical Students in a Multi-Religious Setting",2019,"Medical students are vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the nature of their academic life. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among medical students and the association between religious coping, religiosity and socio-demographic factors with anxiety and depressive symptoms. A cross sectional design was used for this study. Scales used were the Malay version of the Duke Religious Index (DUREL-M), the Malay version of the Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE) and the Malay version Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS-M). 622 students participated in this study. They scored moderately on the organized (mean: 3.51) and non-organized religious (mean: 3.85) subscales of the DUREL, but had high intrinsic religiosity (mean: 12.18). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 4.7% and 17.4% respectively, which is lower than local as well as international data. Islam, negative religious coping and the presence of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Only the presence of anxiety symptoms was significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Negative religious coping, rather than positive religious coping, has significant association with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Redirecting focus towards negative religious coping is imperative to boost mental health outcomes among medical students.","anxiety; coping behavior; cross-sectional study; depression; female; human; Malaysia; male; medical student; prevalence; psychology; religion; statistics and numerical data; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Prevalence; Religion; Students, Medical"
"Association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease evaluated by transient elastography with extracranial carotid atherosclerosis in a multiethnic Asian community",2019,"Background and Aim: There is not much data on the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and advanced fibrosis assessed using Fibroscan with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in the general population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, as diagnosed by Fibroscan, with an increased CIMT in the Malaysian population. Methods: A cross-sectional study of government officers and their family members attending a health screening at a public healthcare facility was conducted. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, biochemical testing, anthropometry, ultrasound carotid Doppler, and Fibroscan examination. Results: Data for 251 subjects were analyzed (mean age 47.1 ± 12.4 years, 74.1% male). Prevalence of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis were 57.4 and 17.5%, respectively. Independent factors associated with NAFLD were waist circumference (odds ratio [OR] = 1.077, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.038–1.118, P < 0.001) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR = 1.039, 95% CI 1.005–1.074, P = 0.024). Independent factors associated with advanced fibrosis were male gender (OR = 4.847, 95% CI 1.369–17.155, P = 0.014) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR = 1.057, 95% CI 1.003–1.113, P = 0.036). Prevalence of increased CIMT was 29.0%. Independent factor associated with increased CIMT was older age (OR = 1.146, 95% CI 1.067–1.231, P < 0.001). Of the subjects, 34.5% with NAFLD had increased CIMT compared to 19.1% of the subjects without NAFLD (P = 0.063). Advanced fibrosis was not associated with increased CIMT. Conclusions: Prevalence of NAFLD, advanced liver fibrosis, and increased CIMT were high. NAFLD and advanced liver fibrosis appeared not to be associated with increased CIMT. However, a larger sample size is needed to demonstrate whether there is any association. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Cell surface α2,3-linked sialic acid facilitates Zika virus internalization",2019,"The emergence of neurotropic Zika virus (ZIKV) raised a public health emergency of global concern. ZIKV can cross the placental barrier and infect foetal brains, resulting in microcephaly, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV is poorly understood. With recent findings reporting AXL as a type I interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor, the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved. Here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in ZIKV infection. Removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished ZIKV infection in Vero cells and human induced-pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less ZIKV infection of both African and Asian lineages. Huh7 cells deficient in α2,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of ST3 β-galactoside-α2,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Removal of membrane-bound, un-internalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in ZIKV internalization but not attachment. Sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, implying that sialic acid could be mediating ZIKV-receptor complex internalization. Identification of α2,3-linked sialic acid as an important host factor for ZIKV internalization provides new insight into ZIKV infection and pathogenesis. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

Methods: Adult and larval mosquitos were collected for surveillance. Susceptibility status of Anopheles was determined using the standard WHO adult bioassay, larval bioassay and biochemical enzyme assay. Results: WHO adult bioassay results indicated An. cracens collected from Kampung Sungai Ular, Pahang was resistant towards 4% DDT, while An. maculatus collected from Kampung Sokor, Kelantan and Kampung Sungai Lui, Selangor exhibited resistance towards 4% DDT. However, the enzyme activity profiles varied according to strains and species. The resistance ratio of larval bioassay, showed that all strains and species tested were susceptible to malathion and temephos. Conclusions: Since only a few anopheline strains exhibited low level of insecticide resistance towards malathion, DDT and temephos. These insecticides are still considered effective for vector control program towards An. cracens and An. maculatus. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","acetylcholinesterase; chlorphenotane; deltamethrin; glutathione transferase; malathion; nonspecific esterase; temefos; unspecific monooxygenase; adult; Anopheles; Anopheles cracens; Anopheles maculatus; Article; bioassay; biochemical analysis; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; female; insect larva; insecticide resistance; larvicidal activity; LC50; Malaysia; nonhuman; Plasmodium knowlesi malaria; priority journal; vector control; World Health Organization"
"Predictive factors of prostate cancer diagnosis with PSA 4.0–10.0 ng/ml in a multi-ethnic Asian population, Malaysia",2020,"Objectives: To identify the associated factors determining prostate cancer detection using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy, within a multi-ethnic Malaysian population with prostate specific antigen (PSA) between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/ml. Methods: Study subjects included men with initial PSA between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/ml that have undergone 12-core TRUS-guided prostate biopsy between 2009 and 2016. The prostate cancer detection rate was calculated, while potential factors associated with detection were investigated via univariable and multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 617 men from a multi-ethnic background encompassing Chinese (63.5%), Malay (23.1%) and Indian (13.3%) were studied. The overall cancer detection rate was 14.3% (88/617), which included cancers detected at biopsy 1 (first biopsy), biopsy 2 (second biopsy with previous negative biopsy) and biopsy ? 3 (third or more biopsies with prior negative biopsies). Indian men displayed higher detection rate (23.2%) and increased risk of prostate cancer development (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03–3.32, p < 0.05), compared to their Malay (9.8%) and Chinese (14.0%) counterparts. Multivariable analysis revealed that ethnicity and PSA density (PSAD) are independent factors associated with overall prostate cancer detection rate. A unit increase of PSAD reflected an increase in PSA after controlling for prostate volume. Conclusion: Prostate cancer detection in Malaysia is comparatively lower. Our study suggests that ethnicity and PSA density should be considered when recommending first or repeat TRUS-guided prostate biopsy for prostate cancer detection in a multi-ethnic Malaysian population. ? 2019",""

"Optimizing Use of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score, Fibrosis-4 Score, and Liver Stiffness Measurement to Identify Patients With Advanced Fibrosis",2019,"Background & Aims: Measuring liver stiffness only in patients with indeterminate or high nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis scores (called a 2-step approach) was reported to reduce indeterminate or discordant results while maintaining the accuracy to identify patients with advanced fibrosis. We aimed to validate this approach using data collected from the Gut and Obesity in Asia Workgroup. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 759 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (24% with advanced fibrosis), seen at 10 centers in 9 countries in Asia, from 2006 through 2018. By using liver biopsies as the reference standard, we calculated percentages of misclassifications and indeterminate or discordant results from assessments made based on fibrosis scores (NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS] or Fibrosis-4 score) and liver stiffness measurements (LSMs), alone or in combination. The analysis was repeated using randomly selected subgroups with a different prevalence of advanced fibrosis (histologic fibrosis stage ?F3). Results: In groups in which 3.7% and 10% of patients had advanced fibrosis, a 2-step approach (using the NFS followed by LSM only for patients with indeterminate or high NFS) and using a gray zone of 10 to 15 kPa for LSM, produced indeterminate or discordant results for 6.9% of patients and misclassified 2.7% of patients; only 25.6% of patients required LSM. In the group in which 10% of patients had advanced fibrosis, the same approach produced indeterminate or discordant results for 7.9% of patients and misclassified 6.6% of patients; only 27.4% of patients required LSM. In groups in which 24% and 50% of patients had advanced fibrosis, using LSM ?10 kPa alone for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis had the highest accuracy and misclassified 18.1% and 18.3% of patients, respectively. These results were similar when the Fibrosis-4 score was used in place of NFS. Conclusions: In a retrospective analysis, we found that a 2-step approach using fibrosis scores followed by LSM most accurately detects advanced fibrosis in populations with a low prevalence of advanced fibrosis. However, LSM ?10 kPa identifies patients with advanced fibrosis with the highest level of accuracy in populations with a high prevalence of advanced fibrosis. ? 2019 AGA Institute","adult; advanced liver fibrosis; area under the curve; Article; Asia; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; digestive system disease assessment; female; Fibrosis 4 Score; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness measurement; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score; patient identification; predictive value; prevalence; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; transient elastography; validation study"
"Prevalence of growth and endocrine disorders in Malaysian children with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia",2019,"INTRODUCTION Endocrine dysfunction due to iron overload secondary to frequent blood transfusions is a common complication in children with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (TDT). We ascertained the prevalence of endocrine dysfunction in children with TDT seen in a hospital setting in Malaysia. METHODS We reviewed all patients with TDT who had ? 8 blood transfusions per year. Patients who had a history of stem cell transplantation, concurrent autoimmune diseases or were newly diagnosed to have TDT were excluded. Standard diagnostic criteria were used in the diagnosis of various endocrine dysfunctions. RESULTS Of the 82 patients with TDT, 65% had at least one endocrine dysfunction. Short stature was the commonest (40.2%), followed by pubertal disorders (14.6%), hypoparathyroidism (12.3%), vitamin D deficiency (10.1%), hypocortisolism (7.3%), diabetes mellitus (5.2%) and overt hypothyroidism (4.9%). Subclinical hypothyroidism and pre-diabetes mellitus were seen in 13.4% and 8.6% of the patients, respectively. For children aged < 10 years, the prevalence of both thyroid dysfunction and hypoparathyroidism was 9.1%. CONCLUSION Two-thirds of children with TDT experienced at least one endocrine dysfunction. Thyroid dysfunction and hypoparathyroidism may be missed if endocrine screening is only performed in children with TDT > 10 years of age. Close monitoring for endocrine dysfunction and hormonal therapy is essential to prevent long-term adverse outcomes. ? 2019, Singapore Medical Association.

"Can dynamic consent facilitate the protection of biomedical big data in biobanking in Malaysia?",2019,"As with many other countries, Malaysia is also developing and promoting biomedical research to increase the understanding of human diseases and possible interventions. To facilitate this development, there is a significant growth of biobanks in the country to ensure continuous collection of biological samples for future research, which contain extremely important personal information and health data of the participants involved. Given the vast amount of samples and data accumulated by biobanks, they can be considered as reservoirs of precious biomedical big data. It is therefore imperative for biobanks to have in place regulatory measures to ensure ethical use of the biomedical big data. Malaysia has yet to introduce specific legislation for the field of biobanking. However, it can be argued that its existing Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) has laid down legal principles that can be enforced to protect biomedical big data generated by the biobanks. Consent is a mechanism to enable data subjects to exercise their autonomy by determining how their data can be used and ensure compliance with legal principles. However, there are two main concerns surrounding the current practice of consent in biomedical big data in Malaysia. First, it is uncertain that the current practice would be able to respect the underlying notion of autonomy, and second, it is not in accordance with the legal principles of the PDPA. Scholars have deliberated on different strategies of informed consent, and a more interactive approach has recently been introduced: dynamic consent. It is argued that a dynamic consent approach would be able to address these concerns. ? 2019, National University of Singapore and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",""
"Molecular Insight and Mode of Inhibition of α-Glucosidase and α-Amylase by Pahangensin A from Alpinia pahangensis Ridl.",2019,"The inhibition of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes in human digestive organs is crucial in controlling blood sugar levels, which is important in treating type 2 diabetes. In the current study, pahangensin A (1), a bis-labdanic diterpene characterized previously in the rhizomes of Alpinia pahangensis Ridl., was identified as an active dual inhibitor for α-amylase (IC50=114.80 μm) and α-glucosidase (IC50=153.87 μm). This is the first report on the dual α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of a bis-labdanic diterpene. The Lineweaver-Burk plots of compound 1 indicate that it is a mixed-type inhibitor with regard to both enzymes. Based on molecular docking studies, compound 1 docked in a non-active site of both enzymes. The dual inhibitory activity of compound 1 makes it a suitable natural alternative in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. ? 2019 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland","acarbose; alpha glucosidase; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; amylase; amylase inhibitor; diterpene; pahangensin A; unclassified drug; diterpene; enzyme inhibitor; plant extract; Alpinia; Alpinia pahangensis; Article; enzyme inhibition; hydrogen bond; IC50; molecular docking; nonhuman; Alpinia; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; chemistry; enzyme active site; isolation and purification; kinetics; metabolism; alpha-Amylases; alpha-Glucosidases; Alpinia; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Diterpenes; Enzyme Inhibitors; Kinetics; Molecular Docking Simulation; Plant Extracts"

Three countries (Brunei, Cambodia, and East Timor) have no epilepsy center, and 2 countries (Laos, Myanmar) have level 2 centers doing tumor surgery only. Level-3 epilepsy centers are available in 6 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippine, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam); only 5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippine, Singapore, Thailand) has at least one level-4 epilepsy care facility. Indonesia with 261 million population only has one level 3 and another level 4 center. The costs of presurgical evaluation and brain surgery vary within and among the countries. The main barriers towards epilepsy surgery in ASEAN include lack of expertise, funding and facilities. Conclusions: Epilepsy surgery is underutilized in ASEAN with low number of level 3 centers, and limited availability of advanced presurgical evaluation. Lack of expertise, facilities and funding may be the key factors contributing to the underutilization. ? 2019 British Epilepsy Association","Article; brain surgery; brain tumor; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; cortical dysplasia; cross-sectional study; epilepsy; funding; health care cost; health care facility; health care utilization; hippocampal sclerosis; human; Indonesia; invasive procedure; Laos; lesionectomy; Malaysia; Myanmar; non invasive procedure; patient referral; Philippines; priority journal; professional knowledge; Singapore; Thailand; Timor-Leste; Viet Nam"

"Interventions for obesity among schoolchildren: A systematic review and meta-analyses",2019,"Background Childhood overweight and obesity has emerged as a major public health threat worldwide with challenges in its management. This review assessed the effectiveness of interventions for childhood overweight and obesity. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus databases to retrieve articles published from 1st January 2000 to 31 st December 2017. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies comparing different strategies in managing overweight and obesity among schoolchildren (6 to 12 years of age) were included. The main outcomes of interest were reductions in weight related variables included anthropometry and body composition measurements. All variables were analysed using random effects meta-analyses. Results Fourteen studies were reviewed, 13 were RCTs and one was a quasi-experimental study. The risk of bias for randomisation was low risk for all of RCTs except for one, which was unclear. The risk of bias for randomisation was high for the quasi-experimental study. Most interventions incorporated lifestyle changes and behavioural strategies such as coping and problem solving skills with family involvement. The meta-analyses did not show significant effects of the intervention in reducing weight related outcomes when compared with controls. Conclusion Meta-analyses of the selected studies did not show significant effects of the interventions on weight related outcomes among overweight and obese schoolchildren when compared with controls. The role of interdisciplinary team approaches with family involvement using behaviour and lifestyle strategies to curb obesity among schoolchildren is important. ? 2019 A. Hamid, Sazlina.

"Cost-Effectiveness of Adjuvant Trastuzumab Therapy for Early Breast Cancer in Asia: A Systematic Review",2019,"Objectives: To systematically review and assess the quality of the economic evidence of adjuvant trastuzumab usage in early breast cancer in Asian countries. Methods: Literature search was performed using 6 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, EconLit, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and ISI Web of Knowledge). The final search was performed in October 2018. All potential economic studies were then checked for eligibility. The reporting and methodological qualities of each study were independently assessed by 2 authors of this review, using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards, Drummond, and Philips checklists. To compare the different currencies used in these studies, all costs were converted into US dollars (2016). Results: A total of 6 studies were included; most of them were performed from the healthcare provider perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for evaluation performed for a lifetime horizon were reported at $8573 and $20 816 per quality-adjusted life-year in 2 studies. The model outcome was generally sensitive to the changes in trastuzumab drug acquisition cost and discount rate, as well as its clinical effectiveness. For the quality assessment, all studies fulfilled more than 50% of the requirements in the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards, Drummond, and Philips checklists. Conclusions: Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy is considered a cost-effective option for early breast cancer in Asian countries including China, Iran, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. All studies were generally well conducted. Economic evaluations from the societal perspective, with inclusion of indirect and informal care costs, are warranted to facilitate informed decision making among policy makers. ? 2019 ISPOR—The professional society for health economics and outcomes research","trastuzumab; trastuzumab; Article; Asian; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; early cancer; economic evaluation; health care cost; human; policy; priority journal; social norm; systematic review; breast tumor; cost benefit analysis; economics; female; procedures; secondary prevention; standards; Breast Neoplasms; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Secondary Prevention; Trastuzumab"
"Homologous recombination DNA repair defects in PALB2-associated breast cancers",2019,"Mono-allelic germline pathogenic variants in the Partner And Localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) gene predispose to a high-risk of breast cancer development, consistent with the role of PALB2 in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. Here, we sought to define the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations in PALB2-associated breast cancers (BCs), and whether PALB2-associated BCs display bi-allelic inactivation of PALB2 and/or genomic features of HR-deficiency (HRD). Twenty-four breast cancer patients with pathogenic PALB2 germline mutations were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES, n = 16) or targeted capture massively parallel sequencing (410 cancer genes, n = 8). Somatic genetic alterations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the PALB2 wild-type allele, large-scale state transitions (LSTs) and mutational signatures were defined. PALB2-associated BCs were found to be heterogeneous at the genetic level, with PIK3CA (29%), PALB2 (21%), TP53 (21%), and NOTCH3 (17%) being the genes most frequently affected by somatic mutations. Bi-allelic PALB2 inactivation was found in 16 of the 24 cases (67%), either through LOH (n = 11) or second somatic mutations (n = 5) of the wild-type allele. High LST scores were found in all 12 PALB2-associated BCs with bi-allelic PALB2 inactivation sequenced by WES, of which eight displayed the HRD-related mutational signature 3. In addition, bi-allelic inactivation of PALB2 was significantly associated with high LST scores. Our findings suggest that the identification of bi-allelic PALB2 inactivation in PALB2-associated BCs is required for the personalization of HR-directed therapies, such as platinum salts and/or PARP inhibitors, as the vast majority of PALB2-associated BCs without PALB2 bi-allelic inactivation lack genomic features of HRD. ? 2019, The Author(s).","partner and localizer of BRCA2; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; clinical article; female; gene frequency; gene inactivation; germline mutation; heterozygosity loss; human; middle aged; recombination repair; somatic mutation; tumor gene; very elderly; whole exome sequencing; wild type"
"An oncogenic role for four-jointed box 1 (FJX1) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma",2019,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly metastatic cancer prevalent in Southern China and Southeast Asia. The current knowledge on the molecular pathogenesis of NPC is still inadequate to improve disease management. Using gene expression microarrays, we have identified the four-jointed box 1 (FJX1) gene to be upregulated in primary NPC tissues relative to nonmalignant tissues. An orthologue of human FJX1, the four-jointed (fj) gene in Drosophila and Fjx1 in mouse, has reported to be associated with cancer progression pathways. However, the exact function of FJX1 in human is not well characterized. The overexpression of FJX1 mRNA was validated in primary NPC tissue samples, and the level of FJX1 protein was significantly higher in a subset of NPC tissues (42%) compared to the normal epithelium, where no expression of FJX1 was observed (p = 0 01). FJX1 is also found to be overexpressed in microarray datasets and TCGA datasets of other cancers including head and neck cancer, colorectal, and ovarian cancer. Both siRNA knockdown and overexpression experiments in NPC cell lines showed that FJX1 promotes cell proliferation, anchorage-dependent growth, and cellular invasion. Cyclin D1 and E1 mRNA levels were increased following FJX1 expression indicating that FJX1 enhances proliferation by regulating key proteins governing the cell cycle. Our data suggest that the overexpression of FJX1 contributes to a more aggressive phenotype of NPC cells and further investigations into FJX1 as a potential therapeutic target for NPC are warranted. The evaluation of FJX1 as an immunotherapy target for NPC and other cancers is currently ongoing. ? 2019 San Jiun Chai et al.","cyclin D1; cyclin e1; cycline; four jointed box 1 protein; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; oncoprotein; protein; small interfering RNA; tumor marker; unclassified drug; cycline; FJX1 protein, human; membrane protein; tumor marker; anchorage independent growth; Article; cancer growth; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell cycle regulation; cell invasion; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; DNA microarray; epithelium; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; head and neck cancer; HeLa cell line; hela t cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; mRNA expression level; nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line; nasopharynx carcinoma; NPC/HK1 cell line; ovary cancer; phenotype; protein expression level; protein function; upregulation; carcinoma; epithelium cell; genetics; metabolism; nasopharynx tumor; pathology; physiology; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma; Cell Proliferation; Cyclins; Epithelial Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Up-Regulation"
"BTEX compositions and its potential health impacts in Malaysia",2019,"This study aims to determine the composition of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) and assess the risk to health at different sites in Malaysia. Continuous monitoring of BTEX in Kuala Lumpur City Centre, Kuala Terengganu, Kota Kinabalu and Fraser Hill were conducted using Online Gas Chromatograph. For comparison, BTEX at selected hotspot locations were determined by active sampling method using sorbent tubes and Thermal Desorption Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. The hazard quotient (HQ) for non-carcinogenic and the life-time cancer risk (LTCR) of BTEX were calculated using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) health risk assessment (HRA) methods. The results showed that the highest total BTEX concentrations using continuous monitoring were recorded in the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (49.56 ± 23.71 μg/m3). Toluene was the most dominant among the BTEX compounds. The average concentrations of benzene ranged from 0.69 ± 0.45 μg/m3 to 6.20 ± 3.51 μg/m3. Measurements using active sampling showed that BTEX concentrations dominated at the roadside (193.11 ± 114.57 μg/m3) in comparison to petrol station (73.08 ± 30.41 μg/m3), petrochemical industry (32.10 ± 13.13 μg/m3) and airport (25.30 ± 6.17 μg/m3). Strong correlations among BTEX compounds (p&lt;0.01, r&gt;0.7) at Kuala Lumpur City Centre showed that BTEX compounds originated from similar sources. The values of HQ at all stations were &lt;1 indicating the non-carcinogenic risk are negligible and do not pose threats to human health. The LTCR value based on benzene inhalation (1.59 × 10?5) at Kuala Lumpur City Centre were between 1 × 10?4 and 1 × 10?5, representing a probable carcinogenic risk. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benzene; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas chromatography; Health; Mass spectrometry; Monitoring; Risk assessment; Toluene; Active sampling; BTEX; Continuous sampling; Health impact; Motor vehicle; Health risks; benzene; carcinogen; ethylbenzene; ortho xylene; sorbent; toluene; xylene; benzene; benzene derivative; carcinogen; ethylbenzene; toluene; xylene; BTEX; concentration (composition); health impact; health risk; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; risk assessment; sampling; transport vehicle; Article; boundary layer; cancer risk; comparative study; environmental exposure; Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur; government; hazard; health hazard; human; human impact (environment); industrial area; kota kinabalu; kuala terengganu; Malaysia; mass fragmentography; motor vehicle; petrochemical industry; quality control; risk assessment; statistics; Terengganu; urban area; environmental monitoring; procedures; risk assessment; Malaysia; Benzene; Benzene Derivatives; Carcinogens; Environmental Monitoring; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Malaysia; Risk Assessment; Toluene; Xylenes"

"A compartmental model on the effect of quarantine on MDR-TB",2019,"This paper presents a five compartmental deterministic model to study the effect of quarantine in managing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We established that the model exhibits two equilibria; disease free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium point (EEP). The DFE was shown to be locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number, R0 is less than unity (R0 &lt; 1). The global stability of both the DFE and EEP were established with the aid of constructed Lyapunov functions. We proved that the model undergoes backward bifurcation, which gives direction to the medical experts that keeping the basic reproduction number less than unity (R0 &lt; 1) is not enough to curtail the spread of the infection but rather think of other measures. The numerical simulation done gives a pictorial representation of the impact of quarantine in managing MDR-TB as it helps in reducing the disease incidence. ? 2019, Badih/Ghusayni, Ed. & Pub.",""

"The burden and epidemiology of polyparasitism among rural communities in Kano State, Nigeria",2019,"Background Parasitic infections constitute a major public health problem worldwide, particularly among underprivileged communities in developing countries including Nigeria. The present study aimed to determine the epidemiology of polyparasitism (multiple parasitic infections) among rural communities in Kano State, North Central Nigeria. Methods A total of 551 individuals were screened for the presence of intestinal, urogenital and blood parasites by using different diagnostic techniques. Demographic, socioeconomic, household and behavioural characteristics were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Overall, 84.0% (463/551) of the participants were found to be infected with at least one parasite species, with 51.2% (282/551) of them having polyparasitism. The most prevalent parasites were Plasmodium falciparum (60.6%) followed by Blastocystis sp. (29.2%) and hookworm (15.4%). No significant association was found between malaria and helminth infections (p>0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the presence of other family members who had intestinal polyparasitism (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=4.12; 95% CI=2.72, 6.24), walking barefoot outside (AOR=1.70; 95% CI=1.09, 2.63) and being male (AOR=1.74; 95% CI=1.14, 2.66) were the significant risk factors of intestinal polyparasitism among the population studied. Conclusion Polyparasitism is highly prevalent among rural communities in Kano State. Therefore, effective, sustainable and integrated control measures should be identified and implemented to significantly reduce the burden and consequences of these infections in rural Nigeria. ? 2018 The Author(s).","adult; Article; Blastocystis; cross-sectional study; demography; disease burden; female; helminthiasis; hookworm; household; human; major clinical study; male; mass screening; Nigeria; parasitism; parasitosis; Plasmodium falciparum; questionnaire; risk factor; rural population; socioeconomics"
"Marine debris: A review of impacts and global initiatives",2019,"Marine debris, defined as any persistent manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment, has been highlighted as a contaminant of global environmental and economic concern. The five main categories of marine debris comprise of plastic, paper, metal, textile, glass and rubber. Plastics is recognised as the major constituent of marine debris, representing between 50% and 90% of the total marine debris found globally. Between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tonnes of consumer plastics end up in the world oceans annually, resulting in the presence of more than 100 million particles of macroplastics in only 12 regional seas worldwide, and with 51 trillion particles of microplastic floating on the ocean surface globally. The impacts of marine debris can be branched out into three categories; injury to or death of marine organisms, harm to marine environment and effects on human health and economy. Marine mammals often accidentally ingest marine debris because of its appearance that can easily be mistaken as food. Moreover, floating plastics may act as vehicles for chemicals and/or environmental contaminants, which may be absorbed on to their surface during their use and permanence into the environment. Additionally, floating plastics is a potential vector for the introduction of invasive species that get attached to it, into the marine environment. In addition, human beings are not excluded from the impact of marine debris as they become exposed to microplastics through seafood consumption. Moreover, landscape degradation owing to debris accumulation is an eyesore and aesthetically unpleasant, thus resulting in decreased tourism and subsequent income loss. There are a wide range of initiatives that have been taken to tackle the issue of marine debris. They may involve manual removal of marine debris from coastal and aquatic environment in form of programmes and projects organised, such as beach clean-ups by scientific communities, non-governmental organizations and the removal of marine litter from Europe’s four regional seas, respectively. Other initiatives focus on assessment, reduction, prevention and management of marine debris under the umbrella of international (the United Nations Environment Programme/Mediterranean Action Plan, the Oslo/Paris Convention) and regional organisations – that is, the Helsinki Commission. There are also a number of international conventions and national regulations that encourage mitigation and management of marine debris. However, it is argued that these initiatives are short-term unsustainable solutions and the long-term sustainable solution would be adoption of circular economy. Similarly, four of the sustainable developmental goals have targets that promote mitigation of marine debris by efficient waste management and practice of 3R. As evident by the Ad Hoc Expert Group on Marine Litter and Microplastics meeting, tackling the marine debris crisis is not a straightforward, one-size-fits-all solution, but rather an integrated and continuous effort required at local, regional and global level. ?

"Reproductive Factors, Exogenous Hormone Use, and Risk of B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in a Cohort of Women from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition",2019,"The role of hormonal factors in the etiology of lymphoid neoplasms remains unclear. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results, have lacked sufficient statistical power to assess many lymphoma subtypes, or have lacked detailed information on relevant exposures. Within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, we analyzed comprehensive data on reproductive factors and exogenous hormone use collected at baseline (1992-2000) among 343,458 women, including data on 1,427 incident cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and its major subtypes identified after a mean follow-up period of 14 years (through 2015). We estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using multivariable proportional hazards modeling. Overall, we observed no statistically significant associations between parity, age at first birth, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, or ever use of postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of B-cell NHL or its subtypes. Women who had undergone surgical menopause had a 51% higher risk of B-cell NHL (based on 67 cases) than women with natural menopause (hazard ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.94). Given that this result may have been due to chance, our results provide little support for the hypothesis that sex hormones play a role in lymphomagenesis. ?

"DNA repair efficiency associated with reprogrammed osteosarcoma cells",2019,"Genomic instability and genetic heterogeneity are typical hallmarks of cancer, including osteosarcoma (OS), a type of bone tumor. Inactivation of DNA repair pathways may play an important role in the initiation and progression of OS pathogenesis by increasing the mutation rate and genomic instability. However, there is still a lack of information on gene alterations and mutations that may increase the risk of osteosarcoma formation. Reprogramming OS cells to a primitive stage namely induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)state could be a useful disease model to understand the pathogenesis of OS and to bridge the current gap of knowledge on DNA repair mechanisms in reprogrammed OS cells. By using Yamanaka factors, OS cell lines, G-292 and Saos-2, were reprogrammed to iPSC lines, respectively iG-292 and iSaos-2, both of which demonstrated pluripotency similar to embryonic stem cells. However, only iG-292 was able to form teratoma. Subsequent microarray data showed significant down-regulation of DNA Damage Response (DDR)genes expression for both iG-292 and iSaos-2. A functional assay using UV-induced DNA damage approach demonstrated efficient DNA repair mechanism in iG-292. Further analysis of nucleotide excision repair (NER)genes demonstrated up-regulation of GADD45G, XPA, RPA, MNAT1, ERCC1, PCNA, and POLL, in iG-292. Up-regulation of GADD45G together with up-regulation of other NER genes synergistically repair UV damage by rapid removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. In conclusion, down-regulation of DDR genes in reprogrammed OS may render an enhanced state of genomic integrity in reprogrammed OS as compared to the parental cells. Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time DDR profile of reprogrammed OS cells and the probable involvement of GADD45G in the DNA repair mechanism of reprogrammed OS cells. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","cycline; excision repair cross complementing protein 1; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; growth arrest and damage inducible 45 gamma; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta; mnat cdk activating kinase assembly factor 1; MutL protein homolog 1; polymerase DNA lambda; protein; pyrimidine dimer; replication factor A; transcription factor GATA 2; transcription factor GATA 4; transcription factor GATA 6; transcription factor MSX1; unclassified drug; Article; DNA damage response; DNA repair; down regulation; embryonic stem cell; excision repair; gene expression; genomic instability; human; human cell; ig 292 cell line; induced pluripotent stem cell; isaos 2 cell line; microarray analysis; nuclear reprogramming; osteosarcoma; osteosarcoma cell; priority journal; teratoma; upregulation"
"Innovative strategies for the elimination of viral hepatitis at a national level: A country case series",2019,"Viral hepatitis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but has long been neglected by national and international policymakers. Recent modelling studies suggest that investing in the global elimination of viral hepatitis is feasible and cost-effective. In 2016, all 194 member states of the World Health Organization endorsed the goal to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, but complex systemic and social realities hamper implementation efforts. This paper presents eight case studies from a diverse range of countries that have invested in responses to viral hepatitis and adopted innovative approaches to tackle their respective epidemics. Based on an investment framework developed to build a global investment case for the elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030, national activities and key enablers are highlighted that showcase the feasibility and impact of concerted hepatitis responses across a range of settings, with different levels of available resources and infrastructural development. These case studies demonstrate the utility of taking a multipronged, public health approach to: (a) evidence-gathering and planning; (b) implementation; and (c) integration of viral hepatitis services into the Agenda for Sustainable Development. They provide models for planning, investment and implementation strategies for other countries facing similar challenges and resource constraints. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Antiviral activity of a standardized root water extract of eurycoma longifolia (Physta?) against dengue virus",2019,"The aim of this study was to investigate the antiviral property of Eurycoma longifolia Jack (EL) against dengue virus. A propriety standardized extract of Eurycoma longifolia Jack (Physta?) was tested for anti-viral activity after viral adsorption in Vero cell line. Viral yield was measured by qRT-PCR in four serotypes of dengue virus. The antiviral activity was further investigated in an in vivo AG129 mouse model for dengue inhibitory candidates. 100 mg/kg EL extract was fed twice daily and challenged with a lethal dose of (~1x105 PFU per mouse) of DENV-2 over a period of six days. Antiviral activity with IC50 of 33.84, 33.55, 58.35 and 119 ?g/ml for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes respectively was observed. The selectivity index (SI) values determined as the ratio of cytotoxic concentration (CC50) to inhibitory concentration (IC50) was the lowest for DENV-2 at 28.9. The dengue virus (DENV) replication measured by qRT-PCR showed a reduction of 100% for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and 80% for DENV-4 at day 2 of exposure. In the in vivo AG129 mouse model, a lower weight reduction, 30% lower viral load and 12% higher platelet in the extract group compared to the control was observed at day 6. The extract of E. longifolia has potential anti-dengue properties with improving trends in platelet counts. E. longifolia supplementation is potentially a two-pronged approach in treating dengue fever. ? 2019, Malaysian Society for Parasitology. All rights reserved.",""
"Responsiveness to change of the Malay-ECOHIS following treatment of early childhood caries under general anaesthesia",2019,"Objectives: To evaluate the sensitivity and responsiveness of the Malay version of Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (Malay-ECOHIS) to dental treatment of early childhood caries (ECC) under general anaesthesia (GA) and determine the minimally important difference (MID) for the Malay-ECOHIS. Methods: A sample of 158 preschool children with ECC awaiting dental treatment under GA was recruited over an 8-month period. Parents self-completed the Malay-ECOHIS before and 4?weeks after their child's dental treatment. At 4?weeks follow-up, parents also responded to a global health transition judgement item. Data were analysed using independent and paired samples t tests, ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: The response rate was 87.3%. The final sample comprised 76 male (55.1%) and 62 female (44.9%) preschool children with mean age of 4.5 (SD?=?1.0) years. Following treatment, there were significant reductions in mean scores for total Malay-ECOHIS, child impact section (CIS), family impact section (FIS) and all domains, respectively (P?<?0.001). The effect size (ES) for the Malay-ECOHIS was +1.0; across the domains, it ranged from +0.4 to +1.9. There was a weak, positive correlation for Malay-ECOHIS change scores (r?=?0.165) and CIS change scores (r?=?0.175) with the number of decayed teeth (dt), respectively. Similar correlation was also observed between Malay-ECOHIS change scores and the number of extracted teeth (r?=?0.129). Based on the global health transition judgement, 62.3% of parents reported their child's oral condition to be “a little improved” while 37.7% reported it to be “much improved” following treatment, with Malay-ECOHIS mean change scores of 6.7 (ES?=?+1.1) and 9.6 (ES?=?+1.2), respectively. There was an observed gradient in the Malay-ECOHIS change scores and ES in relation to parents’ perception of their child's oral health improvement after treatment, supporting the responsiveness of the measure. The Malay-ECOHIS MID was found to be 7 scale points. Conclusion: The Malay-ECOHIS is empirically shown to be sensitive and responsiveness to dental treatment of ECC under GA. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Systematic scoping review protocol of methodologies of chronic respiratory disease surveys in low/middle-income countries",2019,"This protocol describes a systematic scoping review of chronic respiratory disease surveys in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) undertaken as part of the Four Country ChrOnic Respiratory Disease (4CCORD) study within the National Institute for Health Research Global Health Research Unit on Respiratory Health (RESPIRE). Understanding the prevalence and burden of chronic respiratory disease (CRD) underpins healthcare planning. We will systematically scope the literature to identify existing strategies (definitions/questionnaires/diagnostics/outcomes) used in surveys of CRDs in adults in low-resource settings. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI WoS, Global Health and WHO Global Health Library [search terms: prevalence AND CRD (COPD, asthma) AND LMICs, from 1995], and two reviewers will independently extract data from selected studies onto a piloted customised data extraction form. We will convene a workshop of the multidisciplinary 4CCORD research team with representatives from the RESPIRE partners (Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Edinburgh) at which the findings of the scoping review will be presented, discussed and interpreted. The findings will inform a future RESPIRE 4CCORD study, which will estimate CRD burden in adults in Asian LMICs. ? 2019, The Author(s).","asthma; chronic respiratory tract disease; global health; health care; health care policy; human; low income country; middle income country; Review; risk factor; systematic review"
"Energy use analysis of the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system versus the multi - split unit using TRNSYS",2020,"The usage of air - conditioning in the residential and commercial buildings is becoming necessary because of the enormous demand for thermal comfort and healthy indoor environment. In achieving human thermal comfort and healthy indoor environment in a large building, there are many types of air conditioning systems that can be used, including the multi - split type unit and the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system. The present research analyses the annual energy use of the existing ACMV system (multi - split type ceiling cassette unit) installed in the examined building, which located in the tropical area and compares it with a VRF system. The TRNSYS software is used to simulate both of these systems in accordance with the existing building’s characteristics and its operation. The existing building’s characteristics and its operation are obtained by conducting the site survey and field measurements in the building. In the current paper, the bin method is used to estimate the annual energy consumption for these systems. Based on the simulation results, the existing ACMV system consumes more energy in comparison to the VRF system by 13.62%. In addition, the annual operating cost of these systems has shown that the VRF system has a lower annual operating cost in comparison to the existing ACMV system by 13.63%. Besides that, the VRF system can accommodate an estimated payback period of around 6.6?years and an internal rate of return of 12.75%. The result has suggested that the VRF system has a great potential in energy savings and could reduce the electricity consumption in a large building significantly. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air conditioning; Earnings; Energy conservation; Investments; Office buildings; Operating costs; Refrigerants; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Annual energy consumption; Annual operating costs; Commercial building; Electricity-consumption; Field measurement; Healthy indoor environments; Human thermal comfort; Internal rate of return; Energy utilization"
"Low Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) rates in public hospitals in Malaysia: The effect of stage and ethnicity",2019,"Introduction: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiation therapy is the procedure of choice for early-stage breast cancer. Survival and locoregional recurrence is non-inferior to mastectomy, with superior cosmetic and psycho-social outcomes. Differing health systems have demonstrated a wide variation in the rate of BCS. Little is known about the rate of BCS and factors influencing its practice in middle resource countries. This study aims to examine the BCS rates in Malaysia and to identify factors influencing its uptake. Methodology: This is a multi-centre, cross-sectional study involving the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Queen Elizabeth II Hospital (QEH), and Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital (TARH). Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from January 2014 to December 2015 were included, excluding stromal cancers and lymphomas. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors influencing BCS. Results: A total of 1005 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in the allocated time frame. Excluding incomplete records and those who did not have surgery, 730 patients were analysed. Overall BCS rate was 32.9%. The BCS rate was highest at QEH (54.1%), followed by UMMC (29.5%), and TARH (17.4%). 16.9% had BCS after neoadjuvant therapy. Factors influencing BCS uptake included age, ethnic group, breast-surgeon led services, AJCC Stage, tumour size, HER-2 expression, and tumour grade. Conclusions: The rate of BCS in Malaysia is low. A wide variation of rate exists among the studied hospitals. Younger age, earlier AJCC stage, and the presence of a Breast sub-specialist surgeon, would make it more likely that the patient has her breast conserved. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer staging; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; ethnicity; gene expression; groups by age; health service; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; multicenter study; observational study; oncogene neu; partial mastectomy; priority journal; public hospital; retrospective study; surgeon; tumor volume; university hospital; breast tumor; clinical trial; ethnic group; ethnology; female; health care delivery; middle aged; multivariate analysis; partial mastectomy; pathology; public hospital; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Malaysia; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Staging"
"Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer in the Asia Pacific region: ‘real-world’ consideration of results from the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017",2019,"Objective: The Asia Pacific Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APAC APCCC 2018) brought together 20 experts from 15 APAC countries to discuss the real-world application of consensus statements from the second APCCC held in St Gallen in 2017 (APCCC 2017). Findings: Differences in genetics, environment, lifestyle, diet and culture are all likely to influence the management of advanced prostate cancer in the APAC region when compared with the rest of the world. When considering the strong APCCC 2017 recommendation for the use of upfront docetaxel in metastatic castration-na?ve prostate cancer, the panel noted possible increased toxicity in Asian men receiving docetaxel, which would affect this recommendation in the APAC region. Although androgen receptor-targeting agents appear to be well tolerated in Asian men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, access to these drugs is very limited for financial reasons across the region. The meeting highlighted that cost and access to contemporary treatments and technologies are key factors influencing therapeutic decision-making in the APAC region. Whilst lower cost/older treatments and technologies may be an option, issues of culture and patient or physician preference mean, these may not always be acceptable. Although generic products can reduce cost in some countries, costs may still be prohibitive for lower-income patients or communities. The panellists noted the opportunity for a coordinated approach across the APAC region to address issues of access and cost. Developments in technologies and treatments are presenting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Differences in genetics and epidemiology affect the side-effect profiles of some drugs and influence prescribing. Conclusions: As the field continues to evolve, collaboration across the APAC region will be important to facilitate relevant research and collection and appraisal of data relevant to APAC populations. In the meantime, the APAC APCCC 2018 meeting highlighted the critical importance of a multidisciplinary team-based approach to treatment planning and care, delivery of best-practice care by clinicians with appropriate expertise, and the importance of patient information and support for informed patient choice. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International ? 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","abiraterone; androgen receptor; docetaxel; enzalutamide; generic drug; platinum complex; prednisone; prescription drug; abiraterone; androstane derivative; antiandrogen; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; advanced cancer; Asia; Asia Pacific region; cancer radiotherapy; cancer research; cancer therapy; castration resistant prostate cancer; clinical practice; consensus; cultural anthropology; diet; drug targeting; environment; financial deficit; genetics; health care access; health care cost; health care delivery; health care quality; human; lifestyle; medical decision making; medical expert; metastasis; patient information; patient preference; physician attitude; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; Review; treatment planning; consensus development; developing country; economics; Far East; lymph node dissection; male; metastasis; multimodality cancer therapy; Pacific islands; pathology; prostate tumor; radiotherapy; risk factor; Southeast Asia; supply and distribution; Androgen Antagonists; Androstenes; Antineoplastic Agents; Asia, Southeastern; Combined Modality Therapy; Consensus; Developing Countries; Docetaxel; Far East; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Male; Neoplasm Metastasis; Oceania; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy; Risk Factors"
"A comprehensive study on antidiabetic and antibacterial activities of ZnO nanoparticles biosynthesized using Silybum marianum L seed extract",2019,"Green synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) using the plants’ extract and their potential application have driven a tremendous interest in recent years. This study reports a green microwave-assisted method for synthesis of ZnO NPs using Silybum marianum L. seed extract. Characteristics of the as-prepared sample was explored in terms of crystalline phase, morphology, composition, surface area, optical, and thermal properties. The particles of the biosynthesized sample (ZnO/extract) had smaller sizes than the chemically produced one (ZnO). The existence of biomolecules from Silybum marianum L seed extract linked to the ZnO/extract sample was approved by various analyses. The ZnO/extract sample was used for treating alloxan-induced diabetic rats and its efficiency was compared with ZnO, extract, and insulin treatments. For this purpose, the levels of blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, total triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein were measured before and after treating with the studied treatment agents and compared with each other. Moreover, the antibacterial activities of both ZnO samples were investigated against E. coli to assess their potential antibacterial application. From the results, ZnO/extract NPs represented an outstanding performance in overcoming the diabetic disorders and good antibacterial activity against the studied bacteria. ? 2018","Escherichia coli; Extraction; II-VI semiconductors; Insulin; Medical nanotechnology; Metal nanoparticles; Plants (botany); Synthesis (chemical); Zinc oxide; Anti-bacterial activity; Diabetes mellitus; Gram-negative bacteria; Green synthesis; High density lipoprotein; Lipid profile; Microwave-assisted methods; Total cholesterols; ZnO nanoparticles; antidiabetic agent; antiinfective agent; metal nanoparticle; plant extract; zinc oxide; animal; chemistry; drug effect; Escherichia coli; experimental diabetes mellitus; green chemistry; infrared spectroscopy; male; metabolism; plant seed; scanning electron microscopy; Silybum marianum; synthesis; thermogravimetry; Wistar rat; X ray diffraction; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Escherichia coli; Green Chemistry Technology; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Metal Nanoparticles; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Milk Thistle; Plant Extracts; Rats, Wistar; Seeds; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Thermogravimetry; X-Ray Diffraction; Zinc Oxide"
"Breast Cancer Multi-classification through Deep Neural Network and Hierarchical Classification Approach",2019,"Breast cancer (BC) is the third leading cause of deaths in women globally. In general, histopathology images are recommended for early diagnosis and detailed analysis for BC. Thus, state-of-the-art classification models are required for the early prediction of BC using histopathology images. This study aims to develop an accurate and computationally feasible classification model named Biopsy Microscopic Image Cancer Network (BMIC_Net) to classify BC into eight distinct subtypes through deep learning (DL) and hierarchical classification approach. For experiments, the publicly available dataset BreakHis is used and splitted into training and testing set. Furthermore, data augmentation was performed on training set only and 4096 result-oriented features were extracted through DL. In order to improve the classification performance, feature reduction schemes were experimented to elicit the most discriminative feature subset. Finally, six machine-learning algorithms were analyzed to acquire the best results. The experimental results revealed that BMIC_Net outperformed existing baseline models by obtaining the highest accuracy of 95.48% for first-level classifier and 94.62% and 92.45% for second-level classifiers. Thus, this model can be deployed on a normal desktop machine in any healthcare center of less privileged areas in under-developing countries to serve as second opinion for breast cancer classification. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Statistical tests; Breast Cancer; Convolutional neural network; Hierarchical classification; Histopathology Images; Transfer learning; Image classification"
"The 2017 m balasegaram memorial lecture: The changing landscape of liver diseases in malaysia—60 years on!",2019,"The landscape of liver diseases in Malaysia has changed dramatically since the time of Professor Balasegaram Manickavasagar—an eminent surgeon in the 1960s. The most significant discoveries in hepatology have been that of hepatitis B virus in 1963 and hepatitis C virus in 1989, which have both been shown to be predominantly blood borne diseases. Hepatitis B and C infections result in long term carrier state and a high propensity to develop liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis B is the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer in Malaysia. Blood bank screening and public health preventive measures have reduced the disease burden significantly and an effective vaccination for hepatitis B is now incorporated in our National Immunisation Programme. Although no vaccine is available for hepatitis C, highly effective eradication therapies were introduced in 2011. These agents will significantly change the disease scenario across the world. A “new” disease was described in 1980, by Ludwig et al.—non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) disease. With the global epidemic of obesity and diabetes mellitus, NAFLD is set to increase exponentially across the world including in Malaysia. It will be the most important liver disease in the future, replacing hepatitis B and C infections. ?

"Associations between psychological factors and accelerometer-measured physical activity in urban Asian adults",2019,"Objectives: Examine the association between psychological variables and accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in urban Asians. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Singapore. Participants wore an accelerometer for 7?days to measure physical activity (PA). Demographic, anthropometric and psychological data were also collected. Psychological variables included PA guideline knowledge, motivational profile for PA self-regulation (5 subscales), perceived barriers to PA (4 subscales) and perceived social support for PA. Regression models with adjustment for socio-demographic variables were fitted. Results: External regulation (b = ? 13.03, 95% CI ? 34.55; ? 1.50) and perceived daily life barriers (b = ? 12.63, 95% CI ? 24.95; ? 0.32) were significantly associated with fewer weekly MVPA minutes. A significant interaction between perceived social support and age (p = 0.046) was found. Social support was significantly negative associated with MVPA minutes in younger (< 28?years), but not in older participants. Conclusions: Considering levels of self-determination to engage in PA and perceived daily life barriers may be important for planning PA interventions in urban Asian populations. Caution is required when promoting social support for PA as it was associated with lower MVPA in younger people. ? 2019, Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+).","accelerometry; adolescent; adult; aged; anthropometry; Asian continental ancestry group; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; human; male; middle aged; motivation; physiology; psychology; questionnaire; social support; statistics and numerical data; urban population; very elderly; young adult; Accelerometry; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthropometry; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Young Adult"

"Improvement of physicochemical properties of nanocolloidal carrier loaded with low water solubility drug for parenteral cancer treatment by Response Surface Methodology",2019,"Nanoemulsions have been used as a drug carrier system, particularly for poorly water-soluble drugs. Sorafenib is a poorly soluble drug and also there is no parenteral treatment. The aim of this study is the development of nanoemulsions for intravenous administration of Sorafenib. The formulations were prepared by high energy emulsification method and optimized by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Here, the effect of independent composition variables of lecithin (1.16–2.84%, w/w), Medium-Chain Triglycerides (2.32–5.68%, w/w) and polysorbate 80 (0.58–1.42%, w/w) amounts on the properties of Sorafenib-loaded nanoemulsion was investigated. The three responses variables were particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index. Optimization of the conditions according to the three dependent variables was performed for the preparation of the Sorafenib-loaded nanoemulsions with the minimum value of particle size, suitable rage of zeta potential, and polydispersity index. A formulation containing 0.05% of Sorafenib kept its properties in a satisfactory range over the evaluated period. The composition with 3% Medium-Chain Triglycerides, 2.5% lecithin and 1.22% polysorbate 80 exhibited the smallest particle size and polydispersity index (43.17 nm and 0.22, respectively) with the zeta potential of ?38.8 mV was the optimized composition. The fabricated nanoemulsion was characterized by the transmission electron microscope (TEM), viscosity, and stability assessment study. Also, the cytotoxicity result showed that the optimum formulations had no significant effect on a normal cell in a low concentration of the drug but could eliminate the cancer cells. The dose-dependent toxicity made it a suitable candidate for parenteral applications in the treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, the optimized formulation indicated good storage stability for 3 months at different temperatures (4 ± 2 °C, 25 ± 2 °C and 45 ± 2 °C). ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chains; Diseases; Emulsification; Lecithin; Particle size; Surface properties; System stability; Transmission electron microscopy; Vegetable oils; Volcanic rocks; Zeta potential; Anti-cancer; Nanoemulsion; Parenteral delivery; Response surface methodology; Sorafenib; Drug delivery; antineoplastic agent; drug carrier; nanoparticle; oil; sorafenib; water; analysis of variance; animal; cell survival; chemical phenomena; chemistry; colloid; drug stability; Hep-G2 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; medicinal chemistry; mouse; neoplasm; NIH 3T3 cell line; parenteral drug administration; solubility; ultrastructure; viscosity; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Survival; Chemical Phenomena; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Colloids; Drug Carriers; Drug Stability; Hep G2 Cells; HT29 Cells; Humans; Infusions, Parenteral; Mice; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; NIH 3T3 Cells; Oils; Solubility; Sorafenib; Viscosity; Water"
"Liraglutide in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes",2019,"BACKGROUND Metformin is the regulatory-approved treatment of choice for most youth with type 2 diabetes early in the disease. However, early loss of glycemic control has been observed with metformin monotherapy. Whether liraglutide added to metformin (with or without basal insulin treatment) is safe and effective in youth with type 2 diabetes is unknown. METHODS Patients who were 10 to less than 17 years of age were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous liraglutide (up to 1.8 mg per day) or placebo for a 26-week double-blind period, followed by a 26-week open-label extension period. Inclusion criteria were a body-mass index greater than the 85th percentile and a glycated hemoglobin level between 7.0 and 11.0% if the patients were being treated with diet and exercise alone or between 6.5 and 11.0% if they were being treated with metformin (with or without insulin). All the patients received metformin during the trial. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level after 26 weeks. Secondary end points included the change in fasting plasma glucose level. Safety was assessed throughout the course of the trial. RESULTS Of 135 patients who underwent randomization, 134 received at least one dose of liraglutide (66 patients) or placebo (68 patients). Demographic characteristics were similar in the two groups (mean age, 14.6 years). At the 26-week analysis of the primary efficacy end point, the mean glycated hemoglobin level had decreased by 0.64 percentage points with liraglutide and increased by 0.42 percentage points with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of-1.06 percentage points (P<0.001); the difference increased to-1.30 percentage points by 52 weeks. The fasting plasma glucose level had decreased at both time points in the liraglutide group but had increased in the placebo group. The number of patients who reported adverse events was similar in the two groups (56 [84.8%] with liraglutide and 55 [80.9%] with placebo), but the overall rates of adverse events and gastrointestinal adverse events were higher with liraglutide. CONCLUSIONS In children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, liraglutide, at a dose of up to 1.8 mg per day (added to metformin, with or without basal insulin), was efficacious in improving glycemic control over 52 weeks. This efficacy came at the cost of an increased frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events.

"Synergistic Growth Inhibition by Afatinib and Trametinib in Preclinical Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Models",2019,"Background: Given that aberrant activation of epidermal growth factor receptor family receptors (ErbB) is a common event in oral squamous cell carcinoma, and that high expression of these receptor proteins is often associated with poor prognosis, this rationalizes the approach of targeting ErbB signaling pathways to improve the survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, monotherapy with the ErbB blocker afatinib has shown limited survival benefits. Objectives: This study was performed to identify mechanisms of afatinib resistance and to explore potential afatinib-based combination treatments with other targeted inhibitors in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: We determined the anti-proliferative effects of afatinib on a panel of oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines using a crystal violet-growth inhibition assay, click-iT 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine staining, and cell-cycle analysis. Biochemical assays were performed to study the underlying mechanism of drug treatment as a single agent or in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. We further evaluated and compared the anti-tumor effects of single agent and combined treatment by using oral squamous cell carcinoma xenograft models. Results: In this study, we showed that afatinib inhibited oral squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation via cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Interestingly, we demonstrated reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway in vitro, which possibly reduced the effects of ErbB inhibition. Concomitant treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells with afatinib and trametinib synergized the anti-tumor effects in oral squamous cell carcinoma-bearing mouse models. Conclusions: Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance to afatinib and support further clinical evaluation into the combination of afatinib and MEK inhibition in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","afatinib; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein kinase B; trametinib; afatinib; antineoplastic agent; pyridone derivative; pyrimidinone derivative; trametinib; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer model; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; female; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; mouse; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; animal; apoptosis; cell cycle; drug potentiation; drug screening; metabolism; mouth tumor; nonobese diabetic mouse; pathology; SCID mouse; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell culture; Afatinib; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Drug Synergism; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Mouth Neoplasms; Pyridones; Pyrimidinones; Signal Transduction; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Characteristics and outcome of primary sclerosing cholangitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease in Asian children",2019,"Background: Current knowledge on the clinical features and natural history of childhood primary sclerosing cholangitis – inflammatory bowel disease in Asia is limited. We described the presenting features and natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease seen in a cohort of Southeast Asian children. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of childhood primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease from three tertiary centers in Singapore and Malaysia. Results: Of 24 patients (boys, 58%; median age at diagnosis: 6.3 years) with primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, n = 21; Crohn's disease, n = 1; undifferentiated, n = 2), 63% (n = 15) were diagnosed during follow-up for colitis, and 21% (n = 5) presented with acute or chronic hepatitis, 17% (n = 4) presented simultaneously. Disease phenotype of liver involvement showed 79% had sclerosing cholangitis-autoimmune hepatitis overlap, 54% large duct disease, and 46% small duct disease. All patients received immunosuppression therapy. At final review after a median [±S.D.] duration follow-up of 4.7 [±3.8] years, 12.5% patients had normal liver enzymes, 75% persistent disease, and 12.5% liver failure. The proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis increased from 13% at diagnosis to 29%; 21% had portal hypertension, and 17% had liver dysfunction. One patient required liver transplant. Transplant-free survival was 95%. For colitis, 95% had pancolitis, 27% rectal sparing, and 11% backwash ileitis at initial presentation. At final review, 67% patients had quiescent bowel disease with immunosuppression. One patient who had UC with pancolitis which was diagnosed at 3 years old developed colorectal cancer at 22 years of age. All patients survived. Conclusions: Liver disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease in Asian children has variable severity.

"The effectiveness of a structured nursing intervention program on maternal stress and ability among mothers of premature infants in a neonatal intensive care unit",2019,"Aims and objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of a structured nursing intervention program on maternal stress and NICU-related maternal ability after the admission of premature infants to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Background: Mothers of premature infants may face stress having premature infants, and their infants may be admitted to the NICU for a few weeks or months. The mothers’ experience of stress would be worse if they have low knowledge and poor NICU-related maternal ability. Mothers of infants admitted to the NICU require well-planned interventions to cope with psychological matters arising after an infant hospitalisation. Design: Quasi-experimental design. Methods: A total of 216 mothers were consecutively assigned to control and intervention groups. Each group consisted of 108 mothers. The mothers in both groups received questionnaire concerning maternal stress and NICU-related ability during their first visit to NICU (within 48?hr of admission). A structured nursing intervention was implemented for 10?days on mothers in the intervention group. The control group continued to receive existing practice nursing care. Mothers of both groups were again given the questionnaire on maternal stress and NICU-related ability after 14?days of admission. Results: In the intervention group, the difference between the mean total score of maternal stress and parental role and relationship subscale decreased significantly, compared to the control group (p?=?0.04; p?=?0.01) respectively. Maternal ability improved significantly in mothers in the intervention group 2?weeks postintervention, p?<?0.001. Conclusion: A structured nursing intervention for mothers could significantly reduce maternal stress and promote maternal NICU-related abilities. Relevance to clinical practice: The results of the study could help neonatal nurses to develop an appropriate nursing intervention for parents with premature infants in the NICU. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; attitude to health; case control study; controlled clinical trial (topic); female; gestational age; human; infant; male; mental stress; mother; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; nursing; prematurity; prevention and control; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gestational Age; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Male; Mothers; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Polyethylene glycol-coated porous magnetic nanoparticles for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics under magnetic hyperthermia condition",2019,"Purpose: Although magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) are promising agents for hyperthermia therapy, insufficient drug encapsulation efficacies inhibit their application as nanocarriers in the targeted drug delivery systems. In this study, porous magnetite nanoparticles (PMNPs) were synthesized and coated with a thermosensitive polymeric shell to obtain a synergistic effect of hyperthermia and chemotherapy. Materials and methods: PMNPs were produced using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide template and then coated by a polyethylene glycol layer with molecular weight of 1500 Da (PEG1500) and phase transition temperature of 48 ± 2 °C to endow a thermosensitive behavior. The profile of drug release from the nanostructure was studied at various hyperthermia conditions generated by waterbath, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), and alternating magnetic field (AMF). The in vitro cytotoxicity and hyperthermia efficacy of the doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (DOX-PEG1500-PMNPs) were assessed using human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. Results: Heat treatment of DOX-PEG1500-PMNPs containing 235 ± 26 mg·g?1 DOX at 48 °C by waterbath, MRgFUS, and AMF, respectively led to 71 ± 4%, 48 ± 3%, and 74 ± 5% drug release. Hyperthermia treatment of the A549 cells using DOX-PEG1500-PMNPs led to 77% decrease in the cell viability due to the synergistic effects of magnetic hyperthermia and chemotherapy. Conclusion: The large pores generated in the PMNPs structure could provide a sufficient space for encapsulation of the chemotherapeutics as well as fast drug encapsulation and release kinetics, which together with thermosensitive characteristics of the PEG1500 shell, make DOX-PEG1500-PMNPs promising adjuvants to the magnetic hyperthermia modality. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Graphene oxide and gold nanoparticle based dual platform with short DNA probe for the PCR free DNA biosensing using surface-enhanced Raman scattering",2019,"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based DNA biosensors have considered as excellent, fast and ultrasensitive sensing technique which relies on the fingerprinting ability to produce molecule specific distinct spectra. Unlike conventional fluorescence based strategies SERS provides narrow spectral bandwidths, fluorescence quenching and multiplexing ability, and fitting attribute with short length probe DNA sequences. Herein, we report a novel and PCR free SERS based DNA detection strategy involving dual platforms and short DNA probes for the detection of endangered species, Malayan box turtle (MBT) (Cuora amboinensis). In this biosensing feature, the detection is based on the covalent linking of the two platforms involving graphene oxide-gold nanoparticles (GO-AuNPs) functionalized with capture probe 1 and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with capture probe 2 and Raman dye (Cy3) via hybridization with the corresponding target sequences. Coupling of the two platforms generates locally enhanced electromagnetic field ‘hot spot’, formed at the junctions and interstitial crevices of the nanostructures and consequently provide significant amplification of the SERS signal. Therefore, employing the two SERS active substrates and short-length probe DNA sequences, we have managed to improve the sensitivity of the biosensors to achieve a lowest limit of detection (LOD) as low as 10 fM. Furthermore, the fabricated biosensor exhibited sensitivity even for single nucleotide base-mismatch in the target DNA as well as showed excellent performance to discriminate closely related six non-target DNA sequences. Although the developed SERS biosensor would be an attractive platform for the authentication of MBT from diverse samples including forensic and/or archaeological specimens, it could have universal application for detecting gene specific biomarkers for many diseases including cancer. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biosensors; Conservation; DNA; Electromagnetic fields; Fiber optic sensors; Fluorescence; Gold nanoparticles; Graphene oxide; Metal nanoparticles; Polymerase chain reaction; Quenching; Raman scattering; Substrates; Surface scattering; DNA biosensors; DNA Probe; Malayan box turtle; Sensing techniques; SERS-active substrates; Spectral bandwidth; Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Universal application; DNA sequences; gold nanoparticle; graphene oxide; DNA; gold; graphene oxide; graphite; metal nanoparticle; nanomaterial; Article; base mispairing; controlled study; Cuora amboinensis; DNA hybridization; DNA modification; DNA probe; DNA sequence; electromagnetism; gene amplification; gene targeting; genetic linkage; genetic procedures; limit of detection; nanofabrication; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; turtle; chemistry; DNA probe; isolation and purification; Raman spectrometry; Biosensing Techniques; DNA; DNA Probes; Gold; Graphite; Limit of Detection; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Spectrum Analysis, Raman"

"Does abuse in late life worsen sleep quality? A two-year prospective cohort study among rural older adults",2019,"Background: Elder abuse and neglect (EAN) is a growing public health problem, and numerous adverse health effects of abuse in late life have been documented. Little is known, however, about the impact of elder abuse on sleep quality. This study examines the longitudinal relationship between EAN and sleep quality. Methods: This was a 2-year prospective cohort study involving 1927 older adults in a rural Malaysian district, Kuala Pilah. A multi-stage cluster sampling strategy was employed. After 2?years, 1189 respondents were re-assessed. EAN was determined using the modified Conflict Tactic Scale, while sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: The prevalence of elder abuse was 8.1% (95% CI:6.9,9.3). Longitudinal analysis using generalized estimating equations showed that elder abuse contributed to higher PSQI scores (B:0.49, 95% CI:0.17,0.58). Sub-analyses demonstrated that psychological abuse and neglect had significant longitudinal relationships with increase of PSQI scores, while other subtypes did not. Conclusion: Abuse in late life, particularly psychological abuse and neglect, result in greater PSQI scores. Even though this may imply decline in sleep quality, our findings were not considered clinically significant as they did not exceed the clinical cut-off score of five. Nevertheless, sleep quality is an important determinant of health and a predictor of mortality among older adults; thus, understanding its relationship with abuse is useful to health care providers and policy-makers in improving health services and upgrading preventive measures. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","abuse; adult; aged; Article; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; Conflict Tactic Scale; controlled study; elder abuse; female; health care personnel; health care policy; health service; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle aged; mortality; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; prediction; prevalence; prevention; prospective study; psychological abuse; rating scale; rural area; sleep quality; very elderly; elder abuse; epidemiology; insomnia; physiology; psychology; rural population; sleep; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Elder Abuse; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Rural Population; Sleep; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"
"Ultrastructural aspects of sylvatic dengue virus infection in vero cell",2019,"Introduction: Dengue virus (DENV), the causative agent of dengue disease exists in sylvatic and endemic ecotypes. The cell morphological changes and viral morphogenesis of two dengue ecotypes were examined at the ultrastructural level to identify potential similarities and differences in the surrogate model of enzootic host. Materials and Methods: Vero cells were inoculated with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Cell cultures were harvested over a time course and processed for transmission electron microscopic imaging. Results: The filopodia protrusions on cell periphery preceded virus entry. Additionally, sylvatic DENV infection was found spreading slower than the endemic DENV. Morphogenesis of both dengue ecotypes was alike but at different level of efficiency in the permissive cells. Conclusions: This is the first ultrastructural study on sylvatic DENV and this comparative study revealed the similarities and differences of cellular responses and morphogenesis of two dengue ecotypes in vitro. The study revealed the weaker infectivity of sylvatic DENV in the surrogate model of enzootic host, which supposed to support better replication of enzootic DENV than endemic DENV. ? 2019, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

"Evaluation of organ doses following high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy of breast cancer: A Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation study",2019,"This study aimed to evaluate the absorbed doses received by the organs at risk (OARs) following Iridium-192 (192Ir) high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy of the left breast. The MIRD5 adult female anthropomorphic phantom, readily available in the Geant4 Monte Carlo package was used. However, the left breast was modified from 195 to 145 cm3, to represent a breast following lumpectomy. Left breast was chosen due to its higher cancer occurrence than the right breast. The HDR sources were constructed with an outer cylindrical dimension of 4.5 mm (length) × 0.9 mm (diameter). Various influencing parameters were studied, i.e. catheter arrangement (single versus dual plane), source inter-dwell distances (5 versus 10 mm), and different radionuclides, i.e. Cobalt-60 (60Co) and 192Ir, by delivering a total treatment dose of 32 Gy to the left breast. Absorbed doses to the OARs (e.g. left lung, heart, right breast, spleen, etc.) were then evaluated. A maximum left lung dose of 1.5 Gy was recorded, while doses to the other OARs were all below 1 Gy. The treatment using dual plane catheter arrangement contributed to a slightly higher dose to the OARs, despite equal dose to the breast. There was no dose difference between different inter-dwell distances used in this study. 60Co resulted in a slightly higher left lung dose than that of 192Ir, while the results were the opposite for the other OARs. HDR brachytherapy allows high dose to be delivered to the breast within a short period of time, with minimal absorbed doses to the OARs. ?

"Sofosbuvir–velpatasvir for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in Asia: a single-arm, open-label, phase 3 trial",2019,"Background: Treatment with combined sofosbuvir and velpatasvir has resulted in high sustained virological response rates in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) with genotypes 1–6 in clinical trials and real-world settings, but its efficacy and safety has not been assessed in Asia, a region with diverse HCV genotypes. Methods: In this single-arm, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 38 sites across China, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia, who were chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1–6, and were HCV treatment-naive or treatment-experienced, either without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. Patients self-administered a combined sofosbuvir (400 mg) and velpatasvir (100 mg) tablet once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virological response, defined as HCV RNA less than 15 IU/mL at 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12), assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The primary safety endpoint was the proportion of adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02671500, and is completed. Findings: Between April 14, 2016, and June 30, 2017, 375 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 374 completed the full treatment course and one discontinued treatment. Overall, 362 (97% [95% CI 94–98]) of 375 patients achieved SVR12. Among 42 patients with HCV genotype 3b, all of whom had baseline resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A, 25 (89% [95% CI 72–98]) of 28 patients without cirrhosis and seven (50% [23–77]) of 14 patients with cirrhosis achieved SVR12. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection (36 [10%] patients) and headache (18 [5%] patients). There were no discontinuations due to adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported in three (1%) patients, none of which was judged to be related to sofosbuvir–velpatasvir treatment. Interpretation: Consistent with data from other phase 3 studies, single-tablet sofosbuvir–velpatasvir for 12 weeks is an efficacious and safe treatment for Asian patients with chronic HCV infection, but might have lower efficacy in those infected with HCV genotype 3b and with cirrhosis.

"Cardiovascular disease-related mortality and factors associated with cardiovascular events in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD)",2019,"Objectives: With aging of the HIV-positive population, cardiovascular disease (CVD) increasingly contributes to morbidity and mortality. We investigated CVD-related and other causes of death (CODs) and factors associated with CVD in a multi-country Asian HIV-positive cohort. Methods: Patient data from 2003–2017 were obtained from the Therapeutics, Research, Education and AIDS Training in Asia (TREAT Asia) HIV Observational Database (TAHOD). We included patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with > 1 day of follow-up. Cumulative incidences were plotted for CVD-related, AIDS-related, non-AIDS-related, and unknown CODs, and any CVD (i.e. fatal and nonfatal). Competing risk regression was used to assess risk factors of any CVD. Results: Of 8069 patients with a median follow-up of 7.3 years [interquartile range (IQR) 4.4–10.7 years], 378 patients died [incidence rate (IR) 6.2 per 1000 person-years (PY)], and this total included 22 CVD-related deaths (IR 0.36 per 1000 PY). Factors significantly associated with any CVD event (IR 2.2 per 1000 PY) were older age [sub-hazard ratio (sHR) 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36–3.58 for age 41–50 years; sHR 5.52; 95% CI 3.43–8.91 for ? 51 years, compared with < 40 years], high blood pressure (sHR 1.62; 95% CI 1.04–2.52), high total cholesterol (sHR 1.89; 95% CI 1.27–2.82), high triglycerides (sHR 1.55; 95% CI 1.02–2.37) and high body mass index (BMI) (sHR 1.66; 95% CI 1.12–2.46). CVD crude IRs were lower in the later ART initiation period and in lower middle- and upper middle-income countries. Conclusions: The development of fatal and nonfatal CVD events in our cohort was associated with older age, and treatable risk factors such as high blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol and BMI. Lower CVD event rates in middle-income countries may indicate under-diagnosis of CVD in Asian-Pacific resource-limited settings. ? 2019 British HIV Association","antiretrovirus agent; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; accident; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; aging; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Asian; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cause of death; CD4 lymphocyte count; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; drug overdose; female; follow up; groups by age; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertension; incidence; infection; liver disease; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle income country; obesity; outcome assessment; priority journal; risk assessment; suicide; violence; virus load"
"DIFFERENTIALS in SEXUAL and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH KNOWLEDGE among EAST MALAYSIAN ADOLESCENTS",2019,"The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of East Malaysian adolescents on sexual and reproductive health issues. Data were collected in March-July 2015 from 2858 adolescents aged 13-18 years from selected East Malaysian secondary schools using a self-administered questionnaire. Twelve items relating to sexual and reproductive health were used to measure respondents' knowledge based on their responses 'True', 'False' or 'Don't know', with the proportion of correct answers being the variable of interest. Cronbach's alpha for the twelve items was 0.761 and the mean knowledge score was 6.8. While the majority of the respondents knew that a woman can get pregnant if she has sex with a man and that HIV and AIDS can be transmitted through sexual intercourse, knowledge about Malaysia's abortion laws, that a woman can get pregnant if she has sex only once and that people with sexually transmitted infections may look healthy was poor. Older respondents and those from urban schools reported significantly higher knowledge than younger respondents and those from rural schools, respectively. More emphasis should be given in schools to the specific topics for which low levels of sexual and reproductive health knowledge were found, with greater attention being given to younger adolescents and those in rural areas. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.",""
"Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy Among Incarcerated Persons with HIV: Associations with Methadone and Perceived Safety",2019,"With adequate support, people with HIV (PWH) may achieve high levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) during incarceration. We examined factors associated with ART utilization and adherence among incarcerated PWH (N = 150) in Indonesia. ART utilization was positively associated with HIV status disclosure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.5, 95% CI 1.2–24.1, p = 0.023), drug dependency (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.2–12.6, p = 0.022), health service satisfaction (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.7–6.2, p < 0.001), and perceived need for medical treatment (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.011), and negatively associated with chance locus of control (aOR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.7, p = 0.013). Most participants utilizing ART (74.5%) reported less than “perfect” ART adherence. ART adherence was independently associated with perceived personal safety (β = 0.21, 95% CI 0.01–0.40, p = 0.032) and methadone utilization (β = 0.84, 95% CI 0.10–1.67, p = 0.047). PWH receiving methadone had a sixfold higher adjusted odds of being highly-adherent to ART (aOR = 6.3, 95% CI 1.1–35.7, p = 0.036).

"Stress and anxiety among mothers of premature infants in a Malaysian neonatal intensive care unit",2019,"Objective: This study aims to determine maternal stress and anxiety as perceived by mothers whose premature infants were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to identify maternal stress and its relationship with maternal and infant characteristics and anxiety. Background: Vulnerable premature infants commonly require special care in the NICUs. In most cases, prolonged hospitalization results in stress and anxiety for the mothers. Methods: A non-probability convenience survey was used in a public hospital, with 180 mothers completing the 26-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and a 40-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: 56.5% of mothers had high levels of stress, 85.5% of mothers had a high level of state-anxiety and 67.8% of mothers had a high level of trait-anxiety. The stress experienced by these mothers had a significant relationship with anxiety, and was found to be associated with state and trait anxiety levels, but not with maternal and infant characteristics. Conclusion: Mothers in this setting revealed high levels of stress and anxiety during their premature infants’ NICU admission. An immediate interventional programme focusing on relieving mothers’ anxiety and stress is needed to prevent maternal stress and anxiety at an early stage. ? 2018, ? 2018 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.","adult; anxiety; Apgar score; Article; child behavior; female; health care survey; hospitalization; human; Likert scale; major clinical study; Malaysia; maternal stress; neonatal intensive care unit; Perceived Stress Scale; prematurity; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; structured questionnaire; validation process"
