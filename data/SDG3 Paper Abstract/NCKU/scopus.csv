"TYRO3: A potential therapeutic target in cancer","2019","TYRO3 belongs to the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MER) receptor family, a unique subfamily of the receptor tyrosine kinases. Members of TAM family share the same ligand, growth arrest-specific 6, and protein S. Although the signal transduction pathways of TYRO3 have not been evaluated in detail, overexpression and activation of TYRO3 receptor tyrosine kinase have been reported to promote cell proliferation, survival, tumorigenesis, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or chemoresistance in several human cancers. Targeting TYRO3 could break the kinase signaling, stimulate antitumor immunity, reduce tumor cell survival, and regain drug sensitivity. To date, there is no specific TYRO3-targeted drug, the effectiveness of targeting TYRO3 in cancer is worthy of further investigations. In this review, we present an update on molecular biology of TYRO3, summarize the development of potential inhibitors of TAM family members, and provide new insights in TYRO3-targeted treatment. Impact statement: Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2016, 8.9 million people are estimated to have died from various forms of cancer. The current treatments, including surgery with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, are not effective enough to provide full protection from cancer, which highlights the need for developing novel therapy strategies. In this review, we summarize the molecular biology of a unique member of a subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinase, TYRO3 and discuss the new insights in TYRO3-targeted treatment for cancer therapy. ? 2019 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","3 methylhistidine; brefeldin A; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor; gonadorelin; growth arrest specific protein 6; ldc 1267; metformin; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; monensin; n [4 [(2 amino 3 chloro 4 pyridinyl)oxy] 3 fluorophenyl] 4 ethoxy 1 (4 fluorophenyl) 2(1h) oxonicotinamide; progranulin; protein p85; protein tyrosine kinase; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; quinazoline derivative; rhodamine 6G; sitravatinib; TAM inhibitor; TYRO3 receptor tyrosine kinase; unc 2250; unc 2881; unc 5; unclassified drug; vincristine; Akt signaling; allergic rhinitis; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell survival; drug sensitivity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene; gene overexpression; human; malignant neoplasm; metastasis; molecularly targeted therapy; neurologic disease; nonhuman; Pi3K/Akt signaling; protein motif; Review; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; thrombocyte aggregation; TYRO3 gene"
"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) enhances centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP) expression to promote hepatocarcinogenesis","2019","Background: Our previous report suggested that centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP) is required for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) encoded non-structure protein X (HBx)-mediated nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-andkappa;B) activation. CPAP is overexpressed in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the interaction between CPAP and HBx in HBV-HCC remains unclear. Methods: The mRNA expression of CPAP and HBx was analyzed by quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR). NF-andkappa;B transcriptional activity and CPAP promoter activity were determined using a reporter assay in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and in situ proximal ligation assay (PLA) were performed to detect the interaction between CPAP and HBx. Chromatin-IP was used to detect the association of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and HBx with the CPAP promoter. Cell proliferation was measured using cell counting kit CCK-8, Bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2andprime;-deoxyuridine, BrdU) incorporation, and clonogenic assays. The tumorigenic effects of CPAP were determined using xenograft animal models. Results: HBx can transcriptionally up-regulate CPAP via interacting with CREB. Overexpressed CPAP directly interacted with HBx to promote HBx-mediated cell proliferation and migration; SUMO modification of CPAP was involved in interacting with HBx. Knocked-down expression of CPAP decreased the HBx-mediated tumorigenic effects, including cytokines secretion. Interestingly, overexpressed CPAP maintained the HBx protein stability in an NF-andkappa;B-dependent manner; and the expression levels of CPAP and HBx were positively correlated with the activation status of NF-andkappa;B in HCC. Increased expression of CPAP and CREB mRNAs existed in the high-risk group with a lower survival rate in HBV-HCC. Conclusion: The interaction between CPAP and HBx can provide a microenvironment to facilitate HCC development via enhancing NF-andkappa;B activation, inflammatory cytokine production, and cancer malignancies. This study not only sheds light on the role of CPAP in HBV-associated HCC, but also provides CPAP as a potential target for blocking the hyper-activated NF-andkappa;B in HCC. andcopy; 2019 The Author(s). ? 2019 BMC.

"Experience of applying cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for ovarian teratoma with malignant transformation and peritoneal dissemination","2019","Objectives: The prognosis of ovarian teratoma with malignant transformation and peritoneal dissemination (PD) is poor. This condition is rare but associated with a high recurrence rate even after aggressive debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. In the present paper, we describe our experience of using cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) for this condition. Methods: The data of ten female patients having ovarian teratoma with malignant transformation and PD between June 2007 and June 2017 were collected and reviewed retrospectively. CRS-HIPEC was performed according to the standard protocol. Patient characteristics, pathological reports, tumor markers, perioperative operative parameters, postoperative events, and disease status during the follow-up period were recorded. Results: The primary ovarian neoplasms were pure mature cystic teratoma with malignant transformation (n=6, including 5 of mucinous adenocarcinoma), mixed germ cell tumor with mature cystic teratoma and yolk sac tumor (YST) (n=1), pure immature teratoma (n=1), immature teratoma with growing teratoma syndrome (GTS) (n=1), and immature teratoma mixed YST with GTS (n=1). The mean levels of tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and CA125, were markedly elevated. The recurrence rate was 10%. The median and mean disease-free survival (DFS) after CRS-HIPEC were 22.3 and 36.2 months, respectively, and the 5-year DFS rate is 88%. Conclusion: CRS-HIPEC is a safe therapeutic option for reducing the recurrence rate in selected patients with PD originating from ovarian teratoma with malignant transformation. ? 2019 Yu et al.","CA 125 antigen; carcinoembryonic antigen; cisplatin; docetaxel; tumor antigen; adult; aged; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; clinical article; colloid carcinoma; controlled study; cytology; cytoreductive surgery; disease free survival; female; follow up; germ cell tumor; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy; immunohistochemistry; malignant transformation; middle aged; ovary teratoma; peritoneum metastasis; retrospective study; tumor invasion; yolk sac tumor; young adult"
"Scleritis and anterior uveitis may herald the development of an epibulbar tumor in patients with extranodal Rosai-Dorfman disease: A case report","2019","Background: Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Ocular involvement is even rarer, mostly involving the orbit and eyelids, although marginal corneal ulcers, uveitis, and epibulbar masses have also been reported, and is characterized by multiple recurrences. However, the disease course and optimal treatment strategies remain undetermined, in light of the rarity of this disease. Case presentation: We reported a 36-year-old male patient with the extranodal form of Rosai-Dorfman disease, presenting with scleritis and anterior uveitis in the left eye, who experienced subsequent development of an epibulbar tumor in the same eye. The patient was also complicated by a relapsing facial nodule on the right cheek. After the pathological diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease was obtained, the patient underwent surgical excision of the epibulbar tumor and the facial nodule, accompanied by systemic immunosuppression therapy. At the last follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic without signs of recurrence. Conclusions: This report highlights the progression of ocular manifestations of Rosai-Dorfman disease and emphasizes the importance of systemic therapy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","acute disease; adult; biopsy; case report; complication; conjunctiva; differential diagnosis; disease exacerbation; human; iridocyclitis; male; pathology; sclera; scleritis; sinus histiocytosis; visual acuity; Acute Disease; Adult; Biopsy; Conjunctiva; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; Histiocytosis, Sinus; Humans; Male; Sclera; Scleritis; Uveitis, Anterior; Visual Acuity"
"FEASIBILITY OF SMART HEMODIALYSIS PATIENT CARE USING SENSORS EMBEDDED IN PERSONALIZED 3D PRINTING CAST","2019","The ever-increasing incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has already become a major burden to health budgets and a threat to public health nationwide in Taiwan. According to the United States Renal Data System Annual Data Report in 2015, the prevalence and incidence of ESRD in Taiwan are the highest in the world. Moreover, for the population of 82 thousand ESRD patients receiving hemodialysis treatments, the total cost is up to NT$34.2 billion annually out of the National Health Insurance (NHI) program budget. This project is to design a wearable medical device which can measure and monitor the fluid dynamics of the dialysis access using sensor of phonoangiography (PAG) for exploring vascular pitch pattern and sensor of Photoplethysmography (PPG) for estimating the flow volume as a double checking of the AV access condition. We use arteriovenous access (AVA) stenosis detector based on phonoangiography technique and autoregressive model to detect access stenosis and simultaneously estimate the status of AVA life cycle by tracking and obtaining changes in frequency spectra domain. It helps hemodialysis patients to be aware earlier of the dysfunction of AVA and reminds them to make a return visit. The purpose of the complement deployment of vital sign sensors is to improve the prognosis and optimize overall health by providing analysis of physiological signals, including water content index, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure at the same time. With these sensors, the concept of holistic hemodialysis patient care (HHPC) might be proved. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","3D printers; Angiography; Blood pressure; Budget control; Dialysis; Health insurance; Health risks; Hemodialyzers; Life cycle; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Photoplethysmography; Public health; Signal analysis; 3-D printing; Embedded sensors; Hemodialysis patient; phonoangiography (PAG); Photoplethysmography (PPG); Wearable sensors"
"Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia associated with higher expressions of miR-21, 155, and 223 can be regressed by Helicobacter pylori eradication in the gastric cancer familial relatives","2019","Background and aims: Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is a preneoplastic gastric cancer lesion related to epigenetic microRNA (miRNA) expression. This study elucidated whether Helicobacter pylori-infected first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer (GCF) are susceptible to have SPEM and correlated with miR-21, 155, and 223 expressions. We also validated whether SPEM and these miRNAs can be regressed after H?pylori eradication. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 148 GCF and 148 nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD) subjects without gastric cancer familial history as controls. Each case had received a panendoscopy to determine H?pylori status and gastric histology, including SPEM. The cases with SPEM were followed after H?pylori eradication to determine SPEM regression. The total RNA was extracted to analyze tissues miR-21, 155, and 223 before and after eradication. Results: GCF subjects had a higher prevalence of H?pylori infection (73% vs 32%) and SPEM (42% vs 14%, P?<?0.01) than controls. The tissue miR-21, 155, and 223 in antrum were higher in cases with SPEM than in those without SPEM (P?<=?0.05). There was similar SPEM reversibility after H?pylori eradication between GCF subjects and controls (72% vs 69%, P?=?0.852). In the SPEM regressed cases, tissue miR-21, 155, and 223 decreased after H?pylori eradication (P?<?0.05). Conclusion: The H pylori-infected GCF subjects were prone to have SPEM with higher tissues miR-21, 155, and 223 expressions. H?pylori eradication can result in a 70% SPEM regression, accompanied by a decline in miR-21, 155, and 233 expression levels. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","microRNA; microRNA 155; microRNA 21; microRNA 223; microRNA; MIRN155 microRNA, human; MIRN21 microRNA, human; MIRN223 microRNA, human; peptide; spasmolytic polypeptide; adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer susceptibility; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; dyspepsia; eradication therapy; female; first-degree relative; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gene expression; Helicobacter infection; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; metaplasia; middle aged; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; remission; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia; stomach biopsy; stomach cancer; tissue level; urea breath test; validation study; genetics; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; metabolism; metaplasia; microbiology; physiology; stomach tumor; Adult; Female; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Male; Metaplasia; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Peptides; Stomach Neoplasms"
"hnRNPM induces translation switch under hypoxia to promote colon cancer development","2019","Background: Hypoxia suppresses global protein production, yet certain essential proteins are translated through alternative pathways to survive under hypoxic stress. Translation via the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is a means to produce proteins under stress conditions such as hypoxia; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. Methods: Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were employed to identify hnRNPM as an IRES interacting factor. Clinical specimens and mouse model of tumorigenesis were used for determining the expression and correlation of hnRNPM and its target gene. Transcriptomic and translatomic analyses were performed to profile target genes regulated by hnRNPM. Findings: Hypoxia increases cytosolic hnRNPM binding onto its target mRNAs and promotes translation initiation. Clinical colon cancer specimens and mouse carcinogenesis model showed that hnRNPM is elevated during the development of colorectal cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis. Genome-wide transcriptomics and translatomics analyses revealed a unique set of hnRNPM-targeted genes involved in metabolic processes and cancer neoplasia are selectively translated under hypoxia. Interpretation: These data highlight the critical role of hnRNPM-IRES-mediated translation in transforming hypoxia-induced proteome toward malignancy.

"Loss of the transcriptional repressor TGIF1 results in enhanced Kras-driven development of pancreatic cancer","2019","Background: The TG-interacting factor 1 (TGIF1) gene, which encodes a nuclear transcriptional corepressor of the TGFβ1/Smad signaling pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of human cancer; however, its role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has yet to be elucidated. Methods: The expression of TGIF1 in human and murine PDAC specimens were detected by IHC analysis. The functions of TGIF1 in in vivo PDAC growth, dissemination, and metastasis were assessed using conditional inactivation of TGIF1 in well-established autochthonous mouse models of PDAC. Primary cells from TGIF1 null or wild type PDAC mice were examined by assays for cell proliferation, migration, invasion, soft agar and xenograft tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiling, pathway analyses, epigenetic changes associated with TGIF1 loss, and in vitro and in vivo effects of 4-MU were assessed. Results: Conditional deletion of TGIF1 in the mouse pancreas had no discernible effect on pancreatic development or physiology. Notably, TGIF1 loss induced KrasG12D-driven PDAC models exhibited shorter latency and greater propensity for distant metastases. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms highlighted the TGIF1 loss-induced activation of the hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2)-CD44 signaling pathway and upregulation of the immune checkpoint regulator PD-L1 to facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor immune suppression. We also founded that TGIF1 might function as an epigenetic regulator and response for aberrant EMT gene expression during PDAC progression. Conclusions: Our results imply that targeting the HAS2 pathway in TGIF1 loss of PDAC could be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the clinical efficacy against PDAC metastasis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","arginase; beta1 integrin; CD163 antigen; CD68 antigen; colony stimulating factor 1; cytokine; eotaxin 2; Hermes antigen; hyaluronan synthase 2; hyaluronate synthetase; interleukin 1; interleukin 12; interleukin 4; K ras protein; LIX protein; matrix metalloproteinase; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nerve cell adhesion molecule; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; protein kinase B; smooth muscle actin; stromal cell derived factor 1; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; transcription factor ZEB1; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell growth assay; cell invasion; cell migration; cell migration assay; cell proliferation; cell proliferation assay; colony formation assay; controlled study; distant metastasis; down regulation; epigenetics; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; flow cytometry; gene deletion; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene mutation; HAS2 CD44 signaling pathway; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; metastasis; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreas cancer; protein expression; repressor gene; signal transduction; TGIF1 gene; tumor immunity; tumor microenvironment; tumor xenograft; upregulation; wild type mouse; wound healing assay"
"Bathtub drowning mortality among older adults in Japan","2019","We examined the bathtub drowning mortality among older adults in Japan. Mortality data from Japan and 30 other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were extracted from World Health Organization Cause of Death Query Online. During 2012–2014, unintentional drowning mortality rates in Japan were 9.5, 28.2 and 39.7 per 100,000 population for adults aged 65–74, 75–84 and ?85 years, respectively—rates highest among the 31 OECD countries. In total, 6377 older adults aged ?65 years died from unintentional drowning in 2014, of which 4857 (76%) deaths involved bathtubs. During 1995–2014, the bathtub drowning mortality rate for adults aged ?65 years was stable in Japan. During 2011–2014, approximately 4800 older adults died from bathtub drowning annually. Death predominantly occurred ‘while in a bathtub’, rather than ‘following a fall into a bathtub’. In 2014, 95% and 87% of bathtub drowning deaths among older women and men aged ?65 years, respectively, occurred at home. In conclusion, bathtub drowning deaths at home is an important public health problem among older adults Japanese and efforts are needed to reduce these preventable deaths. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","aged; bath; drowning; epidemiology; female; home accident; human; Japan; male; mortality; very elderly; Accidents, Home; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Baths; Drowning; Female; Humans; Japan; Male"
"Traffic-related particulate matter exposure induces nephrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo","2019","Traffic emission is responsible for most small-sized particulate matter (PM) air pollution in urban areas. Several recent studies have indicated that traffic-related PM may aggravate kidney disease. Furthermore, exposure to particulate air pollution may be related to the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been adequately addressed. In the present study, we studied the mechanisms of renal damage that might be associated with exposure to PM. In a real world of whole-body exposure to traffic-related PM model for 3–6 months, PM in urban ambient air can affect kidney function and induce autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in kidney tissues. Exposure to traffic-related diesel particulate matter (DPM) led to a reduction in cell viability in human kidney tubular epithelial cells HK-2. DPM increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, DPM induced ER stress and activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Eventually, DPM exposure induced caspase pathways and triggered apoptosis. In addition, DPM induced autophagy through the inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Autophagy inhibition resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These findings suggest that air pollution in urban areas may cause nephrotoxicity and autophagy as a protective role in PM-induced cytotoxicity. ? 2019 The Authors","caspase; creatinine; cystatin C; diesel fuel; mammalian target of rapamycin; nitrogen; protein kinase B; reactive oxygen metabolite; urea; air pollution; ambient air; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cell viability; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; cytotoxicity; disease association; disease exacerbation; endoplasmic reticulum stress; environmental exposure; enzyme induction; epithelium cell; exhaust gas; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney function; kidney tissue; kidney tubule epithelium; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; molecular mechanics; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; rat; unfolded protein response; urban area"

"Circumcision to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in men who have sex with men: a systematic review and meta-analysis of global data","2019","Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide. Previous reviews investigating the role of circumcision in preventing HIV and other STIs among MSM were inconclusive. Many new studies have emerged in the past decade. To inform global prevention strategies for HIV and other STIs among MSM, we reviewed all available evidence on the associations between circumcision and HIV and other STIs among MSM. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, BioMed Central, Scopus, ResearchGate, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and websites of international HIV and STI conferences for studies published before March 8, 2018. Interventional or observational studies containing original quantitative data describing associations between circumcision and incident or prevalent infection of HIV and other STIs among MSM were included. Studies were excluded if MSM could not be distinguished from men who have sex with women only. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs using random-effect models. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Findings: We identified 62 observational studies including 119 248 MSM. Circumcision was associated with 23% reduced odds of HIV infection among MSM overall (OR 0·77, 95% CI 0·67–0·89; number of estimates [k]=45; heterogeneity I 2 =77%). Circumcision was protective against HIV infection among MSM in countries of low and middle income (0·58, 0·41–0·83; k=23; I 2 =77%) but not among MSM in high-income countries (0·99, 0·90–1·09; k=20; I 2 =40%). Circumcision was associated with reduced odds of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection among MSM overall (0·84, 0·75–0·95; k=5; I 2 =0%) and penile human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among HIV-infected MSM (0·71, 0·51–0·99; k=3; I 2 =0%). Interpretation: We found evidence that circumcision is likely to protect MSM from HIV infection, particularly in countries of low and middle income. Circumcision might also protect MSM from HSV and penile HPV infection. MSM should be included in campaigns promoting circumcision among men in countries of low and middle income. In view of the substantial proportion of MSM in countries of low and middle income who also have sex with women, well designed longitudinal studies differentiating MSM only and bisexual men are needed to clarify the effect of circumcision on male-to-male transmission of HIV and other STIs.

"Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 expression predicts poorer survival and up-regulates ZEB2 expression in human early stage bladder cancer","2019","Purposes: Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) is a key enzyme of tryptophan metabolism which regulates T cell function in immune cells and little is known about the role of IDO1 expression in bladder cancer cells. The study is aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of IDO1 expression in human bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC). Materials and Methods: One hundred and sixty paraffin-embedded UC tissues (130 bladder, 30 upper urinary tract) and 47 adjacent normal tissues were retrieved for IDO1 immunostaining. Urine samples from UC and non-UC patients were collected before surgery for measuring the concentration of tryptophan and its metabolites. Clinicopathological correlates of IDO1 expression and the prognostic values in human bladder cancer were explored. External validation was performed with 4 published bladder cancer datasets, as well as in vitro studies. Results: As compared with normal adjacent tissues, UC exhibited a higher frequency of IDO1 expression (chi-square, P = 0.0005). IDO1 expression is an independent poor prognostic factor for disease progression [hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval, 3.80 (1.46–9.86), P = 0.006], which is associated with decreased number of intratumoral infiltrating CD8+ lymphocyte (unpaired t test, P = 0.026). External validation showed that patients with higher IDO1 expression exhibit decreased disease-specific survival than those with lower IDO1 expression. Furthermore, IDO1 expression correlated positively with the expression of several EMT markers, including ZEB2, fibronectin and vimentin. The in vitro T24 cell subline demonstrated that IDO1 expression can up-regulate ZEB2 expression probably through miR-200c signaling. Conclusion: IDO1 expression predicts poorer survival and up-regulates ZEB2 expression in human bladder cancer. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","fibronectin; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1; unclassified drug; vimentin; zinc finger E box binding homeobox 2; aged; Article; bladder; cancer survival; CD8+ T lymphocyte; chi square test; controlled study; disease specific survival; female; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; Student t test; transitional cell carcinoma; upregulation; urinary tract"

"Residential greenness and mortality in oldest-old women and men in China: a longitudinal cohort study","2019","Background: Exposure to natural vegetation, or greenness, might affect health through several pathways, including increased physical activity and social engagement, improved mental health, and reductions in exposure to air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Few studies of the effects of greenness have focused on Asia, and, to the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the effect on vulnerable oldest-old populations. We assessed the association between residential greenness and mortality in an older cohort in China. Methods: We used five waves (February, 2000–October, 2014) of the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), a prospective cohort representative of the general older population in China. We assessed exposure to greenness through satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in the 250 m and 1250 m radius around the residential address for each individual included in the study. We calculated contemporaneous NDVI values, cumulative NDVI values, and changes in NDVI from the start of the study over time. The health outcome of the study was all-cause mortality, excluding accidental deaths. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, geographical region, childhood and adult socioeconomic status, social and leisure activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Findings: Among 23 754 individuals (mean age at baseline 93 years [SD 7·5]) totaling 80 001 person-years, we observed 18 948 deaths during 14 years of follow-up, between June, 2000, and December, 2014. Individuals in the highest quartile of contemporaneous NDVI values had 27% lower mortality than those in the lowest quartile for the 250 m radius (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73, 95% CI 0·70–0·76), and 30% lower mortality for the 1250 m radius (0·70, 0·67–0·74). No clear association was observed for cumulative NDVI measurements and mortality. We did not detect an association between area-level changes in NDVI and mortality. Interpretation: Our research suggests that proximity to more green space is associated with increased longevity, which has policy implications for the national blueprint of ecological civilisation and preparation for an ageing society in China.

"The Effectiveness of Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training Group vs. Cognitive Therapy Group on Reducing Depression and Suicide Attempts for Borderline Personality Disorder in Taiwan","2019","In this study the effectiveness of the condensed Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training Group (DBTSTG) was compared to the Cognitive Therapy Group (CTG) in reducing depression and suicide reattempt and modifying emotion regulation strategies among those with borderline personality disorder (BPD). A total of 82 depressed BPD college students with a suicidal history within the past 6-months were randomly allocated to DBTSTG or CTG. Both groups had similar reductions in suicide reattempts and depression after the intervention and 6-month follow-ups. However, the CTG showed improvements in cognitive errors, but the DBTSTG revealed increases in acceptance and decreases in suppression scores. Both groups were effective in decreasing depression and suicide reattempt in BPD college students, probably through increasing adaptive antecedent-focused or response-focused strategies of emotion regulation, respectively. ? 2018, Copyright ?

"SERS-active substrate with collective amplification design for trace analysis of pesticides","2019","Health risks posed by the exposure to trace amounts of pesticide residue in agricultural productshave gaineda lot of concerns, due to theirneurotoxicnature. The applications of surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) as a detection technique have consistently shown its potential as a rapid and sensitive means with minimal sample preparation. In this study, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) in elliptical shapes were collected into a layer of ordered zirconia concave pores. The porous zirconia layer (pZrO2) was then deposited with Au NPs, denoted as Au NPs (x)/pZrO2, where x indicates the deposition thickness of Au NPs in nm. In the concave structure of pZrO2, Au-ZrO2 and Au-Au interactions provide a synergistic and physical mechanism of SERS, which is anticipated to collect and amplify SERS signals and thereafter improve the enhancement factor (EF) of Au NPs/pZrO2. By taking Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as the test molecule, EF of Au NPs/pZrO2 might reach to 7.0 × 107. Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2 was then optimized and competent to detect pesticides, e.g., phosmet and carbaryl at very low concentrations, corresponding to the maximum residue limits of each, i.e., 0.3 ppm and 0.2 ppm, respectively. Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2 also showed the effectiveness of distinguishing between phosmet and carbaryl under mixed conditions. Due to the strong affinities of the phosphoric groups and sulfur in phosmet to the Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2, the substrate exhibited selective detection to this particular pesticide. In this study, Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2 has thus demonstrated trace detection of residual pesticides, due to the substrate design that intended to provide collective amplification of SERS. ? 2019 by the authors.",""
"Real-world effectiveness and safety of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for genotype 6 chronic hepatitis C patients in Taiwan","2019","Background and Aim: Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 6 is uncommon in Taiwan, and reports of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) treatment for GT6 are few. This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of LDV/SOF in treating chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with GT6 infection. Methods: CHC patients that were infected with GT6 and treated for 12?weeks with LDV/SOF at two hospitals were enrolled. All patients were followed for an additional 12?weeks after the completion of LDV/SOF treatment. Demographics, HCV viral load, lipid and sugar profiles, and adverse events were recorded and reviewed. Results: A total of 127 patients were enrolled. Cirrhosis was found in 68.2% of them. Sustained virological response (SVR), determined by per-protocol analysis, was 97.6%. The SVR rates for cirrhosis versus non-cirrhosis (96.5% vs 100%, P?=?0.229) and low versus high viral load (cutoff value: 106?IU/mL; 100% vs 95.6%, P?=?0.108) were similar. Following HCV clearance, significantly lower glycosylated hemoglobin was present both in patients with or without diabetes mellitus. Twenty-three (18.1%) patients exhibited adverse events, and each adverse event presented with an incidence of 0.8% to 3.1%. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were the most common. During treatment, 18 patients (14.2%) had alanine aminotransferase elevations consistent with more than grade 1 abnormalities, and none had signs of decompensation. Renal function remained unchanged. Conclusion: The high SVR and excellent safety of LDV/SOF treatment for GT6 CHC patients suggest that LDV/SOF is a favorable option for treating GT6 CHC patients in Taiwan and Asia. ? 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",""
"An effective and accurate identification system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using convolution neural networks","2019","Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from infectious disease in developing countries. The sputum smear microscopy remains the primary diagnostic laboratory test. However, microscopic examination is always time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, an effective computer-aided image identification system is needed to provide timely assistance in diagnosis. The current identification system usually suffers from complex color variations of the images, resulting in plentiful of false object detection. To overcome the dilemma, we propose a two-stage Mycobacterium tuberculosis identification system, consisting of candidate detection and classification using convolution neural networks (CNNs). The refined Faster region-based CNN was used to distinguish candidates of M. tuberculosis and the actual ones were classified by utilizing CNN-based classifier. We first compared three different CNNs, including ensemble CNN, single-member CNN, and deep CNN. The experimental results showed that both ensemble and deep CNNs were on par with similar identification performance when analyzing more than 19,000 images. A much better recall value was achieved by using our proposed system in comparison with conventional pixel-based support vector machine method for M. tuberculosis bacilli detection. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","artificial neural network; cytology; evaluation study; human; image processing; isolation and purification; lung tuberculosis; microbiology; microscopy; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; procedures; sputum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Neural Networks (Computer); Sputum; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"
"Facing children suffering from physical abuse: The decision-making process of non-abusing caregivers","2019","Background: Physical abuse is the most common type of child maltreatment reported in Taiwan. The action of non-abusing caregivers is key to ending this maltreatment and to preventing future victimization in the home. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the decision-making process used by non-abusing caregivers to take action after finding that children under their care were being physically abused at home. Methods: A qualitative descriptive approach was adopted and purposive, snowball sampling was used to recruit 11 non-abusing caregivers of children less than 18 years of age who were experiencing physical abuse at home. Data were collected using semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Data analysis was performed using a constant comparison method that was based on grounded theory principles and techniques. Results: The participants adopted a process that shifted over time from passive observation to active participation in dealing with children under their care being physically abused at home. The three main categories and five subcategories in this process are (1) inaction (shirking parental responsibility and rationalizing spouse’s use of corporal punishment); (2) obscure action (family harmony first; strategic solutions); and (3) action (bottom line for asking for help). In this study, the decision-making process was influenced by personal, family, and sociocultural factors. Conclusions / Implications for Practice: The decision of the non-abusing caregivers in this study whether or not to take action was influenced by situational factors, which led to various consequences for their children. Non-abusing caregivers should be provided with coping strategies and resources to help them make decisions that protect the best interests of the physically abused child. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Impact of prior pulmonary tuberculosis in treatment outcomes of HCAP and CAP patients in intensive care units","2019","Background/purpose: It is controversial whether healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) belongs to a unique clinical entity or it shares common characteristics with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The impact of prior pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in clinical presentation and treatment outcome of ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients also remains unknown. Methods: We report a nationwide, multi-center, retrospective study. ICU-admitted CAP and HCAP patients from six medical centers in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. Patients were defined as either CAP or HCAP cases, and with and without prior PTB, according to the database of Taiwan CDC. The disease severity, microbiologic characteristics, and treatment outcomes between CAP and HCAP patients with or without prior PTB were compared and analyzed. Results: A total of 414 ICU-admitted patients, including 176 CAP cases and 238 HCAP cases were included for analysis during the study period. In both CAP and HCAP subgroups, the pneumonia severities, proportions of organ dysfunction, and microbiologic characteristics were similar between patients with and without prior PTB. In survival analysis, patients with prior PTB had higher 30-day mortality than those without prior PTB (38.9% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.021) in the CAP population. Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of prior PTB was an independent clinical factor associated with higher 30-day mortality rate in CAP patients (HR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.81–10.98, P = 0.001). Conclusion: History of prior PTB is an independent clinical factor for increased 30-day mortality rate in ICU-admitted CAP patients, but not in ICU-admitted HCAP patients. ? 2018","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic lung disease; clinical evaluation; community acquired pneumonia; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; Enterobacter; Enterococcus faecium; female; health care associated pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; Klebsiella pneumoniae; length of stay; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality rate; multicenter study; nonhuman; pathogen load; Pneumonia Severity Index; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; respiratory failure; retrospective study; septic shock; smoking habit; Staphylococcus aureus; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; adult; clinical trial; community acquired infection; comorbidity; demography; epidemiology; hospital; hospitalization; lung tuberculosis; microbiology; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; pneumonia; regression analysis; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistical model; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Community-Acquired Infections; Comorbidity; Demography; Female; Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Multivariate Analysis; Pneumonia; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult"
"Generation of a heterozygous p53 R249S mutant human embryonic stem cell line by TALEN-mediated genome editing","2019","As one of the most essential genome guardians, p53 and its mutants have been suggested associated with many types of cancers. Many p53 mutants function induce unique phenotypes, including carcinogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance.

"Incidence of hospitalization for infection among patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection without cirrhosis in Taiwan: A cohort study","2019","Background: Infection is a major complication in liver cirrhosis and causes major morbidity and mortality. However, the incidence and mortality related to these conditions in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are unclear, as is whether antiviral therapy could change their infection risk. Methods and findings: In this community-based cohort study, a total of 115,336 adults (mean age 52.2 years; 35.6% men) without cirrhosis participating in the New Taipei City Health Screening in 2005-2008 were classified as having noncirrhotic HCV (NC-HCV) (n = 2,839), noncirrhotic hepatitis B virus (NC-HBV) (n = 8,316), or no HBV or HCV infection (NBNC) (n = 104,181). Participants were followed to their first hospitalization for infection or death after data linkage with the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and Death Registry. A Cox proportional hazard regression model, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, education level, diabetes, renal function, systemic steroids, and history of hospitalization, was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall and individual sites of infection and infection-related mortality. The reference group was NBNC participants with normal to mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (<1.5 times upper normal limit [UNL]) levels. To further address the impact of antiviral treatment on infection risk, we conducted analyses of data from the nationwide NHIRD and compared the risks for hospitalization because of infections and infection-related deaths between patients with HCV who received antiviral therapy (n = 20,264) and those who remained untreated (n = 104,360). During a median 8.2-year followup, the incidence of hospitalization for infection was substantially higher in NC-HCV patients. Compared to the reference group, NC-HCV was associated with a significantly higher risk for hospitalization because of overall infections (adjusted HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12-1.33), but we observed no increased risk for patients in the NC-HBV (adjusted HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88-1.01) or NBNC group with moderate to markedly elevated ALT levels (adjusted HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.93-1.14). For specific sites of infection, the NC-HCV group had increased risks for septicemia and lower respiratory tract, reproductive, and urinary tract infections. We noted no increased risk for infection-related death among patients with NC-HCV. Patients with HCV who received antiviral therapy had significantly reduced infection-related hospitalization and death risks (adjusted HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.73-0.84 for infection-related hospitalization and adjusted HR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04-0.16 for infection-related deaths). Study limitations include the exclusion of patients with cirrhosis from the cohort, the possibility of unmeasured confounding, and the lack of information on direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Conclusions: In this study, patients with NC-HCV were at increased risk for hospitalization for infection, while no increased risk was observed for NC-HBV-infected patients.

"An automated microfluidic system for selection of aptamer probes against ovarian cancer tissues","2019","Because of the difficulty of treatment in its latest stages, cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Therefore, high-affinity and specificity biomarkers are still in demand for many cancer types, and the utility of aptamers to serve in this regard has been explored recently. Although a process known as ""systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment"" (SELEX) has been used to generate aptamer-based cancer biomarkers, this approach is complicated, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. An automated microfluidic system was consequently developed herein to screen ovarian cancer-specific aptamers via on-chip SELEX with clinical cancer tissue samples. The integrated microfluidic system consisted of an integrated microfluidic chip, a temperature control module equipped with 12 thermoelectric coolers, and a flow control module for controlling 36 electromagnetic valves such that the entire, tissue-based SELEX process could be fully automated and carried out within 15 h. Highly specific ovarian cancer aptamers with high affinity (dissociation constant of 129 nM) to their cellular targets were screened with this system. Given the comparable specificity to their much more expensive antibody counterparts, these aptamers, when used in conjunction with the developed microfluidic system, may be used to diagnose ovarian cancer in its earliest stages. ? 2019 Author(s).","Automation; Biomarkers; Dissociation; Fluidic devices; Microfluidics; Thermoelectric equipment; Tissue; Cancer biomarkers; Dissociation constant; Electromagnetic valves; Integrated microfluidic chips; Integrated microfluidic systems; Micro fluidic system; Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichments; Thermoelectric cooler; Diseases"
"Competing risk analysis on visit-to-visit glucose variations and risk of depression: The Taiwan Diabetes Study","2019","Aim: Patients with diabetes have higher rates of depression than does the general population, but diabetes management mainly aims to maintain glucose stability. For this reason, our study assessed the relationship between 1-year variations in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and risk of depression in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 32,829 patients aged ? 30 years who were diagnosed with T2D and who participated in the National Diabetes Case Management Program in Taiwan. Their 1-year FPG variation as a predictor was determined by coefficient of variation (CV), whereas depressive events were analyzed by Cox's proportional hazards models. Results: During a mean 8.23 years of follow-up, 1041 new cases of depression were diagnosed. When patients were grouped based on quartiles of FPG-CV, incidence rates were 3.23, 3.49, 3.96 and 4.80 per 1000 person-years in the first, second, third and fourth quartile subgroups, respectively. After adjusting for traditional risk factors, baseline fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, and diabetes complications, FPG-CV was independently linked with incident depression. Hazard ratios of depression for FPG-CV in the fourth vs first quartile subgroups was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.11–1.59), respectively. Conclusion: Patients whose 1-year FPG variations were &gt; 42.6% had an increased risk of depression, thus suggesting that FPG variations may be a predictor of depression in patients with T2D. Also, glucose variation during outpatient visits may be an indicator for individualized diabetes management in clinical practice. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",""
"Recalcitrant extragenital giant condyloma acuminatum: A need for combination therapy","2019","Giant condyloma acuminatum (GCA), also known as Buschke -L?wenstein tumor, is a huge, rapidly growing variant of condyloma found in the anogenital region. Extragenital GCA is rare and, in most cases, affecting the intertriginous area and treated by excision. We described a case of refractory extragenital GCA involving the large part of the left axilla area successfully treated with immunotherapy and podophyllotoxin. Considering the large size and the location, the lesions were not treated by wide excision because it might result in scar contracture with limitation of shoulder movement or axillary web syndrome. Our case illustrates that combination therapy of podophyllotoxin, imiquimod plus weekly cryotherapy may be an effective and less invasive option for treating GCA of the axilla with good cosmetic and functional outcomes. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","imiquimod; podophyllotoxin; virus DNA; Wart virus vaccine; adult; Article; axilla; case report; clinical article; cream; cryotherapy; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; epidermis hyperplasia; follow up; giant condyloma acuminatum; histopathology; human; Human papillomavirus type 6; immunotherapy; male; polymerase chain reaction; recalcitrant extragenital giant condyloma acuminatum"
"Haptic perception is altered in children with developmental coordination disorder","2019","Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the motor system, but it may also present with signs of somatosensory dysfunction. This study examined whether haptic perception, which relies on somatosensory afferents, is impaired in children with DCD. Haptic sensitivity and acuity were systematically quantified in children with DCD and contrasted to the performance of typically developing (TD) children and young adults (each group N = 20). All participants performed a curvature detection task measuring haptic sensitivity and a curvature discrimination task measuring haptic acuity. In both tasks, participants moved the index finger of their dominant hand over a surface contour and verbally indicated whether they could detect its curvature or discriminate between two curved contours. Based on their verbal responses haptic detection and discrimination thresholds were obtained. The main findings are as follows: First, the DCD group had significantly elevated haptic discrimination thresholds (lower haptic acuity) compared to both TD children and adult controls. Second, we found no evidence that haptic sensitivity is impaired in DCD. Third, haptic acuity significantly correlated with clinical motor measures, indicating that higher levels of haptic acuity were associated with higher motor abilities. We conclude that DCD may be associated with impaired haptic perception, which likely contributes to the observable fine motor deficits. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article; child; child development; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; developmental coordination disorder; disease association; female; haptic perception impairment; haptic sensitivity; human; index finger; male; motor dysfunction; motor performance; nervous system parameters; neurologic examination; perception disorder; school child; surface property; tactile discrimination; task performance"
"Increased amount and duration of tea consumption may be associated with decreased risk of renal stone disease","2019","Purpose: Previous studies have looked into the association between tea consumption and renal stone disease, but the impact of tea consumption over time has not yet been fully clarified. Our study aimed to examine the amount and duration of tea consumption concomitantly in relation to the risk of renal stone disease. Methods: A total of 13,842 subjects who underwent health check-ups were recruited. Average tea consumption per day was defined as the amount of tea consumption per day multiplied by the frequency per week divided by seven. A “cup” was defined as 120?mL for each Chinese traditional teapot,” and “cup-year” was calculated by multiplying the number of daily cups and the years of tea consumption to express the cumulative dose of tea consumption over time. The diagnosis of renal stone disease was established based on the results of abdominal sonography. Results: The amount of daily tea consumption was 119.2 ± 306.8 and 131.7 ± 347.3?mL in groups with and without renal stone disease. After adjusting for other clinical variables, daily tea consumption ? 240?mL vs. none was related to lower risk of renal stone disease (OR = 0.84, CI 0.71–0.99, p = 0.037). In another model, the associated risk of renal stone disease decreased significantly with tea consumption ? 20 cup-year (OR = 0.79, CI 0.66–0.94, p = 0.008), but not < 20 cup-year (OR = 0.92, CI 0.78–1.09, p = 0.34).

"Depressive symptoms and nutritional status in the frail older adults","2019","Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms and nutritional status in the frail older adults. Methods: This study uses a cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational design. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data, and the Taiwan International Physical Activity Questionnaire Form Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form Charlson Comorbidity Index, and Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short-Form were used to measure depression and nutritional status, respectively. Data were analyzed by independent-t tests, chi-square tests, spearman correlations, and multiple linear regressions. Results: Of the total of 94 frail older adults, 17 (18.09%) had depressive symptoms (GDS > 5). The average MNA-SF score was 11.38 (SD = 2.45), 31 (32.98%) participants had a risk of malnutrition and 12 (12.77%) were malnourished. Participants’ reports of dissatisfaction with their lives (72.1%) and feeling terrible about their lives (58.14%) were associated with a risk of malnutrition. Elderly age, multiple comorbidities, and high level of depressive symptoms were at increased risk of malnutrition. Conclusion: When clinicians are faced with a high-risk group, such as elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and depressive symptoms, they should perform an immediate assessment of nutritional status. If a risk of malnutrition is found, adequate nutrition and health care should be provided. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aged; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chi square test; comorbidity; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; depression; descriptive research; female; frailty; Geriatric Depression Scale; health care utilization; human; international physical activity questionnaire; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; physical activity; priority journal; regression analysis"
"Longitudinal investigation of the reciprocal relationship between depressive symptoms and glycemic control: The moderation effects of sex and perceived support","2019","Aims/Introduction: The present study investigated the longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and glycemic control in nationally representative adults with type?2 diabetes, and tested the effects of sex and perceived family support in moderating this association. Materials and Methods: In this longitudinal study of middle-aged and older adults who participated in the 2002 and 2006 Health and Retirement Study, and the 2003 and 2006 Diabetes Study (n?=?398), we applied a cross-lagged structural equation?model to examine the reciprocal relationship between depressive symptoms and glycemic control over a 3-year period. Results: Men and women were not different in terms of the depressive symptoms and glycemic control relationship, with a stronger association noted for higher depressive symptom scores predicting worse glycemic control (β?=?0.22, critical ratio 3.03), as opposed to worse glycemic control predicting higher depressive symptom scores. Family and friend support for diabetes self-management serves as an important buffer. In patients with low family and friend support, more depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with subsequent worse glycemic levels (β?=?0.36, critical ratio 4.03). In contrast, in individuals who had strong support, depressive symptoms did not predict subsequent glycemic control. Conclusions: The present study provided evidence for the relationship between glycemic control and depression, finding that depressive symptoms predicted poorly controlled glycemic status, especially when the participants perceived inadequate support from their family or friends. A quick survey in clinics to assess the level of family or friend support for diabetes management and depressive symptoms might be an important part of individualized diabetic care. ? 2018 The Authors.

Percentage of demand ventricular pacing is different between patients with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and those with complete atrioventricular block (CAVB). This study aims to compare the incidence of HF admission and pacing-induced cardiomyopathy between patients with SSS and CAVB. Methods and results: A total of 824 patients who received single ventricular or dual-chamber pacemaker implantation at our hospital between January 2003 and December 2012 were recruited for the study. Patients with HF, those without complete cardiac echocardiography, and those with significant coronary artery disease were excluded. Finally, 315 patients with SSS and 289 patients with CAVB were enrolled in this study. The CAVB group had a higher pacing percentage (39.37?±?9.17% vs. 83.82?±?33.06%; P?<?0.001), longer pacing QRS duration (142.56?±?33.02?ms vs. 156.63?±?25.18?ms; P?<?0.001), and higher prevalence of follow-up left ventricular ejection fraction ?40% (1.3% vs. 4.2%; P?=?0.040). However, the incidence of HF admission was similar between the two groups (log-rank P?=?0.647). Age [hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.121, 1.054–1.193], diabetes mellitus (HR, 95% CI: 2.667, 1.159–6.136), pacing QRS duration ?163?ms (HR, 95% CI: 3.506, 1.491–8.247), and left atrial size (HR, 95% CI: 1.070, 1.012–1.131) were independent predictors of HF admission. The Kaplan–Meier curve showed a significant difference in HF admission over a 3.5?year follow-up period (3.5?years: P value?=?0.004; 5?years: P value?=?0.002) between patients with pacing QRS duration ?163 and <163?ms. Conclusions: There was no difference in HF admission between patients with SSS and CAVB, although the CAVB group had a higher pacing percentage. Post-pacemaker implant pacing QRS duration ?163?ms was the most important predictor of HF admission. ? 2019 The Authors.

"LncRNA NORAD is repressed by the YAP pathway and suppresses lung and breast cancer metastasis by sequestering S100P","2019","Metastasis is responsible for most cancer mortality, but its molecular mechanism has not been completely understood. In addition to coding genes and miRNAs, the contribution of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to tumor metastatic dissemination and the mechanisms controlling their expression are areas of intensive investigation. Here, we show that lncRNA NORAD is downregulated in lung and breast cancers, and that NORAD low expression in these cancer types is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. NORAD is transcriptionally repressed by the Hippo pathway transducer YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex in conjunction with the action of NuRD complex. Functionally, NORAD elicits potent inhibitory effects on migration and invasion of multiple lung and breast cancer cell lines, and repression of NORAD expression participates in the migration- and invasion-stimulatory effects of the YAP pathway. Mechanistically, NORAD exploits its multiple repeated sequences to function as a multivalent platform for binding and sequestering S100P, thereby suppressing S100P-elicited pro-metastatic signaling network. Using cell and mouse models, we show that the S100P decoy function of NORAD suppresses lung and breast cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis. Together, our study identifies NORAD as a novel metastasis suppressor, elucidates its regulatory and functional mechanisms, and highlights its prognostic value. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","long untranslated RNA; long untranslated RNA NORAD; protein S 100; protein S 100P; transcription factor Yap1; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; breast cancer; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; down regulation; gene expression; gene knockdown; gene repression; hippo signaling; human; human cell; human tissue; lung cancer; male; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; NORAD gene; priority journal; prognosis; promoter region; protein interaction; signal transduction; upregulation"
"The Role of Methylated Circulating Nucleic Acids as a Potential Biomarker in Alzheimer’s Disease","2019","Previous studies report detection of high concentrations of circulating nucleic acids (CNAs), which are likely related to cell apoptosis, in the plasma of patients with cancers, stroke, trauma, and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and CNAs is unclear. A total of 36 adult participants (9 non-demented controls and 27 patients with AD) and patients with mild AD, who met the criteria for probable AD, were enrolled in the present study, which was conducted at the Department of Neurology of National Cheng Kung University Hospital. The CNA levels were increased in the plasma of patients with AD, culture medium of amyloid-β-treated SH-SY5Y cells, and plasma from a mouse model of AD. The CNA concentrations in the plasma were positively correlated with the cognitive scores. Further, CNAs in patients with AD contained neuronal tissue-specific methylated LHX2, at CpG sites 1 and 5. These results showed that the increased levels of plasma CNAs could be related to neuronal cell death that was induced by β-amyloid toxicity. Thus, the results suggested that the levels of plasma CNAs and LHX2 methylation might serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD, particularly during the early stages of the disease. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","amyloid beta protein; cell free nucleic acid; biological marker; cell free nucleic acid; LHX2 protein, human; LIM homeodomain protein; transcription factor; adult; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; Article; clinical article; cognitive function test; controlled study; cytotoxicity; disease severity; early diagnosis; epigenetics; gene; human; human cell; LHX2 gene; methyl-CpG-binding domain; nerve cell necrosis; neuroapoptosis; nonhuman; protein blood level; protein function; protein methylation; SH-SY5Y cell line; tissue specificity; Alzheimer disease; animal; antibody specificity; blood; cognition; DNA methylation; genetics; metabolism; nerve cell; nucleotide sequence; transgenic mouse; tumor cell line; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Base Sequence; Biomarkers; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; Cognition; DNA Methylation; Humans; LIM-Homeodomain Proteins; Mice, Transgenic; Neurons; Organ Specificity; Transcription Factors"
"The relationship between children's overweight and quality of life: A comparison of Sizing Me Up, PedsQL and Kid-KINDL [Relaci?n entre el sobrepeso en ni?os y calidad de vida: comparaci?n entre Sizing Me Up, PedsQL y Kid-KINDL]","2019","Background/Objective: Overweight and obese children are likely to encounter negative impact on psychological well-being and quality of life (QoL). Hence, for overweight and obese children, measuring QoL could go beyond simply assessing objective medical parameters and cover their physical health, psychological well-being, and social interaction. Generic (Kid-KINDL and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL]) and weight-related (Sizing Me Up) measures are two major types of QoL measurement instruments; however, little is known about the differences between them. Method: We recruited 569 3rd to 6th graders from eleven schools in Southern Taiwan. In addition to the three QoL questionnaires, the Child Depression Inventory and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were applied. Results: Depression had significantly negative associations with all three QoL questionnaires. Self-esteem was only associated with Kid-KINDL. Body mass index had a significantly stronger relationship with Sizing Me Up than its relationships with PedsQL and Kid-KINDL. In other words, the items related to body size concerns in Size Me Up significantly contributed to impaired overweight/obese children's QoL. Conclusions: The study further identified the characters and strength of these QoL measures for better suggestions on evaluating physical and psychological issues for overweight/obese children. ? 2018 Asociaci?n Espa?ola de Psicolog?a Conductual",""
"Treatment outcomes for one-stage concurrent surgical resection and reconstruction of synchronous esophageal and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","2019","Purpose: It is not uncommon to see the synchronous presentation of esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) and head and neck cancer (HNC), and most patients were treated with staged interventions. This study retrospectively reported the outcomes of patients with synchronous ESCC and HNC treated with one-stage concurrent surgical resection and reconstruction. Methods: We identified 17 consecutive patients with synchronous ESCC and HNC undergoing primary concurrent surgical resections between 2011 and 2017 at our hospital. All patients had received esophageal screenings prior to treatment. Results: The HNC patients in this study had the following subsite involvements: oral cavity (n = 5), oropharynx (n = 4), larynx (n = 1), hypopharynx (n = 9), and thyroid gland (n = 1). Eighty percent of the HNC subsites (16/20) were treated in advanced stages, while most ESCCs were?treated at early stages. The mean follow-up time was 3.2 ± 1.6?years. Surgery-associated morbidity and mortality were 94.1% and 0%, respectively, and the most common complication was anastomotic leakage. The two-year overall survival, 2-year loco-regional recurrence-free survival, and 2-year distant metastasis-free survival were 86.7%, 85.6%, and 78.7%, respectively. No significant difference was found between overall survival and HNC subsite or anastomotic leakage. Four patients (23.5%) developed secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) within a mean follow-up period of 2.9?years (standard deviation 1.6?years). Conclusion: Although one-stage concurrent surgical resection and reconstruction of synchronous ESCC and HNC were highly invasive and complicated, survival was promising. Isolated distant metastasis remained the most common failure pattern. Vigilant follow-up strategy is mandatory to detect secondary primary malignancies (SPMs), especially within the first 3?years following initial treatment. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cisplatin; docetaxel; fluorouracil; adult; aged; anastomosis leakage; Article; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; cancer therapy; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; clinical outcome; comorbidity; controlled study; digestive system fistula; distant metastasis free survival; early cancer; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; follow up; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; hypopharynx; invasive procedure; larynx; local recurrence free survival; male; middle aged; mouth cavity; multiple cycle treatment; oropharynx; overall survival; postoperative complication; primary tumor; priority journal; reconstructive surgery; retrospective study; screening; second cancer; surgical mortality; thyroid gland; treatment failure; treatment outcome; adverse event; anastomosis; anastomosis leakage; dissection; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; female; head and neck tumor; multiple cancer; pathology; procedures; reconstructive surgery; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Anastomosis, Surgical; Anastomotic Leak; Dissection; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms, Multiple Primary; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Orbitofrontal dysfunction during the reward process in adults with ADHD: An fMRI study","2019","Objective: The present study aimed to detect differences in the reward response between adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and healthy controls (HCs) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was designed to explore participants’ reward-related decision-making in relation to selections during risky behaviors. Twenty adults with ADHD and 20 HCs were enrolled. fMRI with a modified IGT was performed. Results: The adults with ADHD showed a poorer performance in terms of avoidance during risky behaviors. The fMRI results indicated that the adults with ADHD had significantly lower orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation. A positive correlation between performance in the IGT and brain activation in the OFC was detected. Conclusions: The results suggested that the adults with ADHD exhibited abnormal OFC responses during decision-making. Significance: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use fMRI to collect brain activation data while performing the IGT in adults with ADHD. Our findings suggest that deficits in reward processing in ADHD are still present during adulthood. ? 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology","adult; Article; attention deficit disorder; BOLD signal; brain analysis; brain dysfunction; brain function; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gambling; high risk behavior; human; insula; male; orbital cortex; priority journal; reward; task performance"
"p21-Activated kinase 3 promotes cancer stem cell phenotypes through activating the Akt-GSK3β-β-catenin signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells","2019","Relative to several other p21-activated kinase (PAK) family members, the role of PAK3 in regulating cancer cell functions remains unclear. Our study obtained evidence that PAK3 regulates the Akt-GSK3β-β-catenin signaling by acting as Ser 473 -Akt kinase in several pancreatic cancer cell lines. Specifically, knockdown of PAK3 or overexpression of dominant-negative PAK3 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser 473 -Akt and GSK3β, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Conversely, overexpression of PAK3 led to activation of Akt signaling and increased β-catenin expression. These changes, however, were not noted with the silencing and/or overexpression of PAK1, PAK2, or PAK4, which underlies the impetus of PAK3 as a key effector in governing malignant phenotypes in these pancreatic cancer cells, including cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion. Accordingly, PAK3 depletion effectively suppresses tumorsphere formation, ALDH activity, and the expression of CSC surface markers. Moreover, we used a stable knockdown clone of AsPC-1 cells to demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of PAK3 inhibition in suppressing tumorigenesis and xenograft tumor growth. Together, these findings suggest the potential role of PAK3 as a target for pancreatic cancer therapy, which warrants further investigations. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aldehyde dehydrogenase; beta catenin; cell surface marker; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; p21 activated kinase 1; p21 activated kinase 2; p21 activated kinase 3; p21 activated kinase 4; proteasome; protein kinase B; serine; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; AsPC-1 cell line; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cancer stem cell; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme regulation; female; human; human cell; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; pancreatic cancer cell line; phenotype; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; stem cell expansion; tumor xenograft"
"Safety and efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir in Asian participants with hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 and 4 infection","2019","Background and Aim: Estimates suggest that in Asia, more than 31 million individuals have hepatitis C virus infection. The present analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir in Asian participants enrolled in the elbasvir/grazoprevir phase 2/3 clinical trials. Methods: This is an integrated analysis of data from 12 international phase 2/3 clinical trials. Asian participants with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 4 infection who received elbasvir 50?mg/grazoprevir 100?mg once daily for 12?weeks or elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin for 16?weeks were included in this analysis. The primary end point was sustained virologic response at 12?weeks after completion of therapy (SVR12). Results: Seven hundred eighty Asian participants from 15 countries were included in this analysis. SVR12 was achieved by 756/780 (96.9%) of all participants, including 748/772 (96.9%) of those who received elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12?weeks and 8/8 (100%) of those who received elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin for 16?weeks. In the genotype 1b-infected population, the SVR12 rate was 691/709 (97.5%), and there was no impact of age, high baseline viral load, or presence of cirrhosis. The most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis (8.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.4%), and diarrhea (5.2%). Twenty participants receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12?weeks reported a total of 25 serious adverse events, and 7 (0.9%) discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Conclusion: Elbasvir/grazoprevir administered for 12?weeks is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment option for Asian individuals with hepatitis C virus genotype 1b infection. ? 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; elbasvir plus grazoprevir; nonstructural protein 3; nonstructural protein 5A; ribavirin; virus RNA; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; Asian; brain infarction; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; fatigue; female; headache; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 4; human; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nausea; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; reinfection; rhinopharyngitis; side effect; sustained virologic response; treatment duration; upper respiratory tract infection; virus load"
"A Temporal Approach for Air Quality Forecast","2019","Recently, air pollution caused by particulate matter that the diameter is less than or equal to 2.5??μg/m3 has become an important issue. It is so tiny that it can go through alveolar microvascular and enter our body. PM2.5 makes a significant impact on human health. Therefore, monitoring and forecasting the air quality is an indispensable task for human society. Nowadays, we can easily acquire Air Quality Indices (AQIs) by installing a small-scale air quality sensor or downloading from some freely authorized databases. However, people demand farther PM2.5 information to plan their route. This research aims to forecast PM2.5 value in the future hours. Previous studies indicated that the air quality varies nonlinearly in urban areas and depends on several factors such as temperature, humidity and wind speed. Therefore, we combine air quality data from AirBox and meteorology data to forecast PM2.5 value. Air quality is a continuous data. If monitored air quality is good at the last time stamp, the next monitored air quality has high possibility to be good at the same location. And air quality may have some regular in the history data. We forecast PM2.5 values via the algorithm similar to weighted average method. It can figure out the time intervals with similar weather condition. Finally, the error is calculated to examine the accuracy of our method. In contrast to a famous method, Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, our method preforms well and stable with farther forecast. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Database systems; Forecasting; Meteorology; Wind; Air quality data; Air quality forecasts; Air quality indices; AirBox; Correlation coefficient; Particulate Matter; Temporal approach; Weighted average method; Air quality"
"Co-precipitation Synthesis of Near-infrared Iron Oxide Nanocrystals on Magnetically Targeted Imaging and Photothermal Cancer Therapy via Photoablative Protein Denature","2019","Near-infrared (NIR)-based nanomaterials that provide efficient tumor ablation for cancer therapy have been reported. However, the issues of biocompatibility of metals or ions in inorganic nanoparticles systems such as copper and gold nanoparticles are still a matter of concern. In this study, we developed a facile and ligand-assisted co-precipitation method to synthesize biocompatible iron oxide (IO) nanocrystals with NIR absorption that provided T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and photothermal ablation characteristics suitable for cancer theranostics. Our results showed that 150-nm particles can be synthesized and optimized by using different amounts of ligand. NIR-IO nanocrystals of this size showed high photothermal conversion efficiency (21.2%) and T2-weighted MR contrast (transverse relaxivity value approximately 141 S-1 mM-1). The NIR-IO nanocrystals showed no cytotoxicity in HT-29 colorectal cancer cells without irradiation, whereas the viability of cells that received NIR-IO nanocrystals decreased significantly after 808-nm laser irradiation. The mechanism of cell death may involve alterations in protein secondary structure and membrane permeability. For in vivo studies, 4-fold enhanced tumor accumulation was significantly observed of NIR-IO nanocrystals with a magnetic field (MF) application, resulting in a 3-fold higher T2-weighted MR signal than that produced by a commercial T2-weighted MR contrast agent (Resovist?) and excellent photothermal efficacy (approximately 53 °C) for cancer treatment. The innovative NIR-IO nanocrystals showed excellent biocompatibility and have great potential as a theranostic agent against cancer.",""
"Antibacterial Activity of Cysteine-Derived Cationic Dipeptides","2019","Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, especially in the treating of life-threatening diseases like sepsis. One way to address such an issue is with the use of antimicrobial peptides, which can kill many types of bacteria by disrupting cellular targets (such as membranes) through electrostatic interaction. In this report, cysteine-derived cationic dipeptides lysine–cysteine (KC), arginine–cysteine (RC) and histidine–cysteine (HC) were used to evaluate antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and positive bacteria. The dipeptides exhibited bacterial membrane rupture capabilities under SEM observation after treatment with IC50 conditions, as well as low cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity toward normal cell lines and human red blood cells (RBCs) at IC50. Furthermore, the dipeptides significantly ameliorated Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)-induced lethality in Caenorhabditis elegans in a dose-dependent manner. These cysteine-derived cationic dipeptides may provide a novel alternative therapy in combating bacterial infection. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",""
"Postpartum deep vein thrombosis resolved by catheter-directed thrombolysis: A case report","2019","Rationale:Postpartum deep vein thrombosis is a unique condition in diagnosis and treatment. Rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant, is indicated for acute deep vein thrombosis, but limited data have been reported for postpartum women. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is a common procedure for treating acute deep vein thrombosis, but it is rarely used for postpartum patients, especially after more than 3 months.Patient concerns:A 31-year-old Asian woman suffered from progressive erythematous swelling and local heat of the left lower limb after twin delivery.Diagnoses:Venous duplex ultrasound examination showed thrombus formation in the left femoral vein and popliteal vein with reduced compressibility. After standard treatment of novel oral anticoagulant therapy for 4 months, we observed only partial improvement of the symptoms, and the condition deteriorated after her ordinary activities.Interventions:Venography was performed and a large amount of thrombus lining from left femoral vein to left iliac vein was noted with total occluded left common iliac vein. After catheter-directed thrombolysis and balloon dilatation, better flow was regained and her symptoms improved completely after procedure.Outcomes:During a 1-year follow-up without medication, the patient did not complain about leg swelling, exercise aggravation, or any other post-thrombotic symptoms.Lessons:Pregnancy seems to be a transient provoking factor for deep vein thrombosis, but it is sometimes refractory even during the postpartum period.Follow-up imaging studies should be encouraged to confirm the vessel condition, particularly for applying down-titration or discontinuation strategies of medication.Catheter-directed thrombolysis could be considered as an alternative method for postpartum iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis. Postpartum women usually have favorable functional status and lower bleeding risk.Rivaroxaban is a favorable choice for deep vein thrombosis, but its use in postpartum women is still controversial, and evidence of its effectiveness is not available. Thus, endovascular intervention can be a relatively safe therapy, in addition to anticoagulation therapy for premenopausal patients with recurrent deep vein thrombosis. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Automatic HCC Detection Using Convolutional Network with Multi-Magnification Input Images","2019","Liver cancer postoperative pathologic examination of stained tissues is an important step in identifying prognostic factors for follow-up care. Traditionally, liver cancer detection would be performed by pathologists with observing the entire biological tissue, resulting in heavy work loading and potential misjudgment. Accordingly, the studies of the automatic pathological examination have been popular for a long period of time. Most approaches of the existing cancer detection, however, only extract cell level information based on single-scale high-magnification patch. In liver tissues, common cell change phenomena such as apoptosis, necrosis, and steatosis are similar in tumor and benign. Hence, the detection may fail when the patch only covered the changed cells area that cannot provide enough neighboring cell structure information. To conquer this problem, the convolutional network architecture with multi-magnification input can provide not only the cell level information by referencing high-magnification patches, but also the cell structure information by referencing low-magnification patches. The detection algorithm consists of two main structures: 1) extraction of cell level and cell structure level feature maps from high-magnification and low-magnification images respectively by separate general convolutional networks, and 2) integration of multi-magnification features by fully connected network. In this paper, VGG16 and Inception V4 were applied as the based convolutional network for liver tumor detection task. The experimental results showed that VGG16 based multi-magnification input convolutional network achieved 91% mIOU on HCC tumor detection task. In addition, with comparison between single-scale CNN (SSCN) and multi-scale CNN (MSCN) approaches, the MSCN demonstrated that the multi-scale patches could provide better performance on HCC classification task. ? 2019 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Cell death; Diseases; Histology; Network architecture; Pathology; Tumors; Classification tasks; Convolutional networks; Detection algorithm; Fully connected networks; Liver cancer detection; Magnification images; multi-scale CNN; pathologic; Convolution"

"Elevated miR-200a and miR-141 inhibit endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor expression and ciliogenesis in preeclampsia","2019","Key points: Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) is a critical factor that facilitates trophoblast invasion in placenta. Plasma miR-141 and miR-200a levels were elevated, while EG-VEGF was decreased in peripheral blood and placenta of preeclamptic patients. Furthermore, numbers of cilia in the placenta from preeclamptic women were significantly decreased. Elevated miR-141 and miR-200a inhibited the expression of EG-VEGF, downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/matrix metalloproteinase 9 signalling and cilia formation, thus leading to defective trophoblast invasion. The growth of the primary cilium, which transduced ERK signalling upon EG-VEGF induction for proper trophoblast invasion, was also inhibited by miR-141 and miR-200a upregulation. Abstract: Preeclampsia is a severe gestational complication, and inadequate trophoblast invasion during placental development is an important pathoaetiology. Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) is a critical factor that facilitates trophoblast invasion in placenta. By binding to the primary cilium, EG-VEGF initiates the signalling cascade for proper embryo implantation and placental development. The miR-200 family was predicted to target the EG-VEGF 5′-untranslated region, and its specific binding site was confirmed using a dual luciferase and a co-transfection assay. In the peripheral blood and placenta of preeclamptic patients, EG-VEGF showed significantly lower expression, whereas plasma miR-141 and miR-200a had higher expression compared with the controls. The biological significance of miR-141 and miR-200a was verified using an overexpression method in a trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo). Elevated miR-141 and miR-200a inhibited the expression of EG-VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling, thus leading to defective trophoblast invasion. Additionally, the growth of the primary cilium, which transduces ERK/MMP9 signalling upon EG-VEGF induction, was inhibited by miR-141 and miR-200a upregulation. Furthermore, the number of cilia in the human placenta of preeclamptic women was significantly decreased compared to normal placenta. In conclusion, the study uncovers the clinical correlations among the miR-200 family, EG-VEGF and the primary cilium in preeclampsia and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results indicate that miR-141 and miR-200a directly targeted EG-VEGF, suppressed primary cilia formation and inhibited trophoblast invasion. Thus, miR-141 and miR-200a could be explored as promising miRNA biomarkers and therapeutic targets in preeclampsia. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Non-nutritive artificial sweeteners as an emerging contaminant in environment: A global review and risks perspectives","2019","Generally, non-nutritive artificial sweeteners are widely utilized as sugar substitute in various applications. With various applications, non-nutritive artificial sweeteners are now being recognized as emerging contaminants with high water persistence and are chemically stable in environment. Although non-nutritive artificial sweeteners were documented on their occurrence in environment, yet their potential impacts to environment and human health remain ambiguous. Therefore, this review was prepared to provide a more comprehensive insight of non-nutritive artificial sweeteners in environment matrixes by highlighting special concerns on human health and environmental risks. Precisely, this review monitors the exploration of non-nutritive artificial sweeteners occurrences as an emerging contaminants in environment worldwide and their associated risks to human as well as environment. At present, there are a total of 24 non-nutritive artificial sweeteners’ studies with regards to their occurrence in the environment from 38 locations globally, spanning across Europe including United Kingdoms, Canada, United States and Asia. Overall, the quantitative findings suggested that the occurrence of non-nutritive artificial sweeteners is present in surface water, tap water, groundwater, seawater, lakes and atmosphere. Among these environmental matrixes, surface water was found as the most studied matrix involving non-nutritive artificial sweeteners. However, findings on non-nutritive artificial sweeteners impacts on human health and environment are limited to understanding its overall potential impacts and risks. Additionally, this review also serves as a framework for future monitoring plans and environmental legislative to better control these emerging contaminants in environment. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","acesulfame; aspartame; cyclamate sodium; ground water; neotame; nonnutritive sweetener; rebaudioside A; saccharin; sea water; sucralose; surface water; tap water; unclassified drug; drinking water; nonnutritive sweetener; anthropogenic source; chemical pollutant; food processing; global perspective; pollution effect; pollution incidence; pollution monitoring; risk assessment; air pollution; Article; Asia; Canada; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental policy; Europe; geographic distribution; lake; pollutant; quantitative analysis; risk factor; United Kingdom; United States; analysis; atmosphere; chemistry; human; international cooperation; risk assessment; water pollutant; Asia; Canada; United Kingdom; United States; Atmosphere; Drinking Water; Groundwater; Humans; Internationality; Lakes; Non-Nutritive Sweeteners; Risk Assessment; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"IL-29 promoted obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance","2019","Adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk plays a critical role to regulate adipose tissue microenvironment and cause chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity. Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/M2 macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic disorders. ? 2019, CSI and USTC.",""
"An allied health rehabilitation program for patients following surgery for abdomino-pelvic cancer: a feasibility and pilot clinical study","2019","Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of conducting a rehabilitation program for patients following surgery for abdomino-pelvic cancer. Methods: A non-randomised controlled before-and-after study. Patients who had undergone surgery for stage I–III abdomino-pelvic cancer (colorectal, gynaecological or prostate cancer) were recruited. The rehabilitation group (n = 84) received an 8-week, bi-weekly education and exercise program conducted by a physiotherapist, exercise physiologist, health psychologist and dietician, supplemented by exercise diaries and telephone coaching sessions. The comparator group (n = 104) completed postal questionnaires only. Feasibility measures, functional exercise capacity, muscle strength, physical activity levels, pelvic floor symptoms, anxiety and depression, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and self-efficacy were measured at baseline (time 1), immediately post-intervention (time 2) and at 6?months post-baseline (time 3) and compared within- and between-groups. Results: The consent rate to the rehabilitation program was 24%. Eighty-one percent of the rehabilitation group attended 85–100% of 16 scheduled sessions. Overall satisfaction with the program was 96%. Functional exercise capacity, handgrip strength in males, bowel symptoms, physical activity levels, depression and HRQoL were significantly improved in the rehabilitation group (p < 0.05) at time 2. The improvements in all these outcomes were sustained at time 3. The rehabilitation group had significantly improved physical activity levels, depression and HRQoL compared with the comparator group at times 2 and 3 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Recruitment to this oncology rehabilitation program was more difficult than expected; however, attendance and patient satisfaction were high. This program had positive effects on several important clinical outcomes in patients following abdomino-pelvic cancer treatment.

"Fucoxanthin Protects against oxLDL-Induced Endothelial Damage via Activating the AMPK-Akt-CREB-PGC1α Pathway","2019","Scope: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most prevalent cause of mortality and morbidity. Fucoxanthin (FX) possesses anti-hypertensive and anti-obesity properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of FX on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced oxidative injuries in human endothelial cells are still largely unknown. This study aims to test the hypothesis that FX protects against oxLDL-induced oxidative stress by upregulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and to explore the roles of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Methods and Results: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells are treated with oxLDL in the presence or absence of FX. FX significantly increases AMPK phosphorylation. In addition, FX diminishes oxLDL-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation by inhibiting protein kinase C and subsequently inducing reactive oxygen species generation and impairing the activity of the endogenous antioxidant enzyme superoxidase dismutase. Furthermore, FX restores oxLDL-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt and decreases CREB and PGC-1α expression to nearly normal levels. Moreover, FX ameliorates the oxLDL-mediated suppression of mitochondrial function and apoptosis. Conclusion: These findings provide new insights into the possible molecular mechanisms by which FX mitigates oxLDL-induced endothelial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Sustained release of recombinant thrombomodulin from cross-linked gelatin/hyaluronic acid hydrogels potentiate wound healing in diabetic mice","2019","Thrombomodulin (TM) is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surfaces of endothelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes. It is known to regulate blood coagulation, inflammation, and cell-cell adhesion. A recombinant TM, which contains an epidermal growth factor-like domain and serine/threonine-riches domain, has been demonstrated to stimulate cell proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and wound healing. In this study, we developed the biodegradable hydrogels and evaluated the efficacy of sustained release of rhTM from the hydrogel for the treatment of diabetic wounds. The hydrogels were composed of gelatin with or without hyaluronic acid, and fabricated by chemical cross-linking followed by lyophilization. Gelatin-based hydrogels had porous structure, good swelling property, and were biodegradable with characteristics of slow rhTM release in a short term. The once every-3-day rhTM-loaded hydrogel (with hyaluronic acid) markedly promoted wound healing and were superior to rhTM solution, once daily rhTM hydrogel (without hyaluronic acid), hydrogel controls, and once every-3-day rhEGF hydrogel treatment groups. The rhTM hydrogels enhanced granulation tissue formation, re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis in wound repair. The once every-3-day rhTM hydrogel was stable and drug release was maintained up to 11-month of storage at 4 °C. The developed rhTM hydrogels could meet the needs for clinical practice, and may have future medical applications for wound care in diabetic patients. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","gelatin; hyaluronic acid; recombinant thrombomodulin; collagen; gelatin; hyaluronic acid; recombinant protein; thrombomodulin; angiogenesis; animal experiment; Article; chronic wound; controlled study; cross linking; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; drug delivery system; drug design; epithelization; freeze drying; granulation tissue; hydrogel; keratinocyte; male; mouse; nonhuman; storage temperature; sustained drug release; wound healing; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; comparative study; complication; delayed release formulation; drug effect; drug release; drug stability; drug storage; experimental diabetes mellitus; hydrogel; metabolism; wound healing; Animals; Collagen; Delayed-Action Preparations; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Drug Liberation; Drug Stability; Drug Storage; Gelatin; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogels; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Re-Epithelialization; Recombinant Proteins; Thrombomodulin; Wound Healing"
"An overview of microbiome based strategies on anti-obesity","2019","With the significant global obesity epidemic and emerging strong scientific evidence that connected gut microbiota to obesity, intervening obesity by targeting gut microbiota has become a trendy strategy. Particularly the application of probiotics has become remarkably popular because of their expected association with gut microbiota modulation. Although there are many literatures on the effects of probiotics in obese animal models, most of them reported the effects of probiotic bacteria on metabolic indications with limited information on anti-obesity itself. Besides, some probiotics have been shown to reduce certain metabolic symptoms but they failed to achieve weight loss. This report reviewed the current literatures on the anti-obesity effects of next-generation probiotics in various animal obesity models and discussed the beneficial potential of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating obesity in humans. The purpose of this article is to help guide further research improve the probiotic bacteria experiments in more precise animal obesity models by standardizing the anti-obesogenesis, obesity control, and treatment assays and hopefully the evidence-based investigations on harnessing gut microbiota through next-generation probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation will develop new interventions to promote and achieve anti-obesity. ? 2019 The Authors.","probiotic agent; antiobesity agent; probiotic agent; antiobesity activity; disease control; fecal microbiota transplantation; genotype environment interaction; human; intestine flora; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; obesity; Review; adult; breast; civil union; cohabiting person; cohort analysis; congenital disorder; electronic health record; ethnicity; female; general hospital; genital system; hospital admission; hospitalization; ICD-10; intoxication; major clinical study; male; married person; mental health care; musculoskeletal system; neoplasm; pelvis; personality disorder; priority journal; resident; retrospective study; sensitivity analysis; social status; social stratification; urogenital system; animal; genetics; microbiology; obesity; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Obesity; Probiotics"
"Hypoxia-induced Slug SUMOylation enhances lung cancer metastasis 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis 06 Biological Sciences 0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology","2019","Background: The Slug-E-cadherin axis plays a critical role in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) where aberrant upregulation of Slug promotes cancer metastasis. Now, the post-translational modifications of Slug and their regulation mechanisms still remain unclear in lung cancer. Hence, exploring the protein linkage map of Slug is of great interest for investigating the scenario of how Slug protein is regulated in lung cancer metastasis. Methods: The Slug associated proteins, Ubc9 and SUMO-1, were identified using yeast two-hybrid screening; and in vitro SUMOylation assays combined with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed to explore the detail events and regulations of Slug SUMOylation. The functional effects of SUMOylation on Slug proteins were examined by EMSA, reporter assay, ChIP assay, RT-PCR, migration and invasion assays in vitro, tail vein metastatic analysis in vivo, and also evaluated the association with clinical outcome of NSCLC patients. Results: Slug protein could interact with Ubc9 and SUMO-1 and be SUMOylated in cells. Amino acids 130-212 and 33-129 of Slug are responsible for its binding to Ubc9 and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS)y, respectively. SUMOylation could enhance the transcriptional repression activity of Slug via recruiting more HDAC1, resulting in reduced expression of downstream Slug target genes and enhanced lung cancer metastasis. In addition, hypoxia could increase Slug SUMOylation through attenuating the interactions of Slug with SENP1 and SENP2. Finally, high expression Slug and Ubc9 levels were associated with poor overall survival among NSCLC patients. Conclusions: Ubc9/PIASy-mediated Slug SUMOylation and subsequent HDAC1 recruitment may play a crucial role in hypoxia-induced lung cancer progression, and these processes may serve as therapeutic targets for NSCLC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","histone deacetylase 1; messenger RNA; protein inhibitor of activated STAT; protein Ubc9; proteinase; SENP1 protein; SENP2 protein; SUMO 1 protein; transcription factor Slug; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; cell hypoxia; cell invasion; cell migration; chromatin; controlled study; female; human; human cell; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; protein protein interaction; sumoylation; transcription regulation; transcriptional repression; complication; genetic transfection; genetics; lung tumor; metastasis; pathology; sumoylation; tumor cell line; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis; Sumoylation; Transfection"
"Degradative autophagy selectively regulates CCND1 (cyclin D1) and MIR224, two oncogenic factors involved in hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis","2019","Overexpressed CCND1 (cyclin D1) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and we used 147 tumor tissue samples from HCC patients and 3 murine models to reveal an inverse correlation between low autophagic activity and high CCND1 expression. These 2 phenomena in combination correlated with poor overall survival in HCC patients. Mechanistic analysis showed that activated autophagy triggered CCND1 ubiquitination followed by SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1)-mediated selective phagophore recruitment, autophagosome formation, fusion with a lysosome, and degradation. Functional studies revealed that autophagy-selective degradation of CCND1 suppresses DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and colony, and liver tumor formation by arresting the cell cycle at the G 1 phase. Most importantly, diverse pharmacological inducers (rapamycin and amiodarone) effectively suppress tumor growth in orthotopic liver tumor and subcutaneous tumor xenograft models. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a link between degradative autophagy and the cell cycle regulator CCND1, and have discovered the underlying mechanism by which the autophagic degradation machinery regulates the turnover of the cell-cycle regulator CCND1, which in turn affects HCC tumorigenesis.

"Factors associated with the intention to use adult preventive health services in Taiwan","2019","Objective: This research aimed to examine the factors associated with the intention to use adult preventive health services in Taiwan. Design and Sample: Using Andersen's behavioral model, we employed a cross-sectional descriptive design to investigate 500 samples from four communities in southern Taiwan. Measures: We used a self-reported survey to assess participants’ intention to use adult preventive health services, and the predisposing, enabling, and need factors influencing their intention. Results: Intention to use adult preventive health services was more significantly explained by predisposing and enabling factors than by need factors. In addition, a lack of fixed medical facilities (enabling factor) and Taiwanese origin (predisposing factor) were associated with decreased odds of intention to use adult preventive health services. An educational level of high school or below (predisposing factor), higher amounts of exercise (predisposing factor), and lower barriers to use preventive health services (predisposing factor) were associated with increased odds of intention to use adult preventive health services. Conclusion: The findings can assist public health nurses in identifying high-risk groups with lower intentions of using adult preventive health services. Additionally, community-based health education program can be developed to increase people's intention to use adult preventive health services. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; article; exercise; female; health education; high risk population; high school; human; human experiment; immigrant; major clinical study; male; nurse; preventive health service; psychological model; Taiwan"
"Comparison of the risk for dementia between physicians and the general population: a nationwide population-based cohort study","2019","Background: Physicians have better medical knowledge, which may decrease the risk of dementia; however, this issue remains unclear. This study was performed to clarify it. Methods: We conducted a nationwide population-based study that recruited 29,388 physicians, 50,000 participants from the general population, and 30,446 other healthcare professionals (HCPs; excluding physicians) for this study. The prevalence of dementia was compared among the three groups and physician subgroups by tracing their medical histories from 2006 to 2012. Results: Physicians had a lower prevalence of dementia than the general population after adjusting for age, sex, head trauma, hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, depression, and alcoholism [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47–0.67]. Other HCPs also had a lower prevalence for dementia than the general population (AOR 0.46; 95% CI 0.36–0.60). Compared with other HCPs, physicians had no difference in the prevalence for dementia (AOR 0.98 95% CI 0.71–1.36). Physicians who were older, specialized in pediatrics and worked at local hospitals and clinics had a higher prevalence for dementia than their counterparts did. Conclusions: Physicians had a lower prevalence for dementia than the general population. The prevalence for dementia in specific subgroups of physicians was higher, which needs to be clarified by further studies. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",""
"Resected specimen size: A reliable predictor of severe Frey syndrome after parotidectomy","2019","Background: Frey syndrome is a common complication after parotidectomy. This study aimed to investigate the potential predictors for developing severe Frey syndrome after parotidectomy and to identify patients who may benefit from additional preventive maneuvers. Methods: A total of 485 patients received parotidectomy because of parotid tumors at the Otolaryngology Department of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, from July 2009 to November 2015. Only 115 of 485 patients were included in this study and to fill in a questionnaire to determine the occurrence and severity of Frey syndrome. Results: A total of 115 parotidectomies were identified. 84 (73%, 84/115) patients were aware of the discomfort and were thus considered symptomatic. 39 (34%, 39/115) patients considered the symptoms apparently affected their quality of life. MSI tests showed that 56 (49%, 56/115) patients had a positive MSI test. By combining the results from symptom questionnaire and MSI test, 23 patients (20%, 23/115) had a severe form of Frey syndrome. Among all clinicopathological variables, the resected specimen size was the only significant predictor of the severe Frey syndrome group (P = 0.04). Disease pathology, tumor size, and adjuvant radiotherapy did not correlate with the severe Frey syndrome. Using receiver operating curve analysis, the best cutoff value of the resected specimen size (in largest dimension) for predicting severe Frey syndrome was 40 mm(sensitivity: 71.7%, specificity: 42.0%; area under the curve = 0.6483). The odds ratio of severe Frey syndrome with every 10 mm increase in the largest diameter of resected specimen was 1.30 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.68; P = 0.04). Conclusions: Resected specimen size is the only significant predictor of developing severe Frey syndrome after parotidectomy. Preventive interventions may have to be considered in high-risk patients whose resected specimen size (in largest dimension) is greater than 40 mm. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adjuvant radiotherapy; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; disease severity; female; Frey syndrome; high risk patient; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; parotid gland tumor; parotidectomy; postoperative complication; predictive value; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; retrospective study; surgical risk; tumor volume; university hospital"
"Seroepidemiology of dengue virus infection among adults during the ending phase of a severe dengue epidemic in southern Taiwan, 2015","2019","Background: A severe dengue epidemic occurred in 2015 which resulted in over 22,000 laboratory-confirmed cases. A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted during the ending phase of this epidemic to evaluate the true incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infection and the level of herd immunity. Methods: Adult residents in three administrative districts with high dengue incidence were recruited; workers in two districts with intermediate dengue incidence were also recruited for comparison. DENV-specific IgM and IgG were tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. DENV RNA was detected using commercial quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify risk factors for recent and past DENV infection. Results: The overall seroprevalence of anti-DENV IgM and IgG in 1391 participants was 6.8 and 17.4%, respectively. The risk of recent DENV infection increased with age, with the elderly having the highest risk of infection. Living in areas with high incidence of reported dengue cases and having family members being diagnosed with dengue in 2015 were also independent risk factors for recent DENV infection. One sample was found to have asymptomatic viremia with viral load as high as 10 5 PFU/ml. Conclusions: Comparing the seroprevalence of anti-DENV IgM with the incidence of reported dengue cases in 2015, we estimated that 1 out of 3.7 dengue infections were reported to the surveillance system; widespread use of rapid diagnostic tests might contribute to this high reporting rate. The results also indicate that the overall herd immunity remains low and the current approved Dengvaxia? is not quite suitable for vaccination in Taiwan. ? 2019 The Author(s).","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus RNA; virus antibody; adult; age; aged; Article; asymptomatic disease; cross-sectional study; dengue; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; female; herd immunity; human; incidence; infection risk; major clinical study; male; middle aged; population risk; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; seroepidemiology; seroprevalence; Taiwan; viremia; virus load; blood; Dengue virus; epidemic; immunology; seroepidemiology; severe dengue; statistics and numerical data; Antibodies, Viral; Dengue Virus; Epidemics; Humans; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Severe Dengue; Taiwan"

"Policy changes for preventing and recognizing overwork-related cardiovascular diseases in Taiwan: An overview","2019","Objective: Overwork-related cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) has a large impact on workers' rights and labor standards across East Asian countries. This article describes the background and impact of policies regarding overwork-related CVD in the past decades in Taiwan. Methods: We reviewed government policies, guidelines, literature, and news addressing the problems and impact of policy changes to prevent and recognize overwork-related CVD since the 1990s, and collected data on overwork-related CVD cases in Taiwan from 2006 to 2017. Results: In 2017, overwork-related CVD accounted for 13% of all cases of occupational diseases, but 79% of all deaths due to occupational diseases. Guidelines for recognizing overwork-related CVD cases were established in 1991; however, under-recognition exists in Taiwan due to poor exposure data on working hours and psychological factors and because most medical expenses are covered by the national health insurance system. Amendments on the guidelines, and stricter policies on overwork prevention were enforced following calls from labor unions, nongovernmental organizations, and legislators, but health disparities were introduced when certain industries were exempted from restrictions. Conclusions: Long working hours and other work characteristics increase the risk of overwork-related CVD. By reviewing the changes in policy for preventing overwork and recognizing overwork-related disease, we identified the need for clearly defined guidance on evaluating overwork-related CVD, with specific criteria for working hours and other risk factors regarding work characteristics. National policies that lead to better working conditions and prevent overwork-related diseases must be developed. ? 2019 Japan Society for Occupational Health.",""
"PiChat: Smartphone Application to Expand the Social Network for the Elderly","2019","The success in medical and multidisciplinary research has resulted in the longevity in human age. Longevity in human age has caused an increase in the elderly population, and this condition becomes a new phenomenon. The scientific and medical research focusing on the elderly becomes one of the biggest concerns, and cross-disciplinary cooperation to promote the health of the elderly is a global issue. However, many factors are affecting the physical and mental health of the elderly. The reduction in a social circle after retirement is a common problem for the elderly. Smaller social circle makes the elderly isolate and can cause loneliness. In order to reduce the problem, this study proposed a smartphone application called PiChat. This application manages to pair similar photos uploaded to help the elderly found new acquaintance and guidance of the conversation topic to begin. However, emphasizing the ease of use and considering the deterioration of the visual ability of the elderly, this application will lead the elderly to create a new social circle gradually. The preliminary test showed that this application is feasible to anticipate social circle reduction for the baby boomer’s elderly. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deterioration; mHealth; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Cross-disciplinary; Elderly populations; Interaction design; Multi-disciplinary research; Old age; Quality of life; Smart-phone applications; Visual abilities; Human computer interaction"
"Dietary behaviors mediate the association between food insecurity and obesity among socioeconomically disadvantaged youth","2019","Across many Asian countries, the prevalence of obesity is increasing and is increasingly recognized as an emerging public health issue. Food insecurity, defined as the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, is major difficulty faced by many poor subpopulations despite national economic growth. Previous research has yielded inconsistent results about the association between food insecurity and obesity, with positive associations more consistently observed among women than men. This study aims to elucidate relationships between food insecurity, dietary behaviors, and weight status, stratified by gender. Data come from the Taiwan Database of Children and Youth in Poverty. Participants (n = 1326) aged 10–18 years (2009–2013), which included measures of food security and dietary behaviors in three survey waves. Weight status was determined using self-reported body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) with the category “overweight/obesity” defined as a BMI above the 85th percentile within a representative population. Logistic regression analyses indicated a significant association between food insecurity and obesity/overweight with an odds ratio (OR) = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–1.70. Food insecurity was associated with a select number of unhealthy dietary behaviors. Skipping breakfast in females (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.20–2.22) and consuming snacks and sugared drinks in males (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.15–1.98) were associated with obesity/overweight. Food insecurity remained significantly associated with obesity/overweight after adjusting for dietary behaviors. In addition, there was some evidence that dietary behaviors mediated the association between food security and obesity/overweight. In conclusion, economically disadvantaged youth are vulnerable to food insecurity and obesity, and food insecurity may increase the likelihood of obesity due to its association with dietary behaviors. Understanding the mediating factors between food insecurity and obesity may help to amend weight-related health problems in poverty-affected populations. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","adolescent; Article; body mass; body weight; breakfast skipping; controlled study; fast food; feeding behavior; female; food insecurity; food security; household income; human; major clinical study; male; obesity; poverty; self report; sex difference; socioeconomics; sugar-sweetened beverage; underweight; vegetable"

The results revealed that the recoveries of AMX from the muscle, liver, and sera of eels were 84.7–105.1%, 81.8–104.9%, and 88.6–106.3%, respectively. The observed peak retention time was approximately 4.2 min. After administration of 40 mg kg?1 BW per day of AMX, the pharmacokinetic parameters were detected, respectively. The average drug residue concentration in muscles was 180 and 260 ng mL?1 on day 1 and day 2, respectively, and in the liver, it was 70 and 110 ng mL?1 on day 1 and day 2, respectively, after the 40 mg kg?1 BW daily AMX administration. Residue concentrations in the muscle and liver on day 3 after 40 mg kg?1 BW administrations were below the limit of detection (&lt;30 ng mL?1). On the other hand, the average drug residue concentration in muscles was 930 and 1070 ng mL?1 on day 1 and day 3, respectively, and in the liver, it was 35 and 95 ng mL?1 on day 1 and day 3, respectively, after 80 mg kg?1 BW AMX administration. However, the residue concentrations in the muscle and liver on day 5 after 80 mg kg?1 BW administration were below the detection limit (&lt;30 ng mL?1). The pharmacokinetic information derived from Japanese eel can be used to design rational dosing regimens and can also assist the Taiwan government in formulating laws and regulations for AMX residues in Japanese eels. Additionally, this information will provide greater protection to consumers of aquaculture products. ? 2019 The Authors",""
"Cardiopulmonary Bypass Time Predicts Early Postoperative Enterobacteriaceae Bloodstream Infection","2019","Background: A bloodstream infection in patients undergoing cardiovascular operations is crucial because it can result in significantly worse outcomes. However, microbiological patterns have rarely been investigated in these patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 1,041 adult patients who underwent cardiovascular operations using cardiopulmonary bypass from January 2013 to December 2017 at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan. The microbiological pattern and associated variables were analyzed in patients with early postoperative primary bloodstream infection. Results: Primary bloodstream infection developed in 28 patients (2.7%) within 7 days after cardiovascular operations using cardiopulmonary bypass. In patients with early primary bloodstream infection, 36 microorganisms were isolated, and a gram-negative bacillus was identified to be the predominant pathogen (28 of 36 [77.8%]). The most common microorganisms comprised the Enterobacter (n = 8) and Acinetobacter (n = 7) species, and 16 of the 28 gram-negative bacilli belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Compared with those without postoperative bloodstream infection, patients with Enterobacteriaceae family–related early postoperative bloodstream infections had a significantly longer cardiopulmonary bypass time and also worse early and late survival rates. Conclusions: Most patients with early primary bloodstream infection after cardiovascular operations using cardiopulmonary bypass were infected with gram-negative bacilli, and the Enterobacteriaceae family was the most common microorganism observed. Endogenous bacterial translocation after prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass is a possible mechanism of Enterobacteriaceae family–related early primary bloodstream infection in these patients. Prophylactic use of an antibiotic regimen with broader gram-negative bacteria coverage in cardiovascular surgical patients with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass should be considered. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","carbapenem; cefazolin; cefotaxime; cefuroxime; cotrimoxazole; gentamicin; quinolone derivative; sultamicillin; Acinetobacter; adult; Article; bloodstream infection; cardiopulmonary bypass; catheter infection; Citrobacter freundii; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep hypothermic circulatory arrest; Enterobacter; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; Escherichia coli; female; hospital mortality; human; Klebsiella pneumoniae; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pneumonia; postoperative infection; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; Serratia marcescens; surgical infection; survival rate; time; urinary tract infection; Youden index; adverse event; aged; bacteremia; cardiopulmonary bypass; Enterobacteriaceae infection; operation duration; postoperative complication; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; Taiwan; Aged; Bacteremia; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Survival Rate; Taiwan"
"A portable platform for the quantification of Vitamin D levels by using paper-based microfluidic","2019","Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to several diseases and adverse outcomes including: diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. At present the clear majority of vitamin D testing is performed in large-scale laboratories at the request of a physician as part of an annual panel of blood tests. Here we present a paper-based microfluidic system for rapid quantification of vitamin D levels on a portable platform. The system consists of a smartphone accessory, an app, and a test strip that allows the colorimetric detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D using a novel gold nanoparticle-based immunoassay. We show that the system can be used to accurately measure physiological levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with accuracy better than 25 nM and a precision of 10 nM. We compare our system with well-established ELISA test kits for serum samples of unknown concentration and demonstrate equivalency of the results. ? 2018 IEEE.","Biomedical engineering; Diseases; Gold nanoparticles; Microfluidics; 25-hydroxyvitamin d; Adverse outcomes; Cardio-vascular disease; Colorimetric detection; Joint Research centers; Paper-based microfluidics; Physiological levels; Vitamin-D; Vitamins"
"Risks of bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and traumatic brain injury among siblings of patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","2019","Background: Previous studies have suggested that the unaffected siblings of patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience deficits in attention, impulsivity control, and behavior inhibition, which are associated with health-risk behaviors. However, risks to mental and physical health among the unaffected siblings of ADHD probands have rarely been investigated. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5128 unaffected siblings of ADHD probands born between 1980 and 2000 were included in our study along with 20,512 age- and sex-matched controls, and they were followed from 1996 or birth until the end of 2011. Mental and physical health risks, including affective disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and sexually transmitted infection were identified during the follow-up period. Results: Logistic regression analyses with adjustments for demographic data showed that the unaffected siblings were more likely to develop unipolar depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39–2.22), bipolar disorder (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1. 09–4.05), and TBI (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.14–1.36) than were the control group. Discussion: The unaffected siblings of patients with ADHD were prone to developing unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, and TBI later in life. ? 2018","adolescent; Article; attention deficit disorder; bipolar disorder; brother; controlled study; female; health hazard; high risk behavior; human; impulsiveness; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental health; priority journal; sex difference; sexually transmitted disease; sibling; sister; traumatic brain injury; attention deficit disorder; bipolar disorder; child; complication; depression; major depression; mood disorder; risk factor; Taiwan; traumatic brain injury; young adult; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Bipolar Disorder; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Child; Depressive Disorder; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Mood Disorders; Risk Factors; Siblings; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Risk of heart failure in a population with type 2 diabetes versus a population without diabetes with and without coronary heart disease","2019","Aims: To conduct a population-based study comparing age- and sex-specific risk estimates of heart failure (HF) between people with type 2 diabetes and people without diabetes, and to investigate the risks of HF in association with type 2 diabetes in people with various coronary heart diseases (CHDs). Materials and methods: We used a nationally representative sample (one million people) selected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) system. A total of 34 291 patients with type 2 diabetes were identified from ambulatory care claims in 2000, and the same number of age- and sex-matched controls were randomly selected from the registry of NHI beneficiaries in the same year. All study subjects were linked to inpatient claims (2000-2013) to identify the possible admissions for HF. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, we compared the relative hazards of HF in relation to type 2 diabetes according to various age and sex stratifications. We also compared the relative hazard of HF between type 2 diabetes and controls, with and without histories of various CHDs and coronary revascularization procedures. Results: Compared with absence of diabetes (control group), type 2 diabetes was significantly associated with an increased hazard of HF (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-1.54]. In both sexes, those with type 2 diabetes aged <45 years had the highest increased hazard of HF, with an aHR of 2.54 (95% CI 1.62-3.98) and 4.12 (95% CI 2.35-7.23) for men and women, respectively. Compared with the control subjects without any CHD, people with type 2 diabetes without prior CHD had increased hazards of HF (aHR 1.54, 95% CI 1.41-1.68, in men and aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.43-1.71, in women), which were similar to the aHRs for people without diabetes who had histories of heart diseases (aHR 1.60 and 1.55 for men and women, respectively). Conclusions: Diabetes mellitus may increase the risk of HF in both men and women, as well as in all age groups, especially in young people. People with type 2 diabetes without CHD had a similarly increased risk of HF to that of control subjects with CHD. Certain coronary revascularization procedures and CHDs, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography, coronary artery bypass surgery and acute myocardial infarction, were found to greatly increase risk of HF in people with type 2 diabetes. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","acute heart infarction; adult; age distribution; ambulatory care; Article; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary angiography; coronary artery bypass surgery; disease association; female; follow up; heart failure; heart muscle revascularization; human; incidence; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; risk assessment; aged; complication; coronary artery disease; heart failure; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Coronary Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Taiwan"
"Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived interleukin-1β activates protumor C-C motif chemokine ligand 22 signaling in head and neck cancer","2019","Oral cancer, a subtype of head and neck cancer, is characterized by increased infiltrating regulatory T cells (Treg); however, the pathological significance of the increase in Tregs in disease prognosis and progression and their underlying mechanism remain unestablished. C-C motif chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) has been implicated in the recruitment of Tregs. We used RT-qPCR to determine CCL22 mRNA expression in clinical specimens and cultured cells. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies were carried out to analyze the effects of CCL22 modulations on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis and the mechanism involved in the deregulation of CCL22. In oral cancer specimens, CCL22 mRNA was upregulated. The increase was not only associated with reduced disease-free survival but also strongly correlated with an increase in FOXP3 mRNA, a master regulator of Treg development and functions. Silencing CCL22 expression reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas ectopic overexpression showed opposite effects. Manipulation of CCL22 expression in cancer cells altered tumorigenesis in both immune-compromised and -competent mice, supporting both autonomous and non-autonomous actions of CCL22. Release of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) induces CCL22 mRNA expression in oral cancer cells by activating transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Our data support a model in which CAF-derived IL-1β, CCL22, and its receptor CCR4 foster a protumor environment by promoting cell transformation and Treg infiltration. Intervention of the IL-1β-CCL22-CCR4 signaling axis may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for oral cancer treatment. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Effects of childhood adversity and resilience on Taiwanese youth health behaviors","2019","Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can leave negative impacts on one's health behaviors or social functioning later in life. Resilient characteristics have been shown to mitigate effects against risk behaviors in developing adolescents. However, clinical and research attention has rarely been given to jointly consider the effects of ACEs and resilient characteristics on health behaviors in Taiwanese youth. Method: A total of 200 individuals aged 15–22 years were recruited from primary care settings, communities, and schools. Participants completed questionnaires assessing their ACEs, resilient characteristics, and health behaviors. Univariate analysis was firstly used to describe the correlates of ACEs and resilient characteristics. Further multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of both factors with health behaviors. Results: More than half (61.5%) of those surveyed had been exposed to at least one category of ACE. Verbal (37%) and physical (21%) abuses were the most common types of ACEs. The counts in the ACE categories were associated with being involved in physical fights (odds ratio 1.28 [confidence interval 1.01–1.63]), property damage (1.29 [1.03–1.61]), running away from home (1.30 [1.05–1.60]), bullying victimization (1.37 [1.16–1.61]), and sleep problems/tiredness (1.25 [1.03–1.52]). Meanwhile, resilience scores were associated with decreased odds of infrequent seatbelt use (0.47 [0.23–0.97]), low fruit and vegetable intake (0.42 [0.21–0.86]) unsatisfied body image (0.46 [0.22–0.97]), and sleep problems/tiredness (0.37 [0.18–0.79]). Conclusions: ACEs and resilience characteristics play a significant role in shaping youth health behaviors. Further research should be undertaken to identify ways to build resilience against health risks in youth with prior ACE exposure. ? 2018","adolescent; adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; alcohol consumption; Article; Article; body image; body image; bullying; bullying; childhood adversity; childhood adversity; death; death; drinking behavior; drinking behavior; fatigue; fatigue; female; female; food intake; food intake; fruit; fruit; health behavior; health behavior; household; household; human; human relation; human relation; male; male; physical abuse; physical abuse; physical activity; physical activity; psychological resilience; psychological resilience; questionnaire; questionnaire; sleep; sleep; Taiwanese; Taiwanese; vegetable; vegetable; verbal hostility; verbal hostility; wellbeing; wellbeing"
"Designing an Interactive Device to Slow Progression of Alzheimer’s Disease","2019","Inactive sedentary working styles result in many people exercising insufficiently, leading to poor blood circulation and decreased blood flow of the brain. Consequently, amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulates in the brain, impairing nerve conduction and potentially causing nervous necrosis, both of which cause Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include inability to recognize orientation in space and memory decline, along with amyotrophic Hippocampus, and low Neurotrophic content and Cerebral blood flow. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a crucial component for brain nerve growth, abundant BDNF alleviates nervous necrosis. An environment with BDNF secretion is directly proportional to cerebral blood flow. Research has indicated that engaging in puzzle games and finger motor exercises can mitigate and ameliorate Alzheimer’s disease. Performing tasks with the fingers make extensive use of the brain’s motor and somatosensory cortices, thus promoting activity and increased blood flow in the brain to generate more BDNF facilitating brain neuron growth. The goal of this research is to increase cerebral circulation, through patient-oriented activity, to elucidate which activities increase cerebral circulation, and sustained local motion enhancing muscle contraction that increases blood flow velocity. These three game guidelines are devised to improve spatial cognition and increase cerebral circulation. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Behavioral research; Blood; Flow velocity; Hemodynamics; Human computer interaction; Alzheimer disease; Blood circulation; Brain-derived neurotrophic factors; Cerebral blood flow; Cerebral circulation; Muscle contractions; Somatosensory cortex; Spatial cognition; Brain"
"Pigment epithelium-derived factor inhibits lung cancer migration and invasion by upregulating exosomal thrombospondin 1","2019","Exosomes are implicated in cancer cell development, migration and invasion. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a secreted anticancer protein that can regulate lung cancer progression; however, the role of PEDF in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including metastasis and cancer cell-derived exosome secretion, is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the effects of PEDF on exosome-mediated migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity of cultured NSCLC cells. The results showed that PEDF overexpression significantly reduced NSCLC invasion and migration, while inducing cell aggregation, whereas PEDF knockdown had the opposite effects. Exosomes from NSCLC cells treated with recombinant PEDF had a significantly reduced ability to promote cancer cell motility, migration, and invasion compared to exosomes from untreated cells. Exosomes from PEDF-treated cells contained thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), which inhibited cytoskeletal remodeling and exosome-induced lung cancer cell motility, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, PEDF-overexpressing NSCLC cells formed smaller xenograft tumors with higher THBS1 expression compared to control tumors. Our findings indicate that PEDF decreases the metastatic potential of NSCLC cells through regulation of THBS1 release in cancer cell-derived exosomes, thus uncovering a new mechanism of lung cancer progression. ? 2018 The Author(s)","pigment epithelium derived factor; recombinant protein; thrombospondin 1; eye protein; nerve growth factor; pigment epithelium-derived factor; serine proteinase inhibitor; thrombospondin 1; thrombospondin-1, human; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer cell culture; carcinogenicity; cell aggregation; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; controlled study; exosome; human; human cell; in vivo study; intracellular signaling; male; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; tumor invasion; upregulation; A-549 cell line; animal; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; SCID mouse; signal transduction; tumor invasion; tumor volume; A549 Cells; Animals; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Movement; Exosomes; Eye Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Nerve Growth Factors; Serpins; Signal Transduction; Thrombospondin 1; Tumor Burden; Up-Regulation"
"Suicidality Among Gay and Bisexual Men in Taiwan: Its Relationships with Sexuality and Gender Role Characteristics, Homophobic Bullying Victimization, and Social Support","2019","This study aimed to examine the associations of suicidality in emerging adulthood with time of coming out, gender role nonconformity, sexual orientation, traditional and cyber homophobic bullying victimization, and family and peer support during childhood in gay and bisexual men in Taiwan. The frequency of “experiencing suicide ideation” and “attempting suicide” in the past year among 500 gay or bisexual men was examined. The participants’ time of coming out, level of subjective masculinity, sexual orientation, experiences of traditional and cyber homophobic bullying victimization, and levels of family and peer support during childhood were also evaluated. In total, 31% (n = 155) of participants reported experiencing suicide ideation (n = 82) or attempting suicide (n = 73). Early coming out, traditional homophobic bullying victimization, and low family support during childhood increased the risk of suicidality in emerging adulthood; by contrast, family support did not moderate the association of early coming out or traditional bullying victimization with current suicidality. A high proportion of participants reported experiencing suicide ideation and attempt in emerging adulthood. Hence, effective suicide prevention is required for gay and bisexual men. Suicide prevention programs should consider time of coming out, traditional homophobic bullying victimization, and level of family support. ? 2018 The American Association of Suicidology","adult; bisexuality; bullying; crime victim; gender identity; homophobia; human; male; male homosexuality; psychology; questionnaire; sexual and gender minority; social support; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Bisexuality; Bullying; Crime Victims; Gender Identity; Homophobia; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Support; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Supplementation with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate alleviates ultraviolet B-inflicted oxidative damage in folate-deficient zebrafish","2019","Ultraviolet (UV) is an omnipresent environmental carcinogen transmitted by sunlight. Excessive UV irradiation has been correlated to an increased risk of skin cancers. UVB, the most mutagenic component among the three UV constituents, causes damage mainly through inducing DNA damage and oxidative stress. Therefore, strategies or nutrients that strengthen an individual's resistance to UV-inflicted harmful effects shall be beneficial. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin essential for nucleotides biosynthesis, and also a strong biological antioxidant, hence a micronutrient with potential of modulating individual's vulnerability to UV exposure. In this study, we investigated the impact of folate status on UV sensitivity and the protective activity of folate supplementation using a zebrafish model. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and morphological injury were observed in the larvae exposed to UVB, which were readily rescued by supplementing with folic acid, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). The UVB-inflicted abnormalities and mortality were worsened in Tg(hsp:EGFP-γGH) larvae displaying folate deficiency. Intriguingly, only supplementation with 5-CHO-THF, as opposed to folic acid, offered significant and consistent protection against UVB-inflicted oxidative damage in the folate-deficient larvae. We concluded that the intrinsic folate status correlates with the vulnerability to UVB-induced damage in zebrafish larvae. In addition, 5-CHO-THF surpassed both folic acid and NAC in preventing UVB-inflicted oxidative stress and injury in our current experimental zebrafish model. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","acetylcysteine; folic acid; folinic acid; acetylcysteine; antioxidant; folinic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; vitamin B complex; cyprinid; injury; mortality; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species; ultraviolet B radiation; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; embryo; folic acid deficiency; larva; mortality; nonhuman; oxidative stress; radiation protection; ultraviolet B radiation; vitamin supplementation; zebra fish; adverse event; animal; dietary supplement; drug effect; folic acid deficiency; metabolism; oxidative stress; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; Danio rerio; Acetylcysteine; Animals; Antioxidants; Dietary Supplements; Folic Acid Deficiency; Larva; Leucovorin; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Ultraviolet Rays; Vitamin B Complex; Zebrafish"
"Tris(8-Hydroxyquinoline)iron induces apoptotic cell death via oxidative stress and by activating death receptor signaling pathway in human head and neck carcinoma cells","2019","Background: 8-Hydroxyquinoline derivatives have highly sensitive fluorescent chemosensors for metal ions, which are associated with anti-oxidant, anti-tumor and anti-HIV-1 properties. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is associated with a high rate of mortality and novel anti-HNSCC drugs must be developed. Therefore, effective chemotherapy agents are required to address this public health issue. Hypothesis/Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)iron (Feq3) on the HNSCC and the underlying mechanism. Study design/Methods: A novel 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative, Feq3, was synthesized. The cell viabilities were analyzed using MTT reagent. Apoptosis and the cell cycle distributions were determined by flow cytometer. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, western blot, MitoSOX and CellROX stain assay were used to study the mechanism of Feq3. Feq3 combined with antioxidants NAC (N-acetylcysteine) and BSO (buthionine sulfoximine) measured the cell viability and intracellular ROS. Results: Feq3 induced the death of HNSCC cells and caused them to exhibit the morphological features of apoptosis. Feq3 also induced apoptosis of SCC9 cells by cell cycle arrest during the G2/M phase and the induced arrest of SCC25 cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases, which was associated with decreased cyclin B1/cdc2 and cyclin D/cdk4 expressions. Feq3 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduces glutathione (GSH) levels, and responds to increased p53 and p21 expressions. Feq3 induced apoptosis by mitochondria-mediated Bax and cytochrome c up-expression and down-expression Bcl-2. Feq3 also up-regulated tBid, which interacts with the mitochondrial pathway and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/TNF-Rs, FasL/Fas, and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL-Rs)/TRAIL-dependent caspases apoptotic signaling pathway in HNSCC cells. However, Feq3 activates Fas but not FasL in SCC25 cells. Feq3 arrests the growth of HNSCC cells and is involved in the mitochondria- and death receptor (DR)-mediated caspases apoptotic pathway. Conclusion: This study is the first to suggest that apoptosis mediates the anti-HNSCC of Feq3. Feq3 has potential as a cancer therapeutic agent against HNSCC. ? 2019","8 quinolinol derivative; acetylcysteine; adaptor protein; antineoplastic agent; benzyloxycarbonylleucylglutamylhistidylaspartyl fluoromethyl ketone; beta actin; buthionine sulfoximine; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; cyclin B1; cyclin B2; cyclin D; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cytochrome c; death receptor; glutathione; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p21; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; tris(8 hydroxyquinoline)iron; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor; unclassified drug; A-375 cell line; A-431 cell line; apoptosis; Article; basal cell carcinoma cell line; cancer chemotherapy; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle progression; cell population; cell structure; cell viability; chemical structure; chromosome condensation; clinical feature; death domain; down regulation; drug mechanism; flow cytometry; gene expression; growth inhibition; HaCat cell line; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line; IC20; IC50; immunofluorescence; immunofluorescence microscopy; MIC80; mitochondrion; MTT assay; nonhuman; oxidative stress; percentage of apoptotic cells; phase contrast microscopy; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SCC-9 cell line; signal transduction; solid phase synthesis; synthesis; upregulation; UT-SCC-5 cell line; Western blotting"

Because HER2 status was not captured in the ATTRACTION-2 trial, we used patients with prior trastuzumab use (Tmab+) as surrogate for HER2 expression status to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab as third- or later-line therapy in these patients. Methods: In ATTRACTION-2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 multicenter trial, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (3?mg/kg) or placebo every 2?weeks until disease progression or toxicity requiring study discontinuation. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety were assessed. Results: Of 493 enrolled patients, 81 (nivolumab, n = 59; placebo, n = 22) were Tmab+ and 412 (nivolumab, n = 271; placebo, n = 141) were Tmab?.

"Esophageal reconstruction after oncological total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy: Algorithmic approach","2019","Background: Reconstruction for total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy is accomplished mainly by gastrointestinal transposition but can be complicated by anastomotic tension or associated neck-skin defect. Here, we present the results of total esophageal reconstruction by gastrointestinal transposition alone or with additional free tissue transfer and propose an algorithm accordingly. Methods: We reviewed patients who had oncologic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy between January 2012 and January 2016. Twenty-four men and one woman were included with a mean age of 54 (range, 41–72) years. Patients were grouped by reconstruction into the gastric pull-up (GP, n = 15), colon interposition (CI, n = 2), GP combined with free jejunal flap (GPFJ, n = 6), or GP combined with anterolateral thigh flap (GPALT, n = 2) group to compare clinical outcomes. Results: The mean operation time was 1037.3 minutes and was significantly longer in the GPALT group than in the GP group (1235.0 ± 50.0 minutes vs. 929.7 ± 137.7 minutes, p =.009). All flaps survived. After a mean follow-up of 18 months, the overall leakage, stricture, and successful swallowing rates were 44%, 4%, and 76%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the leakage (53.3%, 50.0%, 16.7%, and 50.0%, p =.581), stricture (6.7%, 0%, 0%, and 0%, p = 1.000), or successful swallowing (73.3%, 50.0%, 83.3%, and 100%, p =.783) rates between GP, CI, GPFJ, and GPALT groups, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm that ranks gastric pull-up as a priority and uses additional free tissue transfer to overcome the anastomotic tension or associated neck-skin defect is feasible. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; aged; anterolateral thigh flap; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; colon interposition; conservative treatment; deltopectoral flap; esophagus cancer; esophagus reconstruction; esophagus resection; female; follow up; hospitalization; human; hypopharynx cancer; larynx cancer; male; middle aged; operation duration; pneumonia; postoperative care; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; retrospective study; swallowing; tissue flap; tongue cancer; total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy; tracheostomy; algorithm; esophagus reconstruction; free tissue graft; head and neck tumor; laryngectomy; pathology; pharyngectomy; procedures; reconstructive surgery; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Esophagectomy; Esophagoplasty; Female; Free Tissue Flaps; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Laryngectomy; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Pharyngectomy; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"
"Does awareness of death strengthen awareness of self? The effects of existential threat on self-focus","2019","Drawing on Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory, which suggests that human constructs typically contain their opposites. This study proposed that people facing death threat might be prompted to concern their existence, therefore pay more attentions on themselves. Two studies were conducted to explore the effects of death threat on self-focus. Study one analyzed data of six mortality salience experiments by using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program. Study two was a case study analyzing a cancer patient’s writings. Both studies found that people use more first-person singular pronouns when reminded of their mortality. The results indicated that death threat increases self-focus. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Impact of new technologies for middle-aged and older patients: In-depth interviews with type 2 diabetes patients using continuous glucose monitoring","2019","Background: Technology-embedded health care is a future trend. How middle-aged and older patients perceive the added technology intervention is not clear. Objective: The study aimed to understand the factors associated with the adoption of new technology in diabetes care, to understand the feelings and behaviors while using it, and to determine the changes in attitudes and behavior after completing the use of the new technology at the 3-month follow-up. Methods: Middle-aged and older type 2 diabetes patients who had received professional continuous glucose monitoring (CGM; iPro 2 [Medtronic]) were invited for semistructured in-depth interviews on the day of the CGM sensor removal and at 3 months after CGM-based counseling. A phenomenography approach was used to analyze the interview data. Results: A total of 20 type 2 diabetes patients (aged 53 to 72 years, 13 males and 7 females, 4 to 40 years duration of diabetes, mean glycated hemoglobin 8.54% [SD 0.71%]) completed 2 sections of semistructured in-depth interviews. Physician guidance and participant motivation toward problem solving were found to be factors associated with adoption of the device. Participants indicated that technology can be a reminder, a supervisor, and a visualizer of blood glucose, all of which are helpful for disease management. However, CGM is somewhat inconvenient, and some participants also reported that the provision of this new technology might be a hint of disease progression. There was a higher percentage of women compared with men who reported that CGM can be a reminder or a supervisor to help them with diet control. Conclusions: Physician guidance and participants’ degree of motivation are keys to adopting new technology in the case of middle-aged and older adults. Although the CGM sensor may cause inconvenience to patients on their limited body movement when wearing the device, it is helpful for diet control and is an effective behavioral modification tool that offers support, especially in the case of women. ?

"Deciphering the potential role of hox genes in pancreatic cancer","2019","The Hox gene family plays an important role in organogenesis and animal development. Currently, 39 Hox genes that are clustered in four chromosome regions have been identified in humans. Emerging evidence suggests that Hox genes are involved in the development of the pancreas. However, the expression of Hox genes in pancreatic tumor tissues has been investigated in only a few studies. In addition, whether specific Hox genes can promote or suppress cancer metastasis is not clear. In this article, we first review the recent progress in studies on the role of Hox genes in pancreatic cancer. By comparing the expression profiles of pancreatic cancer cells isolated from genetically engineered mice established in our laboratory with three different proliferative and metastatic abilities, we identified novel Hox genes that exhibited tumor-promoting activity in pancreatic cancer. Finally, a potential oncogenic mechanism of the Hox genes was hypothesized. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Eicosapentaenoic acids enhance chemosensitivity through connexin 43 upregulation in murine melanoma models","2019","Chemotherapy is now in common use for the treatment of tumors; however, with tumor growth retardation comes the severe side effects that occur after a chemotherapy cycle. Eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) used in combination with chemotherapy has an additive effects and provides a rationale for using EPA in tandem with chemotherapy. To improve the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy, a further understanding that EPA modulates with the tumor microenvironment is necessary. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is involved in enhancing chemosensitivity that was suppressed in a tumor microenvironment. We aim to investigate the role of EPA in chemosensitivity in murine melanoma by inducing Cx43 expression. The dose-dependent upregulation of Cx43 expression and gap junction intercellular communication were observed in B16F10 cells after EPA treatment. Furthermore, EPA significantly increased the expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways. The EPA-induced Cx43 expression was reduced after MAPK inhibitors. Knockdown Cx43 in B16F10 cells reduced the therapeutic effects of combination therapy (EPA plus 5-Fluorouracil). Our results demonstrate that the treatment of EPA is a tumor induced Cx43 gap junction communication and enhances the combination of EPA and chemotherapeutic effects. ?

"Which should be used first for alk-positive non-small-cell lung cancer: Chemotherapy or targeted therapy? a meta-analysis of five randomized trials","2019","Background and objectives: Targeted therapy is widely used in the era of precision medicine. Whether the sequence in which targeted therapy and chemotherapy are performed matters, is however not known. We examined the impact of the sequential treatment of targeted therapy and chemotherapy among advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing the use of ALK inhibitors with chemotherapy were included in this meta-analysis. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from a random effects model. Two-sided statistical tests were used to determine the significance of these estimates. Results: In five eligible studies (1404 patients), ALK targeted therapy, in comparison with chemotherapy, had a significantly higher PFS (HR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.42-0.55), but not significantly higher OS (HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72-1.07). Crossover from chemotherapy to ALK inhibitors was allowed after progression in all trials. The sensitivity analysis of the use of ALK inhibitors as either the first- or second-line treatment, showed improvements in PFS but not in OS. Conclusions: Our results indicate that using targeted therapy first improved PFS, but that the sequence in which the treatments were performed did not cause a significant difference in overall survival. ? 2019 by the authors.","ALK protein, human; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; antineoplastic agent; protein kinase inhibitor; data mining; economics; health care cost; human; lung tumor; meta analysis; middle aged; molecularly targeted therapy; non small cell lung cancer; randomized controlled trial (topic); Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Data Mining; Drug Therapy; Health Care Costs; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Progression-Free Survival; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
"Brain MRI imaging characteristics predict treatment response and outcome in patients with de novo brain metastasis of EGFR-mutated NSCLC","2019","Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and de novo brain metastasis (BM) have poor prognosis. We aim to investigate the characteristic of brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and the association with the treatment response of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) for lung cancer with BM.EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with BM from October 2013 to December 2017 in a tertiary referral center were retrospectively analyzed. Patient's age, sex, cell type, EGFR mutation status, treatment, and characteristics of BM were collected. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. The efficacy of different EGFR-TKIs were also analyzed.Among the 257 eligible patients, 144 patients with Exon 19 deletion or Exon 21 L858R were included for analysis. The erlotinib group had the best progression free survival (PFS) (median PFS 13 months, P = .04). The overall survival (OS) revealed no significant difference between three EGFR-TKI groups. Brain MR imaging features including tumor necrosis, rim enhancement and specific tumor locations (frontal lobe, putamen or cerebellum) were factors associated with poor prognosis. Patients with poor prognostic imaging features, the high-risk group, who received erlotinib had the best PFS (median PFS 12 months, P < .001). However, the OS revealed no significant difference between 3 EGFR-TKI groups. The low risk group patients had similar PFS and OS treated with three different EGFR-TKIs.In NSCLC patients with common EGFR mutation and de novo BM, those with poor prognostic brain MR characteristics, erlotinib provided better PFS than afatinib or gefitinib. ? 2019 the Author(s).","afatinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; erlotinib; gadolinium; gefitinib; osimertinib; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; brain metastasis; brain stem; cancer chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; exon; female; frontal lobe; gene deletion; gene mutation; health care; high risk population; human; insula; low risk population; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neuroimaging; non small cell lung cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; occipital lobe; overall survival; parietal lobe; priority journal; progression free survival; putamen; retrospective study; temporal lobe; thalamus; treatment outcome; treatment response; tumor localization; tumor necrosis; brain tumor; diagnostic imaging; disease free survival; genetics; lung tumor; metastasis; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; predictive value; secondary; Taiwan; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease-Free Survival; ErbB Receptors; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; Predictive Value of Tests; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Retrospective Studies; Taiwan"

"Shock index predicted mortality in geriatric patients with influenza in the emergency department","2019","Background: The shock index is a rapid and simple tool used to predict mortality in patients with acute illnesses including sepsis, multiple trauma, and postpartum hemorrhage. However, its ability to predict mortality in geriatric patients with influenza in the emergency department (ED) remains unclear. This study was conducted to clarify this issue. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study, recruiting geriatric patients (? 65 years) with influenza visiting the ED of a medical center between January 01, 2010 and December 31, 2015. Demographic data, vital signs, shock index, past histories, subtypes of influenza, and outcomes were included for the analysis. We investigated the association between shock index ?1 and 30-day mortality. Results: In total, 409 geriatric ED patients with mean age of 79.5 years and nearly equal sex ratio were recruited. The mean shock index ± standard deviation was 0.7 ± 0.22 and shock index ?1 was accounted for in 7.1% of the total patients. Logistic regression showed that shock index ?1 predicted mortality (odds ratio: 6.80; 95% confidence interval: 2.39–19.39). The area under the receiver operating characteristic was 0.62 and the result of the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was 0.23. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of a shock index ?1 were 30.0%, 94.1%, 20.0%, and 96.4%.

"Association of use of Chinese herbal medicines and the risk of fracture in patients with osteoporosis: a population-based cohort study","2019","Summary: After utilizing a large population-based claims database and the application of propensity score match approach to reduce the confounding effects, we found that the use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) was related to the lower risk of sequent osteoporotic fracture by 27% among the individuals with osteoporosis. The predominant effect was observed in those receiving CHMs for more than two years. Introduction: Osteoporosis (OS) is a highly disabling condition that can lead to fragility fracture, thus posing greater burdens of functional limitations for the affected individuals. It is unclear if the use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) could reduce the risk of fracture due to OS. This study aimed to investigate the association of CHMs and the subsequent osteoporotic fracture risk among OS patients. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study used the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 250,699 newly diagnosed OS patients aged 20?years or older between 1998 and 2010. We recruited 103,325 CHM users following the onset of OS (CHM users) and randomly selected 103,325 subjects without CHM usage as controls (non-CHM users) by propensity score matching according to the demographic characteristics and comorbidities at enrollment. All enrollees were followed until the end of 2012 to record the incidence of osteoporotic fracture. We applied the Cox proportional hazard regression model to compute the hazard ratio (HR) of the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Results: During the 15-year follow-up period, 7208 CHM users and 11,453 non-CHM users sustained osteoporotic fracture, with an incidence rate of 9.26 and 12.96, respectively, per 1000 person-years. We found that CHM users had a significantly reduced risk of osteoporotic fracture compared to non-CHM users (adjusted HR 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.75). Those treated with CHMs for longer than 730?days had a lower fracture risk by 54%. Some commonly used CHMs, such as Yan hu suo (Rhizoma Corydalis), Huang Qin (Scutellaria Baicale), Jie Geng (Platycodon grandifloras), Xiang Fu (Cyperus rotundus), Hai Piao Xiao (Cuttlebone Sepium), Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Ge-Gen-Tang, Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang, and Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang, are related to the lower risk of fracture. Conclusions: The use of CHMs was associated with lower risk of osteoporotic fracture for OS patients, suggesting that it could be integrated into conventional therapy to prevent subsequent bone fracture. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","du huo ji sheng tang; ge gen tang; hai piao xiao; herbaceous agent; huang qin; jia wei xiao yao san; jie geng; shao yao gan cao tang; unclassified drug; xiang fu; yan hu suo; herbaceous agent; adult; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; fragility fracture; human; incidence; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; osteoporosis; priority journal; Taiwanese; aged; case control study; drug utilization; factual database; fragility fracture; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; osteoporosis; procedures; risk assessment; socioeconomics; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Databases, Factual; Drug Utilization; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Incidence; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Resveratrol induced premature senescence and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells via induction of tumor suppressor Rad9","2019","Resveratrol (RSV) has been reported to influence many biological processes, including the stimulation of cellular senescence and inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this research, we explored the mechanisms of RSV on EMT and cellular senescence through the expression of a DNA damage response (DDR) protein, Rad9, in breast and lung cancer cell lines. Upon treating breast and lung cancer cell lines with RSV at the concentrations of 10–50 μM, Rad9 expression was increased at both transcriptional and translational levels. The results indicated that RSV-induced Rad9 expression, mediated by DNA damage and ROS, can significantly suppress proliferation by activating cellular senescence, and diminishing the expression of EMT markers with concomitant downregulation of Slug in breast and lung cancer cell lines. By using a siRNA approach, RSV was shown to mediate cellular senescence and EMT through a Rad9-dependent mechanism. The treatment with RSV can inhibit the proliferation, EMT, and increase cellular senescence of breast and lung cancer cell lines by activating Rad9. Our results suggest that the breast and lung tumor suppressive activities of RSV are, at least in part, mediated by the upregulation of Rad9. ? 2019 Chen et al.

"A survey of traditional Chinese medicine use among rheumatoid arthritis patients: a claims data–based cohort study","2019","Introduction/objectives: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is commonly used for symptom relief in patients with chronic diseases. Nevertheless, large-scale surveys focusing on the utilization of TCM among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are limited, especially in Taiwan, where TCM is highly popular. This cohort study aimed to describe the utilization of TCM and determine the factors related to TCM usage among RA patients. Method: A national health insurance database was used to identify 6532 newly diagnosed RA patients aged between 20 and 70?years, together with 12,246 subjects without RA matched by sex, age, and index year between 2000 and 2010. Incidence density of TCM use and its related factors was calculated by the Poisson regression model. Results: Findings indicated that RA patients experienced higher incidence density of TCM use than non-RA patients, with an adjusted incidence density ratio of 1.30 (95% confidence interval = 1.21–1.36). Multivariate analysis showed that RA patients who were female, were young, had high monthly income, had high Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index scores, and lived in the highly urbanized area with high TCM density were more likely to use TCM services. The top three reasons for seeking TCM services were diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue, the respiratory system, and the digestive system. Conclusions: The findings allow healthcare providers to identify the pattern of TCM use and characterize the factors that affect TCM utilization. Further research is required to fully address the efficiency and safety of TCM in treating RA patients. ? 2019, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).","Chinese drug; prescription drug; herbaceous agent; acupuncture; adult; aged; Article; Chinese medicine; cohort analysis; comorbidity; connective tissue disease; controlled study; female; follow up; gastrointestinal disease; human; incidence; income; major clinical study; male; manipulative medicine; musculoskeletal disease; national health insurance; priority journal; residential area; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; urbanization; Chinese medicine; insurance; middle aged; multivariate analysis; musculoskeletal manipulation; Poisson distribution; questionnaire; rheumatoid arthritis; sex factor; Taiwan; young adult; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Insurance Claim Review; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Musculoskeletal Manipulations; Poisson Distribution; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Developmental outcomes and prevalence of SLC2A1 variants in young infants with hypoglycorrhachia","2019","Introduction: The neurodevelopmental outcomes of young infants with hypoglycorrhachia that is comparable to glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS), i.e. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose ?40 mg/dL and CSF lactate <2.2 mM without causes of secondary hypoglycorrhachia are unknown. This study investigated the developmental outcomes and possibility of GLUT1DS in infants with hypoglycorrhachia, or low CSF glucose concentration. Material and methods: 1655 neurologically asymptomatic infants aged <4 months had CSF examinations for fever workup from 2006 to 2016. Among the infants with normal CSF cell counts and without isolated pathogens, there were hypoglycorrhachia group who had CSF glucose levels that were comparable to GLUT1DS, and age- and gender-matched non-hypoglycorrhachia group. Both groups were at a mean age of 5.9 ± 2.4 years (ranged 1–10 years) at neurodevelopmental evaluation in 2017. Mutational analysis of solute-carrier-family 2, which facilitated the glucose transporter member 1 (SLC2A1) gene was performed. Results: Among the 722 infants with normal CSF cell counts and without isolated pathogens, 30 (4.2%) had hypoglycorrhachia that was comparable to GLUT1DS. In the 25 infants with hypoglycorrhachia available for follow-up, 4 (16%) had abnormal outcomes, of which 3 (12%) had the history of mixed-type developmental delay before age 6 and 1 (4%) had type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the non-hypoglycorrhachia control group (n = 50), 2 patients (4%) showed abnormal outcomes, both with the history of pure speech delay. The hypoglycorrhachia group had a higher rate of the history of mixed-type of developmental delay than the control group (12% vs. 0%, P = 0.034). No SLC2A1 pathogenic variants were observed in the hypoglycorrhachia group. Conclusion: Hypoglycorrhachia may be a potential biomarker for neurodevelopmental delay instead of for GLUT1DS in neurologically asymptomatic young infants. ? 2019 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology","biological marker; glucose; lactic acid; Article; cerebrospinal fluid examination; cerebrospinal fluid level; child; child development; cognitive defect; controlled study; developmental delay; evaluation study; follow up; gene; genetic variability; human; hypoglycorrhachia; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; metabolic disorder; motor dysfunction; mutational analysis; outcome assessment; preschool child; prevalence; school child; slc2a1 gene; speech delay"
"Hearing loss is a risk factor of disability in older adults: A systematic review","2019","Background and Objectives: Hearing loss (HL) is a public health problem affecting older adults. HL is not only a health condition but also a complex, dynamic phenomenon related to disability. Previous studies identified associations between HL and undesirable outcomes; however, their correlation remains inconclusive. Hearing loss can have profound impact on daily life in the elderly, and an understanding of how HL contributes to disability is needed. A systematic review was conducted to comprehensively examine current evidence and determine the association between HL and disability regarding impairment, activity and participation in older adults. Research Design and Methods: The Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were applied in this systematic review. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for longitudinal studies and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for cross-sectional studies. Results: In this systematic review of 20 studies, HL was associated with mobility limitation, activity limitation and participation restriction. The severity of HL was associated with impaired mobility and physical performance, but the association was only found in persons with severe/major HL. HL was also associated with activities of daily living (ADL) dependency, however these findings were mainly based on cross-sectional studies. Discussion and Implications: HL is related to disability by impairment, activity limitations or participation restrictions in older adults. Future studies should include participation restrictions as a mediation factor to better understand this association. Consistent and accurate hearing measurements and hearing loss criteria are also required to determine the impact of HL on disability. ? 2019","aged; Article; clinical assessment; clinical protocol; daily life activity; disability; disease association; disease severity; elderly care; evidence based practice; hearing impairment; human; International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; patient mobility; patient participation; physical performance; priority journal; risk factor; social status; systematic review"
"Intravenous Thrombolysis in Acute Ischemic Stroke After Idarucizumab Reversal of Dabigatran Effect: Analysis of the Cases From Taiwan","2019","Background: Asians with atrial fibrillation carry a higher risk of ischemic stroke than non-Asians even under treatment of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. The purpose of the study was to observe the feasibility of intravenous thrombolytic therapy after administering a reversal agent, idarucizumab, in dabigatran-treated patients with acute ischemic stroke in Taiwan. Methods: Dabigatran-treated patients with acute ischemic stroke who received intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) after idarucizumab reversal were enrolled in the retrospective nationwide study. The clinical data, treatment course, and outcomes were recorded. Stroke severity was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Any intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after rt-PA was detected by neuroimaging studies. Results: Ten dabigatran-treated patients (6 men, mean age 71.10 ± 7.96 years) with acute ischemic stroke were included. Before stroke, the mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 4.50 ± 1.57 and 8 patients (80%) received dabigatran 110 mg twice daily. All patients were treated with 5 g idarucizumab, following which the activated partial thromboplastin time normalized. Intravenous rt-PA (mean dose.78 mg/kg) was initiated a mean time of 11.11 minutes after idarucizumab infusion. The NIHSS score improved significantly after thrombolysis (16.0 ± 6.67 at admission to 9.38 ± 4.75 at discharge, P =.016). ICH developed in 3 patients (30%). Two of them were asymptomatic and 1 patient suffered from symptomatic ICH leading to mortality.

"Differential Organ-Specific Tumor Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Hepatocellular Carcinoma","2019","Background and Aims: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) exhibit significant clinical activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study explored whether tumor response to ICIs in HCC varies among different organs. Methods: We reviewed the data of patients with advanced HCC who had received ICIs. Patients with measurable diseases were enrolled. Organ-specific response criteria, adapted from RECIST 1.1 and immune-related RECIST, were used to evaluate the objective response to ICIs in tumors located in the liver, lung, lymph node, and other intra-abdominal sites. Results: Of the 75 enrolled patients with advanced HCC, 51 and 11 patients had chronic hepatitis B virus and chronic hepatitis C virus infection, respectively. Regarding ICI treatment, 58, 1, and 16 patients had undergone anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone, anti-CTLA4 mAb alone, and anti-PD-1 mAb plus anti-CTLA4 mAb, respectively; 20 and 55 patients had received ICIs as first-line or ?second-line therapy. The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 28.0%. In total, 58, 34, 19, and 18 patients had measurable hepatic tumors and lung, lymph node, and other intra-abdominal metastases, and the corresponding organ-specific ORRs were 22.4, 41.2, 26.3, and 38.9%, respectively. Of the 39 patients who had both hepatic and extrahepatic tumors, 12 had disease control in extrahepatic tumors while progressive disease (PD) in hepatic tumors, whereas only 4 exhibited disease control in hepatic tumors while PD in extrahepatic tumors (p = 0.046, McNemar test). Of the 16 patients with only evaluable tumors in the liver and lungs at baseline, 8 had disease control in the lungs while PD in the liver, and none experienced disease control in the liver while PD in the lungs (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The hepatic tumors of HCC may be less responsive to ICIs than extrahepatic lesions. Lung metastases responded most favorably to ICIs. The mechanisms underlying this differential response to ICIs warrant further investigation. ? 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

"Etifoxine, a TSPO Ligand, Worsens Hepatitis C-Related Insulin Resistance but Relieves Lipid Accumulation","2019","Etifoxine, an 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) agonist for the treatment of anxiety disorders in clinic, may be able to cause acute liver injury or cytolytic hepatitis. TSPO has been demonstrated to participate in inflammatory responses in infective diseases as well as to modulate glucose and lipid homeostasis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection disrupts glucose and lipid homoeostasis, leading to insulin resistance (IR). Whether TSPO affects the HCV-induced IR remains unclear. Here, we found that the administration of etifoxine increased the TSPO protein expression and recovered the HCV-mediated lower mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) without affecting HCV infection. Moreover, etifoxine reversed the HCV-induced lipid accumulation by modulating the expressions of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and apolipoprotein J. On the other hand, in infected cells pretreated with etifoxine, the insulin-mediated insulin receptor substrate-1/Akt signals, forkhead box protein O1 translocation, and glucose uptake were blocked. Taken together, our results pointed out that etifoxine relieved the HCV-retarded MMP and reduced the lipid accumulation but deteriorated the HCV-induced IR by interfering with insulin signal molecules. ? 2019 Yu-Min Lin et al.","18 kda translocator protein; clusterin; etifoxine; insulin receptor substrate 1; protein; protein kinase B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; transcription factor FKHR; unclassified drug; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; etifoxine; glucose; insulin receptor substrate; lipid; oxazine derivative; protein kinase B; transcription factor FKHR; TSPO protein, human; Article; controlled study; glucose transport; hepatitis C; human; human cell; insulin resistance; lipid homeostasis; lipid storage; mitochondrial membrane potential; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein transport; Western blotting; cell line; cell survival; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; hepatitis C; inflammation; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; pathology; virology; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose; Hepatitis C; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Oxazines; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptors, GABA"
"The biochemical and electrophysiological profiles of amniotic fluid-derived stem cells following Wnt signaling modulation cardiac differentiation","2019","Owing to the beneficial properties of amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSCs), including pluripotency and the lack of ethical issues associated with embryonic stem cells (ESCs), they should be a promising cell source for regenerative medicine. However, how to differentiate AFSCs into contracting cardiomyocytes has not been established. In this study, a well-established, direct cardiac differentiation protocol involving the modulation of Wnt signaling was used to differentiate Oct 3/4+ AFSCs into cardiomyocytes. By day 14 of cardiomyocyte differentiation, these AFSCs expressed cardiac-specific genes (i.e., cardiac troponin T and myosin light chain 2v) and proteins but could not spontaneously contract. Using the patch-clamp technique, we further characterized the electrophysiological properties of human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and differentiated AFSCs. We used different configurations to investigate membrane potentials and ion currents in differentiated AFSCs and hESC-CMs. Under cell-attached voltage- or whole-cell current-clamp modes, we recorded spontaneous action currents (ACs) or action potentials (APs) in hESC-CMs but not in differentiated AFSCs. Compared to hESC-CMs, differentiated AFSCs showed significantly diminished activity of both BKCa and IKCa channels, which might lead to a lack of spontaneous ACs and APs in differentiated AFSCs. These results indicated that this well-established Wnt signaling modulating cardiac differentiation protocol was insufficient to induce the differentiation of functional cardiomyocytes from Oct 3/4+ AFSCs. Therefore, AFSC may not be an ideal candidate for cardiomyocyte differentiation. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Experiential learning of HIV self-test among student nurses: A qualitative study","2019","Background: There is increasing demand for HIV self-tests, and nurses play an important role in counselling and assisting in the testing process. Traditional lecture-based nursing education has not typically focused on self-testing procedures, and there is little understanding of clients' experiences of self-testing. Objectives: To understand the experiential learning (EL)of student nurses during the process of self-testing for HIV. Design: This study used a qualitative design. Settings: A college in northern Taiwan. Participants: We recruited a purposive sample of 30 nursing students. Methods: The OraQuick self-test was used as the self-testing tool in this study. After participants used the OraQuick self-test, they underwent a semi-structured interview during the post-test counselling period. All interview data were subjected to line-by-line content analysis. Results: We extracted nine themes of nursing students' experiences during experiential learning of HIV self-test. In the pre-test stage, they recalled possible risk behaviors for HIV infection, decided to complete the self-test alone or asked for significant others to accompany them, and endured emotional fluctuations immediately prior to the test. When waiting for the test results, they felt isolated from the outside world. Some participants also began questioning the accuracy and safety of the test, and either viewed the results immediately or later on. In the post-test stage, some participants reported being uncertain about the results. Participants reported a greater understanding of the personal impact of testing and revealed their needs for support. Some identified a sense of loss and linked this to the rapid and direct delivery of test results. Conclusions: Our results can be used to guide HIV-related education courses and prevention programs. Experiential learning has the potential to improve HIV pre and post-test counselling, as nurses develop both clinical knowledge and personal insight of the testing process. ? 2018","adult; diagnostic kit; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; interview; mass screening; nursing education; nursing student; problem based learning; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; self care; Taiwan; Adult; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Mass Screening; Problem-Based Learning; Qualitative Research; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; Self Care; Students, Nursing; Taiwan"
"Deep learning for breast cancer classification with mammography","2019","Current screening of mammography results in a high recall rate. Furthermore, distinguishing between BI-RADS 3 and BI-RADS 4 is a challenge for radiologists. In order to help radiologists' diagnosis, researches of CAD system recently have shown that methods of deep learning can significantly improve lesion detection, segmentation, and classification. However, there is not enough evidence to show that deep learning models can reduce the high recall rate because few researches provide the performance of cases in BI-RADS 3 and BI-RADS 4. Moreover, few researches extended the current models to involve images in CC and MLO in a single prediction. Thus, we proposed convolutional neural networks to classify breast cancer. Our model could predict images in four input sizes. Besides, we extended our model to consider images in CC and MLO in a single prediction. To validate our models, we split the data depending on patients rather than images. Our training set was composed of 4255 images, and test set contained 355 images that were proven by biopsy and callback. The overall performance of human experts yielded on an accuracy of 65.3% while our model achieved a better accuracy of 79.6%. Besides, the performance of cases in BI-RADS 3 and 4 by human experts was accuracy of 54.1%, but our model maintained a high accuracy of 75.7%. When we combined images in CC and MLO in the single prediction, we achieved AUC of 0.86. ? 2019 SPIE.","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Diseases; Forecasting; Mammography; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Breast Cancer; Breast cancer classifications; Combined images; Convolutional neural network; Current screening; Lesion detection; Recall rate; Transfer learning; Deep learning"
"Psychometric evaluation of the WHOQOL-BREF, Taiwan version, across five kinds of Taiwanese cancer survivors: Rasch analysis and confirmatory factor analysis","2019","Background: Quality of life (QoL) is important for clinicians to evaluate how cancer survivors judge their sense of well-being, and WHOQOL-BREF may be a good tool for clinical use. However, at least three issues remain unresolved: (1) the psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF for cancer patients are insufficient; (2) the scoring method used for WHOQOL-BREF needs to be clarify; (3) whether different types of cancer patients interpret the WHOQOL-BREF similarly. Methods: We recruited 1000 outpatients with head/neck cancer, 1000 with colorectal cancer, 965 with liver cancer, 1438 with lung cancer and 1299 with gynecologic cancers in a medical center. Data analyses included Rasch models, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and Pearson correlations. Results: The mean WHOQOL-BREF domain scores were between 13.34 and 14.77 among all participants. CFA supported construct validity; Rasch models revealed that almost all items were embedded in their expected domains and were interpreted similarly across five types of cancer patients; all correlation coefficients between Rasch scores and original domain scores were above 0.9. Conclusion: The linear relationship between Rasch scores and domain scores suggested that the current calculations for domain scores were applicable and without serious bias. Clinical practitioners may regularly collect and record the WHOQOL-BREF domain scores into electronic health records. ? 2018","adult; Article; cancer center; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer survivor; colorectal cancer; concurrent validity; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; correlation coefficient; cytology; female; female genital tract cancer; head and neck cancer; histopathology; human; internal consistency; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; marriage; middle aged; outpatient; psychometry; quality of life; Rasch analysis; Taiwan; Taiwanese; wellbeing; aged; cancer survivor; classification; evaluation study; factor analysis; outpatient; procedures; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; World Health Organization; Adult; Aged; Cancer Survivors; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatients; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; World Health Organization"
"Expression of prothymosin α in lung cancer is associated with squamous cell carcinoma and smoking","2019","Prothymosin α (ProTα) is a nuclear protein that serves a role in oncogenesis, by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis in various malignancies. The present study was designed to investigate ProTα expression in resected human non-small cell lung cancer to define the clinicopathological associations of ProTα-positive lung cancer. Immunohistochemical staining of ProTα was performed using tumor sample slides from 149 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent surgical resection. Association between the expression of ProTα and the following clinicopathological parameters was accessed: Age, sex, stage, lymph node involvement, pathological subtype, recurrence and cigarette smoking. A total of 85 tumors (57%) were classified as ProTα-positive lung cancer by staining intensity and 73 tumors (49%) were regarded as ProTα-positive by scoring index. The majority of patients with ProTα-positive tumors were younger (P=0.05) and had squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.01) compared with older and adenocarcinoma. Positive expression of ProTα by staining intensity was associated with a higher incidence rate of cancer recurrence (P=0.05) compared with negative ProTα expression. ProTα was also associated with cigarette smoking, particularly in the group with squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, the present data suggested that ProTα-positive non-small cell lung cancer was associated with younger patients, squamous cell carcinoma, cigarette smoking and a higher incidence recurrence rate, subsequently indicating a subtype consisting of patients with smoking-associated inferior outcomes. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Tuberculosis infection and lung adenocarcinoma: Mendelian randomization and pathway analysis of genome-wide association study data from never-smoking Asian women","2019","We investigated whether genetic susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) influences lung adenocarcinoma development among never-smokers using TB genome-wide association study (GWAS) results within the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia. Pathway analysis with the adaptive rank truncated product method was used to assess the association between a TB-related gene-set and lung adenocarcinoma using GWAS data from 5512 lung adenocarcinoma cases and 6277 controls. The gene-set consisted of 31 genes containing known/suggestive associations with genetic variants from previous TB-GWAS. Subsequently, we followed-up with Mendelian Randomization to evaluate the association between TB and lung adenocarcinoma using three genome-wide significant variants from previous TB-GWAS in East Asians. The TB-related gene-set was associated with lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.016). Additionally, the Mendelian Randomization showed an association between TB and lung adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.66, p = 0.027). Our findings support TB as a causal risk factor for lung cancer development among never-smoking Asian women. ? 2019",""
"Elevated platelet galectin-3 and rho-associated protein kinase activity are associated with hemodialysis arteriovenous shunt dysfunction among subjects with diabetes mellitus","2019","Introduction. Hyperglycemia is a major factor in influencing the patency rate of arteriovenous shunts, potentially associated with the RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. Besides, galectin-3 mediates thrombotic mechanisms in venous thrombosis and peripheral artery disease. We hypothesized that high ROCK activity and galectin-3 levels are associated with arteriovenous shunt dysfunction. Methods. We prospectively enrolled 38 patients diagnosed with arteriovenous shunt dysfunction. 29 patients received a complete follow-up and each provided two blood samples, which were collected at the first visit for occluded status of arteriovenous shunts and 1 month later for patent status. A Western blot assay for a myosin phosphatase target subunit (MYPT) was performed to examine Rho-kinase activity. A Western blot assay for platelet galectin-3 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for circulating galectin-3 were completed. Results. Higher platelet MYPT ratios and galectin-3 levels were identified at occluded arteriovenous shunts (MYPT ratio: 0.5 [0.3-1.4] vs. 0.4 [0.3-0.6], p = 0.01; galectin-3: 1.2 [0.4-1.6] vs. 0.7 [0.1-1.2], p = 0.0004). The plasma galectin-3 binding protein ELISA was also higher at occluded arteriovenous shunts (8.4 [6.0-9.7] μg/mL vs. 7.1 [4.5-9.1] μg/mL, p = 0.009). Biomarker ratios (occluded/patent status) trended high in patients with poorly controlled diabetes (MYPT ratio: 1.7 [1.0-3.0] vs. 1.1 [0.7-1.3], p = 0.06; galectin-3: 1.6 [1.3-3.4] vs. 1.1 [0.8-1.9], p = 0.05). Conclusion. High platelet ROCK activity and galectin-3 levels are associated with increased risk in arteriovenous shunt dysfunction, especially in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. ? 2019 Po-Wei Chen et al.","galectin 3; interleukin 6; Rho kinase; galectin 3; galectin-3, human; myosin light chain; myosin light chain phosphatase; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; aged; arteriovenous shunt; arteriovenous shunt dysfunction; Article; blood sampling; cardiovascular risk; clinical article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; hemodialysis; human; hyperglycemia; male; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prospective study; protein analysis; protein expression; thrombocyte; thrombocyte activation; vascular disease; vein thrombosis; Western blotting; arteriovenous fistula; arteriovenous shunt; diabetes mellitus; hemodialysis; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; procedures; signal transduction; Aged; Arteriovenous Fistula; Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical; Blood Platelets; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Galectin 3; Humans; Male; Myosin Light Chains; Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase; Phosphorylation; Prospective Studies; Renal Dialysis; rho-Associated Kinases; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Signal Transduction"
"Time-to-progression following conventional compared with drug-eluting-bead transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma","2019","AIMS: To identify the optimal transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) approach in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; >5 cm) by comparing conventional TACE (cTACE) and drug-eluting-bead (DEB)-TACE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 63 consecutive HCC patients who received TACE at a single medical centre from September 2009 to October 2015. Primary endpoints were 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and time-to-progression (TTP). Hazard ratios (HRs) from Kaplan–Meier curves were calculated to compare survival estimates. RESULTS: The median OS was shorter in the cTACE group, but was not significantly different from the DEB-TACE group (33.9 versus 35.6 months, respectively; p=0.52). The mean TTP was shorter in the cTACE group than in the DEB-TACE group (13.9 versus 17.5 months, respectively; p=0.01). There was no difference in 3-year survival (HR=0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51–1.78; p=0.880) and TTP (HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.42–1.16; p=0.147) between the groups; however, patients treated with DEB-TACE were more likely to have longer TTP in the first 2 years following treatment (HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.29–0.88; p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Although DEB-TACE is not superior in terms of TTP or OS in patients with large HCC, it may have greater efficacy in the first 24 months following therapy. ? 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists","doxorubicin; gelatin sponge; iodinated poppyseed oil; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer patient; chemoembolization; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; female; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; time; time to progression; tumor volume"
"Fluoride contamination, health problems and remediation methods in Asian groundwater: A comprehensive review","2019","In low concentration, fluoride is considered a necessary compound for human health. Exposure to high concentrations of fluoride is the reason for a serious disease called fluorosis. Fluorosis is categorized as Skeletal and Dental fluorosis. Several Asian countries, such as India, face contamination of water resources with fluoride. In this study, a comprehensive overview on fluoride contamination in Asian water resources has been presented. Since water contamination with fluoride in India is higher than other Asian countries, a separate section was dedicated to review published articles on fluoride contamination in this country. The status of health effects in Asian countries was another topic that was reviewed in this study. The effects of fluoride on human organs/systems such as urinary, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, brain, and reproductive systems were another topic that was reviewed in this study. Different methods to remove fluoride from water such as reverse osmosis, electrocoagulation, nano?ltration, adsorption, ion-exchange and precipitation/coagulation were introduced in this study. Although several studies have been carried out on contamination of water resources with fluoride, the situation of water contamination with fluoride and newly developed technology to remove fluoride from water in Asian countries has not been reviewed. Therefore, this review is focused on these issues: 1) The status of fluoride contamination in Asian countries, 2) health effects of fluoride contamination in drinking water in Asia, and 3) the existing current technologies for defluoridation in Asia. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; fluoride; ground water; fluoride; ground water; drinking water; fluoride; groundwater pollution; health impact; remediation; water resource; water treatment; adsorption; Afghanistan; Asia; Bahrain; Bangladesh; cardiotoxicity; China; defluoridation; dental fluorosis; ecosystem restoration; electrocoagulation; endocrine disease; fluorosis; gastrointestinal toxicity; health hazard; India; Indonesia; ion exchange; Iran; Iraq; Israel; Japan; Jordan; Malaysia; Mongolia; Myanmar; nanofiltration; Nepal; nephrotoxicity; neurotoxicity; Pakistan; Palestine; precipitation; reproductive toxicity; reverse osmosis; Review; Saudi Arabia; South Korea; Sri Lanka; technology; Thailand; Turkey (republic); urinary tract disease; Viet Nam; water contamination; Yemen; Asia; chemistry; dental fluorosis; ecosystem restoration; filtration; gastrointestinal tract; human; industrialization; kidney; water pollutant; water pollution; water supply; Asia; India; Adsorption; Asia; Drinking Water; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Filtration; Fluorides; Fluorosis, Dental; Gastrointestinal Tract; Groundwater; Humans; India; Industrial Development; Kidney; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Water Resources"
"1-Arylsulfonyl indoline-benzamides as a new antitubulin agents, with inhibition of histone deacetylase","2019","We report structure-activity relationships of 1-arylsulfonyl indoline based benzamides. The benzamide (9) exhibits striking tubulin inhibition with an IC50 value of 1.1 μM, better than that of combretastain A-4 (3), and substantial antiproliferative activity against a variety of cancer cells, including MDR-positive cell lines with an IC50 value of 49 nM (KB), 79 nM (A549), 63 nM (MKN45), 64 nM (KB-VIN10), 43 nM (KB-S15), and 46 nM (KB-7D). Dual inhibitory potential of compound 9 was found as it demonstrated significant inhibitory potential against HDAC1, 2 and 6 in comparison to MS-275 (6). Some key interactions of 9 with the amino acid residues of the active site of tubulin and with amino acid residues of HDAC 1 isoform have been figured out by molecular modeling.

"Robotic-assisted therapy with bilateral practice improves task and motor performance in the upper extremities of chronic stroke patients: A randomised controlled trial","2019","Background/Aim: Task-specific repetitive training, a usual care in occupational therapy practice, and robotic-aided rehabilitation with bilateral practice are used to improve upper limb motor and task performance. The difference in effects of two strategies requires exploration. This study compared the impact of robotic-assisted therapy with bilateral practice (RTBP) and usual task-specific training facilitated by therapists on task and motor performance for stroke survivors. Methods: Forty-three community-dwelling stroke survivors (20 males; 23 females; 53.3?±?13.1?years; post-stroke duration 14.2?±?10.9?months) were randomised into RTBP and usual care. All participants received a 10-minute per-protocol sensorimotor stimulation session prior to interventions as part of usual care. Primary outcome was different in the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) on the Motor Activity Log (MAL) scale at endpoint. Secondary outcomes were AOU and QOM scores at follow-up, and pre-post and follow-up score differences on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and surface electromyography (sEMG). Friedman and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to calculate difference. Results: There were no baseline differences between groups. Both conditions demonstrated significant within-group improvements in AOU-MAL and FMA scores following treatment (P?<?0.05) and improvements in FMA scores at follow-up (P?<?0.05). The training-induced improvement in AOU (30.0%) following treatment was greater than the minimal detectable change (16.8%) in the RTBP group. RTBP demonstrated better outcomes in FMA wrist score (P?=?0.003) and sEMG of wrist extensor (P?=?0.043) following treatment and in AOU (P?<?0.001), FMA total score (P?=?0.006), FMA wrist score (P?<?0.001) and sEMG of wrist extensor (P?=?0.017) at follow-up compared to the control group. Control group boost more beneficial effects on FMA hand score (P?=?0.049) following treatment. Conclusions: RTBP demonstrated superior upper limb motor and task performance outcomes compared to therapists-facilitated task training when both were preceded by a 10-minute sensorimotor stimulation session.

"Prevalence and risk factors for colonization by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing or ST 131 escherichia coli among asymptomatic adults in community settings in Southern Taiwan","2019","Purpose: Fecal carriage of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) is common in Asia, especially in China and Southeast Asia. There are no data about fecal carriage of ESBL-EC and mcr-1-positive E. coli in Taiwan, and few studies focusing on the risk factors of asymptomatic fecal carriage of epidemic ST131 E. coli have been published. Patients and methods: From healthy inhabitants attending health examinations at a medical center in southern Taiwan in 2017, we collected 724 stool samples, which were examined for ESBL-EC fecal carriage using chromogenic medium. ST131 and mcr1-positive E. coli were also investigated using multiplex PCR. Clinical data from all participating adults were collected to analyze the risk factors for fecal ESBL-EC or ST131 E. coli carriage. Results: The prevalence rate of asymptomatic ESBL-EC fecal carriage in adults was 1.9% (14/724). ST131 was found in 22 (3.0%) adults and mcr-1-positive E. coli was found in three (0.4%) adults. A multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with ESBL-EC carriage were diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–22.7), a history of colonic polyps (aOR: 6.4, 95% CI: 1.6–24.9), and chronic renal insufficiency (aOR: 20.7, 95% CI: 1.4–305.7). Underlying cancer (aOR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.0–22.5) and stroke (aOR: 18.0, 95% CI: 1.6–207.5) were associated with ST131 E. coli fecal carriage. In our cohort, travel to Asian countries and food habit were not associated with ST131 or ESBL-EC fecal carriage. Conclusions: The ESBL-EC or ST131 E. coli fecal carriage rate is low among asymptomatic adults in Taiwan.

Here, we describe the design of JAVELIN Gastric 100 (NCT02625610), an open-label, Phase III trial. A total of 499 patients with locally advanced/metastatic HER2- gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer adenocarcinoma, who had achieved at least stable disease following 12 weeks of first-line oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy, have been randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab maintenance therapy or continue chemotherapy. The primary objective is to demonstrate superior overall survival in all randomized patients or in the PD-L1+ population. Secondary objectives are to demonstrate superiority for progression-free survival and objective response rate, compare quality of life measures, and determine safety. ? 2018 2018 Markus Moehler.","avelumab; capecitabine plus oxaliplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; fluorouracil; folinic acid; oxaliplatin; antineoplastic agent; avelumab; monoclonal antibody; tumor marker; Article; cancer patient; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; esophageal adenocarcinoma; gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma; gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma; human; maintenance chemotherapy; major clinical study; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; open study; outcome assessment; overall survival; patient-reported outcome; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; progression free survival; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; stomach adenocarcinoma; study design; treatment duration; treatment response; cancer staging; clinical trial; maintenance chemotherapy; molecularly targeted therapy; pathology; stomach tumor; treatment outcome; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Humans; Maintenance Chemotherapy; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasm Staging; Stomach Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome"
"Psychological distress mediated the effects of self-stigma on quality of life in opioid-dependent individuals: A cross-sectional study","2019","Background Both stigma and psychological distress affect quality of life (QOL). This study is an attempt to determine the effects of these two factors on QOL and to explore possible mediation effects between psychological distress and self-stigma in opioid-dependent individuals. Methods This cross-sectional study comprised 268 consecutive, treatment-seeking opioid-dependent individuals who were interviewed using the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF), the Self-Stigma Scale-Short (SSS-S), the Chinese Health Questionnaire-12 (CHQ-12), and the Opiate Treatment Index (OTI). A series of regression models were constructed to determine if the SSS-S and CHQ-12 predict the WHOQOL-BREF scores. Moreover, a comparison of the potential mediation effects of psychological distress (as assessed by the CHQ-12) was made between the SSS-S and the WHOQOL-BREF using the Baron and Kenny procedure (including three separate regressions), along with the Sobel test. Results The CHQ-12 score was predictive of the scores for the four domains and almost all facets of the WHOQOL-BREF except the item, “Dependence on medical aids.” Nonetheless, the SSS-S score predicted three of the four facets of the social QOL after adjustment of the CHQ-12 score. Psychological distress completely mediated the relation between self-stigma and the physical, psychological, and environmental domains, and partially mediated the relationship between self-stigma and social QOL (two-tailed Sobel test: p = 0.02 for each domain). Conclusions Psychological distress has a significant impact on the QOL of treated opioid users. It appears to be a core element in reducing the negative effects of self-stigma on aspects of QOL. ? 2019 Chang et al.

"Prognosticators of hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic vascular invasion","2019","Objective: The prognosis of intrahepatic vascular invasion, including unilateral or main portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and hepatic vein thrombosis, is still poor. Many patients with intrahepatic vascular invasions never receive radiotherapy (RT). In recent years, more conformal RT techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) have been developed and applied to treat other cancers and have significantly improved treatment results and decreased side effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment results in patients with intrahepatic vascular invasion and explore the role of IMRT in these treatments. Materials and Methods: There were a total of 73 patients with newly diagnosed AJCC stage IIIB hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with either PVTT or hepatic vein tumor thrombosis between 2007 and 2015 in our hospital. IMRT was used for all patients who received RT. Prognostic factors, including treatment modalities, liver function, and comorbidities, were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis with the Cox model. Survival time was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The longest follow-up time was 45.3 months. The median age was 67 years. Univariate analyses indicated that IMRT, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), target therapy (sorafenib), tumor size, Child-Pugh class, and ascites were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, IMRT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.495; P = 0.019), sorafenib (HR, 0.340; P = 0.013), tumor size (HR, 2.085; P = 0.020), and Child-Pugh class (P = 0.004), were independent prognostic predictors for patients with intrahepatic vessel invasion, but TACE and ascites were not. The outcomes of patients who had different treatment modalities were significantly different (P < 0.001). Patients who received IMRT with TACE had the best outcomes. Patients who received an RT dose above 5400 cGy had better outcomes than those who with a dose below 5400 cGy, although the results were not significantly different (P = 0.248). Conclusion: IMRT is an important treatment component for patients with intrahepatic vascular invasion. Combined treatment modalities, such as IMRT with TACE, could improve the outcomes of HCC patients with intrahepatic vessel invasion. ? 2018 Tzu Chi Medical Journal","sorafenib; adult; aged; Article; ascites; cancer prognosis; chemoembolization; Child Pugh score; comorbidity; female; follow up; hepatitis C; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver function; major clinical study; male; middle aged; overall survival; radiation dose; retrospective study; tumor invasion; tumor thrombus; tumor volume"
"Avocado (Persea americana) fruit extract (2R,4R)-1,2,4-trihydroxyheptadec-16-yne inhibits dengue virus replication via upregulation of NF-κB–dependent induction of antiviral interferon responses","2019","Dengue virus (DENV) caused millions of infections around the world annually. Co-infection with different serotypes of DENV is associated with dengue hemorrhagic shock syndrome, leading to an estimate of 50% death rate. No approved therapies are currently available for the treatment of DENV infection. Hence, novel anti-DENV agents are urgently needed for medical therapy. Here we demonstrated that a natural product (2 R,4 R)-1,2,4-trihydroxyheptadec-16-yne (THHY), extracted from avocado (Persea americana) fruit, can inhibit DENV-2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner and efficiently suppresses replication of all DENV serotypes (1–4). We further reveal that the NF-κB-mediated interferon antiviral response contributes to the inhibitory effect of THHY on DENV replication. Using a DENV-infected ICR suckling mouse model, we found that THHY treatment caused an increased survival rate among mice infected with DENV. Collectively, these findings support THHY as a potential agent to control DENV infection. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Utility of geriatric syndrome indicators for predicting subsequent health care utilization in older adults in Taiwan","2019","Background: The predictive utility of both individual and combined indicators of geriatric syndromes on subsequent emergency use and hospitalization is not clear. Methods: Nationally representative data on adults aged 65+ (N = 2345) (with 1148 male, 1197 female) in Taiwan were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve examined the diagnostic accuracy of the combined effects of geriatric syndromes on predicting health care utilization in three years. Negative binomial regressions identified the individual effect of each indicator with the control of sociodemographic and baseline health status. Results: The combined indicators of geriatric syndromes predicted future hospitalization of old-old (75+ yrs) diabetes patients, with area under the curve (AUC) = 0.709, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.635-0.782, and young-old patients (65-74 yrs) with mild cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.727, 95% CI = 0.610-0.845 for hospitalization and AUC = 0.770, 95% CI = 0.664-0.877 for emergency visits). As for individual indicators, while incontinence was the indicator having the most influence on hospitalization (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.21-2.72) and emergency visits (IRR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.23-2.59) for general older adults (65+), and for old-old emergency visits, especially (IRR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.39-3.49), falls was the most prominent indicator of hospitalization for young-old (65-74) adults (IRR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.13-2.28). In addition, pain was another significant indicator for predicting future hospitalization of old-old diabetes patients (IRR = 1.61, 95% CI= 1.07-2.44). Conclusions: Combined indicators of geriatric syndromes effectively predict hospitalization in old-old (75+ yrs) diabetes patients and hospitalization and emergency visits in young-old (65-74 yrs) patients with cognitive impairment. Incontinence, falls, and pain were the most predictive independent geriatric assessment indicators. ? 2019 by the authors.

"SOX17 overexpression sensitizes chemoradiation response in esophageal cancer by transcriptional down-regulation of DNA repair and damage response genes","2019","Background: Prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients is poor and the concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) provided to ESCC patients often failed due to resistance. Therefore, development of biomarkers for predicting CCRT response is immensely important. In this study, we evaluated the predicting value of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 17 (SOX17) protein during CCRT and its dysregulation of transcriptional targets in CCRT resistance in ESCC. Methods: Pyrosequencing methylation, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry assays were performed to examine the DNA methylation, mRNA expression and protein expression levels of SOX17 in endoscopic biopsy from a total of 70 ESCC patients received CCRT. Cell proliferation, clonogenic survival and xenograft growth were used to confirm the sensitization of ESCC cell line KYSE510 in response to cisplatin, radiation or CCRT treatment by SOX17 overexpression in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase activity, RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR assays were conducted to examine transcription regulation of SOX17 in KYSE510 parental, KYSE510 radio-resistant cells and their derived xenografts. Results: High DNA methylation coincided with low mRNA and protein expression levels of SOX17 in pre-treatment endoscopic biopsy from ESCC patients with poor CCRT response. SOX17 protein expression exhibited a good prediction performance in discriminating poor CCRT responders from good responder. Overexpression of SOX17 sensitized KYSE510 radio-resistant cells to cisplatin, radiation or CCRT treatment in cell and xenograft models. Importantly, SOX17 transcriptionally down-regulated DNA repair and damage response-related genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, KU80 DNAPK, p21, SIRT1, NFAT5 and REV3L in KYSE510 radio-resistant cells to achieve the sensitization effect to anti-cancer treatment. Low expression of BRCA1, DNAPK, p21, RAD51 and SIRT1 was confirmed in SOX17 sensitized xenograft tissues derived from radio-resistant ESCC cells. Conclusions: Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which SOX17 transcriptionally inactivates DNA repair and damage response-related genes to sensitize ESCC cell or xenograft to CCRT treatment. In addition, we establish a proof-of-concept CCRT prediction biomarker using SOX17 immunohistochemical staining in pre-treatment endoscopic biopsies to identify ESCC patients who are at high risk of CCRT failure and need intensive care. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cisplatin; messenger RNA; transcription factor Sox17; SOX17 protein, human; transcription factor Sox; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer prognosis; cell count; cell proliferation; cell viability; chemoradiotherapy; DNA damage; DNA methylation; DNA repair; DNAPK gene; down regulation; esophagus cancer; female; gene; gene expression; gene overexpression; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; KU80 gene; KYSE510 gene; major clinical study; mouse; NFAT5 gene; nonhuman; p21 gene; predictive value; priority journal; protein expression; pyrosequencing; RAD51 gene; radiation dose; radiosensitivity; REV3L gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SIRT1 gene; transcription regulation; tumor suppressor gene; tumor volume; animal; chemoradiotherapy; DNA repair; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; gene expression regulation; genetic marker; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemoradiotherapy; DNA Repair; Down-Regulation; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Markers; Humans; Mice; Mice, Nude; SOXF Transcription Factors"
"Changing practice pattern of acute coronary syndromes in Taiwan from 2008 to 2015","2019","Background: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation (NSTE)-ACS have a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the practice patterns of ACS care in Taiwan from 2005 to 2018. Methods: Data from two nationwide ACS registries (2008-2010 and 2012-2015) were used. ACS patients who received percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) during admission were compared between the two registries. Results: In STEMI, the door-to-balloon time for primary PCI decreased by 25 min from a median of 96 to 71 min (p < 0.0001) from the first to second registry. More complex PCI procedures and drug-eluting stents were used for ACS. However, the onset-to-door time was still long for both STEMI and NSTE-ACS. The D2B time for NSTE-ACS was long, especially in the elderly and female patients. Although the prescription rate of secondary preventive medications for ACS increased, it was still relatively low compared with Western data, especially in NSTE-ACS. Conclusions: The registry data showed that ACS care quality has improved in Taiwan. However, areas including onset-to-door time and use of secondary preventive medications still need further improvements. ? 2019, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

"Quantitative Proteomics of Human Blood Exosomes","2019","Abstract—: Exosomes are extracellular membrane vesicles secreted by cells into biological fluids. The membrane of exosomes protects their contents from degradation and contains markers of the cells producing them. Almost all cells of the body produce exosomes, however, tumor cells secrete them more intensively. However, initial stages of the study of exosome functions and identification of tumor protein biomarkers in their composition meet a serious problem of isolating pure, characterized exosome preparations. In this study we have performed quantitative proteomic analysis of human serum exosomes isolated using differential ultracentrifugation, ultracentrifugation in a sucrose cushion, or sedimentation of a serum exosomal fraction by means of the commercial Exosome Isolation Kit (Invitrogen from ThermoFisher Scientific Baltics, UAB, Lithuania). The protein composition of the obtained exosome samples was determined by mass spectrometric methods of selected reactions monitoring (SRM) and shotgun proteomic analysis. The resultant preparations were characterized by the content of the main markers (CD9, CD82, HSPA8, CD63). In the exosomes isolated from serum of healthy volunteers samples by ultracentrifugation in the sucrose cushion, the content of the above mentioned markers was determined as 32.85, 15.59, 6.07 fmol/μg of total protein, respectively. It was shown that the centrifugation method with the sucrose cushion was optimal for the isolation of exosomes. The other methods, including the commercial kit, did not yield positive results. Thus, results of this study have shown that the centrifugation using the sucrose cushion is the most optimal for serum exosome isolation. ? 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","CD63 antigen; CD82 antigen; CD9 antigen; heat shock cognate protein 70; sucrose; Article; blood cell; cell isolation; exosome; human; human cell; human experiment; mass spectrometry; normal human; priority journal; protein analysis; proteomics; sedimentation; ultracentrifugation; volunteer"
"High smoking prevalence among HIV-positive individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis","2020","Background: Several observational and population-based studies to determine the prevalence of smoking among people living with HIV (PLWH) have been conducted in multiple settings. However, no study has conducted a meta-analysis of global studies of smoking prevalence among large samples of PLWH. Objectives: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of smoking and characteristics associated with smoking among PLWH. Methods: Studies were included if conducted in HIV population, data available on current smoking, either cross-sectional or cohort study, and the minimum sample size was 1,000. A random-effects model was selected to summarize the prevalence of smoking. Sub-group analyses and meta-regression were performed to address heterogeneity. Results: A total of 31 articles from 2,763 studies were included. The estimated prevalence of current smoking was 46.5% (95%CI: 40.9–52.1) and the pooled prevalence of former smokers was 22.4%. The highest current smoking prevalence was found in European countries (46.4%), males (75.9%), and men who have sex with men (MSM) (52.1%). Conclusion: Nearly half of the people living with HIV were smokers, and this figure was higher in European countries, among males and MSM. It is critical to encourage more effective efforts toward smoking cessation among PLWH. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; cohort analysis; ex-smoker; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; human tissue; male; men who have sex with men; meta analysis; prevalence; review; sample size; smoking cessation; systematic review"
"Exposure Duration and History of Hypertension Predicted Neurological Sequelae in Patients with Carbon Monoxide Poisoning","2019","BACKGROUND: Carbon monoxide poisoning (COP) accounts for a large number of emergency department visits worldwide and is fatal in many cases. In surviving patients, neurological sequelae (NS) attributable to cerebral hypoxia are the most devastating outcome, but reliable predictors are limited. Therefore, we conducted a study to identify predictors of NS in patients with COP and evaluate their effects. METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, we identified patients with COP in a medical center in Southern Taiwan between January 2005 and December 2014. Cases were patients with NS, and controls were patients without NS. We obtained information on potential predictors of NS from medical records and evaluated their association with NS, including demographic characteristics, exposure source, suicide attempts, duration of exposure (by tertile), histories, symptoms, signs, laboratory data, treatment, and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: We included 371 patients with COP. Of them, 93 developed NS, and their mean ages (41.4?±?14.7 years vs. 39.7?±?14.2 years) and proportions of males (59.1% vs. 58.6%) were similar to those in the 298 controls. Multivariate logistic regression showed that a history of hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.0, 4.5) and a longer duration of carbon monoxide exposure (adjusted odds ratio = 1.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 2.8; the longest tertile [>5 hours] vs. the other two tertiles [?5 hours]) were independent predictors for NS, but not the level of carboxyhemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two independent predictors for NS that may be useful for public healthcare workers and physicians in predicting outcomes and deciding on treatment strategies for COP patients.",""
"Identification and characterization of a secreted M28 aminopeptidase protein in Acanthamoeba","2019","Acanthamoeba is a free-living pathogenic protozoan that is distributed in different environmental reservoirs, including lakes and soil. Pathogenic Acanthamoeba can cause severe human diseases, such as blinding keratitis and granulomatous encephalitis. Therefore, it is important to understand the pathogenic relationship between humans and Acanthamoeba. By comparison of systemic analysis results for Acanthamoeba isolates, we identified a novel secreted protein of Acanthamoeba, an M28 aminopeptidase (M28AP), which targets of the human innate immune defense. We investigated the molecular functions and characteristics of the M28AP protein by anti-M28 antibodies and a M28AP mutant strain generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Human complement proteins such as C3b and iC3b were degraded by Acanthamoeba M28AP. We believe that M28AP is an important factor in human innate immunity. This study provides new insight for the development of more efficient medicines to treat Acanthamoeba infection. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","aminopeptidase; complement component C3b; complement factor I; complementary DNA; CRISPR associated endonuclease Cas9; genomic DNA; guide RNA; m28 aminopeptidase; protozoal protein; unclassified drug; aminopeptidase; complement component C3; protozoal protein; Acanthamoeba; Acanthamoeba infection; antibody production; Article; complement activation; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; human; image analysis; innate immunity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein purification; protein secretion; RNA splicing; Acanthamoeba; amebiasis; CRISPR Cas system; genetics; immunology; isolation and purification; lake; metabolism; parasitology; soil; Acanthamoeba; Amebiasis; Aminopeptidases; Complement C3; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Humans; Lakes; Protozoan Proteins; Soil"
"The Role of Pretreatment Serum Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Hypopharyngeal Cancer Treated with Definitive Chemoradiotherapy: A Pilot Study","2019","Serum neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) is a potential predictive and prognostic marker in head and neck cancers. This study aimed to determine the role of pretreatment serum NLR in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. We retrospectively investigated the correlation between clinicopathological parameters and NLR status and analysed its impact on therapeutic response and survival. A total of 120 patients treated at a single institution between 2009 and 2015 were included. The median follow-up time was 24.1 months. High NLR (NLR ? 4) was associated with advanced T classification (p = 0.01*) and advanced stage (p = 0.02*) based on chi-square test. We also found that high pretreatment NLR was correlated with poor treatment response (HR = 2.42, 95% CI: 1.08–5.44, p = 0.03*). Pretreatment NLR was also an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (HR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01–2.90, p = 0.046*) and overall survival (HR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.21–3.28, p = 0.01*) while correcting for known prognostic factors. Overall, these findings support that NLR is a potential biomarker for host response to tumour aggressiveness, therapeutic response to chemoradiotherapy and survival in HPC patients. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and further validation is warranted. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Identification and characterization of permissive cells to dengue virus infection in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells","2019","BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant threat to public health in tropical and subtropical regions, where the frequency of human migration is increasing. Transmission of DENV from donors to recipients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been steadily described. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Freshly isolated bone marrow (BM) was subjected to DENV infection, followed by multicolor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Virus in supernatants was collected and analyzed by plaque assay. RESULTS: DENV-1 to DENV-4 could effectively infect freshly obtained BM and produced infectious virus. DENV infection did not change the quantitative population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), megakaryocytic progenitor cells (MkPs) and megakaryocytes. Additionally, DENV antigen, nonstructural protein 1, was enriched in HSPCs and MkPs of DENV infected marrow cells. CD34+, CD133+, or CD61+ cells sorted out from BM were not only the major contributing targets facilitating the DENV infection directly but also facilitated the spread of DENV into other cells when cocultured. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that DENV can efficiently infect HSPCs, which might jeopardize the recipients if DENV-infected cells were subsequently used. We therefore raise the need for DENV screening for both the donors and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially for donors exposed to endemic areas, to mitigate DENV infection in immunocompromised recipients. ? 2019 AABB","nonstructural protein 1; virus antigen; Article; bone marrow cell; cell lineage; cell population; cell selection; controlled study; dengue; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 4; hematopoietic stem cell; human; human cell; immunocompetent cell; megakaryocyte; virus replication; virus strain"
"Hepatoma-derived growth factor supports the antiapoptosis and profibrosis of pancreatic stellate cells","2019","Pancreatic cancer is refractory and is characterized by extensively surrounding and intratumor fibrotic reactions that are contributed by activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Herein, we show that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (CEBPD) responds to transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) through reciprocal loop regulation and that activated hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) further contributes to the upregulation of the hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) gene. Secreted HDGF contributes to the antiapoptosis of PSCs and consequently leads to the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins for stabilizing PSC/pancreatic cancer cell (PCC) tumor foci. This result agrees with the observation that severe stromal growth positively correlated with stromal HDGF and CEBPD expression in pancreatic cancer specimens. Collectively, the identification of the TGF-β1-activated CEBPD/HIF-1α/HDGF axis provides new insights into novel discoveries of HDGF in the antiapoptosis and profibrosis of PSCs and the outgrowth of PCCs. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta; hepatoma derived growth factor; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; scleroprotein; transforming growth factor beta1; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; fibrosis; HDGF gene; human; human cell; pancreas cancer; pancreatic stellate cell; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction"
"Prevalence of bullying and perceived happiness in adolescents with learning disability, intellectual disability, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder: In the Taiwan Birth Cohort Pilot Study","2019","Children with learning disability (LD), intellectual disability (ID), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reported higher risk of being bullied compared to their peers. Controlling for the co-morbidity of different diagnosis is important in investigating the frequency of bullying. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the pathway relationship of adolescents' psychiatric diagnoses, including LD, ID, ADHD, ASD, with being bullied, their self-perceived psychological well-being (PWB) and social adaptation status (SAS) in 12-years-olds.The Taiwan Birth Cohort Pilot Study dataset (N=1561) was used. The Chinese Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was used to measure PWB and SAS.Adolescent-reported rate of bullying was 25.4%, while only 2.8% of the parents reported knowing their child had been bullied. Boys reported higher rate of being bullied than girls. Adolescents with ADHD were not at higher risk of being bullied compared to their peers, nevertheless, they perceived lower level of SAS. Adolescents diagnosed with ID and ASD reported 63% rate of bullying and those who have been bullied perceived lower level of happiness.Adolescents with ADHD reported lower level of SAS, for disruption of harmony is even less acceptable in the Asian culture. Adolescents with ID and ASD reported higher rate of bullying than their peers and perceived lower level of happiness. A gap was found between parent and adolescent-reported rate of bullying.

"Diabetes-related kidney, eye, and foot disease in Taiwan: An analysis of nationwide data from 2005 to 2014","2019","Background/Purpose: Patients with diabetes have a higher risk of developing chronic complications and cause a huge burden to the public health care system as well as on patients and their families. We studied these diabetic complications about kidney, eye and peripheral vascular diseases to understand their prevalence and distributions in a national survey. Methods: We analyzed diabetic complications using National-Health-Insurance claims filed from 2005 to 2014. We used this database to evaluate their developments of kidney, eye, and peripheral vascular diseases according to the International-Classification-of-Diseases, Ninth Revision using clinical modification diagnosis codes. Results: The prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) significantly increased from 10.49% to 17.92% from 2005 to 2014. The prevalence rate of diabetic foot significantly decreased from 1.34% to 1.05% from 2005 to 2014, and the rate of severe infection also significantly decreased from 50.69% to 45.85%. The amputation rate significantly decreased from 24.91% to 17.47% among all patients with diabetic foot. Conclusion: In this study, the trends in DKD and dialysis prevalence were similar to those of the 2012 report. The rate of increase in dialysis prevalence is lower in this study than in the 2012 report. The prevalence of diabetic foot, severe infection, and amputation in this report exhibited significantly decreasing trends. This improvement may be attributable to care from multidisciplinary teams. We should dedicate more resources to our prevention program of DKD and retinopathy to further improve outcomes in the future. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","abscess; adult; aged; Article; blindness; cellulitis; chronic kidney failure; cross-sectional study; diabetic foot; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic retinopathy; female; gangrene; human; ICD-9-CM; infection rate; kidney transplantation; leg amputation; male; national health insurance; osteomyelitis; peripheral vascular disease; prevalence; renal replacement therapy; Taiwan"
"Hypothesis of the optimal therapeutic effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for psychiatric disorders: Integration of positive cognitive tasks during the neuroplastic process","2019","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising intervention for psychiatric disorders; however, little is known with regards to the optimal regime. As cognition, either spontaneously generated by patients or guided by treatment, is important in psychiatry, we have proposed a model that integrates cognition activity with the biological mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of tDCS in psychiatric disorders. We propose that the valence of the outcome of these mechanisms may be determined by the cognitive activity of the patient before or during tDCS treatment. This hypothesis implies that proper cognition activity may work in cooperation with tDCS to achieve the maximum treatment effect. Negative cognition may decrease or even reverse the positive effect of tDCS. According to this hypothesis, the performance of explicit tasks or instructions before, during, or after tDCS is important. Harm caused by misuse of home-made tDCS equipment is also addressed in this hypothesis. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article; cognition; conditioning; fear; human; hypothesis; memory disorder; mental disease; nerve cell plasticity; task performance; therapy effect; transcranial direct current stimulation; working memory; animal; biological model; cognition; learning; memory; mental disease; motor performance; pathophysiology; procedures; transcranial direct current stimulation; Animals; Cognition; Humans; Learning; Memory; Mental Disorders; Models, Neurological; Motor Skills; Neuronal Plasticity; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"
"Simple renal cysts are associated with increased arterial stiffness in a Taiwanese population","2019","Arterial stiffness has been found to be a predictive risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Simple renal cysts are associated with prehypertension, hypertension, diabetes, and increased serum creatinine, which are risk factors of cardiovascular events. The aim of this work was to clarify the association between simple renal cysts and arterial stiffness defined by the brachial and ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). Subjects with and without simple renal cysts had right baPWV values of 1522.8 ± 357.5 cm/s and 1344.2 ± 268.8 cm/s, respectively (p < 0.001). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, the presence of simple renal cysts was associated with increased baPWV values (p < 0.001). Both the size and the number of simple renal cysts were positively associated with an increased baPWV value. Subjects with a cyst size ?2 cm (p < 0.001) and a cyst number ?2 (p < 0.01) had higher baPWV values than those without SRCs.

"Subsequent thyroid disorders associated with treatment strategy in head and neck cancer patients: A nationwide cohort study","2019","Background: We investigated the risk of thyroid disorders, namely hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis and thyroiditis, in head and neck cancer patients undergoing multimodal treatment. Methods: A cohort study design using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database was used to assess head and neck cancer patients over 20 years old. The cohort was divided into one group who underwent primary tumor excision only (PTE) and another with additional neck dissection (PTE + ND). The tumor sites were stratified to estimate the tumor-site-specific risk of thyroid disorders. The effect of subsequent resurgery, radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CT), and concomitant (CCRT) or sequential chemoradiation therapy (sequential CT+ RT) on the risk of thyroid disorders was explored. Results: For 1999-2012, 7460 patients who underwent PTE + ND and 3730 who underwent PTE were enrolled and followed-up until the end of 2013. There were 122 and 50 patients in the two groups, respectively, who developed thyroid disorders, with no statistical difference between the groups. Patients with hypopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, or laryngeal cancer in the PTE + ND group had a higher risk of thyroid disorders (adjusted HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.67-3.38) than those in the PTE group when adjusted for covariates and mortality. Patients who underwent subsequent RT (adjusted HR: 3.64, 95% CI: 1.05-2.77) and CCRT (adjusted HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.05-2.77) after PTE + ND had a significantly higher risk of thyroid disorders. Conclusion: RT results in a major risk of subsequent thyroid disorders, and ND may exacerbate this effect. Physicians should monitor thyroid function from two years after treatment initiation, especially in patients who undergo ND and subsequent RT. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antineoplastic agent; adult; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chemoradiotherapy; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; follow up; head and neck cancer; high risk patient; human; hypopharynx cancer; hypothyroidism; larynx cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; neck dissection; oropharynx cancer; reoperation; retrospective study; risk assessment; Taiwan; thyroiditis; thyrotoxicosis; young adult; adverse event; head and neck tumor; hypothyroidism; multimodality cancer therapy; register; thyroid disease; thyroidectomy; thyroiditis; thyrotoxicosis; Adult; Cohort Studies; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Hypothyroidism; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Taiwan; Thyroid Diseases; Thyroidectomy; Thyroiditis; Thyrotoxicosis; Young Adult"
"Factors associated with depressive symptoms in female victims of intimate partner violence in Southern Taiwan","2019","Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is known to cause physical suffering and psychological problems, which burden society. In addition, IPV-related psychological problems such as depressive symptoms may lead to disabilities, chronic mental illness, and an increased risk of suicide. Purpose: This study was designed to explore the factors associated with depressive symptoms in women who were physically abused by intimate partners. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 72 physically abused women from two domestic violence prevention centers in southern Taiwan. The questionnaires that were used to collect data included the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, the Conflict Tactic Scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Sixty-six of the participants (91.67%) met the inclusion criteria and completed all questionnaires. Fifty-five (83.3%) of the participants were found to have depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were positively associated in this sample with younger age, a lower level of extraversion, and a higher level of neuroticism. These three factors explained 59.5% of the total variance in depressive symptoms. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Youth and neuroticism were found to be significant risk factors for developing depressive symptoms in female victims of IPV, whereas extraversion was found to be a related protective factor. The results of this study indicate that clinical workers should provide female victims of IPV, especially relatively young victims, with services that help ameliorate neuroticism to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.

"Association between use of Chinese herbal medicine and depression risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A nationwide retrospective cohort study","2019","Aim: Depression is a common mental disorder in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and may provoke the onset of poor clinical prognoses. In view of this, whether or not the use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) can alleviate the risk of depression still remains unclear. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the association between CHMs us and depression risk among RA patients. Method: Using claims data from the National Health Insurance of Taiwan, we identified 6609 newly diagnosed RA patients aged 20?years or older between 1998 and 2010. From this sample, we recruited 3386 CHM users and randomly selected 3223 controls using propensity scores matching from the remaining cases as the non-CHMs users. They were followed until the end of 2012 to record depression incidence. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) of depression with regard to the use of CHMs. Results: During the 15-year follow-up, 249 CHM users and 314 non-CHM users developed depression, representing an incidence rate of 9.33 and 14.98, respectively, per 1000 person-years. We found that use of CHMs was associated with lower risk of depression by 38% (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.76). The most predominant effect was observed in those receiving CHMs for over 2?years (adjusted HR 0.34). Seven commonly prescribed CHMs could lessen the risk of depression: Chuan-niu-xi, Jie-geng, San-qi, Jia-wei-xia-yao-san, Dang-gui-nian-tong-tang, Zhi-gan-cao-tang, and Suan-zao-ren-tang. Conclusion: This study supports that adding CHMs into conventional therapy may prevent subsequent depression risk for RA patients. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","antirheumatic agent; bei mu; Chinese drug; chuan niu xi; dang gui nian tong tang; du huo ji sheng tang; ge gen; ge gen tang; herbaceous agent; huang qin; ji xue teng; jia wei xia yao san; jie geng; kan lu yin; kuei chih shao yaochih mu tang; san qi; shao yao gan cao tang; shu jing huo xue tang; suan zao ren tang; unclassified drug; wei ling xian; yan hu suo; ye jiao teng; zhi gan cao tang; adult; Article; Chinese herb; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; disease association; female; follow up; human; incidence; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; prescription; priority journal; propensity score; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; secondary analysis; Taiwan"
"Real-world effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir with or without ribavirin for genotype 2 chronic hepatitis C in Taiwan","2019","Background and purpose: Sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) treatment achieves excellent efficacy and safety in treating chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with various genotypes. Real world experience of SOF/DCV regimen to treat genotype 2 CHC was scanty in Asia. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SOF/DCV with or without ribavirin to treat genotype 2 CHC patients in real world practice in Taiwan. Methods: Patients with genotype 2 CHC treated with 12-week of SOF/DCV or SOF/DCV/ribavirin were enrolled prospectively. Effectiveness was evaluated by sustained virological response (SVR) which was defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA at post-treatment week 12. Adverse events were recorded for safety analysis. Results: In total of 32 patients were enrolled from October 2016 to June 2017. All were infected with genotype 2 HCV. Sixteen patients (50%) exhibited cirrhosis including 6 patients with decompensation. Regimens of SOF/DCV and SOF/DCV/ribavirin were used to treat 14 and 18 patients, respectively. SVR was achieved in all 31 patients (100%) who completed follow-up. Significantly higher levels of cholesterol (p = 0.013) and higher low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = 0.015) were exhibited after successful viral clearance. SOF/DCV/ribavirin regimen resulted in more adverse events, significantly higher bilirubin levels, and decline of hemoglobin during treatment than SOF/DCV regimen. Four patients with chronic kidney disease maintained renal function during treatment. Overall, SOF/DCV or SOF/DCV/ribavirin treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion: SOF/DCV with or without ribavirin is highly effective and safe for patients with genotype 2 HCV infection in real-world experience in Taiwan. ? 2018","alanine aminotransferase; bilirubin; daclatasvir; hemoglobin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; virus RNA; antivirus agent; BMS-790052; imidazole derivative; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; aged; appetite disorder; Article; chronic hepatitis C; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; clinical trial; coughing; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; edema; female; follow up; headache; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; insomnia; kidney function; liver cirrhosis; malaise; male; observational study; prospective study; rash; side effect; sustained virological response; treatment response; viral clearance; chronic hepatitis C; combination drug therapy; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; middle aged; sustained virologic response; Taiwan; virology; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Imidazoles; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Ribavirin; Sofosbuvir; Sustained Virologic Response; Taiwan"
"Glycoproteomic identification of novel plasma biomarkers for oral cancer","2019","Oral cancer with high incidence rates is occurring in many countries including in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Taiwan. Smoking, alcoholism, and betel nut chewing are considered to be the main risk factors for oral cancer. Further, deaths from oral cancer have increased year by year. Although several oral cancer-associated biomarkers have been reported, very few useful biomarkers have been applied for early diagnosis. Therefore, the investigation of oral cancer-specific biomarkers is urgently needed. We previously investigated N-glycomes of oral cancer cells and patient plasma. We found that both mRNA levels of FUT8 and core-fucosylated glycoproteins increase in cases of oral cancer relative to normal cases. In this study we aim to discover novel core-fucosylated glycoprotein biomarkers for oral cancer diagnosis with glycoproteomic approaches. First, forty plasma samples obtained from the Human Bioinformation Bank of NCKUH were subjected to AAL (Aleuria aurantia lectin) affinity chromatography. Core-fucosylated proteins were collected and applied for LC-MS/MS followed by electrophoresis. Fourteen proteins were identified, and expression levels of proteins in plasma were verified by western blot. Expression levels of some glycoproteins were elevated in the oral cancer group, including ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, and leucin-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1). However, levels of some glycoproteins decreased in the cancer group, including apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and apolipoprotein A-IV (apo A-IV). Via ELISA analysis, we found that apo A-IV and apo A-IV/total protein ratios were decreased in plasma accompanied with cancer stages. The LRG1/total protein ratio was found to increase while plasma levels of LRG1 were not found to differ between the oral cancer plasma and normal groups. An ROC curve analysis reveals strong diagnosis performance when combining apo A-IV levels and LRG1/total protein ratios. Taken together, apo A-IV and LRG1, given their strong performance in detecting oral cancer, can serve as useful biomarkers and may be used as a useful tool for oral cancer screening and early diagnosis. ? 2019","albumin; alpha 2 macroglobulin; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein A2; apolipoprotein A4; apolipoprotein C3; ceruloplasmin; fetuin A; glycoprotein; haptoglobin; hemopexin; immunoglobulin G; lectin; leucin rich alpha 2 glycoprotein 1; messenger RNA; orosomucoid; plasma protein; tumor marker; unclassified drug; affinity chromatography; Aleuria aurantia; Article; cancer diagnosis; clinical article; electrophoresis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; follow up; glycoproteomics; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mouth cancer; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein blood level; protein expression; proteomics; sensitivity and specificity; Western blotting"
"A Simple Method of Intracorporeal ""w-shaped"" Liver Retraction Technique for Minimally Invasive Gastric Cancer Surgery","2019","Minimally invasive gastric cancer surgery requires an extended liver retraction in order to provide optimal operative view, working space for lymph node dissection, and esophageojejunal reconstruction. Ideally, it should avoid reposition of the retractor, additional skin incision or puncture, and liver parenchyma injury. Herein, we introduced an intracorporeal W-shaped liver retraction technique (W-LRT) for minimally invasive gastric cancer surgery without an additional incision or abodminal puncture.Methods:Between October 2013 and October 2016, the W-LRT was applied in 80 patients undergoing minimally invasive gastric cancer surgery. The W-LRT was performed using one 75 cm 3-0 monocryl suture with its end fixed to one hemoclip. The perioperative outcome was recorded.Results:The W-LRT was applied in 80 gastric cancer patients using either laparoscopic approach (N=69) or robotic approach (N=11). The mean age was 62.7±14 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.1±3.6 kg/m2. The time required for W-LRT was 5.6±5.2 minutes in laparoscopic approach and 6.2±4.7 minutes in robotic approach. This technique was successfully applied in all procedures and no other technique or additional instrument was required. Major complications developed in 7 patients (8.8%), classified as greater than Clavien-Dindo classification II; however, there was neither any intraoperative nor postoperative major complication related to W-LRT. The length of hospital stay was 9.1±4.4 days.Conclusions:In laparoscopic or robotic gastric cancer surgery, the W-LRT can provide excellent operative view during lymph node dissection and reconstruction of esophagojejunostomy and eliminate an additional skin incision or abdominal puncture. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"TARBP2-mediated destabilization of Nanog overcomes sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma","2019","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal human malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Patients with HCC are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the prognosis is usually poor. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC. However, cases of primary or acquired resistance to sorafenib have gradually increased, leading to a predicament in HCC therapy. Thus, it is critical to investigate the mechanism underlying sorafenib resistance. Transactivation response element RNA-binding protein 2 (TARBP2) is a multifaceted miRNA biogenesis factor that regulates cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. The tumorigenicity and drug resistance of cancer cells are often enhanced due to the acquisition of CSC features. However, the role of TARBP2 in sorafenib resistance in HCC remains unknown. Our results demonstrate that TARBP2 is significantly downregulated in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. The TARBP2 protein was destabilized through autophagic–lysosomal proteolysis, thereby stabilizing the expression of the CSC marker protein Nanog, which facilitates sorafenib resistance in HCC cells. In summary, here we reveal a novel miRNA-independent role of TARBP2 in regulating sorafenib resistance in HCC cells. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The JAK inhibitor antcin H exhibits direct anticancer activity while enhancing chemotherapy against LMP1-expressed lymphoma","2019","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with B cell lymphomas in humans. The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) of EBV constitutively activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and contributes to the proliferation of EBV-infected primary human B lymphocytes. Thus, targeting LMP1-induced JAK/STAT signaling may prove effective in treating B-cell lymphomas. The extract of the fruiting body of Antrodia cinnamomea, has been reported to have cytotoxicity on blood cancer cells. Here, we report that the bioactivity of antcin H, an analog of the JAK2 inhibitor zhankuic acid A (ZAA), inhibits LMP1-induced JAK/STAT related signaling and induces lymphoma cell line apoptosis. Moreover, antcin H enhances low-dose methotrexate (MTX) cytotoxicity against lymphoma cells. Treatment of antcin H with low-dose MTX significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Our findings indicate antcin H as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of EBV-infected cancer cells. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antcin H; antineoplastic agent; fungal extract; Janus kinase 2 inhibitor; latent membrane protein 1; methotrexate; unclassified drug; anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell line; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Antrodia camphorata; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug potentiation; enzyme phosphorylation; JAK-STAT signaling; Jurkat cell line; Ku812 cell line; lymphoma; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; Raji cell line; RAW 264.7 cell line; THP-1 cell line; U-937 cell line; WEHI-3 cell line"
"An Aptamer Based Sandwich Assay for Simultaneous Detection of Multiple Cardiovascular Biomarkers on A Multilayered Integrated Microfluidic System","2019","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have resulted in an estimated death toll of nearly 17 million yearly. Early detection of CVDs may reduce the risk of sudden deaths. The current technologies based on antigen-antibody interactions have limitations in point-of-care (POC) applications. This study therefore reports an aptamer magnetic bead-based assay which is relatively sensitive and highly selective on a new integrated microfluidic platform for simultaneous analysis of up to six untreated clinical serum samples utilizing less than a volume of 10 μL from each patient. Experimental results showed that one of the important biomarkers for CVDs, cardiac troponin I, could be detected on the microfluidic platform in less than 35 minutes with a limit of detection of 0.01 ng/mL. It may provide a promising device for POC applications. ? 2019 IEEE.","Actuators; Biomarkers; Cardiology; Diseases; Microsystems; Solid-state sensors; Antigen-antibody interaction; Aptamers; Cardiac troponin I; Cardio-vascular disease; Integrated microfluidic systems; Integrated microfluidics; Microfluidic platforms; Simultaneous detection; Microfluidics"
"Oct4 upregulates osteopontin via Egr1 and is associated with poor outcome in human lung cancer","2019","Background: Roles of cancer stem cells and early growth response gene 1 (Egr1) in carcinogenesis have been extensively studied in lung cancer. However, the role of Egr1 in the metastasis of lung cancer remains undetermined, especially in regard to stem cell-related pathways. Methods: Egr1, osteopontin (OPN) and Oct4 expression in human lung cancer was determined by performing immunohistochemistry. Immunoblotting, ELISA, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and RT-PCR were performed to validate the regulation of Oct4-Egr1-OPN axis. Moreover, the effect of Oct4-Egr1-OPN axis on lung cancer progression was evaluated by cell migration assay and mice study. Results: We detected Oct4, Egr1, and OPN expression in clinical specimens from 79 lung cancer patients, including 72 adenocarcinomas and 7 squamous cell carcinomas. High expression of Oct4, Egr1, and OPN accounted for 53, 51, and 57% of the patients, respectively. All of the three biomarkers were positively correlated in clinical human lung cancer. Patients with high expression of OPN were significantly associated with shorter disease-free survivals than those with low expression of OPN (p < 0.05). In lung cancer cells, Oct4 transactivated the Egr1 promoter and upregulated Egr1 expression. In a human lung cancer xenograft model, Oct4-overexpressing tumors expressed elevated levels of Egr1. Furthermore, overexpression of Oct4 in lung cancer cells increased the metastatic potential. Conclusions: Egr1 exerts a promoting effect on cancer metastasis in Oct4-overexpressing lung cancer. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting the Oct4/Egr1/OPN axis may be further explored for the treatment of lung cancer, especially when lung cancer is refractory to conventional treatment due to cancer stem cells. ? 2019 The Author(s).","early growth response factor 1; octamer transcription factor 4; osteopontin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cell migration assay; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; disease association; disease free survival; Egr1 gene; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme regulation; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; luciferase assay; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; lung metastasis; major clinical study; male; molecularly targeted therapy; mouse; nonhuman; outcome assessment; promoter region; protein analysis; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; squamous cell lung carcinoma; transactivation; tumor xenograft; upregulation"
"Simultaneous detection of multiple NT-proBNP clinical samples utilizing an aptamer-based sandwich assay on an integrated microfluidic system","2019","Although cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure (HF) affect 30 million people globally, the early detection of HF has, until recently, been difficult and prone to misdiagnoses. Monitoring the circulatory levels of a relatively new biomarker, the N-terminal prohormone of a B-type natriuretic peptide, could be used for early risk evaluation of HF. Therefore, we developed a pneumatically-driven, automatic integrated microfluidic platform equipped with micromixers, micropumps, and microvalves for the simultaneous detection of NT-proBNP in up to six clinical samples within 25 min by using a novel aptamer-based sandwich assay, and the limit of detection was only 1.53 pg mL-1; given that the chip is 64% more compact than those developed in our prior works and requires only 5 μL of sample input, it may serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis of HF. ?

"The human cost of global warming: Deadly landslides and their triggers (1995–2014)","2019","Worldwide, landslides incur catastrophic and significant economic and human losses. Previous studies have characterized the patterns in landslides' fatalities, from all kinds of triggering causes, at a continental or global scale, but they were based on data from periods of <10 years. The research herein presented hypothesizes that climate change associated with extreme rainfall and population distribution is contributing to a higher number of deadly landslides worldwide. This study maps and identified deadly landslides in 128 countries and it encompasses their role, for a 20 years' period from January/1995 to December/2014, considered representative for establishing a relationship between landslides and their meteorological triggers. A database of georeferenced landslides, their date, and casualties' information, duly validated, was implemented. A hot spot analysis for the daily record of landslide locations was performed, as well as a percentile-based approach to evaluate the trend of extreme rainfall events for each occurrence. The relationship between casualty, population distribution, and rainfall was also evaluated. For 20 years, 3876 landslides caused a total of 163,658 deaths and 11,689 injuries globally. They occurred most frequently between June and December in the Northern Hemisphere, and between December and February in the Southern Hemisphere. A significant global rise in the number of deadly landslides and hotspots across the studied period was observed. Analysis of daily rainfall confirmed that more than half of the events were in areas exposed to the risk of extreme rainfall. The relationships established between extreme rainfall, population distribution, seasonality, and landslides provide a useful basis for efforts to model the adverse impacts of extreme rainfall due to climate change and human activities and thus contribute towards a more resilient society. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate models; Global warming; Population distribution; Rain; Risk assessment; Casualty; Extreme rainfall; Fatality; Global; Hot spot; Landslides; rain; catastrophic event; climate change; economic impact; extreme event; global warming; landslide; Northern Hemisphere; rainfall; accident; Article; climate change; controlled study; cost; environmental impact; exposure; flooding; geographic mapping; greenhouse effect; human; incidence; landslide; mortality rate; population distribution; priority journal; risk; spatial analysis"

In this study, we demonstrated that a histidine-tagged survivin T34A-C84A mutated protein (T34A-C84A-dNSur-His) can be produced using a bacterial recombinant protein expression system [E. coli ArcticExpress (DE3) cells] and solubilized using 1% (w/v) Sarkosyl. In addition, we showed that the purified T34A-C84A-dNSur-His protein formed dimers as predicted by in silico protein structure and molecular dynamics analysis. Importantly, results of the MTT assay revealed that the purified recombinant protein was biologically active in decreasing the viability of the human MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma and MIA-PaCa pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, the purified T34A-C84A-dNSur-His protein, but not of the histidine-peptide, induced apoptosis (i.e. caspase-9 activation and DNA fragmentation) in MDA-MB-231 cells at concentrations from 50 to 400 nM. In conclusion, our study provides a protocol of producing a biologically active survivin-targeting macromolecule, T34A-C84A-dNSur-His, which can be used as a tool for studying the molecular and cellular roles of survivin in cells. T34A-C84A-dNSur-His is also a potential therapeutic agent for augmenting cancer therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",""
"Prevalence and clinical characteristics of stroke patients with p.R544C NOTCH3 mutation in Taiwan","2019","Objective: Features of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) caused by NOTCH3 mutations vary between ethnicities and regions. In Taiwan, more than 70% of CADASIL patients carry the mutation hot spot of p.R544C. We investigated the prevalence of NOTCH3 p.R544C mutation in stroke patients in Taiwan. Methods: This prospective, multicenter study recruited acute stroke patients within 10?days of symptom onset. The p.R544C mutation was identified by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers and sequencing. Clinical parameters, vascular risk factors, stroke subtypes, and stroke outcomes were analyzed. Results: Of the 1970 stroke patients (mean age 61.1?±?13.6?years, male 69.5%) included, 1705 (86.5%) had ischemic stroke and 265 (13.5%) had intracerebral hemorrhage. The prevalence of p.R544C in the study population was 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?2.1–3.5%). The prevalence was highest in patients with small vessel occlusion type of ischemic stroke (5.6%), followed by intracerebral hemorrhage (5.3%), and infarct of undetermined etiology (2.7%), and was low in patients with cardioembolism (0.8%) and large artery atherosclerosis (0.7%). All p.R544C patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were nonlobar hemorrhage. Sibling history of stroke (odds ratio [OR]?=?4.50, 95% CI?=?1.67–12.14 in ischemic stroke; OR?=?6.03, 95% CI?=?1.03–35.47 in intracerebral hemorrhage, respectively) and small vessel occlusion (OR, 4.03, 95% CI, 1.26–12.92) were significantly associated with p.R544C. Interpretation: p.R544C NOTCH3 mutation is underdiagnosed in stroke patients in Taiwan, especially in those with small vessel occlusion and sibling history of stroke. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia in Taiwan","2019","Pneumonia is a leading cause of death worldwide, ranking third both globally and in Taiwan. This guideline was prepared by the 2017 Guidelines Recommendations for Evidence-based Antimicrobial agents use in Taiwan (GREAT) working group, formed under the auspices of the Infectious Diseases Society of Taiwan (IDST). A consensus meeting was held jointly by the IDST, Taiwan Society of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (TSPCCM), the Medical Foundation in Memory of Dr. Deh-Lin Cheng, the Foundation of Professor Wei-Chuan Hsieh for Infectious Diseases Research and Education and CY Lee's Research Foundation for Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Vaccines. The final guideline was endorsed by the IDST and TSPCCM. The major differences between this guideline and the 2007 version include the following: the use of GRADE methodology for the evaluation of available evidence whenever applicable, the specific inclusion of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a category due to the unique medical system in Taiwan and inclusion of recommendations for treatment of pediatric pneumonia. This guideline includes the epidemiology and recommendations of antimicrobial treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults and pediatric pneumonia. ? 2019","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter; adult; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; Burkholderia pseudomallei; carbapenem resistance; child; child hospitalization; Chlamydia pneumoniae; chlamydial pneumonia; community acquired pneumonia; comorbidity; disease severity; drug dose escalation; Enterobacteriaceae; epidemiological data; Haemophilus influenzae; health care associated pneumonia; hemodialysis associated pneumonia; hemodynamic parameters; hospital acquired pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; infection risk; intensive care unit; Legionella; Letter; medical history; Moraxella catarrhalis; mortality risk; multidrug resistance; Mycoplasma pneumonia; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; nonhuman; nursing home associated pneumonia; outpatient care; pediatric patient; pneumonia; practice guideline; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas pneumonia; risk factor; staphylococcal pneumonia; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumonia; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Taiwan; time out (healthcare); ventilator associated pneumonia; epidemiology; evidence based medicine; intensive care; organization and management; pneumonia; practice guideline; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Critical Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; GRADE Approach; Humans; Pneumonia; Taiwan"
"Value of layer-specific strain distribution patterns in hypertrophied myocardium from different etiologies","2019","Background: Intrinsic myocardial mechanics might have different patterns because of the different etiologies of myocardial hypertrophy. We used layer-specific strain to compare those with aortic stenosis (AS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and examined the differences in strain distribution pattern and for their clinical implications. Methods: Comprehensive echocardiography was done in 3 groups: 129 with moderate-to-severe AS, 172 consecutive patients with HCM, and 58 healthy controls. Left ventricle (LV) layer-specific deformation parameters were obtained using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. The transmural strain gradient was defined as the strain difference between subendocardial and subepicardial myocardium. Both diseased groups were further divided based on the median value of transmural strain gradient for the hemodynamics correlation. Results: Compared with the HCM group, the AS group had more preserved transmural longitudinal strain gradient (4.49 ± 1.3% vs. 3.61 ± 1.2%, p < 0.001), which was not significantly different from that of the healthy controls (4.49 ± 1.3% vs. 4.54 ± 1.0%, p = 0.975). And only in AS group the transmural circumferential strain correlated with myocardium mass index (r = ?0.237, p = 0.008), and the hemodynamic profiles (LV ejection fraction and LA pressure) were correlated well with transmural strain gradient, in that the lower subgroup had a significantly lower LV ejection fraction and higher average E/E′. Conclusions: Myocardium hypertrophy from different etiology resulted in different layer-specific strain distribution pattern. The loss of an adequate transmural strain gradient correlated with hemodynamics and might reflect intrinsic myocardial dysfunction. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","biological marker; aged; aortic stenosis; Article; body mass; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; differential diagnosis; disease marker; disease severity; echocardiography; female; heart left atrium pressure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle ischemia; heart ventricle hypertrophy; hemodynamics; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prognosis; reproducibility; retrospective study; tissue distribution; adult; diagnostic imaging; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left"
"Structural damage and motion rhythm of the spine and hip during trunk lateral bending in ankylosing spondylitis patients with mild to moderate radiographic signs","2019","Background: Ankylosing spondylitis causes structural damage and motion restriction in spine. The study was designed to assess structural damage and incoordination pattern between the spine and hip during trunk lateral bending in ankylosing spondylitis. Methods: Twenty-three healthy adults and 39 adults with ankylosing spondylitis were recruited from a tertiary care medical centre. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis were divided into two subgroups: sacroiliitis or lumbar-level syndesmophytes (n = 27) and thoracic or cervical-level syndesmophytes (n = 12). An inertia motion system was used to record three-dimensional kinematic data during trunk lateral bending. Findings: Significant differences were observed in lumbar spine syndesmophyte scores, sacroiliitis severity and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index between the subgroups. The cervical supraspinous ligaments thickness revealed difference between the ankylosing spondylitis and control group, but the Glasgow Ultrasound Enthesitis Scoring System did not revealed difference. Motion analysis revealed that the ankylosing spondylitis group had a larger hip, cervical rotation and smaller lumbar-hip rhythm than the control group; however, the other motions of the spine and hip were smaller. The sacroiliitis or lumbar-level syndesmophytes group had the largest thoracic rotation among the three groups. Interpretation: The different lumbar-hip rhythm between ankylosing spondylitis patients depends on syndesmophyte formation levels. Cervical rotation, the Schober test, the chest expansion test, and lumbar–hip rhythm can indicate the levels of bone damage in ankylosing spondylitis. Clinical examination of ankylosing spondylitis should include kinematic measures of both the spine and hips in the early disease stage. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Kinematics; Ultrasonography; Ankylosing spondylitis; Clinical examination; Ligaments thickness; Lumbar-hip rhythm; Scoring systems; Structural damages; Three-dimensional kinematics; Trunk lateral bending; Bone; adult; ankylosing spondylitis; anterior pelvic tilt; Article; Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; disease severity; female; hip injury; hip pain; human; kinematics; low back pain; lumbar spine; male; middle aged; priority journal; range of motion; sacral slope; sacroiliitis; spine injury; spine mobility; spine radiography; trunk"
"Dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 activates platelets via Toll-like receptor 4, leading to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage","2019","Dengue virus (DENV) infection, the most common mosquito-transmitted viral infection, can cause a range of diseases from self-limiting dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Thrombocytopenia is a major characteristic observed in both mild and severe dengue disease and is significantly correlated with the progression of dengue severity. Previous studies have shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which can be secreted into patients' blood, can stimulate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and can cause endothelial leakage. However, it is unclear whether DENV NS1 can directly induce platelet activation or cause thrombocytopenia during DENV infection. In this study, we first demonstrated that DENV but not Zika virus cell culture supernatant could induce P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in human platelets, both of which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Similar results were found using recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV, and those effects were blocked in the presence of anti-NS1 F(ab')2, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist (Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide, LPS-Rs) and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor (TAK242), but not polymyxin B (an LPS inhibitor). Moreover, the activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Finally, we demonstrated that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. Taken together, these results suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection. ? 2019 Chao et al.

"Expression of AHI1 Rescues Amyloidogenic Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease Model Cells","2019","A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is the accumulation of extracellular plaques mainly composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. Recent reports suggest that transport of APP in vesicles with huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) negatively regulates Aβ production. In neurons, HAP1 forms a stable complex with Abelson helper integration site-1 (AHI1), in which mutations cause neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. HAP1 and AHI1 interact with tropomyosin receptor kinases (Trks), which are also associated with APP and mediate neurotrophic signaling. In this study, we hypothesize that AHI1 participates in APP trafficking and processing to rescue AD pathology. Indeed, AHI1 was significantly reduced in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells expressing human Swedish and Indiana APP (designed as AD model cells) and in 3xTg-AD mouse brain. The AD model cells as well as Ahi1-knockdown cells expressing wild-type APP-695 exhibited a significant reduction in viability. In addition, the AD model cells were reduced in neurite outgrowth. APP C-terminal fragment-β (CTFβ) and Aβ42 were increased in the AD cell lysates and the culture media, respectively. To investigate the mechanism how AHI1 alters APP activities, we overexpressed human AHI1 in the AD model cells. The results showed that AHI1 interacted with APP physically in mouse brain and transfected N2a cells despite APP genotypes. AHI1 expression facilitated intracellular translocation of APP and inhibited APP amyloidogenic process to reduce the level of APP-CTFβ in the total lysates of AD model cells as well as Aβ in the culture media. Consequently, AHI1–APP interactions enhanced neurotrophic signaling through Erk activation and led to restored cell survival and differentiation. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Abelson helper integration site 1; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid precursor protein; cell protein; huntingtin; huntingtin associated protein 1; unclassified drug; AHI1 gene; Alzheimer disease; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; cell lysate; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; disease model; enzyme activation; gene; gene expression; genotype; human; mouse; nerve cell differentiation; neurite outgrowth; Neuro-2a cell line; neuropathology; nonhuman; protein expression; protein processing; protein protein interaction; protein transport; wild type"
"Relationship between body mass index, antidiabetic agents, and midterm mortality in patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome","2019","Background-The aim of this study was to determine the influence of various antidiabetic therapies on the relationship between body mass index and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. Methods and Results-This was a prospective, observational study comprising 1193 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome. The patients were stratified into 4 body mass index categories, and their mortality rates were compared using time-dependent Cox regression analysis using normal weight (body mass index, 18.5-23.9) as the reference. Subsequently, the influence of antidiabetic therapies on the association between BMI and mortality were analyzed. Seventy-four patients (6.2%) died over 2 years of follow-up. The mortality rate was lowest in the class I obese group (3.35%) and highest in the normal-weight group (9.67%). After adjusting for covariates, class I obesity paradoxically remained significantly protective against mortality compared with normal weight (hazard ratio, 0.141; P=0.049); interaction term analysis showed that insulin therapy influenced this “obesity paradox” (P=0.045). When the patients were stratified by insulin use, the protective effect of obesity disappeared in the insulin-treated patients but persisted in the non-insulin-treated patients. Conclusions-In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome, the relationship between body mass index and mortality rate is U-shaped, with class I obesity representing the nadir and normal weight the peak. The protective effect of obesity disappeared in patients treated with insulin. ? 2019 The Authors.","angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; sulfonylurea; acute coronary syndrome; adult; adverse outcome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; body weight; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; drug use; female; follow up; human; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; treatment response"
"Development of the Family Stigma Stress Scale (FSSS) for Detecting Stigma Stress in Caregivers of People With Mental Illness","2019","People with mental illness and their family caregivers often perceive public stigma, which may lead to stigma-related stress (or stigma stress). However, no instruments have been developed to measure this stress for family caregivers of people with mental illness. We modified an instrument that measures the stigma stress of people with mental illness (i.e., the cognitive appraisal of stigma as a stressor) and examined the psychometric properties of the scores of the newly developed instrument: the Family Stigma Stress Scale (FSSS). Primary family caregivers of people with mental illness in Southern Taiwan (n = 300; mean age = 53.08 ± 13.80; 136 males) completed the FSSS. An exploratory factor analysis showed that the FSSS score had two factors; both factor scores had excellent internal consistency (α =.913 and.814) and adequate test–retest reliability (r =.627 and.533; n = 197). Significant correlations between FSSS factor scores and other instruments supported its concurrent validity and the ability of the FSSS to differentiate between clinical characteristics, for example, having been previously hospitalized or not. The FSSS is a brief and effective measure of the stigma stress of family caregivers of people with mental illness. ? The Author(s) 2017.",""
"Safety and efficacy of nivolumab in combination with s-1/capecitabine plus oxaliplatin in patients with previously untreated, unresectable, advanced, or recurrent gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer: Interim results of a randomized, phase II trial (attraction-4)","2019","Background Nivolumab is approved as an option for third- or later-line treatment of advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer in several countries after ATTRACTION-2. To further improve the therapeutic efficacy of first-line therapy, exploration of a nivolumab-chemotherapy combination is warranted. In part 1 (phase II) of ATTRACTION-4, the safety and efficacy of nivolumab combined with S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CapeOX) as first-line therapy for unresectable advanced or recurrent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative G/GEJ cancer were evaluated. Patients and methods Patients were randomized (1: 1) to receive nivolumab (360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) plus SOX (S-1, 40 mg/m 2 orally twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days off; oxaliplatin, 130 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks) or CapeOX (capecitabine, 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days off; oxaliplatin, 130 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Results Of 40 randomized patients, 39 (nivolumab plus SOX, 21; nivolumab plus CapeOX, 18) and 38 (21 and 17, respectively) comprised the safety and efficacy populations, respectively. Most frequent (>10%) grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (14.3%) in the nivolumab plus SOX group, and neutropenia (16.7%), anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, decreased appetite, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and nausea (11.1% each) in the nivolumab plus CapeOX group. No treatment-related death occurred. Objective response rate was 57.1% (95% confidence interval 34.0-78.2) with nivolumab plus SOX and 76.5% (50.1-93.2) with nivolumab plus CapeOX. Median overall survival was not reached (NR) in both groups. Median progression-free survival was 9.7 months (5.8-NR) and 10.6 months (5.6-12.5), respectively. Conclusion Nivolumab combined with SOX/CapeOX was well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging efficacy for unresectable advanced or recurrent HER2-negative G/GEJ cancer.

"Strategies by which WWOX-deficient metastatic cancer cells utilize to survive via dodging, compromising, and causing damage to WWOX-positive normal microenvironment","2019","Proapoptotic tumor suppressor WWOX is upregulated in the early stage of cancer initiation, which probably provides limitation to cancer growth and progression. Later, WWOX protein is reduced to enhance cancer cell growth, migration, invasiveness and metastasis. To understand how WWOX works in controlling cancer progression, here we demonstrate that apoptotic stress mediated by ectopic WWOX stimulated cancer cells to secrete basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in order to support capillary microtubule formation. This event may occur in the cancer initiation stage. Later, when WWOX loss occurs in cancer cells, hyaluronidase production is then increased in the cancer cells to facilitate metastasis. We determined that inhibition of membrane hyaluronidase Tyr216-phosphorylated Hyal-2 by antibody suppresses cancer growth in vivo. WWOX-negative (WWOX-) cells dodged WWOX+cells in the microenvironment by migrating individually backward to avoid physical contacts and yet significantly upregulating the redox activity of WWOX+parental cells or other WWOX+cell types for causing apoptosis. Upon detecting the presence of WWOX+cells from a distance, WWOX- cells exhibit activation of MIF, Hyal-2, Eph, and Wnt pathways, which converges to MEK/ERK signaling and enables WWOX- cells to evade WWOX+cells. Inhibition of each pathway by antibody or specific chemicals enables WWOX- cells to merge with WWOX+cells. In addition, exogenous TGF-β assists WWOX- cells to migrate collectively forward and merge with WWOX+cells. Metastatic WWOX- cancer cells frequently secrete high levels of TGF-β, which conceivably assists them to merge with WWOX+cells in target organs and secure a new home base in the WWOX+microenvironment. Together, loss of WWOX allows cancer cells to develop strategies to dodge, compromise and even kill WWOX-positive cells in microenvironment. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"E-cigarette use in a country with prevalent tobacco smoking: A population-based study in Taiwan","2019","Background: The different profiles of e-cigarette users in different age groups have seldom been investigated, particularly in populations facing a high prevalence of cigarette smoking. This study aims to examine the prevalence and correlates of e-cigarette use separately for adolescents and adults in nationally representative samples in Taiwan. Methods: Among 17,837 participants in the 2014 National Survey of Substance Use in Taiwan, 4445 were aged 12 to 17 years and 13,392 were aged 18 to 64 years. Individuals’ lifetime tobacco use was divided into four groups: non-use, exclusive e-cigarette use, exclusive cigarette use, and dual use. Questions on sociodemographic features, use and problematic use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, and psychosocial distress, among others, were administered using a computer-assisted selfinterview on tablet computers. Results: Among lifetime users of e-cigarette (2.2% for adults and 0.8% for adolescents), 4.5% for adults and 36.6% for adolescents were exclusive e-cigarette users. From use of exclusive e-cigarettes to use of exclusive cigarettes to dual use, those usage groups were related to an increasing trend of adjusted odds ratios for use of other psychoactive substances, particularly problematic use of alcohol or drugs, and with more depressive symptoms. Two correlates were specific to e-cigarette use: alcohol use had stronger relationships with e-cigarette use among adolescents, and younger adults (18-34) were more likely to try e-cigarettes compared to older adults. Conclusions: These results provide essential information regarding e-cigarette use in the general population, and future prevention strategies should account for its specific correlates in young people. ? 2018 Yi-Lung Chen et al.","adolescent; adult; age distribution; child; cross-sectional study; electronic cigarette; epidemiology; female; health survey; human; male; middle aged; prevalence; smoking; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Taiwan; Tobacco Smoking; Young Adult"
"A p53/TIAF1/WWOX triad exerts cancer suppression but may cause brain protein aggregation due to p53/WWOX functional antagonism","2019","Background: Tumor suppressor WWOX physically binds p53 and TIAF1 and together induces apoptosis and tumor suppression. To understand the molecular action, here we investigated the formation of WWOX/TIAF1/p53 triad and its regulation of cancer cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, SMAD promoter activation, apoptosis, and potential role in neurodegeneration. Methods: Time-lapse microscopy was used to measure the extent of cell migration. Protein/protein interactions were determined by co-immunoprecipitation, FRET microscopy, and yeast two-hybrid analysis. The WWOX/TIAF1/p53 triad-mediated cancer suppression was determined by measuring the extent of cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, SMAD promoter activation, and apoptosis. p53-deficient lung cancer cell growth in nude mice was carried out to assess the tumor suppressor function of ectopic p53 and/or WWOX. Results: Wwox-deficient MEF cells exhibited constitutive Smad3 and p38 activation and migrated individually and much faster than wild type cells. TGF-β increased the migration of wild type MEF cells, but significantly suppressed Wwox knockout cell migration. While each of the triad proteins is responsive to TGF-β stimulation, ectopically expressed triad proteins suppressed cancer cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, and SMAD promoter activation, as well as caused apoptosis. The effects are due in part to TIAF1 polymerization and its retention of p53 and WWOX in the cytoplasm. p53 and TIAF1 were effective in suppressing anchorage-independent growth, and WWOX ineffective. p53 and TIAF1 blocked WWOX or Smad4-regulated SMAD promoter activation. WWOX suppressed lung cancer NCI-H1299 growth and inhibited splenomegaly by inflammatory immune response, and p53 blocked the event in nude mice. The p53/WWOX-cancer mice exhibited BACE upregulation, APP degradation, tau tangle formation, and amyloid β generation in the brain and lung. Conclusion: The WWOX/TIAF1/p53 triad is potent in cancer suppression by blocking cancer cell migration, anchorage-independent growth and SMAD promoter activation, and causing apoptosis. Yet, p53 may functionally antagonize with WWOX. p53 blocks WWOX inhibition of inflammatory immune response induced by cancer, and this leads to protein aggregation in the brain as seen in the Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegeneration. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amyloid beta protein; amyloid precursor protein; beta secretase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; protein p53; Smad3 protein; Smad4 protein; tau protein; transcription factor; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta1 induced anti apoptotic factor 1; unclassified drug; WW domain containing oxidoreductase; Alzheimer disease; anchorage independent growth; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; brain; cancer inhibition; controlled study; cytoplasm; ectopic expression; embryo; enzyme activation; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; gene activation; human; human cell; immune response; immunoprecipitation; inflammation; lung cancer; male; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MEF cell line; microscopy; migration inhibition; mouse; NCI-H1299 cell line; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; polymerization; priority journal; promoter region; protein aggregation; protein degradation; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; splenomegaly; time lapse imaging; two hybrid system; upregulation; yeast"
"Effect of home telehealth care on blood pressure control: A public healthcare centre model","2019","Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of home telehealth care combined with case management by public health nurses, in improving blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. Methods: This cohort study examined the data of patients with hypertension obtained from a telehealth service centre database, between July 2011– June 2012. Eligible patients were adults (?40 years old) with both prehypertension and hypertension, living alone or in the remote suburbs of metropolitan areas. Demographic data were collected from 12 district public health centre in Taipei, Taiwan. Following enrolment, patients received an appropriate and validated home telehealth device kit for automatic blood pressure monitoring and automated modem via a telephone line or a desktop computer with Internet connection to enable data transmission between the patient’s home and telehealth service centre. Patients were instructed to upload the measured data immediately every day. The study outcomes included blood pressure and home telehealth service utilisation. Results: Of the 432 patients recruited, 408 (94%) completed data collection. Linear regression analysis found an average 22.1 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure after one year. The mean slope of systolic blood pressure was classified as decreased or non-decreased. An systolic blood pressure decreasing trend was observed in 52.2% patients, while 47.8% patients showed an increasing systolic blood pressure trend. Patients in the decreased systolic blood pressure group tended to be older (p = 0. 0001), with a greater proportion of hypertension alarms (p = 0. 001), improved self-blood pressure monitoring behaviour (p = 0.009) and higher self-measured blood pressure monitoring frequency (p = 0. 010). Patients in the decreased systolic blood pressure group had a higher self-measured blood pressure monitoring frequency (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.99, p = 0. 013) than their counterparts. Conclusions: Home telehealth care combined with care management by public health nurses based in public health care centre was feasible and effective for improving blood pressure control among patients with hypertension. Further studies should conduct a thorough analysis of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. A randomised controlled trial with a longer follow-up period is required to examine the effects of the improved home telehealth device kit on the care of patients with hypertension. ?

"Risk of Myocardial Infarction After Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study","2019","Carbon monoxide poisoning (COP) may lead to ischemic changes in organs, and heart is one of the most susceptible targets to ischemic condition. The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of myocardial infarction following COP. Using a nationwide database of insurance claims in Taiwan, we conducted a population-based cohort study to identify COP patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2012. At a ratio of 3:1, we identified non-COP patients who were matched by the index date and age and compared the risk of myocardial infarction between the two cohorts by time after the index dates of the COP patients, until 2013. We identified 22,258 COP patients and 66,774 non-COP patients. COP patients had an increased risk of myocardial infarction, with an incidence rate ratio of 1.45 (95% confidence interval 1.06–1.98) in comparison with the non-COP patients after adjusting for other independent predictors, including older age, male sex, and underlying comorbidity of hypertension, diabetes, and renal disease. Stratified analyses showed that the increased risk was more prominent in patients with a young age (< 34?years), female sex, and liver disease, and occurred only in the first month of follow-up. We concluded that?COP increased the risk of myocardial infarction, but the increased risk was only observed in the first month after COP, which indicated that the impact of COP on the heart was mainly acute. Patients who were younger than 34?years, female, and with liver diseases were more prone to myocardial infarction after COP. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","carbon monoxide; acute toxicity; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; carbon monoxide intoxication; cardiovascular risk; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; heart infarction; high risk patient; human; hypertension; incidence; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; population research; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; sex ratio; Taiwan; age; carbon monoxide intoxication; factual database; heart infarction; liver disease; middle aged; risk assessment; risk factor; sex factor; time factor; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Incidence; Liver Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Taiwan; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Bortezomib therapy in a real-world setting in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma","2019","Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, approved for treating newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). This real-world, multicenter, observational, non-interventional study of bortezomib was designed to collect and analyze prospective data in Taiwanese patients with relapsed or refractory MM. The primary endpoints included clinical effectiveness outcomes (disease response, disease progression [PD], time-to-response, time-to-progression, response duration, and overall survival [OS]). Secondary endpoints were safety and healthcare resource utilization. Total 100 patients (median [range] age 64.9 [37.0-85.5] years) were enrolled; 47 patients completed the study. Of the withdrawn patients (n=53), there were 48 deaths (PD-related death: n=35, adverse events [AEs]-related: n=12, other reason: n=1), and 5 due to loss to follow-up. Four patients in Cycle 1, 6 patients each in Cycle 2 and 5, 7 in Cycle 3, 10 patients in Cycle 4, 5 patients in Cycle 6, and 3 patients each in Cycle 7 and 8 achieved overall response during the study. Time-to-response was 4.68 months (95%CI: 3.2, NE) and response duration was 10.08 months (95%CI: 2.3, 28.6). Median OS was 9.8 months (95%CI: 3.8, 13.7), and median time-to-progression was 11.3 months (95%CI: 6.2, 20.2). Most common non-hematological AEs were diarrhea (n=32) and hypoesthesia (n=25); most common hematological AE was thrombocytopenia (n=18). Efficacy and safety profile of bortezomib in Taiwanese patients with MM was similar to global and other Asian population. Study provides a critical insight on use of bortezomib in real-world clinical practice, which can be helpful for Taiwanese healthcare providers’ decision-making processes. ?Copyright S-Y.

"The Effect of Acupuncture in Breast Cancer–Related Lymphoedema (BCRL): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","2019","Background: Breast cancer–related lymphedema (BCRL) is hard to control. Management may include lymphatic drainage, skin care, bandaging, or even surgery. Since acupuncture has been proven to affect the neurophysiology and neuroendocrine systems, it has the potential to control BCRL. Aim: To evaluate the effect of acupuncture in BCRL in randomized controlled trials. Design: A literature search was performed, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and without language restrictions. Data Sources: Five databases were searched from inception tthrough September 2018. Only studies that fulfilled the eligibility criteria of evaluating the effect of acupuncture on lymphedema in breast cancer were included. The methodological quality of these trials was assessed using the Cochrane criteria, and meta-analysis software (RevMan 5.3) was used for analysis. Results: We examined 178 breast cancer patients from 6 trials. All included randomized controlled trials had medium to high quality, based on the modified Jadad scale. The systematic review showed that acupuncture is safe and has a trend to improve symptoms, but trials did not consistently measure outcomes. The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture produced no significant improvement in the extent of lymphedema as compared with the control intervention (?1.90; 95% confidence interval = ?5.39 to 1.59, P =.29). None of the studies reported severe adverse events. Conclusions: Acupuncture is safe and has a trend to improve the lymphedema related to breast cancer, yet it did not significantly change arm circumference in BCRL. Future studies should include both subjective and objective measurements and large-scale studies are warranted. ?

"Feature selection of optical satellite images for chlorophyll-a concentration estimation","2019","Healthy inland freshwater sources, such as lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and streams, play crucial roles in providing numerous benefits to surrounding societies. However, these inland water bodies have been severely polluted by human activities. Therefore, long-term monitoring and real-time measurements of water quality are essential to identify the changes of water quality for unexpected environmental incidents avoidance. The success of satellite-based water quality studies relies on three key components: precise atmospheric correction method, optimization algorithm, and regression model. Previous studies integrated various algorithms and regression models, including (semi-) empirical or (semi-) analytical algorithms, and (non-) linear regression models, to obtain satisfactory results. Nevertheless, the selection of appropriate algorithm is complex and challenging because of the fact that the changes in chemical and physical properties of water can lead to different method determination. To alleviate the aforementioned difficulties, this study proposed a potential integration which comprises an optimization method for efficient water-quality model selection, ordinary least squares regression, and an accurately atmospheric corrected dataset. Prime focus of this study is water-quality model selection which optimizes an objective function that aims to maximize prediction accuracy of regression models. According to the experiments, the performance of the selected water-quality model using proposed procedures, dominated that of the existing algorithms in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE), the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), and slope of the regressed line (m) between measured and predicted chlorophyll-a. ?

"Sex hormones and oxidative stress mediated phthalate-induced effects in prostatic enlargement","2019","Prostatic enlargement might affect up to 30% of men and can cause signs and symptoms in the lower urinary tract in the elderly. Imbalanced estrogen and androgen secretions are important in prostatic physiopathology. Phthalates-environmental endocrine disruptors-affect androgen secretion and disrupt sexual organs, including testes and the prostate, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Using European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines, we recruited from urology clinics in southern Taiwan 207 elderly men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic enlargement between 2015 and 2017. We took blood and urine samples from all patients on the same day. We used multivariate linear regression, associations, and potential interactions after we had measured and analyzed oxidative stress (OS) markers, steroidal hormones, and 11 urinary phthalate metabolites, and then we adjusted for confounders. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolite levels, particularly urinary mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, were positively associated with androgen, estrogen, hormone ratios, inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and prostate volume (PV) (p &lt; 0.05). PV and PSA were positively associated with androgen, estrogen, hormone ratios and OS markers (p &lt; 0.05). The estimated percentages of exposure to phthalates in prostatic enlargement mediated by androgen, estrogen, and OS markers ranged from 3.5% to 63.1%. Exposure to DEHP promoted the progress of BPH by increasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol (E2), the converted enzymes aromatase and 5α reductase, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (8-OHdG and iNOS) production. Sex hormones and OS might be important hyperplasia-promoters after a patient has been exposed to phthalates, especially to DEHP. ? 2019 The Authors","Antigens; Association reactions; Biomolecules; Endocrinology; Esters; Metabolites; Nitric oxide; Oxidative stress; Physiology; Steroid hormones; Urology; Benign prostatic hyperplasia; Environmental endocrine disruptors; Inflammation; Mediation effect; Multivariate linear regressions; Nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS); Phthalate metabolites; Prostatic enlargement; Selenium compounds; 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine; androgen; androstanolone; aromatase; estradiol; estrogen; inducible nitric oxide synthase; mono (2 ethyl 5 hydroxyhexyl)phthalate; mono (2 ethyl 5 oxohexyl)phthalate; mono 2 ethyl 5 carboxypentyl phthalate; mono isobutyl phthalate; mono isodecyl phthalate; mono isononyl phthalate; mono n butyl phthalate; monobenzyl phthalate; monoethyl phthalate; monomethyl phthalate; phthalic acid; phthalic acid 2 ethylhexyl monoester; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; prostate specific antigen; reactive oxygen metabolite; sex hormone; steroid 5alpha reductase; unclassified drug; 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine; androgen; biological marker; deoxyguanosine; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; inducible nitric oxide synthase; NOS2 protein, human; phthalic acid derivative; sex hormone; elderly population; endocrine system disorder; oxidative stress; phthalate; sex hormone; steroid; adult; Article; cross-sectional study; disease exacerbation; human; major clinical study; male; oxidative stress; priority journal; prostate hypertrophy; prostate volume; risk factor; Taiwan; blood; middle aged; pollutant; prostate hypertrophy; urine; Taiwan; Androgens; Biomarkers; Deoxyguanosine; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants; Estrogens; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II; Oxidative Stress; Phthalic Acids; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Taiwan"
"Fibroblast growth factors: Potential novel targets for regenerative therapy of osteoarthritis","2019","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disorder and is the leading cause of disability of people, which negatively impact people’s physical and mental health. Although OA causes great socioeconomic burden and individual suffering, no effective treatment options are provided so far. This is partially resulted from poor regenerative activity of articular cartilage and our incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanism of OA. Traditional drug therapies such as acetaminophen and opioids are effective in relieving pain but do not reverse cartilage damage and are often associated with adverse events. Therefore, it is necessary to find effective OA drugs. In recent years, novel regenerative therapies have received much attention because they can effectively promote tissue repair and regeneration. The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been suggested to involve in cartilage homeostasis for decades. The current research shows that sprifermin/recombinant FGF18 significantly reduces the loss of cartilage thickness and volume without serious side effects, thus warrants a continued research for potential new medications of OA. This review mainly highlights the current research progress on FGFs and FGF receptors as a potential therapeutic target for OA. ? 2019 Chinese Journal of Physiology.","collagen type 10; fibroblast growth factor; fibroblast growth factor 1; fibroblast growth factor 10; fibroblast growth factor 14; fibroblast growth factor 16; fibroblast growth factor 18; fibroblast growth factor 19; fibroblast growth factor 2; fibroblast growth factor 21; fibroblast growth factor 3; fibroblast growth factor 4; fibroblast growth factor 5; fibroblast growth factor 6; fibroblast growth factor 8; fibroblast growth factor 9; fibroblast growth factor receptor; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; fibroblast growth factor receptor 3; hypoxia inducible factor; interleukin 1; keratinocyte growth factor; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; paracetamol; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; syndecan 4; transcription factor Nrf2; unindexed drug; Wnt protein; fibroblast growth factor; age distribution; body mass; chondrocyte; dietary intake; epidemiological data; extracellular matrix; health care cost; heredity; human; incidence; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; obesity; osteoarthritis; prevalence; protein expression; protein function; protein targeting; regenerative medicine; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; signal transduction; articular cartilage; osteoarthritis; Cartilage, Articular; Chondrocytes; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Humans; Osteoarthritis; Signal Transduction"

The proposed stethoscope can be used in hospitals and telemedicine through an internet of things (IoT) system and a cloud database. The proposed stethoscope includes three parts, namely, a front-end device for ECG and heart sound measurement, a smart device application (APP), and a cloud server. The ECG-measuring device is designed for single lead measurement and has low power consumption and IoT-based design, which can send real-time ECG data to the smart device APP. Simultaneously, the heart-sound-measuring device combined with a traditional stethoscope head is used to measure heart sound signals. This device includes an analog front-end circuit and a microphone to filter environmental noises and to record heart sound signals. Heart sound signals are transmitted to the APP by using a Bluetooth Low Energy module. The smart device APP can display synchronized and real-time signals, including ECG and heart sounds. Meanwhile, those signals are recorded in smart devices and are uploaded to the cloud server, where doctors and users can diagnose and monitor healthcare anytime. The cloud server can store previous signals and can realize telemedicine through a web user interface.

"Use of best–worst scaling to estimate the magnitude of stressful life events in older adults","2019","Aim: The magnitude of stressful life events can be measured by using rating scales such as the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. This study aimed to estimate the magnitude of stressful life events by using a best–worst scaling approach in a sample of community-dwelling older persons in Taiwan. Methods: Participants aged 55 years or older were asked to rate the stressfulness of 11 life events on a scale from 0 to 10 and the best–worst scaling. We used the case one (object case) best–worst scaling design: each task on a list of events was presented to participants, and they were asked to indicate the events that they considered most and least stressful. Results: A total of 61 persons (66% women) provided valid responses for analysis; the mean age was 64.8 ± 8.6 years. For best–worst scaling, ‘major illness of family member’ (mean best-minus-worst score = 128) was rated the most stressful, and ‘sexual difficulties’ was rated the least stressful (mean best-minus-worst score = ?153). For the rating scale, ‘major personal illness’ was rated the most stressful (mean rating = 6.95), and ‘sexual difficulties’ was again the least stressful (mean rating = 2.05). Rankings of events based on both methods were similar but were different from ratings based on the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. Conclusion: The current study explored using BWS to estimate the magnitude of stressful life events. The magnitude of events estimated in our study was found to differ from the magnitude estimated previously by some common scales for assessing stressful life events. ? 2018 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society","adult; aged; Article; best worst scaling; community dwelling person; controlled study; death; diseases; educational status; family relation; female; financial management; groups by age; health status; human; life event; male; marriage; mental stress; middle aged; priority journal; sex difference; sexual dysfunction; Social Readjustment Rating Scale; stress; stress assessment; Taiwan; coping behavior; procedures; psycholinguistics; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reimbursement; social adaptation; very elderly; Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Psycholinguistics; Quality of Life; Relative Value Scales; Social Adjustment; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Liquid biopsy for detection of EGFR T790M mutation in nonsmall cell lung cancer: An experience of proficiency testing in Taiwan","2019","Background: The use of liquid biopsy to detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a promising method to screen patients eligible for third-generation EGFR inhibitors. Proficiency testing (PT) programs involving liquid biopsy are currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a PT program to assess the quality assurance of liquid biopsy tests for detecting EGFR T790M mutation in molecular pathology laboratories in Taiwan. Methods: Whole blood samples (2 mL) with various concentrations of the EGFR T790M mutation were prepared and analyzed in six participating laboratories using their clinically validated assays. Results: For circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolation, three of the six participating laboratories used the cobas cfDNA Sample Preparation Kit, and three used the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. For testing platforms, two of the six participating laboratories used mass spectrometry, three used the cobas EGFR mutation test, and one used a laboratory-developed test. There was 100% concordance in detection of all the given concentrations of EGFR T790M mutation between the participating laboratories and different testing platforms. The testing platforms used by all participating laboratories could successfully detect EGFR T790M mutation to an expected frequency of 1%. Conclusion: In this first PT program using liquid biopsy in Taiwan, local clinical laboratories were suitably equipped and proficient in the use of cfDNA to test for the EGFR T790M mutation. Establishing a routine PT system to ensure the reliability and accuracy of liquid biopsy in clinical practice in Taiwan would be helpful.

"Identifying individual risk rare variants using protein structure guided local tests (POINT)","2019","Rare variants are of increasing interest to genetic association studies because of their etiological contributions to human complex diseases. Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal. Constructed under a kernel machine framework, POINT performs local association testing by borrowing information from neighboring variants in the 3-dimensional protein space in a data-adaptive fashion. Besides merely providing a list of promising variants, POINT assigns each variant a p-value to permit variant ranking and prioritization. We assess the selection performance of POINT using simulations and illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants in PCSK9, ANGPTL4 and CETP in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data. ? 2019 Marceau West et al.","angiopoietin related protein 4; cholesterol ester transfer protein; proprotein convertase 9; angiopoietin related protein 4; ANGPTL4 protein, human; CETP protein, human; cholesterol ester transfer protein; PCSK9 protein, human; proprotein convertase 9; ANGPTL4 gene; Article; CETP gene; controlled study; genetic database; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; information processing; molecular genetics; PCSK9 gene; protein analysis; protein structure guided local test; protein structure, function and variability; simulation; three dimensional imaging; biological model; biology; computer simulation; DNA sequence; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; human; procedures; protein tertiary structure; risk factor; Angiopoietin-like 4 Protein; Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Models, Genetic; Proprotein Convertase 9; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Risk Factors; Sequence Analysis, DNA"
"Oral hygiene and the overall survival of head and neck cancer patients","2019","Poor oral hygiene is an established risk factor of head and neck cancer (HNC); however, its role in the survival of HNC patients is unclear. This study evaluated the association between oral hygiene habits, including regular dental visits, frequency of tooth brushing, and use of dental floss, and the overall survival (OS) of HNC patients using interview data collected from 740 HNC patients. In addition, the interactions between oral hygiene and the polymorphisms of TLR2 and TLR4 on the OS of HNC patients were assessed. The analysis indicated that poor oral hygiene was significantly associated with poorer OS of HNC patients (hazard ratio (HR)?=?1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.86). This association was modified by a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs11536889, of TLR4. A significant association between poor oral hygiene and worse survival of HNC was observed among those with the CG or CC genotype (HR?=?2.32, 95% CI: 1.41-3.82) but not among those with the GG genotype (HR?=?0.95, 95% CI: 0.65-1.40). Our results suggested that poor oral hygiene is not only a risk factor but may also be a prognostic factor of HNC. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Who Gets Protection? A National Study of Multiple Victimization and Child Protection Among Taiwanese Children","2019","This study aims to examine the prevalence of multiple types of child victimization and the effects of multiple types of victimization on children’s mental health and behavior in Taiwan. The study also examines the child-protection rate and its correlates among children experiencing various types of victimization. This study collected data with a self-report questionnaire from a national proportionately stratified sample of 6,233 fourth-grade students covering every city and county in Taiwan in 2014. After calculating the 1-year prevalence of child victimization, the study found that bullying was the most prevalent (71%), followed by physical neglect (66%), psychological violence (43%), inter-parental violence (28%), community violence (22%), physical abuse (21%), and sexual violence (9%). As the number of victimization types increased, children were more likely to report greater posttraumatic symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, suicide ideation, self-harm thoughts, and violent behaviors. Gender, neonatal status, parental marital status, and other family risks were significantly associated with elevated incidences of the victimization types. Only 20.6% of the children who had experienced all seven types of victimization had received child protective services. A child was more likely to receive child protective services if he or she had experienced sexual violence, community violence, inter-parental violence exposure, higher family risks, higher suicidal ideation, or living in a single-parent or separated family. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the cumulative effects and the harmful effects that children’s experience of multiple types of victimization can have on the children’s mental health and behavior. The present findings also raise alarms regarding the severity of under-serving in child-victimization cases. These results underscore the importance of assessing, identifying, and helping children with multiple victimization experiences. ? The Author(s) 2016.",""
"Prothymosin-α enhances phosphatase and tensin homolog expression and binds with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 to regulate Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling in human bladder cancer","2019","Prothymosin-α (PTMA) is a small, acidic protein that is usually transported into the nucleus and involves many cellular and immunological functions. Previous studies demonstrated that aberrant location of PTMA expression exists in human bladder cancer, but the role of PTMA protein expression remains elusive. In this study, we created ectopic nuclear or cytoplasmic PTMA expression in human bladder cancer cells by infecting lentiviruses carrying wild type or deleted nuclear localization signal of the PTMA gene. The in vivo tumorigenesis assay showed PTMA protein with deleted nuclear localization signal promotes J82 xenograft tumor growth in mice and shortens their survival more so than the wild type. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that wild-type PTMA protein binds to the PTEN promoter and enhances phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression. Through immunoblot proteomics and in vivo ubiquitination studies, PTMA protein can bind with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and block its ubiquitination. Also, TRIM21 can downregulate both forms of PTMA protein. In human bladder tumors, loss of nuclear PTMA expression was an unfavorable prognostic indicator for shorter disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.54; P?=?0.009). Our data support that nuclear PTMA protein serves as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer through upregulating PTEN and orchestrating TRIM21 for the regulation of Nrf2 signaling. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Assessment of zero-valent iron-based nanotherapeutics for ferroptosis induction and resensitization strategy in cancer cells","2019","Addressing nanomedicine resistance is critical for its ultimate clinical success; despite this, advancing .the therapeutic designs for cancer therapy are rarely discussed in the literature. In this study, we discovered that ferroptosis is the central mechanism governing the therapeutic efficacy and resistance of treatment with zero-valent iron nanoparticles (ZVI NPs). In ZVI-sensitive oral cancer cells, ZVI NPs-induced ferroptosis was characterized by mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and reduced levels of glutathione peroxidases (GPx) in subcellular organelles. However, resistant cells could attenuate ZVI-induced oxidative stress and GPx reduction. They also showed stronger mitochondrial respiration ability, thus resisting ZVI NPs-induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Transcriptome comparison and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed that ZVI-resistant cancer cells expressed a gene set related to enhanced NADPH supply, higher detoxification capacity of reactive oxygen species, and decreased sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers (FINs). Finally, we discovered that certain FINs were able to sensitize ZVI-resistant cancer cells to become treatable without compromising healthy non-malignant cells.

Here, we sought to evaluate whether texture features extracted from 18F-FDG PET/CT images may provide additional prognostic information for SGC with high-risk histology. Methods We retrospectively examined pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT images obtained from 85 patients with nonmetastatic SGC showing high-risk histology. All patients were treated with curative intent. We used the fixed threshold of 40% of SUVmax for tumor delineation. PET texture features were extracted by using histogram analysis, normalized gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and gray-level size zone matrix. Optimal cutoff points for each PET parameter were derived from receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to construct a prognostic model for overall survival (OS). Results Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that SUVmax, SUV entropy, uniformity, entropy, zone-size nonuniformity, and high-intensity zone emphasis were significantly associated with OS. The strongest associations with OS were found for high SUVmax (>6.67) and high SUV entropy (>2.50). Multivariable Cox analysis identified high SUVmax, high SUV entropy, performance status, and N2c-N3 stage as independent predictors of survival. A prognostic model derived from multivariable analysis revealed that patients with high SUVmax and SUV entropy or with the presence of poor performance status or N2c-N3 were associated with worse OS. Conclusions A prognostic model that includes SUVmax and SUV entropy is useful for risk stratification and supports the additional benefit of texture analysis for SGC with high-risk histology. ?

"Streptolysin S induces mitochondrial damage and macrophage death through inhibiting degradation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β in Streptococcus pyogenes infection","2019","Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection is associated with a variety of human diseases. Previous studies indicate GAS infection leads to RAW264.7 cell death, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, analyzing the timing of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and using mitochondrial ROS scavenger, we found the wild type GAS-induced RAW264.7 cell death was associated with mitochondrial ROS. The wild type GAS infection could activate glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Inhibition of GSK-3β activity by lithium chloride or decreasing GSK-3β expression by lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA for GSK-3β could not only decrease the wild type GAS-induced mitochondrial ROS generation, mitochondria damage and cell death, but also reduced GAS intracellular replication. Streptolysin S (SLS), a GAS toxin, played the important role on GAS-induced macrophage death. Compared to the wild type GAS with its isogenic sagB mutant (SLS mutant)-infected macrophages, we found sagB mutant infection caused less mitochondrial ROS generation and cell death than those of the wild type GAS-infected ones. Furthermore, the sagB mutant, but not the wild type or the sagB-complementary mutant, could induce GSK-3β degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. These results suggest that a new mechanism of SLS-induced macrophage death was through inhibiting GSK-3β degradation and further enhancing mitochondrial damage. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"A performance guide for major risk factors control in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Taiwan","2019","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease, carries a high morbidity and mortality. Risk factor control is especially important for patients with ASCVD to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines have been developed by the Taiwan Society of Cardiology, Taiwan Society of Lipids and Atherosclerosis, and Diabetes Association of Republic of China (Taiwan)to assist health care professionals in Taiwan about the control of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus. This article is to highlight the recommendations about blood pressure, cholesterol, and sugar control for ASCVD. Some medications that are beneficial for ASCVD were also reviewed. We hope the clinical outcomes of ASCVD can be improved in Taiwan through the implementation of these recommendations. ? 2019",""
"Real-world outcomes of NSCLC patients receiving tissue or circulating tumor DNA-guided osimertinib treatment","2019","Background: Osimertinib yields significant tumor responses and durations of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with acquired T790M mutations. However, the evidence supporting liquid biopsy-guided treatment is still limited. This study examined the real-world benefits of osimertinib in patients with tissue or plasma T790M mutations. Methods: From January 2016 to June 2018, a total of 183 non-small-cell lung cancer patients were enrolled. The presence of the T790M mutation was assessed by either tissue or plasma. The PFS, overall survival, and tumor response rates of the patients were calculated and compared with those of previous clinical trials. Results: T790M mutations were detected in 51.5% of the patients, including 64 of 140 (45.7%) who underwent liquid biopsies and 23 of 29 (79.3%) who underwent tumor biopsies. After excluding those in clinical trials, 46 patients received osimertinib, including 33 with positive plasma and 13 with positive tissue results for T790M mutations. The median PFS was 11.3?months (interquartile range: 5.2-NR) in all the T790M-positive patients and 10.1?months (interquartile range: 5.9-NR) in the plasma T790M-positive patients. The overall survival, meanwhile, was not reached, whereas the one-year survival rate was 66.1% in all the patients and 61.4% in those who were plasma T790M-positive. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 37.8% and 91.9% in all the patients and 34.6% and 92.3% in the plasma T790M-positive group, respectively. Using a Cox proportional hazards regression, we determined that male gender was a poor prognostic factor for PFS. Conclusions: In this retrospective real-world analysis, it was determined that both tissue and plasma T790M mutations can be used to guide treatment with osimertinib. Similar disease control rates and survival durations were observed in comparison to those of phase 3 clinical trials. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The experience of advance care planning discussion among older residents in a long-term care institution: A qualitative study","2019","Aims and objectives: To explore the experiences and processes of advance care planning (ACP) discussions in older residents of a long-term care institution. Background: Advance care planning can facilitate discussion about end-of-life care and help to identify individual's views, wishes and beliefs about dying at a time when they have the cognitive capacity to reflect on and/or make such decisions. Design: A qualitative study was conducted. Methods: Twenty-eight older adults in a long-term care institution participated in person-to-person interviews using an ACP booklet, which included topics such as life review, healthy habits and behaviours, and end-of-life care issues and information. The discussions were recorded, and thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist was followed. Results: Three themes were identified. First, participants identified that ACP could help to ensure that they achieved their view of a “good death.” Second, the process of ACP bought up difficult decisions that many participants expressed uncertainty about making. Third, participants' ability and willingness to plan for end of life were shaped by considerations about their family members' needs, views and potential role as their future carer. Conclusions: The ACP process involved not only personal ideas about good death but also families' concerns. Uncertainty and lack of information created difficult barriers. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare professionals could address the concept of good death, deliver information for their concerns and promote communication with family members. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","advance care planning; aged; article; checklist; clinical practice; controlled study; death; habit; human; interview; long term care; nursing; qualitative research; resident; thematic analysis; uncertainty; attitude to death; caregiver; decision making; family; female; long term care; male; psychology; qualitative research; terminal care; very elderly; Advance Care Planning; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Death; Caregivers; Decision Making; Family; Female; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Qualitative Research; Terminal Care"
"The Effects of Peer Victimization on Children’s Internet Addiction and Psychological Distress: The Moderating Roles of Emotional and Social Intelligence","2019","This study examines the moderating effects of both emotional intelligence and social intelligence (social awareness and social information processing) on the relationship between peer victimization and internet addiction, and on the association between peer victimization and psychological distress. We collected data from a national proportionately-stratified random sample of 6233 fourth-grade primary school students in Taiwan and constructed hierarchical linear regression models to test the research hypotheses. The results show that youth who have experienced more peer victimization are at a higher risk of internet addiction and psychological distress than youth who have experienced less peer victimization. In this study, emotional intelligence was negatively associated with internet addiction, but it did not significantly buffer the impact of victimization on internet addiction. Social awareness was negatively associated with internet addiction, but it exacerbated the negative impact of peer victimization on internet addiction. On the other hand, emotional intelligence was negatively associated with psychological distress and buffered the negative impact of victimization on mental health. Social information processing was negatively associated with psychological distress, but it amplified the negative impact of peer victimization on mental health among Taiwanese adolescents. The research implications of these findings are discussed. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin S is involved in cancer cell motility by regulating store-operated Ca2+ entry","2019","Cathepsin S (CTSS), a lysosomal cysteine protease, has been reported to be associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, thus promoting cell migration and invasion, but whether CTSS regulates other intracellular mechanisms during metastasis remains unknown. The expression of CTSS was knocked down using siRNA transfection, and enzymatic activity was inhibited by the highly-selective CTSS inhibitor RJW-58. The results of in vitro functional assays, western blot analysis, and an in vivo colonization model demonstrated that CTSS was positively related to cellular adhesive ability. Moreover, both CTSS knockdown and inhibition significantly decreased Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) without changing STIM1 and Orai1 expression levels, while RJW-58 dose-dependently reduced the activation of the Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors, NFAT1 and Rac1. The results of immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CTSS could bind to STIM1, which was reversed by CTSS inhibition. In addition, confocal microscopy and super-resolution imaging showed that CTSS inhibition led to STIM1 puncta accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced the interaction between active STIM1 and EB1. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that the lysosomal cysteine protease, CTSS, plays an important role in mediating Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating STIM1 trafficking, which leads to the suppression of cell migration and invasion. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","calcium ion; calcium release activated calcium channel 1; cathepsin S; eb1 protein; nfat1 protein; protein; Rac1 protein; small interfering RNA; stromal interaction molecule 1; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer cell; cell adhesion; cell invasion; cell motility; confocal microscopy; controlled study; downstream processing; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme activity; female; GBM8401 cell line; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; OECM-1 cell line; PC-9 cell line; priority journal; store operated calcium entry; Western blotting"
"Differential clinical significance of COL5A1 and COL5A2 in tongue squamous cell carcinoma","2019","Background: Type V collagen (COL5), in the functional heterotrimer [α1(V)2α2(V)] isoform, participates in the malignancies of various cancers. However, its role in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. Materials and Methods: The expression levels of COL5A1 and COL5A2 polypeptide chains were examined using the tissue microarray from 245 TSCC patients with immunohistochemistry. Paired t test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed for comparisons among the groups. Survival rates were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank tests. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the impact of protein expression level on survival rate. Results: Expression level of COL5A1 was significantly increased in tumor tissues (P?&lt;?0.001) compared to that in corresponding adjacent normal tissues. High expression level of COL5A1 was associated with advanced pathological stage (III, IV, P?=?0.015) and lymph node metastasis (P?=?0.005) of TSCC patients. High expression level of COL5A1 was also correlated with poor disease-specific survival (DSS, P?=?0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS, P?=?0.003) in TSCC patients. However, high expression level of COL5A2 was correlated with better DFS in TSCC patients (P?=?0.043). Moreover, co-expression level of high (COL5A1)2/low (COL5A2) heterotrimer was correlated with worse DSS (P?=?0.004) and DFS (P?=?0.004). Conclusion: COL5A1 is an unfavorable factor for tumorigenesis, clinicopathological outcomes, and prognosis, whereas COL5A2 is only a favorable factor for prognosis in TSCC. The co-expression of high (COL5A1)2/low (COL5A2) heterotrimer is a more potential unfavorable factor for prognosis in TSCC. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Significance of preoperative acute kidney injury in patients with acute type A aortic dissection","2019","Background/purpose: Acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) is a medical emergency with high mortality even with emergency repair. We explored the risk factors for in-hospital mortality and the impact of preoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with AAD. Methods: Our hospital database contained records for 156 consecutive patients who underwent AAD repair between March 2000 and February 2013. They were assigned to the in-hospital mortality or the survival group. All data were collected retrospectively. Results: The 30-day mortality, including intraoperative deaths, was 14.1% (22/156). Total in-hospital mortality was 19.2% (30/156). Patients who required preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (16.7 vs 3.2%; P = 0.012), or who presented with preoperative cardiac tamponade (46.7 vs 19.0%; P = 0.002), shock/hypotension (56.7 vs 21.4%; P < 0.001), or coma (20.0 vs 6.3%; P = 0.019) had a higher in-hospital mortality rate. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality rate between patients with preoperative AKI or not. Mortality and major complications were significantly correlated with the severity of AKI. Multivariate analysis confirmed that preoperative shock or hypotension (odds ratio = 5.2; 95% CI = 2.2–12.3), and preoperative AKI stage 3 (odds ratio = 4.9; 95% CI = 1.3–19.3) were independent preoperative prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: On the basis of our results, preoperative stage 3 AKI is a crucial prognostic risk factor for patients with AAD repair, Cardiac surgeons should be aware of this condition when dealing with AAD patients. ? 2018","abdominal tenderness; acute disease; acute kidney failure; aged; aortic dissection; aortic reconstruction; Article; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular disease; coma; disease severity; female; heart tamponade; hospital mortality; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; hypotension; major clinical study; male; postoperative complication; preoperative period; prevalence; prognosis; resuscitation; retrospective study; risk factor; shock; type A aortic dissection; acute kidney failure; dissecting aneurysm; hypotension; incidence; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; severity of illness index; survival analysis; Taiwan; thoracic aorta aneurysm; time factor; trends; Acute Kidney Injury; Aged; Aneurysm, Dissecting; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Hypotension; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Time Factors"

"Incidence and treatment outcome of aplastic anemia in Taiwan—real-world data from single-institute experience and a nationwide population-based database","2019","Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare disease characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow failure. The incidence of AA tends to be higher in Asia than in the West, but real-world data about AA in Asia remain limited. We aimed to describe the basic data, treatment, and outcome of AA patients from our institute and evaluate the incidence of AA in Taiwan with a nationwide population-based cohort from National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We identified patients older than 2?years with AA in the Registry of Catastrophic Illness of NHIRD between 2001 and 2010 and excluded patients with any diagnosis suggestive of congenital or secondary bone marrow failure. With a total of 1270 patients, the overall incidence was 5.67 per million people per year, and there was a biphasic age distribution of incidence rate, highest in ? 70?years (19.83 per million people per year) and another peak at age 2–9?years (5.26 per million people per year). Overall, the 5-year survival was 60.0%. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and anti-thymocyte globulin-based immunosuppressive therapy (IST) were the major first-line treatments in patients younger than 40?years and were linked with good survival. In contrast, the majority of patients older than 60?years were treated with androgen, and the survival was poor. In multivariate analysis, “severe AA,” “very severe AA,” and “treatment other than HSCT, IST, or androgen” were independent risk factors for inferior survival. In conclusion, the incidence of AA in Taiwan is consistent with nearby Asian countries and is higher than in the West. Advanced age is associated with higher incidence and poorer outcome. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","androgen receptor antagonist; eltrombopag; lymphocyte antibody; adult; age distribution; aged; aplastic anemia; Article; cancer patient; child; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease duration; disease severity; female; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; ICD-9-CM; immunosuppressive treatment; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; overall survival; personal experience; population research; primary health care; priority journal; risk factor; school child; Taiwan; treatment outcome; very elderly; adolescent; allograft; aplastic anemia; disease free survival; epidemiology; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; incidence; mortality; onset age; preschool child; register; survival rate; Adolescent; Adult; Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Allografts; Anemia, Aplastic; Antilymphocyte Serum; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Survival Rate; Taiwan"
"Low cholesterol levels increase symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates after intravenous thrombolysis: A multicenter cohort validation study","2019","Aim: Although a lower level of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was reported to be inversely associated with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), no enough evidence has verified whether lipid profiles modify hemorrhagic transformation and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic treated with thrombolysis. Methods: This multicenter cohort study included 2373 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis between December 2004 and December 2016. Of these, 1845 patients were categorized into either the hyperlipidemia or non-hyperlipidemia group. Symptomatic ICH (SICH) rates within 24–36 h of thrombolytic onset and functional outcomes at 30 and 90 days were longitudinally surveyed. Models of predicting hemorrhagic transformation were used to validate our findings. Results: For enrolled 1845 patients, SICH rates were ?2-fold reduced for the hyperlipidemia group by the NINDS (adjusted RR: 0.488 [0.281–0.846], p =0.0106), the ECASS II (adjusted RR: 0.318 [0.130–0.776], p =0.0119), and SITS-MOST standards (adjusted RR: 0.214 [0.048 –0.957], p =0.0437). The favorable functional rates between the two groups were not significantly different. Lower levels of LDL-C were showed in robust association with SICH. With a cut-off LDL-C value of ＜130 mg/dL, new models are more robust and significant in predicting hemorrhagic transformation within 24 –36 h. Conclusions: This study supports the strong association between reduced LDL-C and increased SICH, but not for functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis. LDL-C level of ＜130 mg/dL is supposed to a candidate marker for predicting SICH within 24–36 h. ? 2019 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.","acetylsalicylic acid; alteplase; cholesterol; clopidogrel; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; ticlopidine; triacylglycerol; warfarin; biological marker; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; atrial fibrillation; blood clot lysis; blood pressure; brain hemorrhage; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; dual antiplatelet therapy; female; human; hyperlipidemia; lipid fingerprinting; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; safe implementation of thrombolysis in stroke monitoring study; scoring system; validation study; adverse event; aged; blood; brain hemorrhage; clinical trial; fibrinolytic therapy; follow up; intravenous drug administration; longitudinal study; prognosis; validation study; Administration, Intravenous; Aged; Biomarkers; Cholesterol, HDL; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prognosis; Thrombolytic Therapy"
"Mortality and vertebral fracture risk associated with long-term oral steroid use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systemic review and meta-analysis","2019","Short-term oral steroid use may improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, long-term oral steroid (LTOS) use is not recommended owing to its potential adverse effects. Our study aimed to investigate whether chronic use of oral steroids for more than 4 months would increase mortality and vertebral fracture risk in patients with stable COPD. A systemic search of the PubMed database was conducted, and meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Five studies with a total of 1795 patients showed there was an increased risk of mortality in patients using LTOS (relative risk, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19–2.23; p &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 86%). In addition, four studies with a total of 17,764 patients showed there was an increased risk of vertebral fracture in patients using LTOS (odds ratio, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.52–3.50; p = 0.03; I2 = 65%). Our meta-analysis showed LTOS was associated with increased mortality and vertebral fracture risk in patients with COPD, and this risk may be due to the adverse effects of LTOS and progression COPD. ?

"Symmetrical acral keratoderma revisited: proposal for a new term, ‘pigmented carpotarsal hyperkeratosis’","2019","First reported from Taiwan mistakenly as acral acanthosis nigricans in 1991, pigmented carpotarsal hyperkeratosis or hyperkeratosis nigricans carpi et tarsi displays a peculiar distribution of velvety brown-grey hyperpigmented plaques symmetrically on the flexural side of the wrists and ankles and on the dorsal sides of the hands and feet. A marked epidermal hyperkeratosis with typically mild acanthosis and papillomatosis is observed in histology. Whitish maceration upon perspiration or water exposure, with exacerbation in summer but remission in winter, is common. The association with obesity, endocrine disorders, atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis or malignancy is unknown. Familial occurrence and hereditary patterns are ill-defined. There is preliminary evidence indicating a pathogenic role of missense mutation in the transcription factor 4 gene. Treatment is empirical, with good outcome with topical retinoids and keratolytic agents. Recurrence is common, and long-term prognosis is unclear. To be distinguished are acral acanthosis nigricans, palmoplantar keratoderma of the Nagashima type, palmoplantar keratoderma of the Bothnian type and aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma. Most reported cases are from Southern China and are predominantly observed in men between the ages of 20 and 40 years. The currently used term ‘symmetrical acral keratoderma’ is non-specific and misleading and may lead to global unawareness, underreporting or misdiagnosis of this phenomenon. Further genetic and molecular studies are required to clarify its pathogenesis and relation to palmoplantar keratoderma. ? 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology","adapalene; etretin; retinoic acid; salicylic acid; steroid; acanthosis nigricans; acral acanthosis nigricans; China; clinical feature; differential diagnosis; disease severity; family history; histology; histopathology; human; hyperkeratosis; keratoderma; nomenclature; palmoplantar keratoderma; pathogenesis; pigmented carpotarsal hyperkeratosis; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; Review; summer; symmetrical acral keratoderma; Taiwan; winter; acanthosis nigricans; classification; female; hand disease; hyperpigmentation; immunohistochemistry; male; needle biopsy; nomenclature; palmoplantar keratoderma; pathology; sensitivity and specificity; skin disease; Acanthosis Nigricans; Biopsy, Needle; China; Female; Foot Dermatoses; Hand Dermatoses; Humans; Hyperpigmentation; Immunohistochemistry; Keratoderma, Palmoplantar; Male; Sensitivity and Specificity; Taiwan; Terminology as Topic"
"A novel proteotoxic combination therapy for EGFR+ and HER2+ cancers","2019","While HER2 and EGFR are overexpressed in breast cancers and multiple other types of tumors, the use of EGFR and/or HER2 inhibitors have failed to cure many cancer patients, largely because cancers acquire resistance to HER2/EGFR-specific drugs. Cancers that overexpress the HER-family proteins EGFR, HER2, and HER3 are uniquely sensitive to agents that disrupt HER2 and EGFR protein folding. We previously showed that disruption of disulfide bond formation by Disulfide Disrupting Agents (DDAs) kills HER2/EGFR overexpressing cells through multiple mechanisms. Herein, we show that interference with proline isomerization in HER2/EGFR overexpressing cells also induces cancer cell death. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) selectively kills EGFR+ or HER2+ breast cancer cells in vitro by activating caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. Further, CsA synergizes with the DDA tcyDTDO to kill HER2/EGFR overexpressing cells in vitro and the two agents cooperate to kill HER2+ tumors in vivo. There is a critical need for novel strategies to target HER2+ and EGFR+ cancers that are resistant to currently available mechanism-based agents. Drugs that target HER2/EGFR protein folding, including DDAs and CsA, have the potential to kill cancers that overexpress EGFR or HER2 through the induction of proteostatic synthetic lethality. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","antineoplastic agent; caspase; cyclophilin; cyclosporine; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; proline; tcyDTDO; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; cyclosporine; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epidermal growth factor receptor 3; ERBB2 protein, human; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer cell; cancer combination chemotherapy; cell killing; cell viability; cohort analysis; controlled study; disulfide bond; dose response; down regulation; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug mechanism; drug potentiation; drug selectivity; endoplasmic reticulum stress; female; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; isomerization; mouse; nonhuman; pharmacophore; priority journal; protein folding; protein homeostasis; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; animal; apoptosis; cell death; drug effect; metabolism; neoplasm; nonobese diabetic mouse; SCID mouse; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Death; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclosporine; ErbB Receptors; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplasms; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptor, ErbB-3; Signal Transduction"
"Stroke occurrence while on antiplatelet therapy may predict atrial fibrillation detected after stroke","2019","Background and aims: Stroke occurrence while on antiplatelet therapy, i.e., a breakthrough stroke, is often conveniently attributed to antiplatelet resistance. However, undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) may underlie breakthrough strokes. We hypothesized that a breakthrough stroke may be a clinical marker for patients at risk of having AF detected after stroke (AFDAS). Methods: Consecutive patients without known AF hospitalized for ischemic stroke between 2000 and 2013 were identified from nationwide claims data. The independent variable of interest was continued use of antiplatelet therapy within 30 days before stroke. The diagnosis of AF and comorbidities were ascertained using validated algorithms. Stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) was estimated using a validated claims-based method. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to determine the effect of breakthrough strokes on the occurrence of AFDAS separately in patients with mild and severe stroke (estimated NIHSS ?10 versus >10). Results: Among 17,076 patients (40% female, mean age 69 years), 3314 (19%) were on antiplatelet therapy before stroke. In patients with mild stroke, prior antiplatelet use was significantly associated with the occurrence of AFDAS (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.48). In contrast, no association existed between prior antiplatelet use and the risk of AFDAS in those with severe stroke. Conclusions: Patients with a breakthrough stroke of mild severity while on antiplatelet therapy carried an increased risk of AFDAS compared to those not on antiplatelet therapy. Our findings may help prioritize patients for advanced cardiac monitoring in daily practice. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; cilostazol; clopidogrel; dipyridamole; ticlopidine; adult; aged; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; Article; atrial fibrillation; atrial fibrillation detected after stroke; atrial fibrillation detected after stroke; brain ischemia; clinical evaluation; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; outcome assessment; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; stroke patient"
"Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 enhances chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer by methylating hnRNPA1 to increase ABCG2 expression","2019","Pancreatic cancer is poorly responsive to chemotherapy due to intrinsic or acquired resistance. Our previous study showed that epigenetic modifying enzymes including protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) are dysregulated in gemcitabine (GEM)-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. Here, we attempt to elucidate the role of PRMT3 in chemoresistance. Overexpression of PRMT3 led to increased resistance to GEM in pancreatic cancer cells, whereas reduction of PRMT3 restored GEM sensitivity in resistant cells. We identified a novel PRMT3 target, ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), which is known to play a critical role in drug resistance. PRMT3 overexpression upregulated ABCG2 expression by increasing its mRNA stability. Mass spectrometric analysis identified hnRNPA1 as a PRMT3 interacting protein, and methylation of hnRNPA1 at R31 by PRMT3 in vivo and in vitro. The expression of methylation-deficient hnRNPA1-R31K mutant reduced the RNA binding activity of hnRNPA1 and the expression of ABCG2 mRNA. Taken together, this provides the first evidence that PRMT3 methylates the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of hnRNPA1 and promotes the binding between hnRNPA1 and ABCG2 to enhance drug resistance. Inhibition of PRMT3 could be a novel strategy for the treatment of GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer. ? 2018 by the authors.

"Diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient on F-18-FDG PET/CT","2019","Lung Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and about 85% of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The staging of lymph nodes in NSCLC patients is extremely important because respective stages require different treatments. FDG-PET/CT is a gold standard for lymph node metastasis staging of NSCLC. However, the results of discriminating lymph node staging on 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) / computed tomography (CT) still needs improvement. In addition to the traditional image parameters of FDG-PET/CT such as standardized uptake value (SUV), there are many other parameters available from FDG-PET/CT images, for example, the lymphatic drainage pathway. Other than this, texture analysis which distinguishes subtle difference can also be a way to define lymph node staging. For the purpose of a better accuracy on lymph node metastasis diagnosis on NSCLC patient in FDG-PET/CT, this research developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to improve the diagnostic efficiency, which achieved 88.056% accuracy. ? 2019 SPIE.","Biological organs; Body fluids; Computerized tomography; Diseases; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Pathology; Positron emission tomography; Textures; FDG PET; Lymph node; lymphatic drainage pathway; Metastasis; Non small cell lung cancer; Texture analysis; Computer aided diagnosis"
"Does Democracy Enhance Health? New Empirical Evidence 1900–2012","2019","This study tests the relationship between democracy and population health. Some studies argue that democracies are more likely than authoritarian regimes to provide public goods and, thus, enhance health. However, recent research has challenged this argument and identified good governance as the crucial determinant of human development. Using a newly collected dataset covering 173 countries from 1900 to 2012, our analyses show that across models with various specifications, democratic elections have consistent effects on health outcomes even when other important factors, including good governance, are taken into account. There are some nuances in this relationship. First, the impact of electoral democracy tends to persist over time. Furthermore, the positive effects are particularly salient once the quality of elections has achieved a certain threshold. Our results also suggest that previous studies yielded mixed results in part because the commonly used governance indicators are only available for relatively short time periods, and the sample does not reflect the entire range of variation in measures of both democracy and governance. ? 2018 University of Utah.",""
"Cordycepin-induced unfolded protein response-dependent cell death, and AKT/MAPK-mediated drug resistance in mouse testicular tumor cells","2019","Testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men at 15-44?years of age, and radical orchidectomy combined with chemotherapy is currently considered as the standard treatment. However, drugs resistance and side effects that impact the quality of life for patients with testicular cancer have not been markedly improved in recent decades. In this study, we characterized the pharmacological exacerbation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is an effective approach to kill testicular cancer cells, by carrying out a clustering analysis of mRNA expression profiles and the immunobloting examination of cordycepin-treated MA-10 cells. The UPR is executed in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress to complement by an apoptotic response if the defect cannot be resolved. Results showed that cordycepin significantly modulated FoxO/P15/P27, PERK-eIF2α (apoptotic), and the IRE1-XBP1 (adaptive) UPR pathways. Interestingly, a fraction of MA-10 cells survived after cordycepin treatment, the AKT, LC3 I/II, and MAPK signaling pathways were highly induced in attached cells as compared to the suspended cells, illustrating the drug resistance to cordycepin via activating AKT and MAPK pathways in MA-10 cells. In summary, PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway is required for pro-apoptotic UPR in MA-10 cell death following cordycepin treatment, suggesting a potential therapeutic application in treating testicular cancer. However, activation of AKT and MAPK pathways could possibly result in drug resistance to cordycepin in MA-10 cells. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Phomaketide A inhibits lymphangiogenesis in human lymphatic endothelial cells","2019","Lymphangiogenesis is an important biological process associated with cancer metastasis. The development of new drugs that block lymphangiogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Marine fungus-derived compound phomaketide A, isolated from the fermented broth of Phoma sp. NTOU4195, has been reported to exhibit anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its anti-lymphangiogenic activity has not been clarified to date. In this study, we showed that phomaketide A inhibited cell growth, migration, and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) without an evidence of cytotoxicity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that phomaketide A reduced LECs-induced lymphangiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), protein kinase C (PKC), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signalings. Furthermore, human proteome array analysis indicated that phomaketide A significantly enhanced the protein levels of various protease inhibitors, including cystatin A, serpin B6, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). Importantly, phomaketide A impeded tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis by decreasing the expression of LYVE-1, a specific marker for lymphatic vessels, in tumor xenograft animal model. These results suggest that phomaketide A may impair lymphangiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR-3, PKC, and eNOS signaling cascades, while simultaneously activating protease inhibitors in human LECs. We document for the first time that phomaketide A inhibits lymphangiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that this natural product could potentially treat cancer metastasis. ? 2019 by the authors.","antineoplastic agent; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; fungal extract; phomaketide A; protein kinase C delta; rapamycin; unclassified drug; vasculotropin receptor 3; angiogenesis inhibitor; antinematodal agent; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; FLT4 protein, human; NOS3 protein, human; polyketide; PRKCD protein, human; protein kinase C delta; vasculotropin receptor 3; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; controlled study; drug identification; drug isolation; drug mechanism; drug structure; endothelium cell; human; human cell; lung adenocarcinoma; lymph vessel endothelium; lymphangiogenesis; male; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; Phoma; tumor vascularization; A-549 cell line; animal; aquatic species; Ascomycetes; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; drug screening; endothelium cell; isolation and purification; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel; lymphangiogenesis; metabolism; neoplasm; nude mouse; pathology; signal transduction; A549 Cells; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Antinematodal Agents; Aquatic Organisms; Ascomycota; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Metastasis; Lymphatic Vessels; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasms; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Polyketides; Protein Kinase C-delta; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Association of iron deficiency anemia with tuberculosis in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study","2019","Background Iron deficiency is associated with decreased cellular immunity, which may predispose patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). This study investigated the relationship between newly diagnosed IDA and TB infection in Taiwan. Methods The study included data on 21,946 patients with incident IDA and 87,555 non-IDA controls from a national database covering the period 2000–2012. IDA and non-IDA subjects were matched 1:4 on age, gender, and index year. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial IDA diagnosis to the date of developing TB or 31 December 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with the control group as the reference. Results The adjusted hazard ratio of TB for the IDA group was 1.99 (95% confidence interval, 1.77–2.25) compared with the control group. The subgroup analysis showed that for both genders, all age groups, and patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hepatitis B virus infection, the IDA group had significantly higher TB incidence. The association was significantly stronger within the 5 years after new IDA diagnosis for both genders and all age groups. Conclusions Higher TB incidence was discovered in the IDA group, especially for patients with comorbidities. ? 2019 Chu et al.

"Development of a human-computer collaborative sleep scoring system for polysomnography recordings","2019","The overnight polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of patients were scored by an expert to diagnose sleep disorders. Visual sleep scoring is a time-consuming and subjective process. Automatic sleep staging methods can help; however, the mechanism and reliability of these methods are not fully understood. Therefore, experts often need to rescore the recordings to obtain reliable results. Here, we propose a human-computer collaborative sleep scoring system. It is a rule-based automatic sleep scoring method that follows the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines to perform an initial scoring. Then, the reliability level of each epoch is analyzed based on physiological patterns during sleep and the characteristics of various stage changes. Finally, experts would only need to rescore epochs with a low-reliability level. The experimental results show that the average agreement rate between our system and fully manual scorings can reach 90.42% with a kappa coefficient of 0.85. Over 50% of the manual scoring time can be reduced. Due to the demonstrated robustness and applicability, the proposed approach can be integrated with various PSG systems or automatic sleep scoring methods for sleep monitoring in clinical or homecare applications in the future. ? 2019 Liang et al.","adult; Article; clinical article; electroencephalography; female; health care organization; human; human computer interaction; kappa statistics; male; polysomnography; practice guideline; reliability; scoring system; sleep disorder; sleep spindle; sleep stage; Taiwan; United States; university hospital; young adult"
"A subanalysis of Taiwanese patients from ODYSSEY South Korea and Taiwan study evaluating the efficacy and safety of alirocumab","2019","Background: Alirocumab can provide significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, data regarding its efficacy and safety in Asians are limited. Methods: A subgroup analysis of Taiwanese patients (n = 116) in a randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in South Korea and Taiwan (ODYSSEY KT, clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02289963) was performed. Patients with hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk on maximally tolerated statin were randomized to alirocumab (75 mg every 2 weeks; with dose increased to 150 mg at Week 12 if LDL-C ? 70 mg/dL at Week 8) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24. Safety was assessed for a total of 32 weeks. Results: At Week 24, the percent change in calculated LDL-C in the alirocumab group (n = 57) was ?51%, whereas that in the placebo group (n = 59) was 2.5%. Alirocumab significantly improved other lipid parameters, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and A1, lipoprotein (a), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the alirocumab group reached an LDL-C target below 70 mg/dL than those in the placebo group (81.3% vs 15.4%). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between both groups. Conclusion: Alirocumab treatment provided a favorable effect on LDL-C levels and other lipid parameters, and was generally well-tolerated in patients from Taiwan.

"Chemopreventive Effect of Phytosomal Curcumin on Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma in A Transgenic Mouse Model","2019","Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Hepatitis B X protein (HBx) and pre-S2 mutant have been proposed as the two most important HBV oncoproteins that play key roles in HCC pathogenesis. Curcumin is a botanical constituent displaying potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties without toxic side effects. Phytosomal formulation of curcumin has been shown to exhibit enhanced bioavailability, improved pharmacokinetics, and excellent efficacy against many human diseases. However, effectiveness of phytosomal curcumin for HCC treatment remains to be clarified. In this study, we evaluated chemopreventive effect of phytosomal curcumin on HBV-related HCC by using a transgenic mouse model specifically expressing both HBx and pre-S2 mutant in liver. Compared with unformulated curcumin, phytosomal curcumin exhibited significantly greater effects on suppression of HCC formation, improvement of liver histopathology, decrease of lipid accumulation and leukocyte infiltration, and reduction of total tumor volume in transgenic mice. Moreover, phytosomal curcumin exerted considerably stronger effects on activation of anti-inflammatory PPARγ as well as inhibition of pro-inflammatory NF-κB than unformulated curcumin. Furthermore, phytosomal curcumin showed a comparable effect on suppression of oncogenic mTOR activation to unformulated curcumin. Our data demonstrated that phytosomal curcumin has promise for HCC chemoprevention in patients with chronic HBV infection. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"EFFECTS OF DIABETES MELLITUS ON VISCOELASTICITY OF ULTRASTRUCTURES OF PERIPHERAL NERVES: THREE-DIMENSIONAL FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES","2019","Diabetes mellitus induces a variety of neuropathies and causes various symptoms. Understanding how diabetes affects mechanical properties of nerves is useful for preventing complications of diabetes mellitus such as the carpal tunnel syndrome. In a previous study, a two-dimensional hyper-viscoelastic finite element model (FEM) of the ultra-structures of normal rat sciatic nerves was developed using an optical coherence tomography (OCT) microscope and in vitro parallel compression tests. The main goal of this study was to extend the FEM from two to three dimensions and use it to explore hyper-viscoelasticity of ultra-structures of sciatic nerves of diabetic rats. A modification of the compression testing system to enhance OCT cross-sectional images of the nerve samples was also conducted. The results showed that the instantaneous shear moduli of the perineurium, epineurium, and endoneurium of the diabetic rat were all greater than those of the normal rats. Due to high instantaneous shear moduli and low percentage of relaxation, the diabetic nerve is prone to damage when subjected to prolonged mechanical loads. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Compression testing; Elastic moduli; Image enhancement; Optical tomography; Rats; Shear strain; Tomography; Viscoelasticity; Carpal tunnel syndrome; Cross sectional image; Diabetes mellitus; Inverse finite element analysis; Peripheral nerves; Rat sciatic nerve; Three dimensional finite element analysis; Three dimensions; Finite element method"
"Ramucirumab after sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and increased α-fetoprotein concentrations (REACH-2): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial","2019","Background: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and increased α-fetoprotein concentrations have poor prognosis. We aimed to establish the efficacy of ramucirumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or higher. Methods: REACH-2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 92 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 20 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically or cytologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma, or diagnosed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance statuses of 0 or 1, α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater, and had previously received first-line sorafenib. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive web response system with a computer-generated random sequence to 8 mg/kg intravenous ramucirumab every 2 weeks or placebo. All patients received best supportive care. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, proportion of patients achieving an objective response, time to radiographic progression, safety, time to deterioration in scores on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Hepatobiliary Symptom Index 8 (FHSI-8), and time to deterioration in ECOG performance status. We also pooled individual patient data from REACH-2 with data from REACH (NCT01140347) for patients with α-fetoprotein concentrations of 400 ng/mL or greater. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, whereas safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02435433. Findings: Between July 26, 2015, and Aug 30, 2017, 292 patients were randomly assigned, 197 to the ramucirumab group and 95 to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 7·6 months (IQR 4·0–12·5), median overall survival (8·5 months [95% CI 7·0–10·6] vs 7·3 months [5·4–9·1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·710 [95% CI 0·531–0·949]; p=0·0199) and progression-free survival (2·8 months [2·8–4·1] vs 1·6 months [1·5–2·7]; 0·452 [0·339–0·603]; p<0·0001) were significantly improved in the ramucirumab group compared with the placebo group. The proportion of patients with an objective response did not differ significantly between groups (nine [5%] of 197 vs one [1%] of 95; p=0·1697). Median time to deterioration in FHSI-8 total scores (3·7 months [95% CI 2·8–4·4] vs 2·8 months [1·6–2·9]; HR 0·799 [95% CI 0·545–1·171]; p=0·238) and ECOG performance statuses (HR 1·082 [95% CI 0·639–1·832]; p=0·77) did not differ between groups. Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either group were hypertension (25 [13%] in the ramucirumab group vs five [5%] in the placebo group), hyponatraemia (11 [6%] vs 0) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [3%] vs five [5%]). Serious adverse events of any grade and cause occurred in 68 (35%) patients in the ramucirumab group and 28 (29%) patients in the placebo group. Three patients in the ramucirumab group died from treatment-emergent adverse events that were judged to be related to study treatment (one had acute kidney injury, one had hepatorenal syndrome, and one had renal failure). Interpretation: REACH-2 met its primary endpoint, showing improved overall survival for ramucirumab compared with placebo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein concentrations of at least 400 ng/mL who had previously received sorafenib. Ramucirumab was well tolerated, with a manageable safety profile. To our knowledge, REACH-2 is the first positive phase 3 trial done in a biomarker-selected patient population with hepatocellular carcinoma.

"Improving the timeliness and accuracy of injury severity data in road traffic accidents in an emerging economy setting","2019","Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are among the leading causes of injury and fatality worldwide. RTI casualties are continually increasing in Taiwan; however, because of a lack of an advanced method for classifying RTI severity data, as well as the fragmentation of data sources, road traffic safety and health agencies encounter difficulties in analyzing RTIs and their burden on the healthcare system and national resources. These difficulties lead to blind spots during policy-making for RTI prevention and control. After compiling classifications applied in various countries, we summarized data sources for RTI severity in Taiwan, through which we identified data fragmentation. Accordingly, we proposed a practical classification for RTI severity, as well as a feasible model for collecting and integrating these data nationwide. This model can provide timely relevant data recorded by medical professionals and is valuable to healthcare providers. The proposed model's pros and cons are also compared to those of other current models. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Fluoride network and circular economy as potential model for sustainable development-A review","2020","Fluorine is the most reactive elements among the halogen group and commonly and ubiquitously occurs as fluoride in nature. The industrial processes produce fluoride by-products causing the increase of unwanted environmental levels and consequently posing risk on human and environmental health worldwide. This review gives a fundamental understanding of fluoride networks in the industrial processes, in the geological and hydrological transport, and in the biological sphere. Numerous biological pathways of fluoride also increase the risk of exposure. Literature shows that various environmental levels of fluoride due to its chemical characteristics cause bioaccumulation resulting in health deterioration among organisms. These problems are aggravated by emitted fluoride in the air and wastewater streams. Moreover, the current waste disposal dependent on incineration and landfilling superpose to the problem. In our analysis, the fluoride material flow model still follows a linear economy and reuse economy to some extent. This flow model spoils resources with high economic potential and worsens environmental problems. Thus, we intend a shift from the conventional linear economy to a circular economy with the revival of three-dimensional objectives of sustainable development. Linkages between key dimensions of the circular economy to stimulate momentum for perpetual sustainable development are proposed to gain economic, environmental and social benefits. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemistry; Deterioration; Fluorine compounds; Halogen elements; Health risks; Planning; Waste incineration; Wastewater disposal; Chemical characteristic; Circular economy; Environmental health; Environmental levels; Environmental problems; Fluoride; Fluoride toxicity; Fluoride Transport; Sustainable development; aluminum; coal; fertilizer; fluoride; ground water; bioaccumulation; byproduct; economic analysis; fluoride; literature review; pollutant transport; risk assessment; sustainable development; toxicity; waste disposal; aquatic fauna; aquatic flora; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; bone; economic model; electric power plant; environmental exposure; environmental impact; fluoridation; human; incineration; landfill; literature; liver toxicity; municipal wastewater; nephrotoxicity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; reproductive toxicity; Review; risk factor; sustainable development; terrestrial species; thyroid disease; tooth; waste disposal; waste water; waste water treatment plant; water supply"
"Bloodstream infections in hospitalized adults with dengue fever: Clinical characteristics and recommended empirical therapy","2019","Background: Dengue is an important mosquito-borne tropical viral disease and dual infection, though rare, has been regarded as a risk factor for severe disease and mortality. However, few studies focused on bloodstream infections (BSIs) and empirical antibiotic therapy rarely addressed. Methods: Dengue patients with concurrent or subsequent BSIs between July 1 and December 31, 2015 were included. Clinical information, laboratory data, and drug susceptibility data were collected. Results: Totally 80 patients, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 32.5%, were included and categorized into three groups. 32 patients in Group I (BSI onset within 48 h after admission), 32 in Group II (between 48 h and one week), and 16 in Group III (more than one week). Patients in Group I were older (mean age: 75.6 vs. 72.6 or 69.6 years; P = 0.01) and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (3.1 vs. 1.8 or 1.9; P = 0.02) than those in Group II or III. Streptococcus species (28.9%, 11/38) and Escherichia coli (23.7%, 9/38) were major pathogens in Group I. Enterobacteriaceae (38.2%, 13/34) isolates predominated in Group II. Fatal patients more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic than the survivors (61.5% vs. 35.2%; P = 0.03). According to susceptibility data, pathogens in Group I and II shared similar susceptibility profiles, and levofloxacin, cefepime, or piperacillin/tazobactam, can be empirically prescribed for those hospitalized within one week. Conclusions: BSI pathogens vary among dengue patients. For adults with dengue and suspected BSI hospitalized within one week, empirical antimicrobial agents are recommended. ? 2018","amikacin; cefazolin; cefepime; ceftazidime; ciprofloxacin; cotrimoxazole; gentamicin; imipenem; levofloxacin; meropenem; piperacillin plus tazobactam; antiinfective agent; cefepime; levofloxacin; Acinetobacter; Aeromonas; aged; antibacterial activity; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacteremia; blood culture; bloodstream infection; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical outcome; dengue; Elizabethkingia meningoseptica; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli; female; hospital mortality; human; inappropriate prescribing; Klebsiella pneumoniae; leukocytosis; major clinical study; male; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; mixed infection; nonhuman; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; retrospective study; Salmonella; Streptococcus; Streptococcus salivarius; thrombocytopenia; bacteremia; blood; candidemia; complication; dengue; Enterobacteriaceae infection; Escherichia coli infection; hospital; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; mixed infection; mortality; pathogenicity; risk factor; Staphylococcus infection; Taiwan; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Candidemia; Cefepime; Coinfection; Dengue; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Levofloxacin; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Mortality; Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Staphylococcal Infections; Streptococcus; Taiwan"
"Oncogenic zinc finger protein ZNF322A promotes stem cell-like properties in lung cancer through transcriptional suppression of c-Myc expression","2019","ZNF322A, a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor, is an oncoprotein in lung cancer. However, the transcription mechanisms of ZNF322A in lung cancer stem cell-like reprogramming remain elusive. By integrating our chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and RNA-sequencing datasets, we identified and validated the transcriptional targets of ZNF322A, which were significantly enriched in tumorigenic functions and developmental processes. Indeed, overexpression of ZNF322A promoted self-renewal ability and increased stemness-related gene expressions in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, ZNF322A bound directly to c-Myc promoter and recruited histone deacetylase 3 to transcriptionally suppress c-Myc expression, which in turn increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and promoted cell motility, thus maintaining stem cell-like properties of lung cancer. Clinically, ZNF322AHigh/c-MycLow expression profile was revealed as an independent indicator of poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Our study provides the first evidence that ZNF322A-centered transcriptome promotes lung tumorigenesis and ZNF322A acts as a transcription suppressor of c-Myc to maintain lung cancer stem cell-like properties by shifting metabolism towards oxidative phosphorylation. ? 2018, The Author(s).","histone deacetylase 3; Myc protein; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; zinc finger protein ZNF322A; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cell motility; cell self-renewal; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; downstream processing; female; gene expression; gene identification; gene repression; gene targeting; genetic transcription; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein function; RNA sequence; validation process"
"Development and Usability Testing of a Decision Support App for Women Considering Breast Reconstruction Surgery","2019","Women with breast cancer have difficulty deciding whether to undergo breast reconstruction when mastectomy is necessary. A computer-based decision aid that can be individualized to provide both surgery information and value clarification may be helpful for women considering breast reconstruction surgery. The objectives of this study are to program a prototype of an application (app) with a value clarification exercise and to evaluate the pilot usability, feasibility, and efficacy of the app. In phase 1, a prototype app called Pink Journey for use on the iPhone OS (IOS) platform was created following the framework of shared decision making. In phase 2, 11 women who were given the option of reconstruction by a breast surgeon were recruited from July 2017 to December 2017. A pretest-posttest design was adopted to test the usability and feasibility of the app. The results showed that the women who used the app reported significantly less decisional conflict after intervention on each subscale of the Decision Conflict scale, i.e., “being informed”, “uncertainty”, “social support”, “effective decision”, and “value clarification”. This research provides preliminary data indicating that Pink Journey holds promise for decreasing decision conflict. Most women felt that the app was both helpful and user-friendly. The app increased their participation in decision making, helped them obtain more accurate risk perceptions, and clarified their values. It also helped the women make decisions regarding breast reconstruction more confidently. ? 2019, American Association for Cancer Education.",""
"Germline susceptibility variants impact clinical outcome and therapeutic strategies for stage III colorectal cancer","2019","Although somatic mutations are the main cause of cancer, underlying germline alterations may affect cancer outcome. There is little information on comprehensive analysis of germline genome sequencing for cancer healthcare strategy. Here we studied the implication of germline cancer-associated variants on cancer counselling and therapeutic strategies by germline whole genome and tumor targeted sequencing. Fifty-five gynecological and 104 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were enrolled. We identified 22 germline pathogenic variants in 16 cancer-associated genes. Most of them are involved in DNA repair signaling, including MLH1, BRCA1/2, MUTYH, ATM, PMS2, MSH6, BAP1, and FANCA. About 6% of cancer patients presented the secondary findings of germline variants with non-oncogenic impact, mainly on the cardiovascular system which should be carefully monitored during chemotherapy. CRC patients carrying germline susceptibility variants had better disease-free survival than those without variants. Importantly, in the CRC model, the underlying germline alterations mold the tumor somatic alteration landscape. NOTCH1 mutation was the most common somatic mutation in recurrent CRC, implying a potential therapeutic target in adjuvant setting. In conclusion, both tumor genome and germline sequence data have to be analyzed to have a more complete picture of the overall genetic foundation of cancer. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Effect of First-line S-1 Plus Oxaliplatin With or Without Ramucirumab Followed by Paclitaxel Plus Ramucirumab on Advanced Gastric Cancer in East Asia: The Phase 2 RAINSTORM Randomized Clinical Trial","2019","Importance: Ramucirumab, a human IgG 1 antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, has been shown to improve progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer in the second-line setting. Objective: To compare progression-free survival for S-1 and oxaliplatin plus ramucirumab with that for S-1 and oxaliplatin plus placebo in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2, double-blind randomized clinical trial (RAINSTORM [First-line S-1 Plus Oxaliplatin With or Without Ramucirumab Followed by Paclitaxel Plus Ramucirumab in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer]) was conducted from October 12, 2015, to April 11, 2018, at 36 sites in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Participants were chemotherapy-naive patients (n?=?189) with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Analyses of the full analysis set and safety population were conducted between November 27, 2017, and June 4, 2018. Interventions: Patients randomized to the ramucirumab plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm received S-1, 80 to 120 mg/d twice daily, on days 1 to 14 and oxaliplatin, 100 mg/m2, on day 1 with ramucirumab, 8 mg/kg, on days 1 and 8 in part A (21-day cycle). Patients randomized to the placebo plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm received the same S-1 and oxaliplatin dosage as well as placebo on days 1 and 8 in part A. Eligible patients received second-line paclitaxel, 80 mg/m2, on days 1, 8, and 15 and ramucirumab, 8 mg/kg, on days 1 and 15 in part B (28-day cycle). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was progression-free survival, analyzed using the stratified log-rank test; the hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using the stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model. Secondary end points included overall survival and adverse events. Results: In total, 189 patients were randomized and received treatment: 96 to the ramucirumab plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm and 93 to the placebo plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm. Among the 189 patients, 121 (64.0%) were male, and the median (range) age was 62.0 (26-84) years. Median progression-free survival was not prolonged in the ramucirumab plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm compared with the placebo plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm (6.34 [80% CI, 5.65-6.93] vs 6.74 [80% CI, 5.75-7.13] months; HR, 1.07; 80% CI, 0.86-1.33; P?=?.70). Median overall survival was 14.65 (80% CI, 12.39-15.67) months in the ramucirumab plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm and 14.26 (80% CI, 13.83-17.31) months in the placebo plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm (HR, 1.11; 80% CI, 0.89-1.40; P?=?.55). The most commonly reported grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus S-1 and oxaliplatin arm in part A were decreased neutrophil count (14 patients [14.6%]), hypertension (10 patients [10.4%]), and anemia (10 patients [10.4%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, the addition of ramucirumab to first-line S-1 and oxaliplatin treatment did not prolong progression-free survival or overall survival compared with S-1 and oxaliplatin alone among East Asian patients with advanced gastric cancer; no new safety signals for ramucirumab were identified.

"A cohort study of age and sex specific risk of pyogenic liver abscess incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus","2019","To investigate the age-sex-specific incidence and relative risk of pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to assess the joint effects of T2DM and other clinical risk factors for PLA on PLA incidence. We used a population-based cohort design with Taiwan's National Health Insurance claim data. Study subjects included 613,921 T2DM patients and 614,613 controls identified in 2000 and were followed to the end of 2010. Cox regression model was employed to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PLA in relation to T2DM. Over an 11-year follow-up, 5336 T2DM and 1850 controls were admitted for PLA, representing a cumulative incidence of 0.87% and 0.30%, respectively. T2DM was significantly associated with increased hazard of PLA (HR, 2.88; 95% CI, 2.73-3.04). We also found that age and gender may significantly modify the relationship between T2DM and PLA, with a higher HR noted in males patients and those aged <45 years. Biliary tract diseases (HR, 8.60; 95% CI, 7.87-9.40) and liver cirrhosis (HR, 7.52; 95% CI, 6.58-8.59) may add substantially additional risk to the incidence of PLA in T2DM patients. The increased risk of PLA in T2DM was greater in male and younger patients. Careful management of biliary tract diseases and liver cirrhosis may also help reduce the incidence of PLA in T2DM patients.","adult; age; aged; biliary tract disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; female; human; incidence; liver cirrhosis; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; public health; pyogenic liver abscess; risk factor; sex factor; Taiwan; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Biliary Tract Diseases; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Incidence; Liver Abscess, Pyogenic; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Taiwan"
"Life cycle assessment of upgraded microalgae-to-biofuel chains","2019","Two individual chains of microalgae-to-diesel and microalgae-to-butanol were upgraded through process integration and design. According to life cycle assessment (LCA)standards, the two proposed chains were compared in terms of 17 categories of LCA impacts and the sensitivity analysis of LCA impacts on two chains with different lipid or carbohydrate content of microalgae cells was performed. Based on the prescribed specifications and conditions for microalgae cultivation, pretreatment and purity level of the products, LCA analysis revealed that the annual ReCiPe end point score of producing 1 kg biobutanol is lower than that of 1 kg biodiesel by 54.4%. The upgraded microalgae-to-butanol chain could reduce the annual ReCiPe end point score of producing 100 MJ diesel/gasoline from crude oil by 5–10%. The microalgae-to-butanol chain is more ecofriendly than the microalgae-to-diesel chain due to lower LCA impacts such as Climate change human health, Climate change ecosystems, and Fossil depletion. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Algae; Biodiesel; Climate change; Diesel engines; Microorganisms; Point contacts; Sensitivity analysis; Biobutanol; Carbohydrate content; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Micro-algae; Microalgae cultivation; Pre-Treatment; Process integration; Purity level; Life cycle; biodiesel; biofuel; butanol; gasoline; petroleum; biofuel; petroleum; biofuel; climate change; crude oil; life cycle analysis; lipid; microalga; sensitivity analysis; Article; biofuel production; carbohydrate analysis; life cycle assessment; microalgae to butanol; microalgae to diesel; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; standardization; ecosystem; microalga; Biofuels; Ecosystem; Gasoline; Microalgae; Petroleum"

Objective: To investigate the effects of touch-observation and task-based mirror therapy on the sensorimotor outcomes of patients with nerve repair. Design: An assessor-blinded study with a randomized controlled design. Setting: University hospital. Participants: We recruited 12 patients with median or ulnar nerve repair between the level of midpalm and elbow referred by the plastic surgeons. Intervention: The patients were randomized into touch-observation and task-based mirror therapy or control groups, and both groups received training for 12 wk. Outcomes and Measures: The Semmes–Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test, two-point discrimination test, Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT), Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT), and pinch-holding-up activity test were assessed at pretreatment, immediately after treatment, and 12 wk after the last treatment. Results: The experimental group showed greater improvements in the results of the pinch-holding-up activity test and the PPT Unilateral Pin Insertion, Bilateral Pin Insertion, and Assembly subtests. However, change on the SWM test revealed no significant difference between the two groups.

"Association between surrounding greenness and schizophrenia: A taiwanese cohort study","2019","This study aims to investigate the association between surrounding greenness and schizophrenia incidence in Taiwan. Data of 869,484 individuals without a history of schizophrenia were included from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database from 2000 through 2010 for analysis. The diagnoses of schizophrenia were based on ICD-9 codes. Greenness exposure was assessed using the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index, assuming individuals lived near the hospital they most often visited for common cold during the study period. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the association between greenness exposure and schizophrenia incidence after adjustments were made for the potential confounders. A total of 5,069 schizophrenia cases were newly diagnosed during the study period. A negative significant (P < 0.05) association found using 2,000-m buffer distances (distance of a moderately paced 20-min walk) in the whole Taiwan island, cities, and metropolitan areas. The results of the stratified analysis based on sex and health insurance rate suggested surrounding greenness has approximately equal effects of reducing the risk of schizophrenia, regardless of sex or financial status. In conclusion, our findings suggest that more surrounding greenness may reduce the risk of schizophrenia. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Cost-effectiveness analysis of the oral cancer screening program in Taiwan","2019","Objectives: We assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the oral cancer (OC) screening program in Taiwan. Materials and methods: We interlinked the Cancer Registry, Mortality Registry, National Vital Statistics, reimbursement database of National Health Insurance, and the National Oral Cancer Screening database of Taiwan. A total of 40,092 pathologically verified OC patients were identified and followed during 2002–2014. After stratification by stages, lifetime survival curves were estimated by a rolling extrapolation algorithm to obtain life expectancy (LE), expected years of life lost (EYLL), and lifetime medical costs (LMC). Results: The LE for stages I-IV were 19.5, 14.0, 11.9, and 7.7 life-years, respectively, while those of EYLL were 7.3, 12.2, 15.4, and 18.7 life-years, respectively. The LMC for stages I-IV were US$ 65,752, 60,086, 53,675, and 47,570, respectively. We assumed no life loss for stage 0 with LMC of US$ 5380 spent for the first year after diagnosis. During 2010–2013, 967 out of the 28,018 cases detected with abnormal oral pathology by screening were found to develop OC. The ICER of the screening program was US$ 28,516 per life-year saved, which could be improved to US$ 5579 per life-year saved if all cancers transformed from abnormal oral pathology were detected before stage I. Conclusion: The ICER of the current OC screening program in Taiwan slightly exceeds 1 GDP (gross domestic product) per capita per life-year saved. Intensive follow-up and treatment for all patients with abnormal oral pathology would improve screening efficiency and effectiveness of prevention. ? 2018","adolescent; adult; algorithm; Article; cancer mortality; cancer registry; cancer screening; cancer staging; cancer survival; child; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; female; follow up; general practitioner; high risk patient; human; ICD-O-3; infant; life expectancy; major clinical study; male; mouth cancer; national health insurance; newborn; priority journal; Taiwan"
"Risks of age and sex on clinical outcomes post myocardial infarction","2019","Background: How sex and age influence post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) outcomes remains unclear. This study evaluated the influence of sex and age on drug therapy, echocardiographic parameters, and outcomes in post-MI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 643 patients with first acute MI who underwent successful PCI and two echocardiographic examinations within 1 year after MI. Clinical characteristics and 4-year follow-up outcomes were compared between sexes and age groups. Primary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Results: Compared with males, female patients with MI, particularly older females, had more systemic diseases. Younger females received fewer guideline-directed therapies. Older patients presented with higher left ventricular volume and mass index but no significant differences in left ventricular ejection fraction. The Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed increased mortality in both younger and older females. Elderly patients, particularly older females, exhibited significantly higher post-MI HF incidence but no difference in recurrent MI, ventricular arrhythmia, or revascularization. Conclusions: In MI patients receiving PCI, outcome differences between sexes are age-dependent. Age influences outcome more heavily in females than in males. Females are likely to exhibit worse overall survival, and older females are at higher risk of post-MI HF. ? 2019","angiotensin receptor antagonist; clopidogrel; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; statin (protein); adult; age; Article; body mass; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular outcome; clinical outcome; diabetes mellitus; disease assessment; echocardiography; follow up; heart ejection fraction; heart failure; heart infarction; heart ventricle arrhythmia; heart ventricle volume; human; hypertension; left anterior descending coronary artery; left ventricular end diastolic volume index; length of stay; major clinical study; middle aged; mortality; obesity; overall survival; percutaneous coronary intervention; post myocardial infarction; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; revascularization; risk factor; sex; survival rate; systemic disease; therapy effect"

However, the relationship between bipolar disorder and risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) requires further investigation, as do the effects of bipolar disorder medications on STI risk. Methods: In the present study, data from 26,028 adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder (ICD-9-CM code 296 except 296.2x, 296.3x, 296.9x, and 296.82) and 104,112 age- and sex-matched non-bipolar-disorder controls from 2001 to 2009 were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who contracted any type of STI-including human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, genital warts, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and trichomoniasis-during the follow-up period (from enrollment to the end of 2011) were identified. Results: Cox regression analysis with full adjustment for demographic data, psychiatric comorbidities, and bipolar disorder medications showed that bipolar disorder was an independent risk factor (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.62-4.66) for contracting an STI. Patients with bipolar disorder and substance and/or alcohol use disorders were at highest risk of STI occurrence. Long-term use of mood stabilizers (HR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86) and atypical antipsychotics (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.95) was associated with reduced risk for contracting STIs. Conclusions: Adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder exhibited an increased risk of subsequent STI during the follow-up period compared with those without bipolar disorder. Comorbidity of substance and alcohol use disorders further increased this risk. Long-term use of bipolar disorder medications (mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics) may reduce this risk. ?

"A population-based study of secondary prostate cancer risk after radiotherapy in male patients with rectal cancer: A retrospective cohort study","2019","Background and objective: Risk of secondary prostate cancer after radiation therapy among patients with rectal cancer remains undetermined. Given an increased incidence of rectal cancer in younger people and improved survival for rectal cancer patients who received radiation therapy, the potential risk of secondary prostate cancer needs to be further investigated. Materials and Methods: Male patients (n = 11,367) newly diagnosed rectal cancer and who underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR) or low anterior resection (LAR) from 1 January, 1998 to 31 December, 2010 were identified from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The incidence and relative risk of secondary prostate cancer in study patients with (n = 1586) and without (n = 9781) radiotherapy within one year after rectal cancer diagnosis were compared using a competing-risks analysis. Results: Rectal cancer patients with radiotherapy were at a significantly decreased risk of developing prostate cancer, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.41 (95% confidence interval = 0.20-0.83) after adjustment for age. Analysis of the risk estimated for various follow-up lengths suggested that a decreasing HR was seen through the period followed-up and that there was a trend of decreasing prostate cancer risk with time after radiotherapy. Conclusions: Radiotherapy was significantly associated with decreased risk of secondary prostate cancer among rectal cancer patients, by a magnitude of 59%. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Microbial volatile compounds-induced cytotoxicity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: The role of MAPK signaling and proteasome regulatory pathway","2019","Microbial volatile organic compounds (mVCs) are formed in the metabolism of microorganisms and widely distributed in nature and pose threats to human health. However, the air pollution by microorganisms is a situation which is poorly understood. In this study, the cytotoxicity of E. aerogenes VCs was evaluated in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. aerogenes VCs inhibited the survival of yeast and triggered the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The hypersensitive of MAP kinase mpk1/slt2 and 19S regulatory assembly chaperone adc17 mutants to the E. aerogenes VCs indicated cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway together with stress-inducible proteasome assembly regulation are essentially involved in mVCs tolerance mechanism. Furthermore, exposure to the mVCs resulted in the transcriptional upregulation of the CWI pathway, the regulatory particle assembly chaperones, and genes involved in proteasome regulations. Our research suggested that the ROS/MAPK signaling and proteasome regulatory pathway play pivotal roles in the integration and fine-tuning of the mVCs stress response. This study provides a molecular framework for future study of the effects of mVCs on more complex organisms, such as humans. ? 2019","Health risks; Microorganisms; Volatile organic compounds; Anti-fungal; Cell walls; Enterobacter aerogenes; Microbial volatile organic compounds; Reactive oxygen species; Tolerance mechanisms; Volatile compounds; Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Yeast; chaperone; mitogen activated protein kinase; proteasome; reactive oxygen metabolite; volatile agent; Adc17 protein, S cerevisiae; chaperone; mitogen activated protein kinase; proteasome; reactive oxygen metabolite; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; SLT2 protein, S cerevisiae; volatile organic compound; antimicrobial activity; atmospheric pollution; cell component; gene expression; induced response; reactive oxygen species; toxicity; volatile organic compound; yeast; Article; cell wall; cytotoxicity; Enterobacter aerogenes; MAPK signaling; nonhuman; regulatory mechanism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; stress; survival; upregulation; air pollutant; air pollution; cytoplasm; drug effect; MAPK signaling; metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; transcription initiation; Enterobacter aerogenes; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cell Wall; Cytoplasm; Enterobacter aerogenes; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Molecular Chaperones; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Reactive Oxygen Species; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcriptional Activation; Volatile Organic Compounds"
"Range of Normal Liver Stiffness and Factors Associated With Increased Stiffness Measurements in Apparently Healthy Individuals","2019","Background &amp; Aims: Transient elastography (TE) is a noninvasive technique used to measure liver stiffness to estimate the severity of fibrosis. The range of liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) in healthy individuals is unclear. We performed a systematic review to determine the range of LSMs, examined by TE, in healthy individuals and individuals who are susceptible to fibrosis. Methods: We collected data from 16,082 individuals, in 26 cohorts, identified from systematic searches of Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies of liver stiffness measurements. Studies analyzed included apparently healthy adults (normal levels of liver enzymes, low-risk alcohol use patterns, and negative for markers of viral hepatitis). The presence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or steatosis, based on ultrasound examination, was known for most participants. We performed a meta-analysis of data from individual participants. The cohort was divided into 4 groups; participants with a body mass index &lt;30 kg/m2 were examined with the medium probe and those with a body mass index ?30 kg/m2 were examined with the extra-large probe. Linear regression models were conducted after adjusting for potential confounding factors of LSMs. We performed several sensitivity analyses. Results: We established LSM ranges for healthy individuals measured with both probes—these did not change significantly in sensitivity analyses of individuals with platelets ?150,000/mm3 and levels of alanine aminotransferase ?33 IU/L in men or ?25 IU/L in women. In multivariate analysis, factors that modified LSMs with statistical significance included diabetes, dyslipidemia, waist circumference, level of aspartate aminotransferase, and systolic blood pressure at examination time. Significant increases in LSMs were associated with the metabolic syndrome in individuals examined by either probe. Diabetes in obese individuals increased the risk of LSMs in the range associated with advanced fibrosis. Conclusions: In a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from individual participants, we established a comprehensive set of LSM ranges, measured by TE in large cohorts of healthy individuals and persons susceptible to hepatic fibrosis. Regression analyses identified factors associated with increased LSMs obtained by TE with the medium and extra-large probes. ? 2019 AGA Institute","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; liver enzyme; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alcohol consumption; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body mass; diabetes mellitus; disease predisposition; dyslipidemia; echography; fatty liver; high risk population; human; hypertension; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness; metabolic syndrome X; normal value; platelet count; Review; risk factor; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; transient elastography; virus hepatitis; waist circumference"
"Comparison of flap outcomes between single- and multiple-perforator-based free anterolateral thigh flap in head and neck reconstruction","2019","Introduction: The number of perforators required for safe perfusion remains under debate. This study aimed to determine whether a single- or multiple-perforator-based anterolateral thigh flap yields better flap outcomes in head and neck reconstruction. Patients and Methods: Between August 2012 and July 2016, 180 men and 4 women with a mean age of 52.8 ± 9.8 years underwent head and neck anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction for oncologic defect in 181 cases, plate exposure in two cases, and trismus release in one case. The flap was patched for inner or external lining, folded for through–through defect, or tubed for cervical esophageal reconstruction. Of 184 flaps, 136 (73.9%) were based on multiple perforators (range, 2–5 perforators), whereas 48 (26.1%) were based on a single perforator. The demographics, operative findings, and flap outcomes were compared. Results: The prevalence of systemic diseases between groups was comparable. The mean flap size in the single-perforator group was smaller (92.8 ± 36.8 vs. 140.5 ± 99.9 cm 2 , P &lt;.0001). Twenty-one flaps (11.4%) required emergency take-back and 13 (61.9%) were successfully salvaged. Eight flaps failed, yielding a 95.7% flap survival rate. The single-perforator group had a significantly higher rate of emergency take-back for vascular compromise (8/48 (16.7%) vs. 8/136 (5.9%), P =.035), a decreased salvage success rate (2/8 (25.0%) vs. 11/13 (84.6%), P =.018), and a corresponding lower flap survival rate (42/48 (87.5%) vs. 134/136 (98.5%), P =.004). Conclusion: Whenever possible, we recommend including multiple cutaneous perforators in anterolateral thigh flaps to yield better flap outcomes in head and neck reconstruction. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; anterolateral thigh flap; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; emergency treatment; female; graft salvage; graft survival; head and neck surgery; human; intermethod comparison; male; medical record review; middle aged; multiple perforator based free anterolateral thigh flap; outcome assessment; priority journal; reconstructive surgery; retrospective study; single perforator based free anterolateral thigh flap; survival rate; systemic disease; aged; China; cohort analysis; comparative study; follow up; graft rejection; head and neck tumor; pathology; perforator flap; physiology; procedures; reconstructive surgery; squamous cell carcinoma; thigh; transplantation; university hospital; vascularization; wound healing; Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; China; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Graft Rejection; Graft Survival; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Hospitals, University; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Perforator Flap; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Thigh; Wound Healing"
"Lead Time Bias May Contribute to the Shorter Life Expectancy in Post-colonoscopy Colorectal Cancer","2019","Background: The long-term outcomes of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer have varied in previous studies. Our nationwide cohort analysis estimated expected years of life lost to adjust for lead time bias. Aim: We recalculated the long-term outcomes for post-colonoscopy and detected colorectal cancer. Methods: Patients with colorectal cancer registered in the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2002 and 2009 were enrolled. The detected group included 22,169 cases of colorectal cancer confirmed within 6?months after a colonoscopy. The post-colonoscopy group included 1653 cancer patients who received a colonoscopy 6–60?months before diagnosis. Patients were followed up until 2011. We simulated age-, sex-, and calendar year-matched referents from life tables in the Taiwan National Vital Statistics using a Monte Carlo method. The life expectancy and expected years of life lost of the cancer patients were obtained from extrapolation of the logit transformation of the survival ratio between the cancer cohorts and the referent groups. Results: Post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer had shorter life expectancies than detected cancer (stages 2–4: 13.6 vs. 16.1?years; 8.7 vs. 12.6?years; 2.1 vs. 4.1?years, p < 0.001). The loss-of-life expectancy did not show this trend after adjusting for lead time bias. Post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer was found at an older age, more often proximal, and was associated with previous endoscopic polypectomy procedures (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer leads to a shorter life expectancy, which appears partially explained by the presence of lead time bias. Quality assurance for colonoscopy and close surveillance for high risk groups would reduce post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aged; Article; ascending colon; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; cecum; cohort analysis; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; demography; descending colon; endoscopic polypectomy; female; follow up; human; lead time bias; life expectancy; long term survival; major clinical study; male; priority journal; splenic flexure; Taiwan; transverse colon"
"Nasogastric tube dislodgment detection in rehabilitation patients based on fog computing with warning sensors and fuzzy petri net","2019","The use of nasogastric (NG) tubes in acute, critical, and long-term care may lead to mechanical, infectious, and metabolic complications. NG intubation is a risk factor for aspiration and complications of organ injury. Mechanical complications include deliberate self-extubation and accidental extubation, both of which comprise unplanned extubation and occur in >35% of cases in rehabilitation rooms. Therefore, we intend to propose a digital warning tool to detect NG tube dislodgment over several days or weeks for a continuous insertion of the NG tube. On the basis of fog computing, integrating dexter-to-sinister light-controlled sensors and fuzzy Petri net (FPN) was performed to achieve the proposed assistant tool. The proposed intelligent algorithm can also be easily implemented using a high-level programming language (Language C/C++) in an embedded system. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the algorithm under normal conditions and partial and NG two-tube dislodgments. ?

"Tumor suppressor gene glycine N-methyltransferase and its potential in liver disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma","2019","Glycine N-methyltransferase is a protein with many functions. In addition to catalyzing the production of sarcosine in the one carbon metabolism pathway, it plays a role in the detoxification of environmental carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene, aflatoxin B1, and aristocholic acid. There is also increasing evidence suggesting a role of GNMT deficiency in liver carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the role of GNMT in the detoxification of xenobiotics and the mechanism of GNMT suppression during liver tumorigenesis. The protective role of GNMT in the liver allows GNMT to not only serve as a marker of liver disease, but also potentially be applied in the treatment of liver disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the potential use of GNMT in gene therapy and we introduce the development of a GNMT promoter reporter assay that can be used to screen medicinal drugs and herbal libraries for natural compounds with anti-cancer properties. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","carcinogen; environmental chemical; glycine methyltransferase; natural product; sarcosine; cancer gene therapy; detoxification; human; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; liver disease; nonhuman; nonviral gene therapy; promoter region; Review; tumor suppressor gene"
"Liposomal irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in older patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer – A subgroup analysis of the pivotal NAPOLI-1 trial","2019","Objectives: Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease predominantly affecting older patients. Characterization of outcomes in these patients may help optimise treatment decisions. The global, phase 3 NAPOLI-1 trial (NCT01494506) demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit with liposomal irinotecan and 5-flurouracil/leucovorin (nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV) versus 5-FU/LV. This subgroup analysis explored impact of age on outcomes in NAPOLI-1 patients, and nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV efficacy and safety in older patients. Materials and Methods: This exploratory, post-hoc analysis of the NAPOLI-1 trial included patients aged ?eighteen years (no upper limit) with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that had progressed on gemcitabine-based therapy. Patients were stratified by age (cut-offs at 65, 70, and 75 years); OS and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Of 417 randomized patients, 192 (46%), 110 (26%) and 43 (10%) were aged ?65, ?70 and ? 75 years, respectively. Mortality risk and risk of disease progression were similar in older and younger patients independent of treatment (HRs for median [m]OS/mPFS comparisons were 0.88/0.95 [<65 versus ?65 years], 0.89/0.88 [<70 versus ?70 years] and 1.04/0.98 [<75 versus ?75 years]; P > .25). Reduced mortality/morbidity risk with nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV in older subgroups was in line with the wider population. No additional toxicities with nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV were observed in older patients: 86% of patients ?75 years versus 69% <75 years required a dose delay or reduction due to toxicities (43% versus 32% dose reductions). Discussion: Results suggest that older patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that progressed on prior gemcitabine-based treatment can benefit from second-line therapy, supporting nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV treatment in older patients. ? 2019 The Authors","fluorouracil; folinic acid; irinotecan; adult; adverse outcome; aged; alopecia; Article; asthenia; blood toxicity; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer survival; controlled study; diarrhea; dose response; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; hemoglobin determination; human; major clinical study; male; metastatic pancreatic cancer; metastatic pancreatic cancer; middle aged; monotherapy; mortality risk; nausea; neutrophil count; open study; outcome assessment; overall survival; pancreas cancer; phase 3 clinical trial; platelet count; priority journal; progression free survival; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; risk reduction; survival rate; survival time; treatment duration; vomiting"
"The incidence and risk factors of hepatic veno-occlusive disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Taiwan","2019","Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a potentially fatal complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We conducted this study to investigate the incidence and risk factors of hepatic VOD for patients receiving HSCT in Taiwan. We retrospectively analyzed the data from a nationwide registry for patients receiving HSCT, which was collected by the Taiwan Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The data collection period was from 2009 to 2014. A total 2345 patients were reviewed and 39 patients among them were diagnosed as having hepatic VOD. The cumulative incidence of hepatic VOD in the whole cohort of 2345 patients was 1.66%. In multivariate analysis, disease diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic HCV infection, condition regimens of bulsulfan intravenously administered, and antithymocyte immunoglobulin were independent factors to predict higher risk of hepatic VOD. The overall mortality rate for patients with hepatic VOD was 79%. Patients with hepatic VOD had significant worse survival outcomes when compared with those without hepatic VOD (P = 0.00063). In conclusion, although the incidence is low, hepatic VOD remains a serious complication after HSCT in Taiwan. The findings of this study could be the basis for developing prophylactic or early treatment strategies for hepatic VOD. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bilirubin; busulfan; cyclophosphamide; ferritin; thymocyte antibody; busulfan; lymphocyte antibody; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; adult; age; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; bilirubin blood level; child; chronic hepatitis; chronic hepatitis B; chronic hepatitis C; chronic myeloid leukemia; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; ferritin blood level; gender; Hodgkin disease; human; incidence; liver cirrhosis; liver venoocclusive disease; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; myeloablative conditioning; myelodysplastic syndrome; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonmyeloablative conditioning; priority journal; register; relapse; remission; retrospective study; risk factor; survival; survival rate; Taiwan; thalassemia major; allograft; clinical trial; disease free survival; epidemiology; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; incidence; liver vein obstruction; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; myelodysplastic syndrome; register; risk factor; Adolescent; Adult; Allografts; Antilymphocyte Serum; Busulfan; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Registries; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Taiwan"
"Stilbene compounds inhibit tumor growth by the induction of cellular senescence and the inhibition of telomerase activity","2019","Cellular senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest characterized by a distinct morphology, gene expression pattern, and secretory phenotype. It can be triggered by multiple mechanisms, including those involved in telomere shortening, the accumulation of DNA damage, epigenetic pathways, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and so on. In current cancer therapy, cellular senescence has emerged as a potent tumor suppression mechanism that restrains proliferation in cells at risk for malignant transformation. Therefore, compounds that stimulate the growth inhibition effects of senescence while limiting its detrimental effects are believed to have great clinical potential. In this review article, we first review the current knowledge of the pro- and antitumorigeneic functions of senescence and summarize the key roles of telomerase in the regulation of senescence in tumors. Second, we review the current literature regarding the anticancer effects of stilbene compounds that are mediated by the targeting of telomerase and cell senescence. Finally, we provide future perspectives on the clinical utilization of stilbene compounds, especially resveratrol and pterostilbene, as novel cancer therapeutic remedies. We conclude and propose that stilbene compounds may induce senescence and may potentially be used as the therapeutic or adjuvant agents for cancers with high telomerase activity. ? 2019 by the author.

"Risk of dementia in patients with end-stage renal disease under maintenance dialysis - A nationwide population-based study with consideration of competing risk of mortality","2019","Background: Dementia is prevalent in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. However, it is still not clarified whether ESRD is one of the etiology of dementia or its attributable effect on the cumulative risk of dementia. Meanwhile, the effect of competing risk of mortality should be taken into consideration when performing epidemiologic analyses among populations with high risk of mortality. Methods: By using the National Health Insurance Research Database (1998-2010), we identified 927,142 non-ESRD individuals and 99,158 ESRD patients to investigate the effect of ESRD on the risk of dementia. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates (IRs) and cumulative incidence rates (CIRs) were first compared between these two cohorts. Competing risk analyses including cause-specific and subdistribution proportional hazards models were then constructed with adjustments for potential confounders. Results: The overall IR and CIR of dementia were much higher in the ESRD group than in the non-ESRD group (10.73 vs. 1.40 per 1000 person-years and 0.061 vs. 0.017, respectively, both P < 0.0001). Results from the multivariable cause-specific hazard models suggested that ESRD was one of the etiological factors for dementia (cause-specific hazard ratio [csHR]: 2.06 [95% CI: 1.95-2.17]). However, the subdistribution HR (sdHR) of ESRD was 0.51 (95% Cl: 0.49-0.54), which indicated the lower cumulative incidence risk of dementia in ESRD patients. The inverse relationship between csHR and sdHR could be explained by the high mortality rate in the ESRD population. These findings were also essentially consistent across various subgroup analyses according to selected confounders, as well as in the analyses that limited dementia diagnoses made by neurologists or psychologists. Conclusions: Although ESRD appears directly associated with the risk of dementia, the high competing mortality means that primary prevention of comorbidity associated with dementia may be more effective in reducing overall dementia in the general population, which may also potentially reduce the incidence of ESRD and prevent death from multimorbidity when affected by ESRD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; age; aged; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; dementia; disease association; end stage renal disease; female; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality risk; multiple chronic conditions; national health insurance; neurologist; primary prevention; priority journal; psychologist; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; young adult"
"Bidirectional relationship between systemic lupus erythematosus and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: A nationwide population-based study","2019","Objectives. We conducted this nationwide population-based study in Taiwan to investigate whether there is a bidirectional relationship between SLE and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Methods. Using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we identified 16 417 patients with newonset SLE without previous cancer and 25 069 patients with new-onset NHL without previous SLE as two non-overlapping cohorts from 1998-2012, and followed them until 2013. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for NHL in the patients with SLE and SIR for SLE in the patients with NHL were compared with the general population. Results. Among the 16 417 patients with SLE, 512 developed cancers, including 34 with NHL. The highest SIR was that for NHL (SIR 4.2, 95% CI 2.9, 5.9) in site-specific cancer risk analysis. Among the 25 069 patients with NHL, 14 developed SLE, and the SIR was also increased (SIR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.4). The SIRs of the patients with SLE to develop NHL and the patients with NHL to develop SLE were both highest within the first year after the diagnosis of each disease. Conclusion. This nationwide population-based study is the first study to report a bidirectional relationship between SLE and NHL. This finding may suggest being alert for the patients with SLE or NHL who have early sings of the other disease in clinical care. ?

"Association of SDF-1 and CXCR4 polymorphisms with susceptibility to oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma","2019","Background/Aim: Long-term exposure to betel quid (BQ)-, cigarette-, and alcohol-induced chronic inflammation is a crucial risk factor for oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) progression. We analyzed the genotypes of stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXC-chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and determined the association between their polymorphisms and the risk of OPSCC. Materials and Methods: This study consisted of 452 patients with pathologically proved OPSCC and 424 sex- and age-matched cancer-free controls. The genotypes of SDF-1 and CXCR4 were detected through the TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Results: Our data indicated that the C allele and C/C genotypes of CXCR4 were significantly associated with OPSCC [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.02-1.96, p=0.037 and AOR=1.51, 95% CI:1.05-2.17, p=0.028, respectively] and OSCC (AOR=1.41, 95%CI:1.00-2.00, p=0.049 and AOR=1.49, 95%CI:1.01-2.20, p=0.044, respectively) risk. Patients with genetic polymorphisms of the genotype combination SDF-1/CXCR4 had a higher risk of OSCC (p trend=0.033). We analyzed the effects of CXCR4 genetic variants on susceptibility to OPSCC in patients with different risk habits of BQ chewing, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, and revealed that C/T+T/T genotypes exerted an increased risk only in patients with one (AOR=2.68, p=0.036) or two risk habits (AOR=2.02, p=0.027) compared to patients with the C/C genotype. Conclusion: We concluded that CXCR4 C>T can be used as a genetic marker of susceptibility to OPSCC, particularly in OPSCC patients with one or two types of risk habits with a synergistic effect. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Obesity and overweight in patients with hemophilia: Prevalence by age, clinical correlates, and impact on joint bleeding","2019","Background: The prevalence of obesity in patients with hemophilia (PWH) varies among different ethnicities, and its influence on joint bleeding and hemophilic arthropathy has not been studied in Taiwan population. We explored the prevalence and clinical correlates of obesity and the impact of body mass index (BMI) on annual joint bleeding rate (AJBR) and hemophilic arthropathy in PWH in Taiwan. Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical information on 140 severe/40 moderate PWH from 2006 to 2014. The patients’ median age was 31.5 years, ranged from 6 to 73 years. Their BMI, 6 index joints score by Pettersson scoring, AJBR, and other clinical data were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity by age group was 7.1% in PWH aged ?10 years, and rapidly increased to 34.5% in PWH aged 11 to 18 years, 46.7% in PWH aged 18 to 29 years, 61.8% in PWH aged 30 to 39 years, 60.6% in PWH aged 40 to 49 years, and 48% in PWH aged ?50 years, respectively. Two peak rates were 72.7% in PWH aged 35 to 44 years and 66.7% in PWH aged >65 years. Age, HCV infection, knee score, elbow score, and total 6 index joints scores were found to correlate positively with BMI. However, subtype and severity of hemophilia, ankle scores, HBV and HIV infection did not correlate with BMI. Finally, BMI was found to correlate positively with AJBR in both adult and pediatric PWH. Conclusion: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in adolescent and adult PWH was higher than those in the general male population in Taiwan, which rapidly increased with age to peak in PWH aged 35 to 44 years and >65 years. High index joint score, with the exception of ankle scores, positively correlated with high BMI. Further, BMI and obesity also had positive correlation with AJBR in PWH. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining these associations in PWH in Taiwan. Copyright ? 2019, the Chinese Medical Association.

"Akt inhibitor SC66 promotes cell sensitivity to cisplatin in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells through inhibition of COL11A1 expression","2019","We studied Akt inhibition using SC66 in a NOD-SCID xenograft mouse model and a panel of eight ovarian cancer cell lines. Elevated phospho-Akt levels in cancerous tissue were associated with short progression-free survival and overall survival. Cell sensitivity to SC66 was inversely correlated with phospho-Akt and COL11A1 expression levels, as well as resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel. SC66 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effectors 4EBP1 and p70S6 kinase. SC66 also attenuated expression of TWIST1 and Mcl-1, factors important in cell invasiveness and anti-apoptosis, respectively. SC66-sensitized chemoresistant cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment, and promoted apoptosis. In addition, SC66 inhibited COL11A1 expression via decreased binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (c/EBPβ), reducing chemoresistance and decreasing binding of nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-YA) to COL11A1. A mouse xenograft experiment demonstrated that SC66 treatment caused a reduction in tumor formation and enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. This study demonstrates the role of Akt in ovarian tumor progression and chemoresistance, and supports the application of SC66 as a therapy for ovarian cancer. ? 2019, The Author(s).","antineoplastic agent; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; cisplatin; collagen type 11; initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; nuclear factor Y; paclitaxel; protein kinase B inhibitor; protein mcl 1; S6 kinase; sc 66; Twist related protein 1; unclassified drug; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cancer resistance; cancer survival; cell invasion; controlled study; drug binding site; drug cytotoxicity; drug potentiation; drug sensitivity; enzyme phosphorylation; female; follow up; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; low drug dose; major clinical study; monotherapy; mouse; NOD SCID mouse; nonhuman; ovary adenocarcinoma; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; promoter region; protein expression level; tumor invasion; tumor volume; tumor xenograft"
"Improving the follow-up completion rate of community-dwelling individuals who screened positive for colorectal cancer","2019","Background & Problems: Early screening and early treatment of colorectal cancer increases the 5-year-survival rate of early stage cancer by 90%. However, a lack of knowledge regarding screening opportunities among community residents affects their willingness to seek medical help and delays treatment. The World Health Organization estimated that deaths from colorectal cancer in the next 20 years will increase from 8.2 million people to 13 million people annually. However, systemic screening and follow-up services will promote early detection and treatment and should effectively decrease colorectal cancer-related mortality. Purpose: The aim of this study is to increase the follow-up completion rate of community participants who tested positive during a screening for colorectal cancer. Resolutions: The resolution measure produced stool occult blood screening education leaflets, promoted health lectures on the topic of cancer screening, planned a training course for cancer-prevention education, constructed a participant tracking and notification system in the outpatient information system for positive participants, set up a procedure for positive participant follow-up, and designed a cooperative model for community health promotion. Results: The follow-up completion rate of participants who tested positive during colorectal cancer screen tests increased to 74.1%, and the accuracy rate of colorectal screening knowledge rose to 93.9%. Conclusions: Implementation of the project increased the follow-up effectiveness of participants who tested positive during the screening. We hope that medical facilities cooperate with communities in order to facilitate health promotion and increase the number of residents with correct cancer-prevention concepts. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Health-related quality of life associated with different cancer treatments in Chinese breast cancer survivors in Taiwan","2019","We assessed the quality of life (QoL) associated with patient's characteristics and different cancer treatments among Chinese breast cancer survivors in Taiwan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 where 193 patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative metastatic breast cancer were recruited. Three QoL questionnaires were administered: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), its breast cancer supplementary measure (QLQ-BR23) and EQ-5D-5L. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the association between QoL and cancer treatments, with adjustment for patient's characteristics. The mean age of study participants was 55.52?years. Simple linear regression showed that cancer stage and receiving chemotherapy were significantly associated with QoL scores (p?<?0.05). Significant adverse effects of chemotherapy on QoL were found among early-stage cancer women (i.e., I or II), including poor cognitive and sexual functioning, and a higher symptom burden (i.e., dyspnoea, constipation, systematic therapy side effects). Multiple linear regression also revealed that receiving chemotherapy was significantly associated with poor QoL (e.g., lower functional health and higher symptom burden measured by the QLQ-BR23), compared to none chemotherapy (p?<?0.05). Receiving chemotherapy was associated with poor QoL, especially among early-stage breast cancer patients. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Applying swanson’s theory of caring to manage powerlessness in an older patient with vasculitis","2019","This case report describes a nursing care experience that applied Swanson’s Caring Theory to a powerless elderly patient who was suffering from vasculitis problems that had made her incapable of walking and had delayed her discharge from the hospital. The associated health problems, including impaired physical mobility, infection, and powerlessness, were affirmed after an integrated physical, psychological, social, and spiritual assessment was conducted during the nursing care period, which lasted between April 26th and May 5th, 2018. The five categories (knowing, being with, doing for, enabling, maintaining belief) of Swanson’s Caring Theory were applied. The patient was encouraged to participate in the treatment plan and motivated to participate in rehabilitation. In addition, the caring capacity and care confidence of family members was enhanced in order to support the patient’s further care after discharge. Furthermore, religious support was involved, which allowed the patient to communicate her emotions, reduce her stress, and achieve spiritual comfort. By providing care in the realms of physiology, psychology, and spirit, the author helped the patient regain her self-worth and enhance her positive beliefs in the future. This case report is hoped to provide medical staffs with a reference for facilitating the recovery of elderly patients experiencing disease-related powerlessness. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Clinical Evaluation of IntelliPlex? KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit for Detection of KRAS Mutations in Codon 12 and 13: A Novel Multiplex Approach","2019","Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most frequently occurring cancers worldwide and its incidence is forecasted to increase. Testing for KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations in colorectal tissue biopsy samples has become a crucial tool to guide therapeutic decisions for personalized treatment. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the IntelliPlex? KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit using clinical specimens compared to Sanger sequencing as the reference method. Methods: A total of 248 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, with CRC tumors comprising more than 10% of the whole tissue sample, were included in the study and analyzed for specific KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13. For samples with discordant results between Sanger sequencing and the IntelliPlex? KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit, Pyrosequencing was utilized to resolve the KRAS mutational status. Results: Sequencing determined 153 specimens as KRAS wild-type genotype while the IntelliPlex? KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit confirmed 139 of the wild-type cases, resulting in a clinical specificity of 90.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 85.12–94.91).

"Dialysis therapy: Concept evolution and update","2019","End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most severe stage of chronic kidney disease. Dialysis, one of the renal replacement therapy, provides life-saving therapy for the patients with ESRD. It is paramount to improve disease outcome and quality of life while performing dialysis. According to previous studies among hemodialysis (HD) patients, the results didn't support to initiate HD at specific timing (early vs late initiation). In addition, there was no clear evidence to improve survival rate through an increase of HD dose, intensity or frequency. Although dialysate composition carries weight to the cardiovascular system, the relationships between various dialysate compositions and patient outcomes remain to be elucidated. For peritoneal dialysis (PD), peritoneal dialysis solutions other than glucose-based ones, Icodextrin or biocompatible peritoneal dialysis solutions, may be benefit for fluid control and preservation of peritoneal membrane function, and preventing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. About the comparison between dialysis modalities (PD vs HD), there is no significant difference between HD and PD in terms of life expectancy, quality of life and quality-adjusted life expectancy when analyzing the Taiwanese National Insurance Database and dialysis-related cohorts; however, PD is more cost-effective than HD. ? 2019 Society of Internal Medicine of Taiwan.

"Attention-based convolutional neural network and long Short-term memory for Short-term detection of mood disorders based on elicited speech responses","2019","Mood disorders, including unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar disorder (BD), have become some of the commonest mental health disorders. The absence of diagnostic markers of BD can cause misdiagnosis of the disorder as UD on initial presentation. Short-term detection, which could be used in early detection and intervention, is desirable. This study proposed an approach for short-term detection of mood disorders based on elicited speech responses. Speech responses of participants were obtained through interviews by a clinician after participants viewed six emotion-eliciting videos. A domain adaptation method based on a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm was proposed to adapt a labeled emotion database into a collected unlabeled mood database for alleviating the data bias problem in an emotion space. For modeling the local variation of emotions in each response, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an attention mechanism was used to generate an emotion profile (EP) of each elicited speech response. Finally, long short-term memory (LSTM) was employed to characterize the temporal evolution of EPs of all six speech responses. Moreover, an attention model was applied to the LSTM network for highlighting pertinent speech responses to improve detection performance instead of treating all responses equally. For evaluation, this study elicited emotional speech data from 15 people with BD, 15 people with UD, and 15 healthy controls. Leave-one-group-out cross-validation was employed for the compiled database and proposed method. CNN- and LSTM-based attention models improved the mood disorder detection accuracy of the proposed method by approximately 11%. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved an overall detection accuracy of 75.56%, outperforming support-vector-machine- (62.22%) and CNN-based (66.67%) methods. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Brain; Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Database systems; Speech; Speech recognition; Attention mechanisms; Attention model; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Detection performance; Diagnostic markers; Mood disorders; Spectral clustering algorithms; Long short-term memory"
"Investigating unmet health care needs under the National Health Insurance program in Taiwan: A latent class analysis","2019","Objectives: In Taiwan, although the implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI) program reduced financial barriers and enhanced accessibility for individuals to utilize health care services, an unequal distribution of medical care resources still exists. This paper is focusing on analyzing factors that are associated with unmet health care needs among the middle-aged and elderly under the NHI in Taiwan. Methods: Statistical analysis from the 2007 Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan. We firstly adopted latent class analysis to classify individuals' observable reasons for feeling unwell but not seeing a doctor within the last 3?months into three latent perceived barriers classes. We further used a multinomial probit regression model to analyze factors that are associated with each perceived barrier class to the access of health care service. Results: Results indicate relative to the “relatively no barriers” class, individuals with a high level of educational attainment tend to more likely to be in the “accommodation barriers” class, and individuals live in the most developed areas with the densest medical facilities tend to less likely to be in the “accessibility barriers” class. Conclusions: We identified possible risk factors for each perceived barrier, which could provide important insights for health authorities and medical providers when targeting policies and interventions to efficiently assist people in need. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","accessibility; educational attainment; elderly population; health care; health insurance; health services; health survey; public health; adult; aged; article; controlled study; health care need; human; latent class analysis; mental capacity; middle aged; national health insurance; risk factor; Taiwan; Taiwan"
"Iron release profile of silica-modified zero-valent iron nps and their implication in cancer therapy","2019","To evaluate the iron ion release profile of zero-valent iron (ZVI)-based nanoparticles (NPs) and their relationship with lysosomes in cancer cells, silica and mesoporous silica-coated ZVI NPs (denoted as ZVI@SiO2 and ZVI@mSiO2) were synthesized and characterized for the following study of cytotoxicity, intracellular iron ion release, and their underlying mechanisms. ZVI@mSiO2 NPs showed higher cytotoxicity than ZVI@SiO2 NPs in the OEC-M1 oral cancer cell line. In addition, internalized ZVI@mSiO2 NPs deformed into hollow and void structures within the cells after a 24-h treatment, but ZVI@SiO2 NPs remained intact after internalization. The intracellular iron ion release profile was also accordant with the structural deformation of ZVI@mSiO2 NPs. Burst iron ion release occurred in ZVI@mSiO2-treated cells within an hour with increased lysosome membrane permeability, which induced massive reactive oxygen species generation followed by necrotic and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of endosome-lysosome system acidification successfully compromised burst iron ion release, thereby reversing the cell fate. An in vivo test also showed a promising anticancer effect of ZVI@mSiO2 NPs without significant weight loss. In conclusion, we demonstrated the anticancer property of ZVI@mSiO2 NPs as well as the iron ion release profile in time course within cells, which is highly associated with the surface coating of ZVI NPs and lysosomal acidification. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Balance of benefits and harms of different blood pressure targets in people with multiple chronic conditions: A quantitative benefit-harm assessment","2019","Objective Recent studies suggest that a systolic blood pressure (SBP) target of 120 mm Hg is appropriate for people with hypertension, but this is debated particularly in people with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). We aimed to quantitatively determine whether benefits of a lower SBP target justify increased risks of harm in people with MCC, considering patient-valued outcomes and their relative importance. Design Highly stratified quantitative benefit-harm assessment based on various input data identified as the most valid and applicable from a systematic review of evidence and based on weights from a patient preference survey. Setting Outpatient care. Participants Hypertensive patients, grouped by age, gender, prior history of stroke, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interventions SBP target of 120 versus 140 mm Hg for patients without history of stroke. Primary and secondary outcome measures Probability that the benefits of a SBP target of 120 mm Hg outweigh the harms compared with 140 mm Hg over 5 years (primary) with thresholds >0.6 (120 mm Hg better), <0.4 (140 mm Hg better) and 0.4 to 0.6 (unclear), number of prevented clinical events (secondary), calculated with the Gail/National Cancer Institute approach. Results Considering individual patient preferences had a substantial impact on the benefit-harm balance. With average preferences, 120 mm Hg was the better target compared with 140 mm Hg for many subgroups of patients without prior stroke, especially in patients over 75. For women below 65 with chronic kidney disease and without diabetes and prior stroke, 140 mm Hg was better. The analyses did not include mild adverse effects, and apply only to patients who tolerate antihypertensive treatment. Conclusions For most patients, a lower SBP target was beneficial, but this depended also on individual preferences, implying individual decision-making is important. Our modelling allows for individualised treatment targets based on patient preferences, age, gender and co-morbidities. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"H. pylori isolates with amino acid sequence polymorphisms as presence of both HtrA-L171 & CagL-Y58/E59 increase the risk of gastric cancer","2019","Background: H. pylori CagL-Y58/E59 increase gastric cancer risk by stronger binding with integrin to faciliate type IV secretory system (T4SS). H. pylori can secrete high temperature requirement A (HtrA) to mediate E-Cadherin cleavage for gastric epithelial junction disruption, so H. pylori CagL can adhere to integrin located on basolateral side of epithelium. The study test whether H. pylori HtrA amino acid polymorphisms can increase gastric cancer risk synergistically with CagL-Y58/E59. Methods: One-hundred and sixty-four H. pylori-positive patients, including 71 with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), 63 with peptic ulcers (PU), and 30 with gastric cancers (GC), were enrolled to receive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to obtain gastric biopsies for H. pylori culture and histology by the updated Sydney system. Each isolate was screened for htrA & cagL genotype by polymerase chain reaction and HtrA & CagL-Y58/E59 amino acid sequence polymorphisms by sequencing. Results: The prevalence rates of htrA & cagL gene were both 100%. The HtrA amino acid sequence polymorphisms were not different between NUD and PU. The H. pylori isolates of GC had higher rates of HtrA residue 171 as leucine than those of NUD (73.3% vs. 50.7%, P = 0.036, OR[95%CI] = 2.7[1.1-6.8]). The risk of the H. pylori-infected subjects to get gastric cancer was increased up to 15.4-fold, if the infected isolates had presence of both HtrA-L171 and CagL-Y58/E59 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The H. pylori isolates of gastric cancer subjects had a higher rate of HtrA-L171. H. pylori isolates with presence of both HtrA-171 & CagL-Y58/E59 can synergistically increase the risk of gastric cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; amino acid sequence; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; CagL gene; cancer risk; dyspepsia; female; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gene; genetic association; genotype; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; histology; HtrA gene; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonhuman; peptic ulcer; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; sequence analysis; stomach biopsy; stomach cancer; amino acid sequence; chemistry; genetic polymorphism; genetics; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; metabolism; microbiology; risk; stomach tumor; Taiwan; bacterial protein; cagL protein, Helicobacter pylori; serine proteinase; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Humans; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prevalence; Risk; Serine Endopeptidases; Stomach Neoplasms; Taiwan"
"Effects of PM2.5 on Skeletal Muscle Mass and Body Fat Mass of the Elderly in Taipei, Taiwan","2019","Loss of skeletal muscle mass is common with aging and can cause morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The effects of particulate air pollution on skeletal muscle mass is not known. The study aims to assess the chronic effects of ambient fine particulates (PM2.5) on the body composition of the elderly. From October 2015 to November 2016, a cross-sectional survey on 530 elderly (age?>?=?65 years) was conducted in the Taipei Basin, Taiwan. The body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 120). One year exposure to air pollution was estimated using the Kriging method at the participant's residence. Multiple linear regression analysis, after adjustments for demographics and co-pollutants, was used to examine the effects of PM2.5 on body composition indices and force of handgrip. Changes in body composition for an interquartile (1.4?μm/m3) increase in PM2.5 concentration included a 0.4?kg (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.31, -0.58; p?<?0.0001) decrease in skeletal muscle mass (2.0%) and a 0.7?kg (95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; p?<?0.0001) increase in body fat mass (3.6%). While PM2.5 reduced fat free mass in the upper extremities and trunk, but not in the lower extremities, it increased body fat mass in the three parts. There was no significant effect of PM2.5 on handgrip force. Higher physical activity (versus lower than median) was associated with less detrimental effect of PM2.5 on skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass (p values for interaction term: 0.009 and 0.013, respectively). Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass and increased body fat mass in the elderly, which can be ameliorated by physical activity.","aged; air pollution; article; body fat; controlled study; fat free mass; female; hand grip; human; impedance; kriging; lower limb; major clinical study; male; multiple linear regression analysis; muscle mass; physical activity; pollutant; skeletal muscle; statistical significance; Taiwan; upper limb"
"The expression profile and prognostic significance of metallothionein genes in colorectal cancer","2019","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease resulting from the combined influence of many genetic factors. This complexity has caused the molecular characterization of CRC to remain uncharacterized, with a lack of clear gene markers associated with CRC and the prognosis of this disease. Thus, highly sensitive tumor markers for the detection of CRC are the most essential determinants of survival. In this study, we examined the simultaneous downregulation of the mRNA levels of six metallothionein (MT) genes in CRC cell lines and public CRC datasets for the first time. In addition, we detected downregulation of these six MT mRNAs’ levels in 30 pairs of tumor (T) and adjacent non-tumor (N) CRC specimens. In order to understand the potential prognostic relevance of these six MT genes and CRC, we presented a four-gene signature to evaluate the prognosis of CRC patients. Further discovery suggested that the four-gene signature (MT1F, MT1G, MT1L, and MT1X) predicted survival better than any combination of two-, three-, four-, five-, or six-gene models. In conclusion, this study is the first to report that simultaneous downregulation of six MT mRNAs’ levels in CRC patients, and their aberrant expression together, accurately predicted CRC patients’ outcomes. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Hypoxia: The force of endometriosis","2019","Aim: Summarize recent findings of how hypoxia regulates numerous important processes to facilitate the implantation, proliferation and progression of ectopic endometriotic lesions. Methods: Most up-to-date evidences about how hypoxia contributes to the disease pathogenesis of endometriosis and potential therapeutic approaches were collected by conducting a comprehensive search of medical literature electronic databases. Quality of data was analyzed by experienced experts including gynecologist and basic scientists. Results: Uterus is a highly vascularized organ, which makes endometrial cells constantly expose to high concentration of oxygen. When endometrial tissues shed off from the eutopic uterus and retrograde to the peritoneal cavity, they face severe hypoxic stress. Even with successful implantation to ovaries or peritoneum, the hypoxic stress remains as a critical issue because endometrial cells are used to live in the well-oxygenated environment. Under the hypoxia condition, cells undergo epigenetic modulation and evolve several survival processes including steroidogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammation and metabolic switch. The complex gene regulatory network driven by hypoxia ensures endometriotic cells can survive under the hostile peritoneal microenvironment. Conclusion: Hypoxia plays critical roles in promoting pathological processes to facilitate the development of endometriosis. Targeting hypoxia-mediated gene network represents an alternative approach for the treatment of endometriosis. ? 2019 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology","hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; oxygen; angiogenesis; Article; cell survival; concentration (parameter); disease severity; endometriosis; endometrium cell; epigenetics; evidence based medicine; gene regulatory network; gynecologist; human; hypoxia; medical expert; pathogenesis; scientist; steroidogenesis; complication; endometriosis; endometrium; female; hypoxia; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; Endometriosis; Endometrium; Female; Humans; Hypoxia; Neovascularization, Pathologic"
"Evolutionary and Genomic Insights into Clostridioides difficile Sequence Type 11: a Diverse Zoonotic and Antimicrobial-Resistant Lineage of Global One Health Importance","2019","Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) sequence type 11 (ST11) is well established in production animal populations worldwide and contributes considerably to the global burden of C. difficile infection (CDI) in humans. Increasing evidence of shared ancestry and genetic overlap of PCR ribotype 078 (RT078), the most common ST11 sublineage, between human and animal populations suggests that CDI may be a zoonosis. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on a collection of 207 ST11 and closely related ST258 isolates of human and veterinary/environmental origin, comprising 16 RTs collected from Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America. Core genome single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis identified multiple intraspecies and interspecies clonal groups (isolates separated by ?2 core genome SNVs) in all the major RT sublineages: 078, 126, 127, 033, and 288. Clonal groups comprised isolates spread across different states, countries, and continents, indicative of reciprocal long-range dissemination and possible zoonotic/anthroponotic transmission. Antimicrobial resistance genotypes and phenotypes varied across host species, geographic regions, and RTs and included macrolide/lincosamide resistance (Tn6194 [ermB]), tetracycline resistance (Tn6190 [tetM] and Tn6164 [tet44]), and fluoroquinolone resistance (gyrA/B mutations), as well as numerous aminoglycoside resistance cassettes. The population was defined by a large ""open"" pan-genome (10,378 genes), a remarkably small core genome of 2,058 genes (only 19.8% of the gene pool), and an accessory genome containing a large and diverse collection of important prophages of the Siphoviridae and Myoviridae This study provides novel insights into strain relatedness and genetic variability of C. difficile ST11, a lineage of global One Health importance.IMPORTANCE Historically, Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) has been associated with life-threatening diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Increasing rates of C. difficile infection (CDI) in the community suggest exposure to C. difficile reservoirs outside the hospital, including animals, the environment, or food. C. difficile sequence type 11 (ST11) is known to infect/colonize livestock worldwide and comprises multiple ribotypes, many of which cause disease in humans, suggesting CDI may be a zoonosis. Using high-resolution genomics, we investigated the evolution and zoonotic potential of ST11 and a new closely related ST258 lineage sourced from diverse origins. We found multiple intra- and interspecies clonal transmission events in all ribotype sublineages. Clones were spread across multiple continents, often without any health care association, indicative of zoonotic/anthroponotic long-range dissemination in the community. ST11 possesses a massive pan-genome and numerous clinically important antimicrobial resistance elements and prophages, which likely contribute to the success of this globally disseminated lineage of One Health importance. ?

"Successful management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by sodium polystyrene sulfonate aspiration: A case report","2019","RATIONALE: Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is commonly administered to treat hyperkalemia. Severe pneumonia due to aspiration of this drug is rare and no survival case has thus far been reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 45-year-old man was hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury with hyperkalemia. He aspirated sodium polystyrene sulfonate while consuming the drug. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed rapidly, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). DIAGNOSES: Chest radiography results after aspiration showed new consolidation in the left upper lung. He underwent emergency bronchoscopy, which revealed a considerable amount of yellow mud-like material in the trachea and bronchi. Chest radiography results after the bronchoscopic removal of the foreign material revealed rapid resolution of the left upper lung consolidation. INTERVENTIONS: In the ICU, mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure was administered and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was set up for treating severe ARDS. We arranged an emergency bronchoscopy for diagnosis and removal of polystyrene sulfonate. OUTCOMES: ECMO was discontinued after 10 days and the patient was discharged after approximately 2 weeks. LESSONS: Aspiration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not common but can be lethal. Clinicians should be cautious and appropriately inform patients of the aspiration risk while administering this drug. Mechanical ventilation and bronchoscopy were effective treatments for severe ARDS caused by aspiration of this drug.","polystyrene derivative; polystyrenesulfonic acid; acid aspiration; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; bronchoscopy; case report; chemically induced; complication; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; male; middle aged; procedures; severity of illness index; Bronchoscopy; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polystyrenes; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Aspiration; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Severity of Illness Index"
"Magnetic Resonance Elastography in the Assessment of Acute Effects of Kinesio Taping on Lumbar Paraspinal Muscles","2019","Background: Kinesio tape (KT) is an elastic therapeutic tape used for treating sports-related injuries and a number of other disorders. To date, the objective evidence to link pathophysiological effects and actual reactions triggered by KT is limited. Purpose: To explore the effect of KT on the lumbar paraspinal muscles by magnetic resonance (MR) elastography. Study Type: Prospective observational study. Population: Sixty-six asymptomatic volunteers with 31 women and 35 men. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T MRI and elastography with vibration frequency of 120 Hz. Assessment: The 5-cm-width KT with full tension was placed on a single side of the lumbar paraspinal muscle. The taping side and adhering direction were randomly decided. Two rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) of 5- and 2.5-cm-width were positioned at the bilateral paraspinal regions from the L2 to L4 level on the confidence map of MR elastography before and after KT taping. The mean shear stiffness values of the ROIs at the superficial, middle, and deep depths were recorded; then the differences between the taping and reference sides were calculated. Statistical Tests: Paired t-test and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the stiffness changes after KT application and intraoperator errors of the stiffness measures on the reference side, respectively. Results: A significant decrease in the muscle stiffness value between taping and reference sides (–0.71 kPa ± 0.60 with KT and –0.25 kPa ± 0.78 without KT, P < 0.0001 for 5-cm ROI; –0.67 kPa ± 1.12 with KT and –0.16 kPa ± 1.17 without KT, P = 0.0004 for 2.5-cm ROI) was found in the superficial depth, but no significant differences in the middle and deep depths (P = 0.25 and P = 0.79 for 5-cm ROI; P = 0.09 and P = 0.67 for 2.5-cm ROI, respectively). There were no significant differences of muscle stiffness differences between gender (P = 0.11 for superficial, P = 0.37 for middle, P = 0.78 for deep) and taping direction (P = 0.18 for superficial, P = 0.13 for middle, P = 0.15 for deep).

"Pembrolizumab in Combination With Erlotinib or Gefitinib as First-Line Therapy for Advanced NSCLC With Sensitizing EGFR Mutation","2019","Introduction: Anti-EGFR agents are standard treatments for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC. The feasibility of combining erlotinib or gefitinib with the anti–programmed death 1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab was evaluated in the phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-021 study (NCT02039674). Methods: Adults with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks plus oral erlotinib 150 mg daily in cohort E or oral gefitinib 250 mg daily in cohort F, using a 3 + 3 design with cohort expansion. rTumor response was evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by blinded independent central review. The primary objective was determination of a recommended phase 2 dose. Results: Twelve patients enrolled to receive pembrolizumab plus erlotinib and seven to receive pembrolizumab plus gefitinib. No dose-limiting toxicities or grade 5 events occurred. Pembrolizumab plus erlotinib was feasible, with adverse events similar to those expected for monotherapy. However, pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was not feasible due to grade 3/4 liver toxicity in five of seven patients (71.4%), leading to permanent treatment discontinuation in four patients. The most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse events with pembrolizumab plus erlotinib were rash (50.0%), dermatitis acneiform, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and pruritus (33.3% each). The objective response rate was 41.7%, including response in all four patients with programmed death ligand 1 expression 50% or greater. Conclusions: Although pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was not feasible, the toxicity profile observed with pembrolizumab plus erlotinib suggests combining immunotherapy with anti-EGFR therapy is feasible. Pembrolizumab plus erlotinib did not improve objective response rate compared with previous monotherapy studies; further evaluation would be necessary to evaluate potential effects on other efficacy outcomes. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gefitinib; pembrolizumab; prednisone; programmed death 1 ligand 1; acne; adult; advanced cancer; aged; arthralgia; Article; autoimmune hepatitis; bacterial skin disease; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer staging; chemosensitization; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; cohort analysis; colitis; decreased appetite; dermatitis; diarrhea; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dry eye; dry skin; EGFR gene; fatigue; feasibility study; female; fever; gene mutation; hepatitis; human; human cell; human tissue; hypothyroidism; ingrown nail; maculopapular rash; male; monotherapy; multicenter study; nausea; non small cell lung cancer; open study; pharmacogenetics; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; protein expression; pruritus; rash; recommended drug dose; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1; side effect; skin manifestation; skin toxicity; treatment response; uveitis"
"Multifocal gastrointestinal varices: a rare manifestation of immunoglobulin G4-related disease","2019","Multifocal gastrointestinal varices are uncommon and often associated with liver cirrhosis. They consist of varices at the gastroesophageal region and the other sites (i.e. ectopic varices) simultaneously. The etiology includes venous system anomalies or thrombosis (congenital or acquired), vascular injury (iatrogenic or traumatic), or portal hypertension (either intrahepatic or extrahepatic). The clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic lesions to life-threatening variceal hemorrhage. The identification of bleeding foci, as well as the etiology of varices, can be challenging. The treatment necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. Here, we report a case with multifocal gastrointestinal varices involving the stomach, duodenum, and transverse colon. The patient presented with intermittent melena and has no history of liver or heart disease. Serial endoscopic examinations confirmed the multiple sites of the gastrointestinal varices. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated that the liver parenchyma is normal, and the hepatic veins, intrahepatic portal system, as well as vena cava, are all unobstructed. Nevertheless, it revealed typical features of autoimmune pancreatitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and compromised splenic and superior mesenteric veins. After the pancreatic tissue sampling, we eventually confirmed the etiology as immunoglobulin G4-related disease. In addition to steroid treatment for immunoglobulin G4-related disease, we successfully treated variceal bleeding with band ligation and prevented rebleeding with propranolol.

"Serum vascular adhesion protein-1 is up-regulated in hyperglycemia and is associated with incident diabetes negatively","2019","Background/objectives: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) can enhance tissue glucose uptake in cell studies and normalize hyperglycemia in animal studies. However, serum VAP-1 concentration (sVAP-1) is higher in subjects with diabetes in cross-sectional studies. In this cohort study, we test our hypothesis that sVAP-1 is increased in prediabetes to counteract hyperglycemia and is associated with incident diabetes negatively. Subjects/methods: From 2006 to 2012, 600 subjects without diabetes from Taiwan Lifestyle Study were included and followed regularly. Diabetes was diagnosed if FPG ? 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L), 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) ? 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ? 6.5%, or if the subject received anti-diabetic medications. Abdominal fat areas were measured by abdominal computed tomography and sVAP-1 was analyzed by ELISA. Results: sVAP-1 was higher in subjects with prediabetes (p < 0.05) and increased during an OGTT (p < 0.001). Fasting sVAP-1 was associated with the response of sVAP-1 during an OGTT (p < 0.001). Besides, sVAP-1 was associated negatively with body mass index (BMI, r = ?0.1449, p = 0.003), waist circumference (r = ?0.1425, p = 0.004), abdominal visceral (r = ?0.1457, p = 0.003), and subcutaneous (r = ?0.1025, p = 0.035) fat areas, and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration (r = ?0.2035, p < 0.0001), and positively with plasma adiponectin concentration (r = 0.2086, p < 0.0001), adjusted for age and gender. After 4.7 ± 2.6 years, 73 subjects (12.2%) developed incident diabetes. High sVAP-1 predicted a lower incidence of diabetes, adjusted for age, gender, BMI, family history of diabetes, HbA1c, HOMA2-%B and HOMA2-IR (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50–0.88, p < 0.01). Conclusions: sVAP-1 is increased in response to hyperglycemia. It is associated with obesity and serum hsCRP concentration negatively, and plasma adiponectin concentration positively. Besides, a high sVAP-1 is associated with a lower incidence of diabetes in human. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","adiponectin; C reactive protein; vascular adhesion protein 1; abdominal fat; adult; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; family history; fasting; female; glucose blood level; glucose transport; human; hyperglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; intra-abdominal fat; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oral glucose tolerance test; priority journal; protein blood level; retrospective study; subcutaneous fat; upregulation; waist circumference"

"Phthalate exposure alters gut microbiota composition and IgM vaccine response in human newborns","2019","Postnatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a common plasticizer, is associated with allergy development in childhood, suggesting that DEHP exposure may dysregulate immune response in infants. We investigated whether DEHP exposure in newborns through medical treatment affected the gut microbiota pattern and vaccine response, which are both related to immune development. In this prospective cohort study from May 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017, newborns with respiratory distress who were given intravenous infusions (IVs) were enrolled as the DEHP group, and newborns who did not receive IVs were enrolled as the control group. We excluded patients with perinatal maternal probiotics, vaginal delivery, antibiotic treatment, and exclusive human milk or formula feeding. Of 118 infants, urinary phthalate metabolite analysis revealed that the calculated DEHP concentrations of the newborns treated with IVs (n = 15) were higher than those in the control group (n = 10) (p = 0.0001). DEHP exposure altered bacterial communities both in composition and diversity, particularly decreases in Rothia sp. and Bifidobacterium longum in the DEHP group. Furthermore, DEHP exposure significantly enhanced anti-HBsAg-IgM responses in the DEHP group (p = 0.013). Early-life DEHP exposure alter gut microbiota of newborns and may change their immune responses in later life. ? 2019 The Authors","drug metabolite; hepatitis B surface antigen; immunoglobulin M; infusion fluid; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; recombinant hepatitis B vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; immunoglobulin M; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; plasticizer; Article; Bifidobacterium longum; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; female; hepatitis B; human; immune response; infant; intestine flora; major clinical study; male; metabolite; microbial diversity; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; newborn; pediatrics; prospective study; Rothia; urinalysis; vaccination; blood; drug effect; fluid therapy; immunology; intestine flora; intravenous drug administration; urine; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; Female; Fluid Therapy; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Humans; Immunoglobulin M; Infant, Newborn; Infusions, Intravenous; Male; Plasticizers"
"Evidence-based practice curriculum development for undergraduate nursing students: The preliminary results of an action research study in Taiwan","2019","Background: Equipping undergraduate nursing students with sufficient competence in evidence-based practice (EBP) is essential to meeting future practice needs. Integrating necessary EBP knowledge and skills systematically into the formal curriculum allows students to obtain better learning experience and outcomes. However, in Taiwan, a systematic nursing curriculum that integrates EBP concepts across the 4-year nursing baccalaureate program has not yet been developed. Moreover, engaging students in the clinical application of evidence remains a key challenge facing nursing education. Purpose: This study aimed to construct an EBP undergraduate nursing curriculum and develop clinical scenarios that support EBP teaching. Methods: Three cycles of action research, incorporating both focus group interviews and questionnaire surveys, were applied to construct and evaluate the appropriateness and feasibility of the EBP nursing curriculum and relevant teaching strategies. Results: An EBP nursing curriculum was constructed that integrates the three levels of learning objectives and corresponding learning outcomes, teaching content, and learning activities. Scenario activities were developed to familiarize students with the EBP process and to maximize their learning with regard to the clinical application of evidence. Next, a preliminary evaluation showed the appropriateness and feasibility of the developed curriculum, which was shown to foster the EBP competency of students and increase their confidence and positive attitudes toward EBP. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: A systematic EBP bachelor nursing curriculum with effective pedagogical strategies was developed. The associated process and the elicited information may offer a valuable reference for other nursing schools. Copyright ? 2019 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Learning sleep quality from daily logs","2019","Precision psychiatry is a new research field that uses advanced data mining over a wide range of neural, behavioral, psychological, and physiological data sources for classification of mental health conditions. This study presents a computational framework for predicting sleep efficiency of insomnia sufferers. A smart band experiment is conducted to collect heterogeneous data, including sleep records, daily activities, and demographics, whose missing values are imputed via Improved Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (Imp-GAIN). Equipped with the imputed data, we predict sleep efficiency of individual users with a proposed interpretable LSTM-Attention (LA Block) neural network model. We also propose a model, Pairwise Learning-based Ranking Generation (PLRG), to rank users with high insomnia potential in the next day. We discuss implications of our findings from the perspective of a psychiatric practitioner. Our computational framework can be used for other applications that analyze and handle noisy and incomplete time-series human activity data in the domain of precision psychiatry. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Behavioral research; Efficiency; Long short-term memory; Sleep research; Time series; Data imputation; Insomnia; Interpretability; Precision Psychiatry; Ranking model; Time-series data; Data mining"
"Development and validation of a nomogram for urothelial cancer in patients with chronic kidney disease","2019","Urothelial cancer (UC) is a common kidney cancer in Taiwan and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more at risk for UC than the general population. The diagnostic value of urine analysis and urine cytology is limited, especially in CKD patients. The aim of the study is to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of UC in CKD patients. We enrolled 169 UC patients and 1383 CKD patients from 9 hospitals in Taiwan between 2012 and 2015. CA125, HE4, clinical characteristics, and medical history were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression for its association with UC. A nomogram was developed to predict the risk of UC and was validated using Bootstrap. CA125 was associated with UC in CKD patients (OR: 5.91, 95% CI: 3.24–10.77) but HE4 was not (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.67–2.35). A nomogram based on patients’ age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, CA125 (log transformed), smoking, exposure of environmental toxin, use of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and use of traditional Chinese medicine was conducted. The AUC of the nomogram was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86–0.92, p < 0.01). Serum CA125 may identify UC patients from CKD patients but has limited diagnostic value due to low sensitivity. The diagnostic value of serum CA125 level can be improved by the combination with clinical characteristics including age, renal function, and medical history. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Music, heart rate variability, and symptom clusters: a comparative study","2020","Purpose: This study aimed to explore the possible range of change of a single-session music intervention (SMI) on symptom clusters and neurological reactivity for women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A parallel and randomized, controlled study with repeated measures design was used. A total of 100 women with breast cancer were randomly assigned to the SMI or a control group. The outcome measurements of symptom cluster were collected using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the neurological reactivity with heart rate variability at four time points: before commencement of the intervention (T0), immediately afterward (T1), 1?week later (T2), and 3?weeks after the intervention (T3). Results: Of the 50 women in each group, 46 in the SMI and 48 in the control group completed the post-test at T3. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the SMI group had a medium effect in change of symptom clusters compared to the control group at T2. Moreover, after adjusting for baseline between normal and higher levels of sympathetic tone activity, significant differences existed in fatigue and depression at T2 and sleep disturbance at T3. Conclusions: A single-session music intervention can be effectively used to reduce symptom clusters for women with breast cancer. Targeting those who have a higher level of sympathetic tone activity is recommended. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","antihistaminic agent; antineoplastic agent; anxiolytic agent; hypnotic sedative agent; sedative agent; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; comparative study; controlled study; depression; fatigue; female; follow up; heart rate variability; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; middle aged; music therapy; outcome assessment; parallel design; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sleep disorder; sympathetic tone; symptom"
"Using a novel scoring system for paronychia related to oncologic treatments (SPOT) for assessing paronychia severity and its correlation with pain index and quality of life","2019","Background: Oncologic treatments may lead to the development of paronychia, which may cause severe pain and disability. However, a detailed objective scoring system is lacking. Objective: To develop an objective scoring system to quantify the severity of paronychia and also examine the correlation of this score with a pain index and patients’ quality of life. Methods: A novel scoring system for paronychia related to oncologic treatments (SPOT), consisting of four parameters, namely redness, oedema, discharge and granulation tissue, was designed to assess the severity of paronychia. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) were recorded, and their association with the SPOT scores was analysed. Results: Ninety patients were enrolled from three medical centres in Taiwan. Severity of paronychia was determined by the scores of SPOT. Patients in the severe group had higher DLQI scores (severe vs. mild: P = 0.0018; severe vs. moderate: P = 0.0015). Both the DLQI and pain index scores were significantly higher in patients with higher dominant hand SPOT scores. Conclusions: The SPOT scores demonstrated the association of the paronychia severity with DLQI and pain. It may thus be useful in clinical practice and future studies. ? 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology","adult; Article; clinical practice; demography; Dermatology Quality of Life Index; disease severity; female; granulation tissue; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; pain assessment; paronychia; priority journal; quality of life; quality of life assessment; scoring system; scoring system for paronychia related to oncologic treatment; skin edema; skin redness; visual analog scale; chemically induced; clinical trial; complication; edema; erythema; exudate; multicenter study; pain; pain measurement; paronychia; pathology; prospective study; severity of illness index; antineoplastic agent; Antineoplastic Agents; Edema; Erythema; Exudates and Transudates; Female; Granulation Tissue; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Pain Measurement; Paronychia; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index"
"Accelerated Segmented Diffusion-Weighted Prostate Imaging for Higher Resolution, Higher Geometric Fidelity, and Multi-b Perfusion Estimation","2019","Purpose The aim of this study was to improve the geometric fidelity and spatial resolution of multi-b diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate. Materials and Methods An accelerated segmented diffusion imaging sequence was developed and evaluated in 25 patients undergoing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging examinations of the prostate. A reduced field of view was acquired using an endorectal coil. The number of sampled diffusion weightings, or b-factors, was increased to allow estimation of tissue perfusion based on the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model. Apparent diffusion coefficients measured with the proposed segmented method were compared with those obtained with conventional single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI). Results Compared with single-shot EPI, the segmented method resulted in faster acquisition with 2-fold improvement in spatial resolution and a greater than 3-fold improvement in geometric fidelity. Apparent diffusion coefficient values measured with the novel sequence demonstrated excellent agreement with those obtained from the conventional scan (R2 = 0.91 for bmax = 500 s/mm2 and R2 = 0.89 for bmax = 1400 s/mm2). The IVIM perfusion fraction was 4.0% ± 2.7% for normal peripheral zone, 6.6% ± 3.6% for normal transition zone, and 4.4% ± 2.9% for suspected tumor lesions. Conclusions The proposed accelerated segmented prostate diffusion imaging sequence achieved improvements in both spatial resolution and geometric fidelity, along with concurrent quantification of IVIM perfusion. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Semiparametric additive rates model for recurrent events data with intermittent gaps","2019","Statistical methods for analyzing recurrent events have attracted significant attention. The majority of existing works consider situations in which subjects are observed over time periods and events of interest that occurred during the course of follow-up are recorded. In some applications, a subject may leave the study for a period of time and then resume due to various reasons. During the absence, which is referred to as an intermittent gap in this study, it may be impossible to observe a recording of the event. A naive analysis disregards gaps and considers events to be a typical recurrent event dataset. However, this may result in biased estimations and misleading results. In this study, we build an additive rates model for recurrent event data considering intermittent gaps. We provide the asymptotic theories behind the proposed model, as well as the goodness of fit between observed and modeled values. Simulation studies reveal that the estimations perform well if intermittent gaps are taken into account. In addition, we utilized the longitudinal cohort of elderly patients who have type 2 diabetes and at least one record of a severe recurrent complication, hypoglycemia, from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan to demonstrate the proposed method. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; Article; cohort analysis; data base; disease severity; human; hypoglycemia; intermittent gap; longitudinal study; major clinical study; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; recurrent event data; semiparametric additive rate model; simulation; statistical analysis; statistical model; Taiwan; trend study"
"Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of perampanel in Asian and non-Asian patients with epilepsy","2019","People of different ethnic or racial backgrounds may experience variations in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to drug therapies. Our post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of perampanel in Asian and non-Asian populations with refractory focal seizures with or without focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC) seizures. This analysis pooled data from 4 randomized, placebo-controlled, phase-3 studies involving patients aged ?12?years who have focal seizures with or without FBTC seizures. Patients were receiving 2, 4, 8, or 12?mg perampanel (or placebo) by the end of a 6-week titration period and for a further 13?weeks during the maintenance phase. Efficacy endpoints included median percent change in seizure frequency per 28?days, and 50% and seizure-freedom responder rates relative to baseline. The median percent change in seizure frequency per 28?days from baseline was significantly greater than placebo for perampanel 8 and 12?mg (?31.1% and ?38.1% change, respectively; each P?<?0.0001) in the Asian population, and for perampanel 4, 8, and 12?mg (?21.1% [P?=?0.0001], ?26.3% [P?<?0.0001], and ?27.7% [P?=?0.0001] change, respectively) in the non-Asian population. The 50% responder rate relative to baseline was significantly greater than placebo for perampanel 8 and 12?mg (40.1% and 43.8%, respectively; each P?<?0.0001) in the Asian population, and for perampanel 4, 8, and 12?mg (29.4% [P?=?0.0002], 32.8% [P?<?0.0001] and 34.5% [P?=?0.0001]), respectively, in the non-Asian population. Seizure-freedom rate among all patients was 4.9%-11.7% for perampanel 2, 4, 8, and 12?mg. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across both populations were dizziness, somnolence, irritability, headache, and fatigue. The most common psychiatric TEAEs were aggression and irritability.

"Application of deep sequencing methods for inferring viral population diversity","2019","The first deep sequencing method was announced in 2005. Due to an increasing number of sequencing data and a reduction in the costs of each sequencing dataset, this innovative technique was soon applied to genetic investigations of viral genome diversity in various viruses, particularly RNA viruses. These deep sequencing findings documented viral epidemiology and evolution and provided high-resolution data on the genetic changes in viral populations. Here, we review deep sequencing platforms that have been applied in viral quasispecies studies. Further, we discuss recent deep sequencing studies on viral inter- and intrahost evolution, drug resistance, and humoral immune selection, especially in emerging and re-emerging viruses.

"Off-resonance SERS nanoprobe-targeted screen of biomarkers for antigens recognition of bladder normal and aggressive cancer cells","2019","The discovery of different binding receptors to allow rapid and high-sensitivity detection via a noninvasive urine test has become the goal for urothelial carcinoma (UC) diagnosis and surveillance. In this study, we developed a new screening membrane receptor platform for bladder cancer cells by integrating surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP)-modified AuAg nanohollows upon NIR laser excitation. AuAg nanohollows have an absorption band at ?630 nm, and slightly off-resonance 785 nm laser excitation is used for minimal photothermal effect. Using the same carbodiimide cross-linker chemistry to conjugate anti-EGFR, transferrin (TF), 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid (CPBA), folic acid (FA), and hyaluronic acid (HA) molecules, by screening the 4-ATP SERS signals intensity, we demonstrated that the targeting efficiency with the cost-effective CPBA molecule is comparable with the conjugation of anti-EGFR antibody to aggressive T24 cancer cells (high-grade), while weak intensity 4-ATP SERS responses to targets were obtained by grade-I RT4 bladder cancer cells, NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells, and SV-HUC1 bladder normal cells. This SERS nanoprobe platform makes primary bladder carcinoma screening from in vitro to ex vivo more straightforward. Our demonstration offers exciting potential for SERS screening of specific receptors on cancer cells of different grades and facilitates new opportunities ranging from surface engineering of SERS material tags to SERS imaging-guided and targeted phototherapy of cancer cells by controlling the laser powers. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell culture; Cell engineering; Cost effectiveness; Diseases; Gold alloys; Hyaluronic acid; Laser excitation; Molecules; Nanoprobes; Organic acids; Raman spectroscopy; Silver alloys; Binding receptors; Bladder cancer cells; High-sensitivity detection; Membrane receptors; Photothermal effects; Surface engineering; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Urothelial carcinoma; Cells"
"Design and evaluation of the system device for mitigation of the low back pain among veterinarians","2019","This Study proposes an innovative auxiliary device to solve the low back pain (LBP) caused by veterinarian’s poor work posture. In recent years, with the heightened status of pets in people’s lives, the demand in animal hospitals has increased significantly, and the occupational hazards of veterinarians have also emerged gradually. Veterinary work environment is complex and diverse, and working hours are overly long, which can easily cause the issue of the LBP. Among the patients with the LBP, many people are classified as non-specific low back pain (NSLBP). This means that there is no known pathological anatomy for the LBP itself, and its principle is strongly related to the compressive load of the spine. NSLBP should be considered as a change in the structure of the whole body’s spine. Poor posture can lead to imbalance of curvature of the spine and damage to soft tissues. This Study begins with the posture state of the veterinary surgery, where biomechanics and physiological anatomy are used to target the interaction of the lower back and shoulder flexion angles during the operation of the veterinarian, and to consider the results of the blood flow when the muscles are tight. This Study will design an auxiliary device for the veterinary surgery to effectively reduce the mechanical load on the spine, overstretch the muscles and promote blood circulation, thereby improving the fluency of the veterinary surgery and slowing the veterinarian’s NSLBP. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Auxiliary equipment; Blood; Ergonomics; Health risks; Muscle; Risk management; Safety engineering; Surgery; Assistive devices; Blood circulation; Compressive loads; Design and evaluations; Low back pain; Occupational hazards; Veterinary; Work environments; Human computer interaction"
"Attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition predict depression maintenance","2019","Insecure attachment cognitions, emotion recognition biases, and their interaction are important contributors to depression susceptibility. The present study, with a prospective longitudinal design, investigated the role of negative emotion recognition in moderating the linkage from insecure attachment cognitions to elevated depressive symptoms. A sample of 96 depression-prone individuals completed measures for attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, depression symptom severity, and a computerized facial and prosodic emotion recognition task twice with a four-week interval. Results revealed that the interaction between attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition significantly predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. More specifically, greater attachment avoidance with lower accuracy of fearful prosodic emotions at baseline predicted an increase of depressive symptoms over four-week interval. However, no moderating role of emotion recognition in the linkage from attachment anxiety to depression persistence was noted. The present study demonstrates that attachment avoidance and negative emotion recognition may together contribute to the maintenance of depression. The findings may be pertinent to attachment avoidance-related deactivating strategy that appears to be a specific cultural forbearance way for emotion regulation in collectivistic societies. Potential applications and future research are then suggested. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; anxiety; Article; automation; avoidance behavior; controlled study; depression; disease severity; emotion; emotional attachment; facial recognition; fear; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; prosodic emotion; prospective study; recognition; task performance; adolescent; depression; emotion; fear; object relation; perception; physiology; psychology; severity of illness index; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Object Attachment; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Social Perception; Young Adult"
"Development of an assistant system of clean intermittent catheterization for neurogenic bladder dysfunction patients","2019","Background: Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is one of the methods currently used to prevent overdistention of the bladder in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD). It is also helpful in preventing urinary tract infection and retaining the function of the bladder. Voiding diary and social behavior are necessary for the patients to maintain their physical and mental health, nevertheless there are currently no good assistant systems to help them achieve these goals. Methods: In this study, we propose a CIC assistant system with the functions of recording and tracking the voided volume and accessible lavatory. The aim of this study is to assess the effects from the 12 patients who joined the proposed system. Information collected from participants included their demographics, past medicals, injury characteristics, current and past bladder managements, and any NBD related complications. Results: The results indicate that most patients felt relieved that they could know the voided volume and track their history easily. Moreover, the accessible lavatory function of the proposed system could reduce time consumption by 43.1% in finding the suitable lavatory, thus the desire and willingness of patients to travel increased from 25% to 75% after using the system. Conclusions: The proposed system could help doctors with clinical diagnoses, and help patients to understand more about the history of their catheterization volume and time period. This study provided essential information and design for future investigation. ? 2019 by the authors.",""
"Spousal health and older adults’ biomarker change over six years: Investigation of gender differences","2019","Objective: Relationship of spousal health and biomarkers over six years were examined. Methods and materials: Nationally representative sample of 483 adults aged 54+ in Taiwan were followed for six years. Four classes of spousal health changes and three categories of biomarker indexes were examined. Biomarkers were assessed by counting the adverse progression on items of allostatic load (AL), cardiovascular disease biomarkers (CVD), and metabolic syndromes, respectively. Results: When the health status of an individual's spouse became worse, women increased their AL by 0.48 (P < 0.05), CVD by 0.56 (P <.001), and metabolic syndrome by 0.43 (P < 0.05). If the health status of a woman's spouse remained poor, it increased her allostatic load by 0.60 (P < 0.05). These effects were only observed in women. In addition, when the health status of a men's spouse became better, man's biomarker profile on AL significantly improved by 0.80 (P < 0.05). No significant moderating effect of education was observed in this sample. Conclusions: Married couples display concordance in both physical and mental health-related biomarkers, specifically, allostatic load. Women were more likely than men to experience adverse biomarker progress on all the biomarkers examined in this study when the status of their spouse became worse based on their subjective judgment, and men were more sensitive to positive health changes in their spouse than women. ? 2019","biological marker; epinephrine; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydrocortisone; interleukin 1; noradrenalin; prasterone sulfate; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cholesterol blood level; diastolic blood pressure; female; health status; human; male; metabolic syndrome X; priority journal; self report; sex difference; spouse; systolic blood pressure; Taiwan; waist circumference; waist hip ratio"

"Pollen of Broussonetia papyrifera: An emerging aeroallergen associated with allergic illness in Taiwan","2019","Pollen has long been recognized as a major allergen, having diverse patterns of allergenicity caused by differences in climate, geography, and vegetation. Our research aimed to explore the role of a regionally dominant pollen in Taiwan, Broussonetia papyrifera, on clinical sensitization and daily 5collected and extracted for a skin prick test on 30 volunteers recruited from a medical college. Daily atmospheric pollen levels were measured using a Burkard 7-day volumetric trap. The association between daily atmospheric pollen levels and clinic visits for allergic illness was examined using a generalized additive model with a normal assumption. After excluding four participants with a positive response to a negative control, 10 participants (38.4%) were determined to be sensitive to B. papyrifera pollen extract. The three-day lagged concentration of B. papyrifera pollen exhibited the highest risk of daily asthma visits (relative risk [RR] = 1.166, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.014–1.341) and allergic rhinitis visits (RR = 1.119, 95% CI: 0.916–1.367) when the pollen increased equally in magnitude to its mean. Our study is the first to provide evidence indicating that the most dominant airborne pollen in Taiwan, B. papyrifera, plays a major role in sensitization and clinic visits for asthma and allergic rhinitis, thus highlighting the need to integrate aeroallergen monitoring with clinical diagnosis. ? 2018","Allergens; Clinical research; Diagnosis; Aeroallergen; Asthma; Broussonetia papyrifera; Pollen; Skin prick test; Diseases; pollen antigen; allergen; immunoglobulin E; aerosol; allergy; angiosperm; asthma; confidence interval; dominance; health impact; monitoring; pollen; adult; air pollution; airborne particle; allergenicity; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; Broussonetia papyrifera; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; male; pollen; prick test; priority journal; sensitization; Taiwan; allergic rhinitis; asthma; blood; Broussonetia; environmental monitoring; immunology; pollen; procedures; skin test; Taiwan; Broussonetia papyrifera; Adult; Allergens; Asthma; Broussonetia; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic; Skin Tests; Taiwan"
"Heart rate variability biofeedback increased autonomic activation and improved symptoms of depression and insomnia among patients with major depression disorder","2019","Objective: Autonomic imbalance is considered a psychopathological mechanism underlying major depressive disorder (MDD). Heart rate variability (HRV) is an index for autonomic activation. Poor sleep quality is common among patients with MDD. HRV biofeedback (BF) has been used for regulating autonomic balance among patients with physical illness and mental disorders. The purpose of present study was to examine the effects of HRV-BF on depressive symptoms, sleep quality, pre-sleep arousal, and HRV indices, in patients with MDD and insomnia. Methods: In this case-controlled study, patients with MDD and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score higher than 6 were recruited. The HRV-BF group received weekly 60-minute protocol for 6 weeks, and the control group who have matched the age and sex received medical care only. All participants were assessed on Beck Depression Inventory-II, Back Anxiety Inventory, PSQI, and Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale. Breathing rates and electrocardiography were also performed under resting state at pre-testing, and post-testing conditions and for the HRV-BF group, also at 1-month follow-up. Results: In the HRV-BF group, symptoms of depression and anxiety, sleep quality, and pre-sleep arousal were significantly improved, and increased HRV indices, compared with the control group. Moreover, in the HRV-BF group, significantly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety, decreased breathing rates, and increased HRV indices were detected at post-testing and at 1-month follow-up, compared with pre-testing values. Conclusion: This study confirmed that HRV-BF is a useful psychosocial intervention for improving autonomic balance, baroreflex, and symptoms of depression and insomnia in MDD patients. ? 2019 Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

"The expanding morphological and genetic spectrum of MYOD1-mutant spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcomas: a clinicopathological and molecular comparison of mutated and non-mutated cases","2019","Aims: Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcomas (SC/SRMS) feature spindled and/or rounded rhabdomyosarcomatous cells within variably hyalinised stroma. Only 30–67% of SC/SRMSs harbour neomorphic MYOD1 p.L122R mutations, indicating heterogeneity in this RMS type. We compared MYOD1-mutant and non-mutant cases to characterise the histological and genetic spectrum of mutated SC/SRMS. Methods and results: Seventeen RMSs with spindled, sclerosing or hybrid histology were sequenced to identify MYOD1 and PIK3CA mutations and reappraised to assess histological features and myogenic immunophenotypes. Twelve SC/SRMSs harboured MYOD1 mutations, including homozygous p.L122R (n?=?8), heterozygous p.L122R (n?=?3) and heterozygous p.E118K (n?=?1). MYOD1-mutant tumours affected nine females and three males aged 8–64?years (median?=?22.5), had a median size of 4.2?cm (range?=?2–22) and involved the head and neck (n?=?7), extremities (n?=?4) and mediastinum (n?=?1). Fascicular/spindle histology was predominant in four cases, including one with heterologous lipoblasts in focally myxoid stroma. Four sclerosing cases mainly comprised rounded cells, including one with multinucleated tumour cells. Four cases were histologically hybrid. The only PIK3CA (p.H1047R) mutation was detected in a predominantly spindled MYOD1-p.L122R-mutated case, but not in its laser-microdissected lipoblast-containing area. All MYOD1-mutant cases exhibited diffuse MYOD1 expression but patchy myogenin reactivity. At final follow-up (median?=?13.5?months), recurrences (n?=?4), metastases (n?=?2) or both (n?=?1) occurred in seven MYOD1-mutant cases; one had died of disease. Five non-mutated cases were reclassified as spindle embryonal (n?=?3), dense embryonal (n?=?1) and unclassifiable (n?=?1) RMSs. Conclusion: MYOD1-mutant RMSs are uncommonly mutated with PIK3CA and behave aggressively with an expanded morphological and genetic spectrum, including lipoblastic differentiation, multinucleated cells and the alternative p.E118K mutation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","MyoD1 protein; myogenin; pik3ca protein; protein; unclassified drug; MyoD protein; MyoD1 myogenic differentiation protein; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; PIK3CA protein, human; adolescent; adult; Article; cancer recurrence; child; clinical article; female; follow up; gene mutation; genetic heterogeneity; heterozygote; histology; homozygote; human; immunophenotyping; lung metastasis; male; preschool child; priority journal; protein expression; rhabdomyosarcoma; school child; spinal cord metastasis; spindle cell sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma; tumor volume; young adult; comparative study; genetics; middle aged; mutation; pathology; retrospective study; rhabdomyosarcoma; sarcoma; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; MyoD Protein; Retrospective Studies; Rhabdomyosarcoma; Sarcoma; Young Adult"
"Attitudes toward and beliefs about obese persons across Hong Kong and Taiwan: Wording effects and measurement invariance","2019","Background: The psychosocial consequences of obesity are important but often underrated. The Attitudes Toward Obese Persons (ATOP) and Beliefs About Obese Persons (BAOP) scales used to measure weight-related bias have little psychometric information, especially in East Asian contexts. The objective of this study was to use rigorous statistical methods to demonstrate the psychometric properties of these two instruments in Hong Kong and Taiwanese college students. Methods: A convenience sample of 707 students was recruited from the universities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Several competing confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to confirm the factorial structure of the ATOP and BAOP. The best fit models for the ATOP and BAOP were chosen for the examination of the measurement invariance across subcultures. We then compared configurable models with or without loading and/or intercept constrained before correlating the latent constructs between the best models for the ATOP and BAOP. Results: The comparison in multiple CFAs found that the model with one factor and two correlated-wording-method factors outperformed the other models for both the ATOP and BOAP. However, the internal consistency was suboptimal (ATOP: α =.56 to.80; BTOP: α =.57 to.65) and the measurement invariance was somewhat unsupported among the Hong Kong and Taiwan samples. Moreover, after controlling wording effects, the latent construct of the ATOP was moderately associated with that of BAOP (r =.356; p <.001). Conclusion: Chinese versions of the ATOP and BAOP can be treated as a unidimensional factor for use in Hong Kong and Taiwan university students. However, further refinements of both instruments may be needed before using them to capture the social attitudes and beliefs toward obesity individuals, which is expected to advance our understanding of weight-related bias in East Asian contexts. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; college student; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; convenience sample; female; Hong Kong; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; obese patient; psychometry; social attitude; Taiwan; university student; weight bias; weight stigma; young adult; attitude; cross-sectional study; factor analysis; Hong Kong; obesity; psychology; publication; quality of life; questionnaire; Taiwan; validation study; Adult; Attitude; Cross-Sectional Studies; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Obesity; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Translations; Young Adult"
"Treatment of a patient with breast cancer and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: A case report","2019","RATIONALE: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells that cause hemolytic anemia. Some anticancer drugs are reported to trigger oxidative stress; however, events of hemolysis are rarely discussed in patients with G6PD deficiency required oncologic treatments. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we reported a young woman with G6PD deficiency safely undergoing breast cancer treatment. DIAGNOSIS: A 29-year-old patient was diagnosed with advanced cancer of the right breast with tumors positive for hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel. During the administration of docetaxel, trastuzumab was concurrently administered and was continued after the completion of docetaxel. The patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy; meanwhile, tamoxifen was administered as adjuvant endocrine treatment. OUTCOMES: The treatment process was smooth. There was no evidence of hemolytic anemia. Except for hot flushes, the patient lives without remarkable side effects from ongoing or previous treatments. LESSONS: Some patients have both G6PD deficiency and malignancy in a geographic area with relatively high incidence of the enzymatic disorder and certain types of cancer. We suggest that our report can contribute to the concern regarding the safety of patients with G6PD deficiency undergoing cancer treatment.","antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; adult; biosynthesis; breast tumor; case report; female; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; human; Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Humans; Receptor, ErbB-2"
"Upcoming epidemic of asbestos-related malignant pleural mesothelioma in Taiwan: A prediction of incidence in the next 30 years","2019","Background/Purpose: Globally, asbestos-related diseases (ARDs) keep rising over the coming decades. The epidemic of ARDs will be a burden on public health. We aimed to predict the malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) incidence in the next 30 years for Taiwan based on historical asbestos consumption. Methods: We collected annual data on local asbestos consumption during 1939–2015 and sex-specific incidence of pleural cancer as a proxy for MPM during 1979–2013. We applied Poisson log-linear models to predict future MPM numbers under the assumption that latency periods between asbestos exposure and MPM incidence were between 25 and 45 years. Results: Asbestos consumption reached a peak in the 1980s, with a total of 668 thousand metric tons during 1939–2015. The observed number of MPM incidence increased by 9- and 6-fold in males and females during 1979–2013, with a cumulative number of 907. Given a latency period of 31 years, MPM incidences were expected to peak around 2012–2016 for males and 2016–2020 for females. In 2017–2046, the predicted total number of new MPM might reach 659 cases (95% confidence interval = 579–749); and the male to female ratios ranged from 1.8 to 2.8. Conclusion: The MPM epidemic in Taiwan will likely peak in 2012–2020 as a result of local asbestos consumption. Approximately 659 new MPM cases in the next 30 years warrant an urgent need to implement a total asbestos ban and put more resources on a comprehensive surveillance, diagnosis, and follow-up health care system for ARDs. ? 2018","asbestos; asbestos; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; child; environmental exposure; epidemic; female; follow up; health care system; human; infant; latent period; major clinical study; male; newborn; pleura mesothelioma; prediction; sex difference; Taiwan; very elderly; age distribution; chemically induced; forecasting; incidence; lung tumor; mesothelioma; middle aged; pleura tumor; preschool child; regression analysis; sex ratio; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asbestos; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mesothelioma; Middle Aged; Pleural Neoplasms; Regression Analysis; Sex Distribution; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Combination of the Preoperative Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Monocyte-Lymphocyte Ratio as a Novel Prognostic Factor in Patients with Upper-Tract Urothelial Carcinoma","2019","Background: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of the preoperative systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) combined with the monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Methods: The clinical data of 424 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy from January 2007 to June 2017 were analyzed. Kaplan–Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations of preoperative systemic immune-inflammatory biomarkers with overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Moreover, logistic regression preoperative models were applied to predict advanced disease. Results: Multivariate analyses showed that SII significantly influenced both OS and CSS (both P < 0.05), whereas MLR exhibited the most significant association with OS (P = 0.008). In particular, simultaneously high SII and MLR values correlated significantly with OS, CSS, and PFS (all P < 0.05). Logistic regression preoperative models showed that the combination of high SII and high MLR was a significant predictor of non-organ-confined UTUC (P = 0.001). Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the combination of high SII and high MLR was significantly linked with poor OS, CSS, and PFS in non-organ-confined UTUC (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: The study reviewed serum inflammation biomarkers in a subset of patients with UTUC and demonstrated the ability of combined SII and MLR to predict disease progression and survival. Patients with both high SII and high MLR were significantly more likely to have non-organ-confined disease and poor survival outcomes. ? 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.","adult; aged; Article; bladder tumor; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer surgery; chronic kidney failure; clinical study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; hematuria; human; hydronephrosis; hypertension; kidney pelvis tumor; lymph node metastasis; lymphocyte monocyte ratio; major clinical study; male; nephroureterectomy; oncological parameters; overall survival; papilloma; progression free survival; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; systemic immune inflammation index; transitional cell carcinoma; tumor necrosis; tumor volume; follow up; immunology; lymphocyte; metabolism; middle aged; monocyte; nephroureterectomy; pathology; preoperative care; prognosis; survival rate; urinary tract tumor; very elderly; autacoid; tumor marker; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Monocytes; Nephroureterectomy; Preoperative Care; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Urologic Neoplasms"
"The application of a high-density street-level air temperature observation network (HiSAN): The relationship between air temperature, urban development, and geographic features","2019","The urban heat island effect in cities has become an important problem in relation to not only urban climate but also public health and urban planning. Tainan, which located in Southern Taiwan, is a compact city with intense development. Therefore, this study investigated the urban thermal condition by employing a high-density street-level air temperature observation network (HiSAN). A total of 100 measurement points were set in various urban development areas. The geographic factors in Tainan can be used for indicating the relationship between thermal conditions and urban built environments to comprehensively compare the approaches, such as conducting traverse measurement and utilizing only a single datum or a small amount of weather station data. Buffer zone analysis was used in this study for zones of different sizes, and it was determined that a 300-m scale is optimal to illustrate the effects of land features on microclimate. The results revealed that the thermal condition in Tainan is influenced by urban development factors, such as the floor area and land cover area, and by geographic factors, such as the distance to the sea. A better cooling effect can be obtained from a vegetation area during the night time and from a water body during the daytime. Moreover, different cooling effects are observed based on the distance to the sea. Through these results, a model for predicting the thermal condition for different periods can be established using a multiple regression model. Urban planners and architects can proffer design and planning suggestions for different areas based on the findings of this study to reduce thermal stress in urban areas. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Landforms; Regression analysis; Urban growth; Buffer zone analysis; Design and planning; Multiple regression model; Tainan; Thermal condition; Urban development; Urban heat island; Urban Heat Island Effects; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; heat island; microclimate; multiple regression; public health; urban climate; urban design; urban development; urban planning; air temperature; architect; Article; built environment; city planning; controlled study; cooling; distance to the sea; environmental parameters; floor area; geography; land cover area; microclimate; population density; priority journal; Taiwan; temperature stress; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; weather; Tainan; Taiwan"
"Interplay between a Mental Disorder Risk Gene and Developmental Polarity Switch of GABA Action Leads to Excitation-Inhibition Imbalance","2019","Excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance is considered a hallmark of various neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. How genetic risk factors disrupt coordinated glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse formation to cause an E-I imbalance is not well understood. Here, we show that knockdown of Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a risk gene for major mental disorders, leads to E-I imbalance in mature dentate granule neurons. We found that excessive GABAergic inputs from parvalbumin-, but not somatostatin-, expressing interneurons enhance the formation of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in immature mutant neurons. Following the switch in GABAergic signaling polarity from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing during neuronal maturation, heightened inhibition from excessive parvalbumin+ GABAergic inputs causes loss of excitatory glutamatergic synapses in mature mutant neurons, resulting in an E-I imbalance. Our findings provide insights into the developmental role of depolarizing GABA in establishing E-I balance and how it can be influenced by genetic risk factors for mental disorders. Kang et al. uncover a circuit-level homeostatic mechanism coordinating glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse formation during neuronal maturation and reveal how excitation-inhibition imbalance develops due to a genetic insult. ? 2019 The Authors","4 aminobutyric acid; disrupted in schizophrenia 1 protein; parvalbumin; somatostatin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell maturation; controlled study; dentate gyrus; depolarization; disrupted in schizophrenia 1 gene; excitation inhibition imbalance; female; GABAergic synapse; GABAergic system; gene knockdown; genetic risk; glutamatergic synapse; interneuron; male; mental disease; mouse; nerve cell; neurologic disease; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; synapse; synaptogenesis"
"Occupational therapy to improve quality of life for colorectal cancer survivors: a randomized clinical trial","2019","Purpose: To determine the potential effects of a healthy lifestyle education provided by occupational therapists on quality of life (QoL), activities of daily living, and healthy lifestyle behavior in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. Methods: Sixty-eight participants were randomly assigned to either an occupational therapy (OT) intervention or a non-intervention group (in a 1:1 ratio). Participants in the OT intervention group were given an OT consultation based on a healthy lifestyle education handbook for CRC at discharge and at a 1-month and 3-month clinic follow-up; participants in the non-intervention group were given the same CRC education handbook only at discharge preparation without further consultation. The primary outcome was based on the QoL measured using the World Health Organization QoL-BREF (WHOOQOL-BREF). Outcomes were examined at discharge preparation as baseline and at a 1-month as well as 3-month clinic follow-up. Results: After controlling for demographic and income variables, we found statistically significant improvement in the scores on two items in the WHOQOL-BREF, including “overall quality of life” and “negative feelings” (p < 0.05) in the OT intervention group. Conclusions: OT consultation sessions based on healthy lifestyle at discharge and in the first 3?months after discharge may improve the QoL of CRC survivors.

"A nationwide survey of adherence to analgesic drugs among cancer patients in Taiwan: prevalence, determinants, and impact on quality of life","2019","Purpose: Poor adherence to analgesic drugs is one of the most common barriers to adequate pain management. This prospective, cross-sectional, patient-oriented observational study aimed to explore the adherence rate, clinical factors, and impact of adherence to analgesic drugs on the quality of life (QoL) among cancer outpatients in Taiwan. Methods: Eight hundred ninety-seven consecutive adult outpatients with cancer who had reported tumor pain and received regular analgesic drug treatment were enrolled from 16 medical centers across Taiwan. The Brief Pain Inventory was used to assess pain intensity and QoL. Morisky’s four-item medication adherence scale was used to assess adherence to analgesic drugs. Clinical factors possibly associated with good adherence to analgesic drugs were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Of the 897 patients, 26.9% met criteria for the good, 35.5% for the moderate, and 37.6% for the poor adherence groups. The good adherence group had significantly better QoL outcomes than the moderate and poor adherence groups (all p < 0.05). Age ? 50?years, head and neck or hematological malignancies, cancer-related pain, patients who agreed or strongly agreed that the side effects of analgesic drugs were tolerable, and patients who disagreed or strongly disagreed that the dosing schedule could be flexibly self-adjusted to deal with the actual pain were predictors of good adherence to analgesic drugs. Conclusions: Awareness of the clinical factors associated with adherence to analgesic drugs may help clinicians to identify cancer patients at a greater risk of non-adherence, reinforce optimal pain management, and improve the QoL by enhancing adherence to pain medications. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","analgesic agent; analgesic agent; adult; aged; analgesia; Article; breast cancer; Brief Pain Inventory; cancer pain; cancer patient; clinical assessment; cross-sectional study; digestive system cancer; drug tolerability; female; head and neck cancer; health survey; hematologic malignancy; human; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medication compliance; middle aged; Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; multicenter study; observational study; outcome assessment; outpatient care; pain intensity; patient compliance; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; Taiwan; thorax cancer; treatment indication; unspecified side effect; cancer pain; medication compliance; neoplasm; outpatient; pathophysiology; prevalence; quality of life; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Analgesics; Cancer Pain; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Outpatients; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status in the prediction of liver transplantation among patients with liver disease: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan","2019","Given the fact that >80% of liver transplantations (LTs) were living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in Taiwan, we conducted this study to assess whether patients with lower socioeconomic status are subject to a lower chance of receiving hepatic transplantation.This was a cohort study including 197,082 liver disease patients admitted in 1997 to 2013, who were at higher risk of LT. Personal monthly income and median family income of living areas were used to indicate individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status, respectively. Cox proportional hazard model that considered death as a competing risk event was used to estimate subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) of LT in association with socioeconomic status.Totally 2204 patients received LT during follow-up, representing a cumulative incidence of 1.12% and an incidence rate of 20.54 per 10 person-years. After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, co-morbidity, location/urbanization level of residential areas, we found that patients with < median monthly income experienced significantly lower incidence of LT (aHR?=?0.802, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?0.717-0.898), but those with >- median monthly income had significantly elevated incidence of LT (aHR?=?1.679, 95% CI?=?1.482-1.903), as compared to those who were not actively employed. Additionally, compared to areas with the lowest quartile of median family income, the highest quartile of median family income was also associated with significantly higher incidence rate of LT (aHR?=?1.248, 95% CI?=?1.055-1.478).Higher individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status were significantly associated with higher incidence of LT among patients with higher risk of LT.","adolescent; adult; aged; ancestry group; classification; cohort analysis; complication; demography; female; human; income; liver disease; liver transplantation; male; middle aged; procedures; propensity score; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; social class; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Continental Population Groups; Female; Humans; Income; Liver Diseases; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Propensity Score; Proportional Hazards Models; Residence Characteristics; Retrospective Studies; Social Class; Taiwan"
"Intra-articular Injection of Platelet-Rich Plasma Is Superior to Hyaluronic Acid or Saline Solution in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Triple-Parallel, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial","2019","Purpose: To prospectively compare the efficacy of intra-articular injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with a sham control group (normal saline solution [NS]) for knee osteoarthritis in a randomized, dose-controlled, placebo-controlled, double-blind, triple-parallel clinical trial. Methods: A total of 87 osteoarthritic knees (53 patients) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups receiving 3 weekly injections of either leukocyte-poor PRP (31 knees), HA (29 knees), or NS (27 knees). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score were collected at baseline and at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Results: All 3 groups showed statistically significant improvements in both outcome measures at 1 month; however, only the PRP group sustained the significant improvement in both the WOMAC score (63.71 ± 20.67, increased by 21%) and IKDC score (49.93 ± 17.74, increased by 40%) at 12 months. For the intergroup comparison, except for the first month, there was a statistically significant difference between the PRP and NS groups in both scores throughout the study duration (regression coefficients of 8.72 [P = .0015], 7.94 [P = .0155], and 11.92 [P = .0014] at 2, 6, and 12 months, respectively, for WOMAC score, and 9.1 [P = .0001], 10.28 [P = .0002], and 13.97 [P < .0001], respectively, for IKDC score). There was no significant difference in both functional outcomes between the HA and NS groups at any time point. Only the PRP group reached the minimal clinically important difference in the WOMAC score at every evaluation (15%, 21%, 18%, and 21% at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months, respectively) and the minimal clinically important difference in the IKDC score at 6 months (improvement of 11.6). Conclusions: Intra-articular injections of leukocyte-poor PRP can provide clinically significant functional improvement for at least 1 year in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee.

"WW domain-containing proteins YAP and TAZ in the hippo pathway as key regulators in stemness maintenance, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis","2019","The Hippo pathway is a conserved signaling pathway originally defined in Drosophila melanogaster two decades ago. Deregulation of the Hippo pathway leads to significant overgrowth in phenotypes and ultimately initiation of tumorigenesis in various tissues. The major WW domain proteins in the Hippo pathway are YAP and TAZ, which regulate embryonic development, organ growth, tissue regeneration, stem cell pluripotency, and tumorigenesis. Recent reports reveal the novel roles of YAP/TAZ in establishing the precise balance of stem cell niches, promoting the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and provoking signals for regeneration and cancer initiation. Activation of YAP/TAZ, for example, results in the expansion of progenitor cells, which promotes regeneration after tissue damage. YAP is highly expressed in self-renewing pluripotent stem cells. Overexpression of YAP halts stem cell differentiation and yet maintains the inherent stem cell properties. A success in reprograming iPSCs by the transfection of cells with Oct3/4, Sox2, and Yap expression constructs has recently been shown. In this review, we update the current knowledge and the latest progress in the WW domain proteins of the Hippo pathway in relevance to stem cell biology, and provide a thorough understanding in the tissue homeostasis and identification of potential targets to block tumor development. We also provide the regulatory role of tumor suppressor WWOX in the upstream of TGF-β, Hyal-2, and Wnt signaling that cross talks with the Hippo pathway.

"Development of an inflammatory tissue-selective chimeric TNF receptor","2019","Background: Inhibiting TNF-α is an effective therapy for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, systemic, nondiscriminatory neutralization of TNF-α is associated with considerable adverse effects. Methods: Here, we developed a trimeric chimeric TNF receptor by linking an N-terminal mouse Acrp30 trimerization domain and an MMP-2/9 substrate sequence to the mouse extracellular domain of TNF receptor 2 followed by a C-terminal mouse tetranectin coiled-coil domain (mouse Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn). Results: Here, we show that the Acrp30 trimerization domain inhibited the binding activity of TNFR, possibly by closing the binding site of the trimeric receptor. Cleavage of the substrate sequence by MMP-9, an enzyme highly expressed in inflammatory sites, restored the binding activity of the mouse TNF receptor. We also constructed a recombinant human chimeric TNF receptor (human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn) in which an MMP-13 substrate sequence was used to link the human Acrp and the human TNF receptor 2. Human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn showed reduced binding activity, and MMP-13 digestion recovered its binding activity with TNF-α. Conclusion: Acrp-masked chimeric TNF receptors may be able to be used for inflammatory tissue-selective neutralization of TNF-α to reduce the adverse effects associated with systemic neutralization of TNF-α. ? 2018","adiponectin; chimeric protein; collagenase 3; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; tetranectin; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2; amino terminal sequence; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; chemical modification; controlled study; extracellular matrix; inflammation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein folding; protein purification; protein structure; trimerization"
"Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines: Delirium management in hospitalized older patients","2019","Background: The health problems of hospitalized older patients are complicated, with delirium a common neurocognitive disorder in this population. Delirium has been correlated with the longer periods of hospitalization, higher mortality, and higher rates of institutionalization. However, clinical practice guidelines for delirium management in hospitalized older patients are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for delirium management in hospitalized older patients. Methods: A multidisciplinary task group at a medical center in southern Taiwan was established. Team members reviewed current delirium practice guidelines. A revised set of practice guidelines was developed by constructing foreground questions on key issues and by systematically searching, appraising, and synthesizing the relevant evidence. After a new draft of the guidelines was established, the Delphi method was used to reach a consensus among experts. Finally, the developed guideline document was applied in a geriatric ward of a medical center in order to evaluate applicability. Results: The developed delirium guidelines address 3 issues with 35 recommendations. The panel of clinical and methodological experts recommended that these delirium guidelines be applied in practice. Most nurses in the targeted geriatric ward indicated that the guidelines were feasible and easy to implement. However, several of the procedures were identified as difficult to implement, including “provide a therapeutic environment”, “promote good sleep patterns and sleep hygiene”, and “consider psychotropic medication as a last resort for agitation”. Conclusion/Implications for Practice: The evidence-based delirium management guidelines for hospitalized older patients that were developed in this study integrates the recommendations from the best available evidence and earned a high consensus among clinical experts. Thus, these guidelines are recommended for clinical application. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Risk for cervical herniated intervertebral disc in dentists: A nationwide population-based study","2019","Background: Prolonged static postures (PSPs) may predispose dentists to develop cervical herniated intervertebral disc (C-HIVD); however, there is limited evidence supporting this in the literature thus far. We conducted this study to fit the data gap. Methods: We conducted a retrospective nationwide population-based study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 10,930 dentists, an identical number of age- and sex-matched participants from the general population, and 73,718 other health care providers (HCPs, non-dentists). Comparisons for the risk of developing C-HIVD between dentists and the general population, and between dentists and other HCPs were performed by tracing their medical histories between 2007 and 2011. Results: Dentists had a cumulative incidence rate of 1.1% for C-HIVD during the 5-year follow-up period. Overall, there was no difference of the risk for C-HIVD between dentists and the general population after adjusting for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, liver disease, mental disorders, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, stroke, and renal disease (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-1.6). However, stratified analysis showed that younger dentists (? 34 years) had a trend of higher risk for C-HIVD than members of the younger general population (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.9-4.1). There was no difference found between dentists and other HCPs (AOR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8-1.1). Conclusion: Younger dentists had a trend of higher risk of developing C-HIVD than members of the general population. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; age; Article; cerebrovascular accident; cervical disk hernia; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; dentist; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; health care personnel; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; incidence; kidney disease; liver disease; male; malignant neoplasm; mental disease; population research; retrospective study; Taiwan; body position; intervertebral disk; intervertebral disk degeneration; intervertebral disk hernia; middle aged; occupational disease; pathophysiology; physiology; register; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Age Factors; Dentists; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Diseases; Posture; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Asthma associated with denatonium benzoate in a healthcare worker in Taiwan: A case report","2019","RATIONALE: Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old female nurse rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after denatonium benzoate fit testing. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium). DIAGNOSES: Due to typical symptoms of asthma after exposure to denatonium benzoate aerosol without any other apparent cause, serial pulmonary function tests indicating obstructive lung function and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E, she was diagnosed with allergic asthma. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, β2 agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. OUTCOMES: The patient showed quick responses after treatment with diphenhydramine (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr (inhalation), and prednisolone (oral). Approximately 2 weeks later, she suffered from difficulty breathing and asthmatic symptoms again when she was exposed to polished wax and disinfectant. She was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, β2 agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. The patient was in stable condition with improvement in symptoms during follow-up. LESSONS: There may be potentially important health risks when healthcare workers are exposed to denatonium benzoate. Individuals who have a history of allergy to disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium) should avoid exposure of denatonium benzoate. More advanced research is needed in the future.","antiasthmatic agent; denatonium; omalizumab; quaternary ammonium derivative; adult; asthma; case report; chemically induced; female; human; occupational disease; occupational exposure; Taiwan; Adult; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Asthma; Female; Humans; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Omalizumab; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Taiwan"
"Portable electrochemical sensing system with molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensing for biomolecular detection","2019","This paper presents a low-cost, flexible, and portable electrochemical sensing platform for biomedical in vitro diagnostic applications. This proposed system automatically measures the redox current, which depends on the concentration of the target molecule in the analyte solution; it can estimate the concentration of analytes and finds applications in biomedical sensing. The target molecule is imprinted into poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol), which is coated on the surface of a screen-printed electrode. Melatonin is used as the target molecule for this system. The level of melatonin secreted in the urine might be associated with breast cancer risks. The measurement results of this system were compared with those of a commercial analyzer and were found to be very similar. This system can be operated independently and can be connected to a laptop for viewing the redox reaction by using the LabVIEW program, which provides a convenient graphical user interface for real-time monitoring and recording the information of electrochemical reactions. Compared with the results of the enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay in the urine sample measurement, those of the proposed system has moderate accuracy for urinary melatonin detection. ? 2019, Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering.

"Cancer immunotherapy: Silencing intracellular negative immune regulators of dendritic cells","2019","Dendritic cells (DCs) are capable of activating adaptive immune responses, or inducing immune suppression or tolerance. In the tumor microenvironment, the function of DCs is polarized into immune suppression that attenuates the effect of T cells, promoting differentiation of regulatory T cells and supporting tumor progression. Therefore, blocking negative immune regulators in DCs is considered a strategy of cancer immunotherapy. Antibodies can target molecules on the cell surface, but not intracellular molecules of DCs. The delivery of short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) should be a strategy to silence specific intracellular targets in DCs. This review provides an overview of the known negative immune regulators of DCs. Moreover, a combination of shRNA/siRNA and DC vaccines, DNA vaccines in animal models, and clinical trials are also discussed. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Leverage and employee compensation – the perspective of human capital","2019","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically test the predictions in Titman (1984) and Berk et al. (2010) which indicate that firms with higher leverage will pay chief executive officer (CEO) and employee more. In addition, this paper examines whether financial distressed firms utilize leverage as a bargaining tool to reduce labor costs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts ordinary least squares regression analysis to investigate: CEO compensation which represents critical employees and lower-level employee compensation which represents less critical employees. Empirical data consist of US publicly held companies during the period between 2006 and 2013. Findings: This paper finds that firms with higher levels of leverage tend to compensate employees for their human capital risk and that financially distressed firms consider leverage a bargaining tool by which to depress labor costs, which leads to lower employee compensation as compared to that of financially healthy firms. Research limitations/implications: This paper highlights the importance of keeping balance between human capital and labor costs. In the case that human capital risk might not be fully compensated by firms facing financial distress, vicious cycle could occur because a failure of considering human capital might invite unrecoverable consequence. This could be done in future research. Originality/value: This paper has three contributions. First, this paper supports the Titman (1984) and Berk et al. (2010) by empirically documenting that high-leveraged firms compensate their employees for potential human capital risk. Second, this paper adds to the literature by empirically providing that human capital risk might not be fully compensated if the firms are facing financial distress. Finally, this paper contributes to the authorities by showing that employees’ interests may be sacrificed if the firm is under financial distress. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",""
"An integrated microfluidic system with field-effect-transistor sensor arrays for detecting multiple cardiovascular biomarkers from clinical samples","2019","Certain blood-borne biomarkers offer a potent methodology for understanding the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) with clinicians generally advocating the use of multiple biomarkers for proper risk assessment of CVDs. Herein four such CVDs biomarkers- C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and fibrinogen- were rapidly (5 min) analyzed from clinical samples (~ 4 ?L) on an integrated microfluidic platform equipped with 1) immobilized highly specific aptamer probes and 2) field-effect transistor (FET)-based sensor arrays. The calibration curve from the FET sensor arrays showed good agreement in the physiological concentration ranges for CRP (0.1–50 mg/L), NT-proBNP (50–10,000 pg/mL), cTnI (1–10,000 pg/mL), and fibrinogen (0.1–5 mg/mL). The developed prototype of this fully automated portable device requires minimal reagent and sample inputs and consequently shows great promise for next-generation point-of-care devices assaying multiple CVDs biomarkers in clinical samples. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Cardiology; Diseases; Microfluidics; Risk assessment; Aptamers; B-type natriuretic peptide; C-reactive proteins; Cardio-vascular disease; Field effect transistor sensors; Integrated microfluidic systems; Integrated microfluidics; Physiological concentrations; Field effect transistors; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; fibrinogen; troponin I; aptamer; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; fibrinogen; peptide fragment; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); troponin I; analytic method; Article; automation; equipment design; field effect transistor sensor array; microfluidics; molecular probe; point of care testing; process optimization; protein analysis; blood; cardiovascular disease; chemistry; devices; evaluation study; genetic procedures; human; lab on a chip; limit of detection; point of care system; transistor; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; C-Reactive Protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; Equipment Design; Fibrinogen; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Limit of Detection; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; Point-of-Care Systems; Transistors, Electronic; Troponin I"
"Dichotomy of the function of DDR1 in cells and disease progression","2019","Discoidin domain receptors DDR1 and DDR2 are collagen receptor tyrosine kinases that have many roles in tissue development and disease progression. Under physiological conditions, DDR1 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and functions to maintain cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis. A switch in expression from DDR1 to DDR2 occurs during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, opposite effects of DDR1 are reported to be involved in the progression of cancer and fibrotic diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that DDR1 is involved in pro-metastasis and pro-survival signals. This review summarizes the roles of DDR1 in epithelial cell differentiation, cell migration, cancer progression and tissues fibrosis and highlights how the dichotomous functions of DDR1 may relevant to different cell types and statues. Elucidation of the underlying mechanism of the dichotomous functions of DDR1 will help to develop DDR1 as a therapeutic target. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ADAM10 endopeptidase; beta1 integrin; discoidin domain receptor 1; discoidin domain receptor 2; matrix metalloproteinase 14; nerve cell adhesion molecule; phosphoprotein DARPP 32; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; STAT1 protein; STAT3 protein; uvomorulin; Wnt5a protein; atherosclerosis; autophosphorylation; cancer growth; cell differentiation; cell invasion; cell migration; conformational transition; disease exacerbation; enzyme structure; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelium cell; kidney fibrosis; lung fibrosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; Review"

"Validation of Alcohol Flushing Questionnaire to Identify ALDH2 Status in a Case–Control Study of Head and Neck Cancer","2019","Background: Carriers of the ALDH2*2 allele have impaired alcohol metabolism and are more susceptible to the development of alcohol-related cancers, including head and neck cancer (HNC). Screening for ALDH2*2 allele may identify high-risk individuals for alcohol health education. Although genotyping of ALDH2 is the most accurate way to identify ALDH2 deficiency, it may not be practical due to the cost and requirement for genotyping service. Methods: This study evaluated the accuracy of the alcohol flushing questionnaire to identify ALDH2 deficiency in a case–control study of HNC conducted in Taiwan using data collected from 904 patients with HNC and 1,078 controls. Results: Overall, alcohol flushing questionnaire had a high sensitivity (89%) of identifying ALDH2*2 carriers among the control subjects and a good sensitivity (79%) among the patients with HNC. The sensitivity of the alcohol flushing questionnaire in identifying ALDH2*2 carriers was affected by alcohol use, with a lower sensitivity among individuals who consumed alcohol, particularly among current regular (drinking alcohol once per week or more) alcohol drinkers. Conclusions: The current validation study showed that the alcohol flushing questionnaire may be a reasonable method to identify ALDH2-deficient individuals. However, current regular users of alcohol who reported no alcohol flushing may need to undergo genotyping of ALDH2 for a more accurate assessment of the ALDH2 status. ? 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism","adult; age; alcohol consumption; alcohol flushing questionnaire; aldh2 gene; cancer risk; case control study; cigarette smoking; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; education; female; gene; head and neck cancer; heterozygote; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; questionnaire; Review; sensitivity and sensibility; Taiwan; validation study"

"Multimodal exercise ameliorates exercise responses and body composition in head and neck cancer patients receiving chemotherapy","2019","Background: Studies have found that many chemotherapy drugs will produce multiple side effects and complications in cancer patients, especially in the case of the cardiovascular disease. This study was intended to investigate whether the exercise training intervention could improve the body composition and exercise responses of patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer who are receiving chemotherapy. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial. Eighty-four H&N patients were assigned to sedentary group or exercise group. The data were collected pretraining and posttraining, where the body composition, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), rate-pressure product (RPP), and exercise capacity were measured. Results: Our data reported that body weight and body mass index were decreased after 8?weeks of chemotherapy in the sedentary group but not in the exercise group. The decreased visceral fat and the increased skeletal muscle rate had been found in the exercise group after 8?weeks of training. In addition, in the exercise group, the HR, HR recovery, BP, BP recovery, RPP, and minutes walking distance were better than the sedentary group. Results from this study suggested exercise training significantly improved exercise responses and body composition. Conclusion: These findings suggested that exercise can help to promote cardiopulmonary fitness and exercise capacity for H&N cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","aldesleukin; carboplatin; cetuximab; cisplatin; gemcitabine; medroxyprogesterone; UFT; adult; Article; blood pressure; body composition; body mass; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; female; head and neck cancer; heart rate; human; intra-abdominal fat; male; middle aged; priority journal; skeletal muscle; body composition; cardiorespiratory fitness; exercise; head and neck tumor; kinesiotherapy; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; Blood Pressure; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal"
"Risk of diabetes mellitus in physicians: A nationwide study in Taiwan","2019","Background: The heavy workload of physicians in Taiwan may contribute to poor lifestyles and increased risk for diabetes mellitus (DM). We conducted this study to determine the risk for DM among physicians in Taiwan. Methods: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 28,440 physicians and 56,880 comparisons (general population) matched at a ratio of 1:2 by age and sex. Participants who had been diagnosed with DM before 2007 were excluded. We compared the risk for DM between physicians and comparisons by following up since 2007 to 2013. Comparisons among physician subgroups were also performed. Results: After adjustment for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and polycystic ovary syndrome, physicians had a lower risk for DM than the comparisons (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.82). In comparisons among physicians, emergency physicians (AOR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.44-3.40) and surgeons (AOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.05-1.52) had a higher risk for DM than other specialists. Conclusions: This study found that physicians have a lower risk for DM than the general population and emergency physicians and surgeons have a higher risk for DM than other specialists. Thus, more attention should be paid to the occupational health of these doctors. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; diabetes mellitus; factual database; female; human; male; middle aged; physician; public health; risk assessment; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Physicians; Risk Assessment; Taiwan"
"Tobacco use and HIV symptom severity in Chinese people living with HIV","2020","Exposure to nicotine among people living with HIV (PLWH) may impact physical health as indicated by experienced symptoms. Yet, the empirical evidence documenting the relations between tobacco use and symptom experiences among PLWH remains limited. This study aims to assess the relationships between tobacco use and HIV symptoms through a cross-sectional survey conducted in Beijing and Shanghai. The WHO ASSIST screening test was used for frequency of tobacco use. Sixty-four items from the revised signs and symptoms checklist for persons with HIV disease (SSC-HIVrev) were used. “Total number of symptoms” was created by summing all the binary coded and “Maximal symptom severity” was created by taking the maximal severity level across all symptoms for each participant. After controlling for confounding variables, tobacco use was not associated with the total number of symptom, yet was associated with the maximal symptom severity. This study documents the link between tobacco use and experienced symptoms among PLWH by demonstrating that higher frequency of tobacco use is associated with greater odds of reporting more severe symptoms. Smoking cessation strategies should be integrated into symptom management interventions for PLWH to optimize their effectiveness. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Mitochondrial protection by simvastatin against angiotensin II-mediated heart failure","2019","Background and Purpose: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the progression of cardiovascular diseases including heart failure. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which inhibit ROS synthesis, show cardioprotective effects in chronic heart failure. However, the beneficial role of statins in mitochondrial protection in heart failure remains unclear. Experimental Approach: Rats were treated with angiotensin II (1.5?mg·kg?1·day?1) or co-administered simvastatin (oral, 10?mg·kg?1) for 14?days; and then administration was stopped for the following 14?days. Cardiac structure/function was examined by wheat germ agglutinin staining and echocardiography. Mitochondrial morphology and the numbers of lipid droplets, lysosomes, autophagosomes, and mitophagosomes were determined by transmission electron microscopy. Human cardiomyocytes were stimulated, and intracellular ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) changes were measured by flow cytometry and JC-1 staining, respectively. Autophagy and mitophagy-related and mitochondria-regulated apoptotic proteins were identified by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Key Results: Simvastatin significantly reduced ROS production and attenuated the disruption of ΔΨm. Simvastatin induced the accumulation of lipid droplets to provide energy for maintaining mitochondrial function, promoted autophagy and mitophagy, and inhibited mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These findings suggest that mitochondrial protection mediated by simvastatin plays a therapeutic role in heart failure prevention by modulating antioxidant status and promoting energy supplies for autophagy and mitophagy to inhibit mitochondrial damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Conclusion and Implications: Mitochondria play a key role in mediating heart failure progression. Simvastatin attenuated heart failure, induced by angiotensin II, via mitochondrial protection and might provide a new therapy to prevent heart failure. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Opioid agonist treatment reduces losses in quality of life and quality-adjusted life expectancy in heroin users: Evidence from real world data","2019","Background: This study estimated the long-term changes of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) in quality of life (QOL) and quantified the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) from the loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in heroin users. Methods: A total of 1283 heroin users stratified by OAT were linked to the National Mortality Registry for 8 years (2006–2014) to obtain survival functions, which were extrapolated to lifetime by applying a rolling extrapolation algorithm to survival ratio between the sub-cohorts and age- and sex-matched referents simulated from vital statistics of Taiwan. We performed cross-sectional measurement of EQ-5D on 349 participants, including those with a valid state of OAT or non-OAT plus newly recruited consecutive patients, during 2015–2017 for utility values, while the QOL of referents were abstracted from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. The QALE was calculated by summing the products of the mean QOL and survival rate throughout life. The QALE difference between the cohort and corresponding referents was the loss-of-QALE. Results: QOL of the OAT group was significantly better than that of the non-OAT group in every domain of the EQ-5D, which was quantified to be 0.23 for utility after controlling for other variables. After extrapolation to 70 years, the estimated QALE and loss-of-QALE were 17.8 and 18.2 QALY for OAT subjects, respectively, while those of the non-OAT group were 9.2 and 27.9 QALY. Conclusions: Receiving OAT could reduce QALE lost by 9.7 QALYs compared with non-OAT after accounting for QOL differences along time and different age and sex distributions. ? 2019","opiate agonist; adult; age distribution; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; follow up; health care utilization; heroin dependence; human; life expectancy; long term care; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; sex ratio; survival analysis; survival rate; Taiwan"
"Sexual network and detection of anogenital human papillomavirus in a community cohort of men who have sex with men in Taiwan","2019","Objectives We examined the association between anogenital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and sexual networks in men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods A total of 253 MSM, 20 years of age and older, were recruited from the community in Southern Taiwan in 2015–2016. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, MSM were screened for HPV to identify 37 HPV genotypes. At the six-month follow-up, MSM were asked to fill out an egocentric network assessment and to report the last five persons with whom they had sex regarding the characteristics of sexual behavior with each network member. Results A total of 182 participants (71.9%) returned for the follow-up and one third had at least one HPV type detected. A higher level of bridging network position calculated by the level of constraints in the network was significantly less likely to have HPV detection at the anal site. A high level of concurrency was associated with penile HPV detection (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.01–9.86). Conclusions Identifying network-related characteristics can advance our understanding of high-risk populations and for prioritizing HPV vaccine recommendations. ? 2019 Strong et al.

"Post-chemoradiotherapy FDG PET with qualitative interpretation criteria for outcome stratification in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma","2019","Objectives Post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) FDG PET is a useful prognosticator of esophageal cancer. However, debate on the diverse criteria of previous publications preclude worldwide multicenter comparisons, and even a universal practice guide. We aimed to validate a simple qualitative interpretation criterion of post-CRT FDG PET for outcome stratification and compare it with other criteria. Methods The post-CRT FDG PET of 114 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were independently interpreted using a qualitative 4-point scale (Qual 4PS ) that identified focal esophageal FDG uptake greater than liver uptake as residual tumor. Cohen’s κ coefficient (κ) was used to measure interobserver agreement of Qual 4PS . The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used for survival analysis. Other criteria included a different qualitative approach (Qual BK ), maximal standardized uptake values (SUV max3.4 , SUV max2.5 ), relative change of SUV max between pre- and post-CRT FDG PET (ΔSUV max ), mean standardized uptake values (SUV mean ), metabolic volume (MV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Results Overall interobserver agreement on the Qual 4PS criterion was excellent (κ: 0.95). Except the Qual BK , SUV max2.5 , and TLG, all the other criteria were significant predictors for overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis showed only Qual 4PS (HR: 15.41; P = 0.005) and AJCC stage (HR: 2.47; P = 0.007) were significant independent variables. The 2-year OS rates of Qual 4PS (–) patients undergoing CRT alone (68.4%) and patients undergoing trimodality therapy (62.5%) were not significant different, but the 2-year OS rates of Qual 4PS (+) patients undergoing CRT alone (10.0%) were significantly lower than in patients undergoing trimodality therapy (42.1%). Conclusions The Qual 4PS criterion is reproducible for assessing the response of ESCC to CRT, and valuable for predicting survival. It may add value to response-adapted treatment for ESCC patients, and help to decide whether surgery is warranted after CRT. ? 2019 Huang et al.

"Real-world anti-viral treatment decisions among chronic hepatitis C patients in Taiwan: The INITIATE study","2019","Background/Purpose: While direct-acting antiviral regimens have been approved for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients in Taiwan, reimbursement is limited to certain populations. Thus, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) remains the standard of care for many patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the percentage of CHC patients who were recommended and willing to receive PEG-IFN/RBV, and to identify reasons why patients were not recommended or unwilling to receive treatment. Methods: 822 Taiwanese CHC patients were enrolled from May–August 2016 in this cross-sectional study. PEG-IFN/RBV recommendation and patient willingness to receive treatment were evaluated through surveys. Patient characteristics associated with treatment recommendation and willingness were assessed. Results: 311 (37.8%) patients were recommended PEG-IFN/RBV while 102 (12.4%) were willing to follow treatment recommendation. Rates of recommendation and willingness were lower in treatment-experienced, hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (GT1) and cirrhotic patients, and those treated in Northern Taiwan. Multivariate analyses found factors such as prior treatment experience, GT1, cirrhosis and low hemoglobin levels to be associated with lower recommendation rates while advanced age, GT1 and low baseline viral loads were associated with lower willingness rates. Physicians' top reasons for not recommending PEG-IFN/RBV included the wish to wait for better treatment options (60.3%), prior treatment failure (21.3%) and patients’ advanced age (20.9%). Patients were unwilling to receive treatment mainly due to concerns about side effects (91.4%), the wish to wait for better treatment options (71.3%) and inconvenience (25.4%). Conclusion: A minority of Taiwanese CHC patients were recommended PEG-IFN/RBV, of which few were willing to receive treatment. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","hemoglobin; peginterferon; ribavirin; virus RNA; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis C; comorbidity; compensated liver cirrhosis; cross-sectional study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; groups by age; hemoglobin blood level; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; Hepatitis C virus genotype 3; Hepatitis C virus genotype 6; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1a; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; human; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; middle aged; multicenter study; nonhuman; observational study; patient-reported outcome; platelet count; prospective study; sex difference; Taiwan; treatment failure; treatment response; virus load; chronic hepatitis C; combination drug therapy; drug effect; genotype; Hepacivirus; multivariate analysis; physiology; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Ribavirin; Taiwan; Treatment Failure; Viral Load"
"Nonmedical prescription drug use of analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics in Taiwan: Results from the 2014 National Survey of Substance Use","2019","Nonmedical prescription drug use (NMPDU)has become a major public health issue but little is known in Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of NMPDU in Taiwan. Participants from the 2014 national survey of 17,837 individuals, aged 12 to 64 year, completed anonymously a computer-assisted self-interview. Past-year prescription drug use was divided into medical use only (MUO)and nonmedical use (NMU), defined as using the drug without a prescription, or more frequently, or in larger doses than prescribed. Problematic alcohol use was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), problematic drug use using the 20-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST), and depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Study-Depression (CES-D). The prevalence of past-year NMU was 3.02% for analgesics, 0.71% for sedatives/hypnotics, and 3.66% for either drug, with a very small overlap of NMU between analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics (0.07%). When individuals with NMU were compared to those without NMU (Non-NMU)and those with MUO, respectively, some correlates consistently identified, including young adulthood, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and greater AUDIT's scores for analgesics, as well as hard drug use and greater DAST's scores for sedatives/hypnotics. NMU was associated with greater CES-D's scores for both analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics when compared to Non-NMU but not to MUO. Robust correlates of NMPDU could offer implications for development of prevention strategies of NMPDU. ? 2019","alprazolam; analgesic agent; brotizolam; clonazepam; codeine phosphate; estazolam; fludiazepam; guaifenesin; hypnotic sedative agent; ipratropium bromide; lorazepam; midazolam maleate; morphine; paracetamol plus tramadol; tiotropium bromide; tramadol; triazolam; zaleplon; zolpidem tartrate; adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; child; controlled study; depression; drinking behavior; drug use; Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence; female; human; major clinical study; male; prescription drug misuse; prevalence; priority journal; screening test; smoking; substance use; Taiwan"
"Stress and other factors associated with colorectal cancer outpatients with temporary colostomies","2019","This study investigated stress and other factors associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) outpatients with temporary colostomies in Taiwan. Temporary colostomies have been incorporated as a defecation alternative to maintain physical function and are accompanied by chemotherapy/radiotherapy in CRC patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted, and a convenience sampling approach was adopted to recruit 110 discharged CRC patients with temporary colostomies from a medical centre in southern Taiwan. The mean score of the Stress of Colostomy Patients Scale was 66.49 (out of 120). Demographic attributes were found to have an impact on different stress types. Stress of changes in familial and social interaction was affected by age, employment status, educational level and colostomy assistant caregiver. The stress of colostomy care was impacted by the factor of employment status, and the stress of changes of self-concept was impacted by the factors of educational level and self-perception of disease. The results provide post-operative information regarding stress and stress types among CRC patients with temporary colostomies, serve as a reference for clinical assessment, practice and care, and generate up-to-date knowledge and comprehension of learning how to live with a temporary colostomy. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Oligonol Alleviates Sarcopenia by Regulation of Signaling Pathways Involved in Protein Turnover and Mitochondrial Quality","2019","Scope: Oligonol has been shown to moderate mitochondrial biogenesis, protein synthesis, and protein degradation in diabetic mice in a previous study. It is therefore hypothesized that oligonol alleviated sarcopenia by regulating pathways involved in protein turnover and mitochondrial quality. Methods and results: The 32-week-old senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice are fed with chow diet containing 200 mg kg ?1 oligonol for 8 weeks. Oligonol supplementation increased skeletal muscle mass, cross-sectional areas, and grip strength in SAMP8 mice. Oligonol increased phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR/p70sk6, inhibited nuclear localization of FoxO3a and NFκB, and decreased transcription of MuRF-1 and MAFbx in skeletal muscle of SAMP8 mice. Downregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis genes (PGC-1α and Tfam) and mitochondrial fusion genes (Mfn2 and Opa1), loss of PINK1, overexpression of Atg13, LC3-II, and p62, and abundant accumulation of autophagosomes and lysosomes in skeletal muscle of SAMP8 mice are limited by oligonol. Furthermore, oligonol reduced expression of released cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-9 in skeletal muscle of SAMP8 mice. Conclusion: Regulating pathways involved in protein synthesis and degradation, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion/fission, autophagy, and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by oligonol contribute to positive protein turnover and mitochondrial quality, thus increasing muscle mass and strength in SAMP8 mice. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Relationships between parent-reported parenting, child-perceived parenting, and children’s mental health in Taiwanese children","2019","The current study examines the relationship between parents’ and children’s reports of parenting and their effects on children’s mental health symptoms. Six hundred and sixty-six parent-child dyads in Taiwan participated in this study. The parents and the children filled out the parenting questionnaires, and the children also reported their general mental health. The results demonstrated that parental-reported and child-perceived parenting were positively correlated, but parents tended to report lower scores on authoritarian parenting and higher scores on Chinese parenting than did their children. There were also significant gender differences: The mothers reported higher authoritative parenting than did the fathers; and the boys perceived higher authoritarian and Chinese-culture specific parenting than did the girls. Moreover, the Chinese parenting had a negative effect on children’s mental health outcomes. Finally, our results showed that children’s perception of parenting had a stronger effect on children’s mental health symptoms than did parental reports on parenting, urging future research to include the children’s report when investigating the effects of parenting on children’s mental health outcomes. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Factors associated with low health literacy among community-dwelling women in Taiwan","2019","The present study investigated factors associated with health literacy in community-dwelling Taiwanese women, particularly focusing on those associated with prevalent unhealthy behaviors. This cross-sectional study recruited 353 community-dwelling women aged 39–89?years from February to October 2015 in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Variables investigated included physical activity, community activity, tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, and betel-nut chewing. Degree of health literacy was evaluated using the Chinese-language version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire. Most respondents had inadequate (17.6%), or problematic (49.3%), general health literacy. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that low educational attainment was closely associated with inadequate or problematic general health literacy. Women who did not engage in regular physical activity or direct community activity were more likely to have inadequate and problematic general health literacy, respectively. Selected unhealthy behaviors (tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, betel-nut chewing) were not associated with health literacy. Low health literacy was prevalent among participants. Lower educational attainment and a lack of physical or community activity were associated with low health literacy. Health literacy should be considered during the process of delivering health information, and health education programs must enhance health literacy tailored to address individuals’ lifestyles. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; aged; alcohol consumption; areca nut; article; Chinese (language); community dwelling person; cross-sectional study; female; health literacy; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; mastication; medical information; mental capacity; physical activity; public health; questionnaire; rural area; Taiwanese; tobacco use"
"Unusual Supernumerary Teeth and Treatment Outcomes Analyzed for Developing Improved Diagnosis and Management Plans","2019","Purpose: Supernumerary teeth (SNTs) are teeth or tooth-like structures that have erupted or might erupt in addition to the 20 primary or 32 permanent teeth. The simultaneous presentation of multiple SNTs, syndrome-related multiple SNTs, SNTs inside the maxillary sinus and treatment outcomes were analyzed to develop improved diagnosis and management plans. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of National Cheng Kung University Hospital patients who had undergone surgical intervention with general anesthesia between February 2014 and September 2018; analyzed panoramic radiographs and cone beam computed tomography scans of their multiple SNTs; and used descriptive statistics to discuss treatments and relative complications, especially of unusual SNTs. Results: The records of 165 patients (127 male and 38 female patients; mean age, 12.4 years) with 241 SNTs (120 patients had 1 SNT, 35 had 2 SNTs, 3 had 3 SNTs, 2 had 4 SNTs, 2 had 5 SNTs, 2 had 6 SNTs, and 1 had 12 SNTs) were reviewed. There were 185 SNTs in the maxilla and 56 in the mandible; 153 were mesiodens and 115 were inverted; 142 were asymptomatic and 137 were conical; and 228 were fully impacted and 210 were partial roots. Two patients had SNTs inside the maxillary sinus, and one had 5 SNTs and Marfan syndrome. Two patients had postoperative lip or chin paresthesia, and two had postoperative sinusitis. Conclusions: Patient demographic variables provided useful epidemiologic information. We recommend panoramic radiographs or cone beam computed tomography for managing patients with possible multiple SNTs and for extracting SNTs. ? 2018 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; asymptomatic disease; child; chin; cone beam computed tomography; female; human; lip; major clinical study; male; mandible; Marfan syndrome; maxilla; maxillary sinus; panoramic radiography; paresthesia; permanent tooth; postoperative complication; retrospective study; sinusitis; supernumerary tooth; treatment outcome; treatment planning"
"TARBP2-enhanced resistance during tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer","2019","Tamoxifen is the most widely used hormone therapy in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% of all breast cancers. Although patients who receive tamoxifen therapy benefit with respect to an improved overall prognosis, resistance and cancer recurrence still occur and remain important clinical challenges. A recent study identified TAR (HIV-1) RNA binding protein 2 (TARBP2) as an oncogene that promotes breast cancer metastasis. In this study, we showed that TARBP2 is overexpressed in hormone therapy-resistant cells and breast cancer tissues, where it enhances tamoxifen resistance. Tamoxifen-induced TARBP2 expression results in the desensitization of ER+ breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, tamoxifen post-transcriptionally stabilizes TARBP2 protein through the downregulation of Merlin, a TARBP2-interacting protein known to enhance its proteasomal degradation. Tamoxifen-induced TARBP2 further stabilizes SOX2 protein to enhance desensitization of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen, while similar to TARBP2, its induction in cancer cells was also observed in metastatic tumor cells. Our results indicate that the TARBP2-SOX2 pathway is upregulated by tamoxifen-mediated Merlin downregulation, which subsequently induces tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Plasma proteome plus site-specific N-glycoprofiling for hepatobiliary carcinomas","2019","Hepatobiliary cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Appropriate markers for early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression, and prediction of postsurgical outcome are still lacking. As the majority of circulating N-glycoproteins are originated from the hepatobiliary system, we sought to explore new markers by assessing the dynamics of N-glycoproteome in plasma samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or combined HCC and CCA (cHCC-CCA). Using a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic approach, we found that 57 of 5358 identified plasma proteins were differentially expressed in hepatobiliary cancers. The levels of four essential proteins, including complement C3 and apolipoprotein C-III in HCC, galectin-3-binding protein in CCA, and 72 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase in cHCC-CCA, were highly correlated with tumor stage, tumor grade, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. Postproteomic site-specific N-glycan analyses showed that human complement C3 bears high-mannose and hybrid glycoforms rather than complex glycoforms at Asn85. The abundance of complement C3 with mannose-5 or mannose-6 glycoform at Asn85 was associated with HCC tumor grade. Furthermore, stepwise Cox regression analyses revealed that HCC patients with a hybrid glycoform at Asn85 of complement C3 had a lower postsurgery tumor recurrence rate or mortality rate than those with a low amount of complement C3 protein. In conclusion, our data show that particular plasma N-glycoproteins with specific N-glycan compositions could be potential noninvasive markers to evaluate oncological status and prognosis of hepatobiliary cancers. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Rasch analysis of the 9-item shared decision making questionnaire in women with breast cancer","2019","Background Shared decision making (SDM) is a best practice to help patients make optimal decisions by a process of healthcare, especially for women diagnosed with breast cancer and having heavy burden in long-term treatments. To promote successful SDM, it is crucial to assess the level of perceived involvement in SDM in women with breast cancer. Objective The aims of this study were to apply Rasch analysis to examine the construct validity and person reliability of the 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) in women with breast cancer. Methods The construct validity of SDM-Q-9 was confirmed when the items fit the Rasch model's assumptions of unidimensionality: (1) infit and outfit mean square ranged from 0.6 to 1.4; (2) the unexplained variance of the first dimension of the principal component analysis was less than 20%. Person reliability was calculated. Results A total of 212 participants were recruited in this study. Item 1 did not fit the model's assumptions and was deleted. The unidimensionality of the remaining 8 items (SDM-Q-8) was supported with good item fit (infit and outfit mean square ranging from 0.6 to 1.3) and very low unexplained variance of the first dimension (5.3%) of the principal component analysis. The person reliability of the SDM-Q-8 was 0.90. Conclusions The SDM-Q-8 was unidimensional and had good person reliability in women with breast cancer. Implications for Practice The SDM-Q-8 has shown its potential for assessing the level of perceived involvement in SDM in women with breast cancer for both research and clinical purposes. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Signaling pathway of globo-series glycosphingolipids and β1,3-galactosyltransferase V (β3GalT5) in breast cancer","2019","The globo-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs) SSEA3, SSEA4, an Globo-H specifically expressed on cancer cells are found to correlat with tumor progression and metastasis, but the functional role of these GSLs and the key enzyme β1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3GalT5) that converts Gb4 to SSEA3 remain largely unclear. Her we show that the expression of β3GalT5 significantly correlates wit tumor progression and poor survival in patients, and the globo series GSLs in breast cancer cells form a complex in membrane lipi raft with caveolin-1 (CAV1) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) whic then interact with AKT and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP) respectively. Knockdown of β3GalT5 disrupts the complex and in duces apoptosis through dissociation of RIP from the complex t interact with the Fas death domain (FADD) and trigger the Fas dependent pathway. This finding provides a link between SSEA3 SSEA4/Globo-H and the FAK/CAV1/AKT/RIP complex in tumor pro gression and apoptosis and suggests a direction for the treatment o breast cancer, as demonstrated by the combined use of antibodie against Globo-H and SSEA4. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Stem cells as a potential therapy for diabetes mellitus: A call-to-action in Latin America","2019","Latin America is a fast-growing region that currently faces unique challenges in the treatment of all forms of diabetes mellitus. The burden of this disease will be even greater in the coming years due, in part, to the large proportion of young adults living in urban areas and engaging in unhealthy lifestyles. Unfortunately, the national health systems in Latin-American countries are unprepared and urgently need to reorganize their health care services to achieve diabetic therapeutic goals. Stem cell research is attracting increasing attention as a promising and fast-growing field in Latin America. As future healthcare systems will include the development of regenerative medicine through stem cell research, Latin America is urged to issue a call-to-action on stem cell research. Increased efforts are required in studies focused on stem cells for the treatment of diabetes. In this review, we aim to inform physicians, researchers, patients and funding sources about the advances in stem cell research for possible future applications in diabetes mellitus. Emerging studies are demonstrating the potential of stem cells for β cell differentiation and pancreatic regeneration. The major economic burden implicated in patients with diabetes complications suggests that stem cell research may relieve diabetic complications. Closer attention should be paid to stem cell research in the future as an alternative treatment for diabetes mellitus. ? 2019 The Author(s).","alpha glucosidase inhibitor; bromocriptine; chemokine receptor CXCR4; colesevelam; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; endoglin; epidermal growth factor; fibroblast growth factor 10; glitazone derivative; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta; hepatocyte nuclear factor 6; insulin; LIM homeodomain protein; meglitinide; metformin; neurogenic differentiation factor; neurogenin 3; retinoic acid; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea derivative; transcription factor Nkx2.2; transcription factor Nkx6.1; transcription factor PAX4; transcription factor PAX6; transcription factor PDX 1; transcription factor Sox17; transcription factor Sox9; transforming growth factor beta; unindexed drug; cell differentiation; cost effectiveness analysis; critical limb ischemia; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic retinopathy; disability-adjusted life year; economic aspect; embryonic stem cell; epidemiological data; health care cost; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; nonhuman; pancreas; pancreas cell; priority journal; protein expression; Review; South and Central America; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; tissue regeneration"
"The influence of partner involvement in the decision-making process on body image and decision regret among women receiving breast reconstruction","2019","Purpose: This study examines the influence of partner involvement in decision-making for breast reconstruction (BR) on women’s body image and post-BR decision regret. Methods: A cross-sectional and correlational approach was used in a convenience sample of 105 women in Taiwan who had breast cancer (BC) whose partners were involved in decision-making for BR. A structured questionnaire including the Involvement in the Breast Reconstruction Decision-Making Process Scale, the Body Image Scale, and the Decision Regret Scale was administered. Pearson’s r and path analysis were used to examine the relationships among the dyadic BR decision-making process, women’s body image, and decision regret. Results: The greater the amount of medical information women had, the better their body image and the less decision regret they experienced. Moreover, partner involvement was not related to women’s body image, though it was inversely related to women’s decision regret. The final path model showed that the amount of medical information women obtained was directly related to body image and decision regret, while body image also directly influenced decision regret. Overall, the amount of medical information women obtained and their body image explained 45% of the variance in decision regret. Conclusions: Medical teams should provide female BC patients with complete medical information, and through partner involvement, women can be supported to make an appropriate decision regarding BR to achieve optimal levels of body image and lower levels of decision regret. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; body image; breast cancer; breast reconstruction; convenience sample; correlation coefficient; correlational study; cross-sectional study; decision making; female; human; human relation; major clinical study; medical information; middle aged; path analysis; priority journal; rating scale; structured questionnaire; Taiwan; body image; breast reconstruction; breast tumor; emotion; male; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; sexuality; Adult; Body Image; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mammaplasty; Middle Aged; Sexual Partners; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Association between polymorphisms of OCT1 and metabolic response to metformin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome","2019","Insulin-sensitizer treatment with metformin is widely used in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the treatment effectiveness shows individual differences in PCOS patients. Organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2 have been reported to mediate metformin transport in the liver and kidney, respectively. In this study, we investigated the association between the polymorphisms of OCT1 and OCT2 and the treatment effectiveness of metformin in PCOS patients. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OCT1 (rs683369 and rs628031) and OCT2 (rs316019) were analyzed in 87 PCOS and 113 control women. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), which represented metformin treatment response, were conducted at the start of treatment and after six-month treatment. The results demonstrated that the SNP frequencies of OCT1 and OCT2 were not associated with PCOS pathophysiology, and that the polymorphisms of OCT1 and OCT2 were not associated with the OGTT parameters at baseline. However, PCOS patients with the G allele of OCT1 rs683369 and/or with the A allele of OCT1 rs628031 had increased insulin sensitivity compared to those with wild-type genotype after receiving metformin treatment. Moreover, the interactions of metformin*SNP were significant in both OCT1 rs683369 (p < 0.001) and rs628031 (p = 0.001) during the treatment period. Taken together, genetic polymorphisms of OCT1 contributed to different metformin treatment responses, and further study is needed to establish personalized treatment programs using a pharmacogenomic algorithm approach in PCOS patients. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Implantable microneedles with an immune-boosting function for effective intradermal influenza vaccination","2019","This study details effective influenza vaccination via sustained intradermal (ID) release of vaccines using implantable and patch-free chitosan microneedles (MNs). The microneedle (MN) patch is composed of vaccine-loaded chitosan MNs with a dissolvable supporting array that gives extra length for complete insertion of MNs and is dissolved within the skin during insertion. Chitosan MNs can be quickly and entirely implanted into the dermis to function as a depot and an immune-boosting agent for the extended release of vaccines and simultaneous activation of the immune system. We found the influenza virus-specific antibody levels induced by chitosan MN vaccination were significantly higher than those elicited by intramuscular (IM) immunization with influenza vaccine alone. The MN induced immune-enhancing effect was obvious 4 week after the vaccination and lasted for at least 16 weeks. Most importantly, MN-immunized mice were completely protected from H1N1 viral challenge without major weight loss, whereas mice receiving IM injection at the same dose had a mortality rate of 60% and experienced notable weight loss after challenge. Our results suggest that the chitosan MNs cannot only be a viable tool for precise ID vaccine delivery but also exert strong adjuvanticity to enhance vaccine potency and induce protective immunity against influenza virus infections. Statement of Significance: There is an urgent need for generating a new vaccination strategy to address the threat of global pandemic influenza. This study presents implantable chitosan microneedles (MNs) with immune-boosting function for effective influenza vaccination. We demonstrate that the chitosan MN can not only be an efficient tool for sustained intradermal delivery but also serve as an immunological adjuvant to boost vaccine efficacy. Continuous antigen exposure and immune stimulation provided by the implanted MNs may enhance the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines and evoke long-lasting immune responses to completely protect mice from lethal influenza challenge. The proposed MN system has great potential to be used as a new adjuvanted vaccine formulation and make influenza vaccination more effective and more accessible. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","chitosan nanoparticle; fluorescein isothiocyanate; immunoglobulin G; inactivated virus vaccine; influenza vaccine; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody response; Article; cadaver; controlled study; human; human tissue; influenza A (H1N1); influenza vaccination; mortality rate; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; vaccine immunogenicity; virus hemagglutination"
"Differential dynamics of hepatic protein expressions with long-term cultivated hepatitis C virus infection","2019","Background: The liver maintains blood chemical homeostasis by active uptake and secretion through endocytosis, exocytosis, and intracellular trafficking between the plasma and intracellular membranes. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects the host membrane architecture and might thus impair the regulation of the cellular transportation machinery. Additionally, the hepatic expressions of differential protein dynamics with long-term HCV infection remain fully recover. Methods: In this study, comparative proteomic analysis was performed in HCV-infected and mock-control Huh7 cells according to the viral dynamics of exponential, plateau, declined, and silencing phases at the acute stage, and the chronic stage. The proteins with <0.8-fold and ?1.25-fold changes in expression were analyzed using functional pathway clustering prediction. Results: The combined experimental repetitions identified full-spectrum cellular proteins in each of 5 sample sets from acute exponential, plateau, declined, and silencing phases, and the chronic stage. The clustering results revealed that HCV infection might differentiate regulatory pathways involving extracellular exosome, cadherin, melanosome, and RNA binding. Overall host proteins in HCV-infected cells exhibited kinetic pattern 1, in which cellular expression was downregulated from the acute exponential to plateau phases, reached a nadir, and was then elevated at the chronic stage. The proteins involved in the membrane-budding pathway exhibited kinetic pattern 2, in which their expressions were distinctly downregulated at the chronic stage. Conclusion: The current comparative proteomics revealed the differential regulatory effects of HCV infection on host intracellular transport functional pathways, which might contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of HCV in hepatocytes that sustain long-term infection. ? 2019",""
"BPR1M97, a dual mu opioid receptor/nociceptin-orphanin FQ peptide receptor agonist, produces potent antinociceptive effects with safer properties than morphine","2019","There is unmet need to design an analgesic with fewer side effects for severe pain management. Although traditional opioids are the most effective painkillers, they are accompanied by severe adverse responses, such as respiratory depression, constipation symptoms, tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction. We indicated BPR1M97 as a dual mu opioid receptor (MOP)/nociceptin-orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor full agonist and investigated the pharmacology of BPR1M97 in multiple animal models. In vitro studies on BPR1M97 were assessed using cyclic-adenosine monophosphate production, β-arrestin, internalization, and membrane potential assays. In vivo studies were characterized using the tail-flick, tail-clip, lung functional, heart functional, acetone drop, von Frey hair, charcoal meal, glass bead, locomotor activity, conditioned place preference (CPP) and naloxone precipitation tests. BPR1M97 elicited full agonist properties for all cell-based assays tested in MOP-expressing cells. However, it acted as a G protein-biased agonist for NOP. BPR1M97 initiated faster antinociceptive effects at 10 min after subcutaneous injection and elicited better analgesia in cancer-induced pain than morphine. Unlike morphine, BPR1M97 caused less respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. In addition, BPR1M97 decreased global activity and induced less withdrawal jumping precipitated by naloxone. Thus, BPR1M97 could serve as a novel small molecule dual receptor agonist for antinociception with fewer side effects than morphine. ? 2019",""
"Risk of psychiatric disorders in overactive bladder syndrome: A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan","2019","Population-based cohort study investigating the risk of depression and other psychiatric disorders for patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is unavailable. This study investigated the subsequent risk of psychiatric disorders among patients with OAB in an Asian population. Using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we established a cohort with 811 patients in an exposed group with OAB between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000, and a non-exposed group, without OAB, of 2433 patients without OAB matched by age and year of diagnosis. The occurrence of psychiatric disorders and Cox regression model measured adjusted HRs (aHR) were monitored until the end of 2013. The overall incidence of psychiatric disorders was 41.7% higher in the exposed group with OAB than in the non-exposed group without OAB (14.2% vs 10.1%, p<0.001), with an aHR of 1.34 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.80, p<0.001) for the OAB cohort. OAB was associated with the increased risk of dementia, anxiety, depressive, sleep, and psychotic disorders, with aHRs as 1.53 (p=0.040), 1.61 (p<0.001), 2.10 (p<0.001), 1.43 (p<0.001), and 2.49 (p=0.002), respectively. The risk of psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, is significantly higher in patients with OAB than in those without OAB. Evaluation of psychiatric status in patients with OAB is strongly recommended. ? American Federation for Medical Research 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

"Comparative study of clinical and epidemiological characteristics of major pediatric adenovirus epidemics in southern Taiwan","2019","Background: Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are important pathogens of pediatric respiratory tract infections in Taiwan. There were two major HAdV epidemics in southern Taiwan in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Methods: The demographic, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for hospitalization of pediatric patients with HAdV infection in the two outbreaks were retrospectively compared. The epidemic was defined as > 7% HAdV detection rate for six consecutive weeks. HAdV infection was defined as positive HAdV isolates from respiratory tract specimens. HAdV genotype was determined by PCR-based hexon gene sequencing. Results: A total of 1145 pediatric patients were identified (635 cases in 2011; 510 cases in 2014). HAdV genotype 3 and 7 contributed to both epidemics, although the proportion of HAdV3 decreased significantly (64.7% in 2011 to 25.5% in 2014, p < 0.001) and was replaced by other genotypes (type 1, 4, and 6) in the 2014 epidemic. Among the hospitalized patients, there were more patients hospitalized with bronchopneumonia/or pneumonia in the 2011 epidemic (10.6% vs 5.1%, p < 0.001), while more patients hospitalized with acute pharyngitis/pharyngoconjunctival fever (63.9% vs. 38.6%, p < 0.001) in the 2014 epidemic. In both epidemics, hospitalized patients had higher WBC and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than non-hospitalized patients. Using multivariate regression analysis, underlying disease and elevated CRP levels were independent risk factors for hospitalization in both epidemics. Conclusion: There were significant differences in clinical, viral characteristics and risk factors of hospitalization between the 2011 and 2014 epidemics. Understanding changes in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HAdV epidemics is important from a public health perspective. ? 2019 The Author(s).","C reactive protein; adenovirus infection; Article; bronchopneumonia; child; clinical feature; comparative study; controlled study; demography; epidemic; epidemiological data; female; gene sequence; genotype; human; human adenovirus infection; infection risk; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; pediatrics; pharyngitis; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; public health; retrospective study; risk factor; survival rate; symptomatology; Taiwan; throat culture; university hospital; virus identification; virus isolation; virus strain; comparative study; epidemic; genetics; hospitalization; Human adenovirus C; human adenovirus infection; infant; pathogenicity; respiratory tract infection; Taiwan; virology; virus pneumonia; Adenovirus Infections, Human; Adenoviruses, Human; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Female; Genotype; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Male; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory Tract Infections; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Activities of daily living function and neuropsychiatric symptoms of people with dementia and caregiver burden: The mediating role of caregiving hours","2019","Objective: Due to the presence of neuropsychiatric behaviors and the decreased ability for activities of daily living (ADLs), family caregivers experience high burden levels in caring for people with dementia (PWD). This study sought to test the mediating role of caregiving hours in association with PWDs’ ability for basic activities of daily living (BADL) function or neuropsychiatric behaviors and caregiver burden. Methods: This study used two waves of survey data, collected between 2013 and 2016, from 186 PWD–caregiver dyads in a dementia clinic at a teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. Two sets of multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the relationships between the changes in patients’ BADL function, patients’ neuropsychiatric behaviors, caregiving hours in ADL (including BADL and Instrumental ADL), and caregiver burden (measured using Zarit Burden Interview). Bootstrapping methods were used to detect the mediating effects of caregiving hours in ADL if the 95% confidence interval (CI) did not cover 0. Results: Caregiving hours in BADL mediated the relationship of PWDs’ BADL function and caregiver burden (effect = ?0.0137, 95% bootstrap CI = ?0.0379, ?0.0003). However, such mediating effects were not found in the relationship of PWDs’ neuropsychiatric behaviors and caregiver burden. Conclusions: In order to relieve caregiver burden, respite care services for caregivers for PWD should target services that assist with PWD's BADL. ? 2018","adult; Article; Barthel index; bootstrapping; caregiver; confidence interval; controlled study; daily life activity; dementia; disease severity; female; functional status; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; multiple linear regression analysis; priority journal; Taiwan; teaching hospital"
"Risk factors of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in hospitalized adults: Vary by hospitalized duration","2019","Background: Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea. Hospitalized patients were at risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). However the risk factors of CDAD in patients with different hospitalization period are not clear. Material and methods: A prospective investigation was conducted in medical wards of a district hospital in southern Taiwan, from January 2011 to January 2013. We arbitrary divided patients into two groups: hospitalized for at most 14 days and 15–30 days, and analyzed their risk factors for CDAD. Results: Overall 451 patients were enrolled. The multivariable analysis of 19 (8.0%) patients developing CDAD within 14 days' hospital stay and 216 patients hospitalized for ? 14 days without CDAD showed malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 7.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82–28.09; P = 0.005), prior cephalosporin (OR 10.8, 95% CI 1.3–93.9; P = 0.03) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI; OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1–24.7; P = 0.002) therapy were independently related to CDAD (Table 3), but hypertension (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1–0.7; P = 0.01) was reversely related to CDAD. However, of 9 (4.2%) patients developing CDAD later (15–30 days' hospital stay) and 207 patients with longer hospitalization (15–30 days) but free of CDAD, malignancy (OR 14.0, 95% CI 1.6–124.9; P = 0.02) and underlying diabetes mellitus (OR 20.5, 95% CI 2.9–144.9; P = 0.002) were independent risk factors of CDAD. Conclusion: Risk factors for CDAD among hospitalized patients varied by the duration of hospital stay. Intervention strategies to prevent CDAD may be different in terms of hospital stay duration. ? 2019",""
"Autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma: Post-transplant outcomes of Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry","2019","Background/Purpose: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal plasma cell malignancy. The primary choice of treatment for MM is induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This study aimed to analyze the treatment efficacy of ASCT in a Taiwanese cohort and evaluate possible prognostic factors. Methods: From the database of the Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, data on 396 patients with MM who underwent ASCT were reviewed. Results: The average age of participants was 54.8 years, and there were more men than women (57.6% vs. 42.4%). Most patients were diagnosed with IgG-type myeloma (52.4%), followed by IgA-type (23.2%) and light-chain type (21.4%). Patients with Durie Salmon Staging System (DSS) III disease accounted for 61.9% of the study cohort, while 23.7% had stage II and 14.4% had stage I disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after ASCT were 46.5 months and 70.4 months, respectively. DSS III was a poor prognostic factor affecting both PFS and OS with a duration of 35.9 months and 69.0 months, respectively, compared with the other two stages (p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively). In addition, patients with better treatment response before ASCT had better PFS and OS compared with those who did not show a response (both p < 0.0001). The overall incidence of organ toxicities associated with transplantation was low. Conclusion: In conclusion, our cohort showed that myeloma patients with early DSS and better treatment response before ASCT had better long-term survival outcomes. ? 2018","immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin light chain; melphalan; antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; bloodstream infection; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cause of death; cohort analysis; cytomegalovirus infection; drug megadose; female; herpes zoster; human; long term survival; major clinical study; male; mucosa inflammation; multiple myeloma; organ injury; overall survival; pneumonia; progression free survival; register; skin infection; transplantation conditioning; treatment response; adolescent; autotransplantation; epidemiology; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; mortality; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; remission; retrospective study; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Multivariate Analysis; Registries; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Chronic exposure to high fat diet triggers myelin disruption and interleukin-33 upregulation in hypothalamus","2019","Background: Hypothalamic inflammation including astrogliosis and microglia activation occurs after intake of high fat diet (HFD) in rodent models or in obese individuals. However, the effect of chronic HFD feeding on oligodendrocytes (OLGs), a myelin-producing glial population in the central nervous system (CNS), remains unclear. In this study, we used 8-week old male C57BL/6 mice fed by HFD for 3-6 months to induce chronic obesity. Results: The transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis showed that the integrity of hypothalamic myelin was disrupted after HFD feeding for 4 and 6 months. Moreover, the accumulation of Iba1+-microglia with an amoeboid hypertrophic form was continually observed in arcuate nucleus of HFD-fed mice during the entire feeding time period. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a tissue alarmin upon injury to the CNS, was detected with an increased level in hypothalamus after HFD feeding for 3 and 4 months. Furthermore, the in vitro study indicated that exposure of mature OLGs to IL-33 impaired OLG cell structure along with a decline in the expression of myelin basic protein. Conclusions: Altogether, our findings demonstrate that chronic HFD feeding triggers hypothalamic myelin disruption in accompany with IL-33 upregulation and prolonged microglial activation in hypothalamus. Given that the addition of exogenous IL-33 was harmful for the maturation of OLGs, an increase in IL-33 by chronic HFD feeding might contribute to the induction of hypothalamic myelin disruption. ? 2019 The Author(s).","calcium binding protein; interleukin 33; myelin; myelin basic protein; protein Iba 1; unclassified drug; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; Article; cell activation; cell maturation; cell structure; controlled study; demyelination; diet induced obesity; experimental CNS injury; feeding behavior; human; hypothalamus; in vitro study; lipid diet; long term exposure; male; microglia; mouse; nonhuman; oligodendroglia; protein expression; transmission electron microscopy; upregulation"
"Regeneration of rete ridges in Lanyu pig (Sus scrofa): Insights for human skin wound healing","2019","Rete ridges are important to the mechanical function of skin in animals with minimal hair, including humans. As mice do not exhibit rete ridges, the need for a quality animal model is pertinent. Here, we develop a Lanyu pig (Sus scrofa) full-thickness wound model to explore tissue regeneration because the architecture and function are similar to humans and inbred genetic variants are available. Full- and partial-thickness wounds were generated on the dorsum. Full-thickness wounds at post-wound day 57 exhibit severe scar with no signs of wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis. Wound contraction is greater in the anterior/posterior relative to the medial/lateral axis. In wound beds, K14 + cells increased while K10 + , p63 + and PCNA + cells decreased compared to unwounded tissue. Epithelial β-catenin is unchanged. The wound bed expresses more ColI, less ColIII and no elastin. Rete ridges do not form after full-thickness wounding, but incompletely regenerate after partial-thickness wounding. An alkaline phosphatase (ALP) + cell population, not associated with hair follicles, is present at the bottom of the rete ridge basal layer in pig and human unwounded skin. These K5 + /K10 ? /PCNA ? /ALP + epithelial cells are absent after full-thickness wounding but reappear after partial-thickness wounding, before invagination of new rete ridges. In summary, full-thickness wounding on the dorsum of Lanyu pigs results in scar formation and perturbed molecular expression while partial-thickness wounding permits limited rete ridge and papillary dermis regeneration. Future functional studies and further characterization will help contribute knowledge for the regenerative medicine field. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Outdoor fitness equipment usage behaviors in natural settings","2019","Outdoor fitness equipment (OFE) areas have become a popular form of built environment infrastructure in public open spaces as a means to improve public health through increased physical activity. However, the benefits of using OFE are not consistent, and several OFE accidents have been reported. In this study, we videotaped how OFE users operate OFE in parks and selected four types of popular OFE (the waist twister, air walker, ski machine, and waist/back massager) for video content analysis. Furthermore, we established coding schemes and compared results with the instructions provided by OFE manufacturers. The results revealed various usage behaviors for the same OFE types. In addition, we observed that a significant portion of user behaviors did not follow manufacturers’ instructions, which might pose potential risks or actually cause injuries. Children are especially prone to act improperly. This study provides empirical evidence indicating the existence of potential safety risks due to inappropriate usage behaviors that might lead to accidents and injuries while using OFE. This study provides crucial information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of OFE and to develop future park or open space initiatives. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Characteristics of scrub typhus, murine typhus, and Q fever among elderly patients: Prolonged prothrombin time as a predictor for severity","2019","Background/purpose: The clinical manifestations of scrub typhus, murine typhus and acute Q fever in the elderly are not clear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to identify the characteristics of the elderly aged ?65 years with a comparison group aged 18–64 years among patients with scrub typhus, murine typhus, or acute Q fever who were serologically confirmed at three hospitals in Taiwan during 2002–2011. Results: Among 441 cases, including 187 cases of scrub typhus, 166 acute Q fever, and 88 murine typhus, 68 (15.4%) cases were elderly patients. The elderly had a higher severe complication rate (10.3% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.022), but did not have a significantly higher mortality rate (1.47% vs. 0.54%, p = 0.396). Compared with those without severe complications, we found the elderly (p = 0.022), dyspnea (p = 0.006), less relative bradycardia (p = 0.004), less febrile illness (p = 0.004), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (p = 0.002), higher levels of initial C-reactive protein (p = 0.039), blood leukocyte counts (p = 0.01), and lower platelet counts (p = 0.012) are significantly associated with severe complications. Only prolonged prothrombin time was associated with severe complications in multivariate analysis (p = 0.018, CI 95% 0.01–0.66). Among clinical symptoms and laboratory data, multivariate analysis revealed chills was less frequently occurred in the elderly (p = 0.012, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33–9.99). Conclusion: The elderly cases with scrub typhus, murine typhus, or acute Q fever would be more likely to have severe complications, for which prothrombin time prolongation is an important predictor for severe complications. ? 2017","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; C reactive protein; lactate dehydrogenase; activated partial thromboplastin time; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; arthralgia; Article; bradycardia; chill; controlled study; coughing; diarrhea; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; dizziness; dyspnea; female; fever; geriatric patient; headache; human; leukocyte count; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; meningitis; middle aged; murine typhus; pancreatitis; platelet count; prothrombin time; Q fever; retrospective study; rhinorrhea; scrub typhus; septic shock; sputum; Taiwan; clinical trial; complication; multicenter study; murine typhus; pathophysiology; prothrombin time; Q fever; scrub typhus; severity of illness index; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Prothrombin Time; Q Fever; Retrospective Studies; Scrub Typhus; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Typhus, Endemic Flea-Borne"
"A qualitative exploration of the fear of recurrence among Taiwanese breast cancer survivors","2019","Objective: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is the most commonly reported problem and unmet need among breast cancer survivors. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the experience of recurrence fears among Taiwanese breast cancer survivors. Methods: Three focus groups were included in this study. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit 11 recurrence-free women at least 20?years of age from southern Taiwan who were diagnosed with breast cancer within the previous 2?years. Data were analysed and interpreted using content analysis. Results: Three themes reflecting the experience of FCR were extracted from the transcript analyses: “Trapped in insecurity,” “Suffering in silence,” and “Pretending as if nothing happened.” Participants endured a complex set of circumstances akin to silently walking the survival tightrope. Breast cancer survivors were still insecure and suffering, rather than celebrating survival, after the completion of treatment. Fear of cancer recurrence silently dominated their lives. Conclusions: An avoidance mindset and an unspoken FCR leave survivors insecure, resulting in a silent survival journey. These difficult thoughts and feelings that may impact the reconstruction of post-cancer life should be acknowledged. The development of appropriate survivorship care programs and emotional resilience regarding recurrence is needed for Taiwanese breast cancer survivors. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"RasGRP1 is a potential biomarker for stratifying anti-EGFR therapy response in colorectal cancer","2019","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent neoplastic disorder and is a main cause of tumor-related mortality, as many patients progress to stage IV metastatic CRC. Standard care consists of combination chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX). Patients with WT KRAS typing are eligible to receive anti-EGFR therapy combined with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, predicting efficacy of CRC anti-EGFR therapy has remained challenging. Here we uncovered that the EGFR pathway component RasGRP1 acts as a CRC tumor suppressor in the context of aberrant Wnt signaling. We found that RasGRP1 suppresses EGF-driven proliferation of colonic epithelial organoids. Having established that RasGRP1 dosage levels impact biology, we next focused on CRC patients. Mining 5 different data platforms, we establish that RasGRP1 expression levels decrease with CRC progression and predict poor clinical outcome of patients. Last, deletion of 1 or 2 Rasgrp1 alleles made CRC spheroids more susceptible to EGFR inhibition. Retrospective analysis of the CALGB 80203 clinical trial showed that addition of anti-EGFR therapy to chemotherapy significantly improved outcome for CRC patients when tumors expressed low levels of RasGRP1 suppressor. In sum, our data support RasGRP1 as a biomarker in the EGFR pathway that has potential relevance to anti-EGFR therapy for CRC patients. ? 2019, American Society for Clinical Investigation.","cetuximab; epidermal growth factor; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; fluorouracil; folinic acid; irinotecan; oxaliplatin; Ras protein; RasGRP1 protein; tumor marker; tumor suppressor protein; unclassified drug; allele; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cancer patient; clinical outcome; colon tissue; colorectal cancer; controlled study; data mining; drug efficacy; drug response; epithelium; gene deletion; human; human tissue; monotherapy; mouse; nonhuman; organoid; prediction; protein degradation; protein expression; protein expression level; protein function; Rasgrp1 gene; retrospective study; treatment outcome; tumor growth; tumor spheroid; Wnt signaling"
"The Chang Gung Research Database—A multi-institutional electronic medical records database for real-world epidemiological studies in Taiwan","2019","Purpose: The Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD), the largest multi-institutional electronic medical records (EMR) collection in Taiwan, provides good access for researchers to efficiently use the standardized patient-level data. This study evaluates the capacity and representativeness of the CGRD to promote secondary use of EMR data for clinical research with more accurate estimates. Methods: The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) which covers over 99.9% of the Taiwanese population served as the comparator in this study. We compare the data components of the CGRD with the NHIRD, including records for health care facilities, patients, diagnoses, drugs, and procedures. Using the chi-square test, we compared the distributions of age categories and sex of patients, and the rates of their health conditions between NHIRD and CGRD based on the year 2015. Results: The CGRD contains more clinical information such as pathological and laboratory results than the NHIRD. The CGRD includes 6.1% of outpatients and 10.2% of hospitalized patients from the NHIRD. We found the CGRD includes more elderly outpatients (23.5% vs 12.5%) and pediatric inpatients (19.7% vs 14.4%) compared with the NHIRD. We found patients' sex distributions were similar between CGRD and NHIRD, but coverage rates of severe conditions, such as cancer, were higher than other health conditions in CGRD. Conclusions: The CGRD could serve as the basis for accurate estimates in medical studies. However, researchers should pay special attention to selection biases since patients' characteristics from CGRD differ from those of the national database. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","access to information; Article; chang gung research database; chi square test; clinical research; data base; electronic medical record; epidemiological data; health care facility; health insurance; hospital patient; human; medical information system; priority journal; sex ratio; Taiwan"
"The prospective and potential of carbonic anhydrase for carbon dioxide sequestration: A critical review","2019","From 1990 to 2000, carbon dioxide emissions increased dramatically by 13% and are estimated to increase by 30–50% until 2050, which has already caused global warming and affected the environment and human health care. Moreover, carbon dioxide has dramatically increased up to 20 times in atmosphere, and the temperature of earth surface also raised 1 °C from the past fifty years. Although novel and globally technologies integrated carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) is already considered, there are still significant challenges of cost, economic barriers, and uncertainties on environmental impacts. One promising way to mediate those issues is to use carbonic anhydrase (CA) as enzyme based is eco-friendly and no secondary pollutant will emerge. In order to propose CAs for carbon fixation, high stable CAs on the extreme and harsh environment is essential and urgent.

"Do healthy city performance awards lead to health in all policies? A case of Taiwan","2019","The Healthy Cities (HC) Project, which was introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986, has been recognized as the best setting approach for health promotion. However, very few studies have addressed how to use HC approaches to establish public policies in non-health departments in cities. This paper describes the strategies for the HC Performance Awards used in Taiwan to draw attention from different departments and to sustain intersectoral collaboration for the purpose of establishing Health in All Policies (HiAP). The methods include: (1) setting up the Taiwan Healthy City Alliance; (2) establishing HC Innovation Performance Awards; (3) reviewing the award applications according to seven criteria; and (4) analyzing the topic content of the award applications. We collected 961 HC award applications during 2013–2016 to analyze their content. The results showed that the number of applications increased nearly every year while significantly more non-health departments applied for the awards compared to health departments (73.3% vs. 26.7%). The award rates of non-health departments have also increased twice from 13.9% in 2013 to 25.8% in 2016. By examining the topics of the award winners, we concluded that “HC Innovation Performance Awards” indeed provide a role and opportunity for political involvement, intersectoral collaboration, co-opetition and capacity building that is necessary for establishing health in all policies. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Dynamic Changes of Health Utility in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Different Treatments: A 7-Year Follow-up","2019","Introduction: This study aimed to estimate the utility values of all subtypes of lung cancer. The trajectories after different kinds of treatments and their major determinants were explored on the basis of real-world data and repeated measurements. Methods: From 2011 to 2017, all patients with lung cancer who visited a medical center were invited to fill out the EuroQol Five-Dimension and WHO Quality of Life-Brief questionnaires at each visit. Utility values of quality of life (QoL) after diagnosis and treatments were depicted using a kernel smoothing method. We constructed linear mixed models to predict health utility in each time period and cross-validated them with domain scores of the WHO Quality of Life-Brief. Results: A total of 1715 patients were enrolled, with 6762 QoL measurements. Utility values were lower in patients with advanced-stage disease and older patients. Patients receiving second-line targeted therapy showed higher utility values at 0 to 3 months, 3 to 6 months, and 6 months and beyond (0.89, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively) than did those undergoing chemotherapy (0.81, 0.85, and 0.80, respectively). After using mixed models to control confounders, including poor performance status and disease progression, patients receiving second-line chemotherapy showed health utility similar to that at quasi-baseline, whereas utility values related to second-line targeted therapy were higher at 3 to 6 months and 6 months and beyond (β = 0.07, p = 0.010 and β = 0.07, p < 0.001, respectively). There was convergent validity between the utility values and scores of the physical and psychological domains. Conclusion: Targeted therapy provided treated patients with a higher health utility value than was provided to those treated with chemotherapy. Development of the longitudinal trajectory may help predict changes in QoL and improve the care of lung cancer survivors. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","adult; advanced cancer; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer staging; female; follow up; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; molecularly targeted therapy; priority journal; quality of life; risk factor; trend study"
"Clinical implications of multiple glioblastomas: An analysis of prognostic factors and survival to distinguish from their single counterparts","2019","Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) has the highest fatality rate among primary malignant brain tumors. GBMs with synchronous multiple foci (multiple GBMs) is rarely diagnosed in the clinical scenario. This study aims to compare the clinical characteristics between multiple and single GBMs and to identify factors associated with the survival of GBM and evaluate their effects. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with primary GBM in a referral medical center in Taiwan who were diagnosed between 2005 and 2016. They were identified from the cancer registry database of the center and followed from the date of diagnosis to october 2018. The primary endpoint of this study was overall survival (OS), and the independent factors for survival were identified through Cox regressions. Results: A total of 48 patients were identified, of whom 44 GBM (92%) and 4 gliosarcoma (GSM) (8%). Preoperative images showed five (10%) patients had multiple brain lesions. GSM showed a high ratio of multiple lesions (50%) than patients with GBM (5%) (p = 0.05). Those with multiple lesions had significantly worse median OS of 8.2 months compared to patients with a single lesion (16 months, p = 0.03). We found that multiple GBMs was a predictor of worse survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.57, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.26–10.13) after adjusting for other significant predictor of radiotherapy (HR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.23–0.96). Conclusion: Patients with multiple GBMs had worse survival compared to those with single GBM. GBM patients without post-operative radiotherapy were also a predictor of worse survival. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association",""
"Relationship of regional elderly density and bus resource based on geographical analysis","2019","Objectives: Bus is the most used mode of transportation for the elderly, yet it is jnot clear about the relationship between bus resource and the elderly population distribution. This study compared the regional elderly density and the bus resource distribution to investigate'whether the bus resource meets the needs of the elderly. Methods: Data on regional elderly population was retrieved from the Ministry of the Interior at Executive Yuanin 2016. The number of bus stops was obtained from GIS-t, a geographic information system and Public transport data exchange managed by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. The bus ujage rate of the regional public transportation resource came from the survey of people's daily use of transportation vehicles, in 2016. Correlation analyses and the Quantum-GIS was used to present the relationship among the distribution of bus resource, the regional population demand, the aged condition, and the bus usage rate. Results: The regional elderly public transport usage rate was positively related to bus stops density (Bus stops per Square kilometer) (r= 0.74, p< .001). The distance between bus stops had a trend of negative association with the elderly bus uiage rate (r:-0.44, p= 0.051). Inside the last five list of bus stops density were Miaoli County, Changhua County, Nantou County, Taitung County and Hualien County which were located in the central and eastern Taiwan. The number of the elderly was serviced by per bus route stop which was positively related to the regional aging ratio (R: 0.48, p= 0.025). The top four numbers of the elderly serviced by per route bus stop were Yunlin County, Miaoli County, Chiayi County and Taitung County. Conclusions: The richer the bus resource a regional area has, the higher usage rate of public transportation there is. However, it was found that the regional areas with more elderly people have fewer bus resources, and there is a gap between urban and rural areas in terms of the bus resource distribution. Yunlin County, Miaoli County, Chiayi County, changhua'county, Nantou County and the eastern Taiwan have fewer bus resources. It is vital for the government to give more concern to this issue and facilitate the construction of public transportation.

"Prostasin Impairs Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor Activation to Suppress Dengue Virus Propagation","2019","Background: Dengue virus (DENV), a common and widely spread arbovirus, causes life-threatening diseases, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. There is currently no effective therapeutic or preventive treatment for DENV infection. Methods: Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that prostasin expression was decreased upon DENV infection. Prostasin expression levels were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in patients with dengue fever and a DENV-infected mice model. Short hairpin RNA against EGFR and LY294002 were used to investigate the molecular mechanism. Results: Based on clinical studies, we first found relatively low expression of prostasin, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane protease, in blood samples from patients with dengue fever compared with healthy individuals and a high correlation of prostasin expression and DENV-2 RNA copy number. DENV infection significantly decreased prostasin RNA levels of in vivo and in vitro models. By contrast, exogenous expression of prostasin could protect ICR suckling mice from life-threatening DENV-2 infection. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of DENV propagation by prostasin was due to reducing expression of epithelial growth factor receptor, leading to suppression of the Akt/NF-κB-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that prostasin expression is a noteworthy clinical feature and a potential therapeutic target against DENV infection. ? 2018 The Author(s) 2018.",""
