"Bradykinin B1 receptor contributes to interleukin-8 production and glioblastoma migration through interaction of STAT3 and SP-1",2019,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive brain tumor, has a poor prognosis due to the ease of migration to surrounding healthy brain tissue. Recent studies have shown that bradykinin receptors are involved in the progression of various cancers. However, the molecular mechanism and pathological role of bradykinin receptors remains unclear. We observed the expressions of two major bradykinin receptors, B1R and B2R, in two different human GBM cell lines, U87 and GBM8901. Cytokine array analysis showed that bradykinin increases the production of interleukin (IL)-8 in GBM via B1R. Higher B1R levels correlate with IL-8 expression in U87 and GBM8901. We observed increased levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and SP-1 in the nucleus as well. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that STAT3 and SP-1 mediate IL-8 expression, which gets abrogated by the inhibition of FAK and STAT3. We further demonstrated that IL-8 expression and cell migration are also regulated by the SP-1. In addition, expression levels of STAT3 and SP-1 positively correlate with clinicopathological grades of gliomas. Interestingly, our results found that inhibition of HDAC increases IL-8 expression. Moreover, stimulation with bradykinin caused increases in acetylated SP-1 and p300 complex formation, which are abrogated by inhibition of FAK and STAT3. Meanwhile, knockdown of SP-1 and p300 decreased the augmentation of bradykinin-induced IL-8 expression. These results indicate that bradykinin-induced IL-8 expression is dependent on B1R which causes phosphorylated STAT3 and acetylated SP-1 to translocate to the nucleus, hence resulting in GBM migration. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","bradykinin; bradykinin B1 receptor; bradykinin B2 receptor; E1A associated p300 protein; focal adhesion kinase; interleukin 8; STAT3 protein; transcription factor Sp1; bradykinin; bradykinin B1 receptor; bradykinin B2 receptor; E1A associated p300 protein; EP300 protein, human; IL8 protein, human; interleukin 8; Sp1 protein, human; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; transcription factor Sp1; Article; cell migration; cell motility; cell nucleus; cellular distribution; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; cytokine production; enzyme inhibition; GBM8901 cell line; glioblastoma; glioblastoma cell line; glioma cell; human; human cell; priority journal; protein acetylation; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; transcription regulation; U87 cell line; acetylation; brain tumor; cell motion; drug effect; gene expression regulation; glioblastoma; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Acetylation; Bradykinin; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Nucleus; E1A-Associated p300 Protein; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glioblastoma; Humans; Interleukin-8; Phosphorylation; Receptor, Bradykinin B1; Receptor, Bradykinin B2; Signal Transduction; Sp1 Transcription Factor; STAT3 Transcription Factor"
"Factors associated with antimuscarinic drug persistence and increasing drug persistence after switching to mirabegron for overactive bladder patients",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate long-term antimuscarinic drug persistence and its associated characteristics in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) treated with antimuscarinic agents. We also assessed the efficacy and safety of switching from solifenacin to mirabegron in patients refractory to antimuscarinic therapy. Methods: In this prospective, open-label, 48-month study, 416 patients (mean age, 70.6 ± 12.4 years) were enrolled. All patients completed the overactive bladder symptom score and urgency severity score questionnaires, along with initial and follow-up uroflowmetry. All patients received antimuscarinic solifenacin 5 mg daily. Mirabegron (25 mg daily) was suggested in patients that were refractory to antimuscarinic therapy or had intolerable side effects. Results: The mean solifenacin persistence was 6.6 ± 8.1 months (range, 0.5–48 months). Only 81 (19.5%) patients had drug persistence of ?12 months. Male sex, age, cerebral vascular accident, maximum flow rate, and post-void residual were associated with solifenacin persistence in the univariate analysis. Age (odds ratio [OR], 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08–0.21) was the only independent predictor in the multivariate logistic regression. Of the 416 patients, 171 (60.8%) changed from solifenacin to mirabegron for due to the persistence of OAB symptoms. The switch resulted in a significantly longer period of actual OAB pharmacotherapy (9.3 ± 9.2 vs 13.3 ± 9.3 months, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Long-term drug persistence of solifenacin was low during the 2-year follow-up. Age was an independent factor associated with longer drug persistence. Switching from solifenacin to mirabegron was an effective and safe alternative for OAB patients that were refractory to solifenacin treatment. ? 2018","mirabegron; solifenacin; acetanilide derivative; mirabegron; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; solifenacin; thiazole derivative; adult; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; disease association; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; female; flow rate; follow up; human; logistic regression analysis; long term care; major clinical study; male; medical history; observational study; overactive bladder; patient referral; postvoid residual urine volume; prediction; prescription; prospective study; prostate volume; risk factor; transrectal ultrasonography; treatment duration; treatment outcome; univariate analysis; uroflowmetry; middle aged; multivariate analysis; overactive bladder; severity of illness index; statistical model; very elderly; Acetanilides; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Muscarinic Antagonists; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Solifenacin Succinate; Thiazoles; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Bladder, Overactive"

"Overexpression of LGR-5 as a predictor of poor outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Hepatocarcinogenesis and distant metastasis pose major challenges for physicians. They are regulated by several genes, such as AKT, JUK, Wnt, and P53, and their expression activates several important processes such as cell proliferation, migration, motility, and interaction in the microenvironment. The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR-5) is a novel biomarker, particularly in stem cells, and is involved in embryogenesis, tumor development, and tumor cell signal transduction. Here, we investigated LGR-5 expression using immunohistochemistry and analyzed the correlation between clinical features and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that LGR-5 expression was higher in tumor tissues than in normal liver tissues, and that high LGR-5 expression possibly favored poor outcomes in HCC, especially in well/moderate differentiation grade, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative, and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive groups. Thus, the LGR-5 marker is suggested to be a routine biomarker for poor prognosis, thereby providing a platform for anti-LGR-5-targeted therapy in the future. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Human leukocyte antigen-A?33:03-B?58:01-DRB1?15:140, a deduced probable human leukocyte antigen haplotype in association with a human leukocyte antigen low-incidence allele DRB1?15:140 in Taiwanese individuals: A case analysis",2019,"Objective: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1?15:140 is a low-frequency allele in the HLA-DRB1 locus. The aim of this study is to confirm the ethnicity of DRB1?15:140 and to deduce a probable HLA-DRB1?15:140-associated HLA haplotype in Taiwanese individuals. Materials and Methods: A total of 1815 healthy unrelated Taiwanese individuals and 14,562 unrelated mainland Chinese individuals were tested for HLA using a sequence-based typing method. Polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify exons 2 and 3 of the HLA-A and HLA-B loci and exons 1 and 2 of the HLA-DRB1 locus using group-specific primer sets. The amplicons were sequenced in both directions with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. Results: The DNA sequence of HLA-DRB1?15:140 is identical to DRB1?15:02:01:01 in exons 1 and 2, except at residue 91 of DRB1?15:02:01:01 where a G in DRB1?15:02:01:01 is replaced by an A in DRB1?15:140 (codon 2; GAC->AAC). The nucleotide substitution in exon 1 introduces a one amino acid substitution at residue 2 where an aspartic acid (D) in DRB1?15:02:01:01 is replaced by an asparagine (N) in DRB1?15:140. We deduced the probable HLA haplotype associated with DRB1?15:140 in Taiwanese to be HLA-A?33:03-B?58:01-DRB1?15:140. Conclusion: Information on the ethnicity and distribution of DRB1?15:140 and its deduced probable HLA haplotype in association with the low-incidence allele is of value for HLA-testing laboratories for reference purposes and can help bone marrow donor registries find compatible donors for patients with this uncommon HLA allele. ? 2018 Tzu Chi Medical Journal","asparagine; aspartic acid; HLA A antigen; HLA A33 antigen; HLA B antigen; HLA B58 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; nucleotide; unclassified drug; amino acid substitution; amplicon; Article; DNA sequence; exon; haplotype; human; major clinical study; polymerase chain reaction; Taiwanese"
"Five-year clinical outcomes of local versus general anesthesia deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease",2019,"Background. Studies comparing long-term outcomes between general anesthesia (GA) and local anesthesia (LA) for STN-DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD) are lacking. Whether patients who received STN-DBS in GA could get the same benefit without compromising electrophysiological recording is debated. Methods. We compared five-year outcomes for different anesthetic methods (GA vs LA) during STN-DBS for PD. Thirty-six consecutive PD patients with similar preoperative characteristics, including age, disease duration, and severity, underwent the same surgical procedures except the GA (n=22) group with inhalational anesthesia and LA (n=14) with local anesthesia during microelectrode recording and intraoperative macrostimulation test. Surgical outcome evaluations included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Mini-Mental Status Examinations, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Stimulation parameters and coordinates of STN targeting were also collected. Results. Both groups attained similar benefits in UPDRS part III from STN-DBS (GA 43.2 ± 14.1% vs. LA 46.8 ± 13.8% decrease, p=0.45; DBS on/Med off vs. DBS off/Med off) and no difference in reduction of levodopa equivalent doses (GA 47.56 ± 18.98% vs. LA 51.37 ± 31.73%, p=0.51) at the five-year follow-up. In terms of amplitude, frequency, and pulse width, the stimulation parameters used for DBS were comparable, and the coordinates of preoperative targeting and postoperative electrode tip were similar between two groups. There was no difference in STN recording length as well. Significantly less number of MER tracts in GA was found (p=0.04). Adverse effects were similar in both groups. Conclusions. Our study confirmed that STN localization with microelectrode recording and patient comfort could be achieved based on equal effectiveness and safety of STN-DBS under GA compared with LA. ? 2019 Sheng-Tzung Tsai et al.","cisatracurium; desflurane; fentanyl; levodopa; local anesthetic agent; propofol; rocuronium; sevoflurane; adult; anesthesia induction; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; brain depth stimulation; brain hemorrhage; clinical article; clinical outcome; comparative effectiveness; confusion; controlled study; disease duration; disease severity; dysarthria; dyskinesia; electrode implantation; electrophysiological procedures; endotracheal intubation; female; follow up; general anesthesia; human; hypomania; hypophonia; inhalation anesthesia; libido disorder; local anesthesia; lung edema; male; mania; memory disorder; Mini Mental State Examination; minimum lung alveolus concentration; neuronavigation; paresthesia; Parkinson disease; patient comfort; side effect; stereotactic procedure; subthalamic nucleus; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; x-ray computed tomography"
"Inhibiting two cellular mutant epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases by addressing computationally assessed crystal ligand pockets",2019,"Aim: Blocking receptor tyrosine kinases is a useful strategy for inhibiting the overexpression of EGFR. However, the quality of crystal pocket is an essential issue for virtually identifying new leads for surviving resistance cancer cells. Results: With the examinating crystal pocket quality by the self-docking root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) calculation, we used the two best kinase pockets of mutant EGFR kinases, T790M/L858R and G719S, for virtual screening. After sorting all the docking poses of the 57,177 library compounds by consensus scores, three evidently blocked cellular EGFR phosphorylation in the H1975 and SW48 cell lines. Conclusion: The computationally assessed qualities of crystal pockets of crystal EGFR kinases can help identify new cellular active and target-specific ligands rapidly and at low cost. ? 2019 Ying-Ting Lin, Chi-Huei Wang, Jia-Hau Lee, Wei-Chen Lin, Tsung-Kai Wen.","enzyme inhibitor; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; protein tyrosine kinase; y 11; y 17; y 28; y 30; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; ligand; protein kinase inhibitor; Article; cancer cell; cancer resistance; cancer screening; controlled study; drug inhibition; human; human cell; IC50; molecular docking; NCI-H1975 cell line; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; SW48 cell line; chemistry; drug design; genetics; molecular library; mutation; pharmacology; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Design; ErbB Receptors; Humans; Ligands; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Small Molecule Libraries"
"Angiotensin II receptor blockade is associated with preserved muscle strength in chronic hemodialysis patients",2019,"Background: Sarcopenia, defined as low muscle mass and strength, is highly prevalent in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD). However, muscle function and muscle mass do not share the same clinical relevance. In fact, muscle strength was more closely associated with the risk of mortality in chronic HD patients than was muscle mass. Therefore, to identify the risk factors of muscle weakness is vital. Angiotensin II overexpression had been recognized to impair skeletal muscle strength. Accordingly, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) potentially possess a muscle protective effect. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the factors associated with low muscle strength and to explore the relationship between ARB use and muscle strength in chronic HD patients. Methods: A total of 120 chronic HD patients, aged 63.3 ± 13.2 years, were included in this study. Basic characteristics, handgrip strength (HGS), body composition, and nutritional status were assessed, and blood samples for biochemical tests were obtained. We divided these participants into normal- and low HGS groups according to the consensus of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). Results: We observed that 78 (65.0%) patients had low HGS. In our cohort, we found that height (r = 0.653; P < 0.001), weight (r = 0.496; P < 0.001), body mass index (r = 0.215; P = 0.020), skeletal muscle index (r = 0.562; P < 0.001), albumin (r = 0.197; P = 0.032), and serum creatinine (r = 0.544; P < 0.001) were positively and age (r = - 0.506; P < 0.001), subjective global assessment (SGA) score (r = - 0.392; P < 0.001), fractional clearance index for urea (Kt/V) (r = - 0.404; P < 0.001) and urea reduction ratio (URR) (r = - 0.459; P < 0.001) were negatively correlated with HGS. According to our analysis, age (Odds ratio, OR = 1.11, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 1.05-1.17, P < 0.001), HD duration (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00-1.02, P = 0.010), diabetes (OR = 13.33, 95% CI = 3.45-51.53, P < 0.001), Kt/V (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.06-2.46, P = 0.027), and SGA score (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.03-1.38, P = 0.017) were regarded as independent predictors of low HGS. In contrast, ARB use (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.07-0.93, P = 0.039) was independently associated with preserved HGS in chronic HD patients, after adjustment for multiple confounding factors. Conclusions: Our study is the first report in chronic HD patients to indicate a potentially protective effect of ARB on muscle strength. However, further longitudinal follow-up and intervention studies are needed to confirm this finding. ? 2019 The Author(s).","albumin; angiotensin receptor antagonist; creatinine; urea; angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; angiotensin receptor antagonist; adult; age; aged; albumin blood level; Article; body composition; body height; body mass; body weight; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; creatinine blood level; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug effect; drug use; female; follow up; fractional clearance index for urea; Global Assessment of Functioning; grip strength; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; muscle strength; muscle weakness; nutritional status; renal system parameters; risk factor; sarcopenia; skeletal muscle; treatment duration; adverse event; blood; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; complication; hand strength; muscle strength; sarcopenia; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Body Composition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hand Strength; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Nutritional Status; Renal Dialysis; Sarcopenia"

"Risk of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with bipolar disorder: A nationwide population-based cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Aim: Previous studies have found a high prevalence of risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). This study aimed to determine whether BD patients are associated with an increased risk of incident OSA. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, 3650 BD patients and 18 250 non-BD controls matched by sex and age were enrolled between 2000 and 2010 and followed until the end of 2013. Patients who developed OSA confirmed by a polysomnographic examination during the follow-up period were identified. Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the risk of OSA between BD patients and comparative controls. Results: BD patients were prone to developing OSA in the crude analysis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–2.49). After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, the HR declined and was only marginally significant (HR: 1.54, 95%CI: 0.99–2.37). The stratification analysis by sex revealed that the risk trend with BD and subsequent OSA was mainly contributed by male BD patients (HR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.02–2.91) and female BD patients weakened the overall association. Additionally, this study found that older age, higher income, living in urbanized areas, and some metabolic comorbidities were potential risk factors for developing OSA. Conclusion: This study shows that male BD patients are associated with an increased risk of OSA, which has direct implications for the development of targeted prevention interventions or the implementation of a screening algorithm for OSA to reduce its negative health impact. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Osteoprotegerin and osteopontin levels, but not gene polymorphisms, predict mortality in cardiovascular diseases",2019,"Aim: This study aims to investigate whether osteoprotegerin (OPG) or osteopontin (OPN) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will predict survival. Materials & methods: This study enrolled 617 participants undergoing health examination, 536 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 86 peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients. Genotypes of OPG SNP rs2073618 and OPN SNP rs11730582 were determined. OPG and OPN levels were measured. Results: In both CAD and PAD populations, high OPG and OPN levels were strong predictors of all-cause death. The OPG rs2073618 CC genotype and the OPN rs11730582 TT genotype did not predict mortality. Conclusion: High OPG and high OPN levels, but not OPG rs2073618 CC genotype or OPN rs11730582 TT genotype, were strong predictors of mortality in both CAD and PAD patients. ? 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","osteopontin; osteoprotegerin; adult; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; controlled study; coronary artery disease; DNA polymorphism; female; genetic analysis; human; major clinical study; male; medical examination; OPG gene; OPN gene; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prediction; protein analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival prediction"
"Statin use in cirrhotic patients with infectious diseases: A population-based study",2019,"Background Recent studies have shown benefits of statins in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, it is still unknown if statins have a beneficial effect on the mortality of cirrhotic patients with bacterial infections. Methods The Taiwan National Health Insurance Database was searched, and 816 cirrhotic patients receiving statins with bacterial infections hospitalized between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013 were included in the study. A one-to-four propensity score matching was performed to select a comparison group based on age, sex, and comorbid disorders. Results The overall 30-day mortalities in statin and non-statin group were 5.3% and 9.8%, respectively (P = 0.001). After Cox regression modeling adjusting for age, sex, and comorbid disorders, the hazard ratio (HR) of statin use on 30-day mortality was 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38–0.72, P<0.001). In subgroup analysis, the 30-day mortality effect of statin use was more pronounced in patients with pneumonia (HR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.19–0.59; P<0.001) and bacteremia (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.35–0.85; P = 0.008). Atovastatin (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37–0.93) and rosuvastatin (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36–0.98) were associated with a decreased 30-day mortality risk compared to patients not taking statins. Conclusions Statin use decreases the 30-day mortality of cirrhotic patients with bacteremia and pneumonia. ? 2019 Hung et al.

"Nonmedical prescription drug use of analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics in Taiwan: Results from the 2014 National Survey of Substance Use",2019,"Nonmedical prescription drug use (NMPDU)has become a major public health issue but little is known in Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of NMPDU in Taiwan. Participants from the 2014 national survey of 17,837 individuals, aged 12 to 64 year, completed anonymously a computer-assisted self-interview. Past-year prescription drug use was divided into medical use only (MUO)and nonmedical use (NMU), defined as using the drug without a prescription, or more frequently, or in larger doses than prescribed. Problematic alcohol use was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), problematic drug use using the 20-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST), and depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Study-Depression (CES-D). The prevalence of past-year NMU was 3.02% for analgesics, 0.71% for sedatives/hypnotics, and 3.66% for either drug, with a very small overlap of NMU between analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics (0.07%). When individuals with NMU were compared to those without NMU (Non-NMU)and those with MUO, respectively, some correlates consistently identified, including young adulthood, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and greater AUDIT's scores for analgesics, as well as hard drug use and greater DAST's scores for sedatives/hypnotics. NMU was associated with greater CES-D's scores for both analgesics and sedatives/hypnotics when compared to Non-NMU but not to MUO. Robust correlates of NMPDU could offer implications for development of prevention strategies of NMPDU. ? 2019","alprazolam; analgesic agent; brotizolam; clonazepam; codeine phosphate; estazolam; fludiazepam; guaifenesin; hypnotic sedative agent; ipratropium bromide; lorazepam; midazolam maleate; morphine; paracetamol plus tramadol; tiotropium bromide; tramadol; triazolam; zaleplon; zolpidem tartrate; adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; child; controlled study; depression; drinking behavior; drug use; Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence; female; human; major clinical study; male; prescription drug misuse; prevalence; priority journal; screening test; smoking; substance use; Taiwan"
"Negative affectivity and social inhibition are associated with increased cardiac readmission in patients with heart failure: A preliminary observation study",2019,"Background Type D personality was hypothesized to influence clinical and patient-centered outcomes patients with heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between negative affectivity and social inhibition components of Type D personality and cardiac readmission in patients with heart failure. Methods A prospective observational study design was used. A total of 222 patients with heart failure were recruited from the department of cardiology in two regional hospitals in Taiwan. The 14-item Type D Scale-Taiwanese version was used to assess negative affectivity and social inhibition of the patients. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association of both Z-score transformed and dichotomized negative affectivity and social inhibition with 6-month and 18-month cardiac readmissions. Results A total of 55 patients (24.8%) and 89 patients (40.1%) had cardiac readmissions within 6 months and 18 months, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses of Z-score transformed negative affectivity and social inhibition were significantly associated with (1) 6-month cardiac readmission with odds ratios of 1.62 (P = 0.003) and 1.48 (P = 0.014), respectively and (2) 18-month cardiac readmission with odds ratios of 1.45 (P = 0.013) and 1.38 (P = 0.031), respectively. Similar findings were obtained when negative affectivity and social inhibition were analyzed as dichotomized scores. Conclusions Negative affectivity and social inhibition components of the Type D personality were significantly associated with a higher risk of cardiac readmission in both 6 months and 18 months after the initial hospitalization in patients with heart failure. ? 2019 Lin et al.

"Magnesium-responsive genes are downregulated in diabetic patients after a three-month exercise program on a bicycle ergometer",2019,"Background: Exercise is an effective therapy for the management of diabetes because it helps regulate glucose and magnesium homeostasis. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts effects on magnesium transport remain unclear. This study investigated the expression of genes encoding magnesium transporters (GMTs) after a three-month exercise program in diabetic patients. Methods: This study was conducted with a within-subject pre-post design. A total of 15 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were recruited and underwent a three-month indoor bicycle exercise program. The expression of five GMTs (CNNM2, TRPM6, TRPM7, SLC41A1, and SLC41A3) was determined in blood samples. Relevant anthropometric values and biochemical parameters were also determined. Results: Although the body weight and body mass index decreased after three months exercise, there were no significant differences. Fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), waist circumference, and magnesium levels decreased after the exercise program (p < 0.05). The expression of SLC41A1 and SLC41A3 were downregulated after exercise, but only CNNM2, TRPM6, and TRPM7 showed significantly decreased expression levels compared with those before the exercise program (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The three-month exercise program ameliorated blood glucose levels and downregulated the expression of magnesium-responsive genes in patients with T2DM.

"Insulin-like growth factor II receptor-α is a novel stress-inducible contributor to cardiac damage underpinning doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress and perturbed mitochondrial autophagy",2019,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline antibiotic commonly employed for the treatment of various cancers. However, its therapeutic uses are hampered by side effects associated with cumulative doses during the course of treatment. Whereas deregulation of autophagy in the myocardium has been involved in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, the role of autophagy in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy remains debated. Our earlier studies have shown that DOX treatment in a rat animal model leads to increased expression of the novel stress-inducible protein insulin-like growth factor II receptor-α (IGF-IIRα) in cardiac tissues, which exacerbated the cardiac injury by enhancing oxidative stress and p53-mediated mitochondria-dependent cardiac apoptosis. Through this study, we investigated the contribution of IGF-IIRα to dysregulation of autophagy in heart using both in vitro H9c2 cells (DOX treated, 1 μM) and in vivo transgenic rat models (DOX treated, 5 mg/kg ip for 6 wk) overexpressing IGF-IIRα specifically in the heart. We found that IGF-IIRα primarily localized to mitochondria, causing increased mitochondrial oxidative stress that was severely aggravated by DOX treatment. This was accompanied by a significant perturbation in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased leakage of cytochrome c, causing increased cleaved caspase-3 activity. There were significant alterations in phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phosphorylated Unc-51 like kinase-1 (p-ULK1), PARKIN, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and p62 proteins, which were more severely disrupted under the combined effect of IGF-IIRα overexpression plus DOX. Finally, Lyso-Tracker Red staining showed that IGF-IIRα overexpression causes lysosomal impairment, which was rescued by rapamycin treatment. Taken together, we found that IGF-IIRα leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant levels, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and perturbed mitochondrial autophagy contributing to DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","beclin 1; caspase 3; cathepsin D; cytochrome c; doxorubicin; heme oxygenase 1; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; manganese superoxide dismutase; microtubule associated protein 1; parkin; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; phosphotransferase; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; PTEN induced kinase 1; sequestosome 1; serine threonine protein kinase ULK1; somatomedin B receptor; somatomedin B receptor alpha; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; doxorubicin; protein insulin like growth factor II receptor alpha; protein light chain 3; protein PTEN induced kinase 1; rapamycin; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cardiomyopathy; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; H9c2(2-1) cell line; heart stress; in vitro study; in vivo study; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitophagy; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein function; protein localization; rat; ubiquitination; animal cell; autophagy; cardiomyopathy; enzyme mechanism; heart injury; heart stress; heart tissue; lysosome; mitochondrial dynamics; protein analysis; protein expression; protein phosphorylation"
"Osteocalcin and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in patients on peritoneal dialysis",2019,"Objective: Vascular calcification is a cardiovascular risk factor in dialysis patients. Vascular calcification involves a complex process of biomineralization resembling osteogenesis, which leads to arterial stiffness. Osteocalcin is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in the bone matrix. It is synthesized in the bone by osteoblasts and reflects the rate of bone formation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum osteocalcin levels and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Materials and Methods: Serum intact osteocalcin and cfPWV were measured in 62 PD patients. Those with CfPWV values >10 m/s were defined as the high central arterial stiffness group, while those with values ?10 m/s were regarded as the low central arterial stiffness group, according to the European Society of Hypertension and of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Results: Seventeen of the 62 PD patients (27.4%) were in the high central arterial stiffness group. The high central arterial stiffness group were older (P = 0.002), had a longer PD vintage (P = 0.018), and had higher serum osteocalcin levels (P = 0.001) than those in the low group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the osteocalcin level (odds ratio: 1.069, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.005-1.137, P = 0.035), PD vintage (odds ratio: 1.028, 95% CI: 1.010-1.048, P = 0.003), and age (odds ratio: 1.081, 95% CI: 1.005-1.162, P = 0.035) were independently associated with central arterial stiffness in PD patients. Among these patients, cfPWV (ρ: 0.216, P = 0.001) values and log-transformed intact parathyroid hormone (ρ: -'0.447, P < 0.001) levels were independently associated with the osteocalcin level in PD patients after multivariate forward stepwise linear regression analysis. Conclusion: Older PD patients with a longer PD vintage and higher serum osteocalcin levels had higher central arterial stiffness as measured by cfPWV. The serum osteocalcin level is an independent marker of central arterial stiffness in PD patients. ? 2018 Tzu Chi Medical Journal","osteocalcin; adult; arterial stiffness; Article; bone matrix; cardiovascular parameters; cardiovascular risk; carotid femoral pulse wave velocity; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hypertension; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multivariate logistic regression analysis; peritoneal dialysis; practice guideline; protein blood level"
"Autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma: Post-transplant outcomes of Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry",2019,"Background/Purpose: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal plasma cell malignancy. The primary choice of treatment for MM is induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This study aimed to analyze the treatment efficacy of ASCT in a Taiwanese cohort and evaluate possible prognostic factors. Methods: From the database of the Taiwan Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, data on 396 patients with MM who underwent ASCT were reviewed. Results: The average age of participants was 54.8 years, and there were more men than women (57.6% vs. 42.4%). Most patients were diagnosed with IgG-type myeloma (52.4%), followed by IgA-type (23.2%) and light-chain type (21.4%). Patients with Durie Salmon Staging System (DSS) III disease accounted for 61.9% of the study cohort, while 23.7% had stage II and 14.4% had stage I disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after ASCT were 46.5 months and 70.4 months, respectively. DSS III was a poor prognostic factor affecting both PFS and OS with a duration of 35.9 months and 69.0 months, respectively, compared with the other two stages (p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively). In addition, patients with better treatment response before ASCT had better PFS and OS compared with those who did not show a response (both p < 0.0001). The overall incidence of organ toxicities associated with transplantation was low. Conclusion: In conclusion, our cohort showed that myeloma patients with early DSS and better treatment response before ASCT had better long-term survival outcomes. ? 2018","immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin light chain; melphalan; antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; bloodstream infection; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cause of death; cohort analysis; cytomegalovirus infection; drug megadose; female; herpes zoster; human; long term survival; major clinical study; male; mucosa inflammation; multiple myeloma; organ injury; overall survival; pneumonia; progression free survival; register; skin infection; transplantation conditioning; treatment response; adolescent; autotransplantation; epidemiology; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; mortality; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; remission; retrospective study; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Multivariate Analysis; Registries; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"The Ribosomal Protein RPLP0 Mediates PLAAT4-induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Cell Apoptosis",2019,"Phospholipase A and acyltransferase 4 (PLAAT4) is a member of the HREV107 tumor suppressor gene family. The expression of PLAAT4 has been shown to induce cell death; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we found that RPLP0, a ribosomal protein, can interact with PLAAT4, as determined by yeast two-hybrid screening, coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization. The level of RPLP0 was suppressed in HtTA cervical cancer cells expressing PLAAT4. In PLAAT4-expressing or RPLP0-silenced cells, decreased cell viability and cell proliferation combined with increased cell death were observed. Furthermore, the levels of cell cycle-associated proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins decreased in PLAAT4-expressing or RPLP0-silenced cells. Similar patterns of cell viability and expression levels of cell-cycle-associated proteins and apoptosis-related proteins were observed in PLAAT4-expressing and RPLP0-knockdown cells, indicating that RPLP0 deficiency might be involved in PLAAT4-mediated growth inhibition and cellular apoptosis. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","cyclin dependent kinase; cycline; PLAAT4 protein, human; protein bcl 2; retinoic acid receptor; ribosome protein; RPLP0 protein, human; small interfering RNA; apoptosis; cell cycle checkpoint; genetics; HeLa cell line; human; metabolism; RNA interference; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases; Cyclins; HeLa Cells; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Receptors, Retinoic Acid; Ribosomal Proteins; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering"
"Association between colorectal cancer and thiazolidinediones administration in a case-control study",2019,"Objectives: This study was designed to assess whether there was an association between colorectal cancer and thiazolidinediones use. Methods: A population-based case-control study was performed using the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. The case group consisted of 20218 type 2 diabetic subjects aged 20 to 84 years with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer between 2000 and 2011. The date of a subject being diagnosed with colorectal cancer was defined as the index date. The control group consisted of 20218 randomly selected type 2 diabetic subjects aged 20 to 84 years without colorectal cancer between 2000 and 2011. A subject who had at least a prescription of thiazolidinediones before the index date was defined as “ever used”. A subject who did not have a prescription of thiazolidinediones before the index date was defined as “never used”. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate the association between colorectal cancer and thiazolidinediones use by the multivariable logistic regression model. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds of thiazolidinediones use in cases with colorectal cancer were lower than the odds of thiazolidinediones use in subjects without colorectal cancer (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99). Conclusions: The odds of thiazolidinediones use in cases with colorectal cancer were lower than subjects without colorectal cancer. A prospective study is required to test whether thiazolidinediones use has a protective effect against colorectal cancer. ? Author(s) 2019.

"Complication rates after chorionic villus sampling and midtrimester amniocentesis: A 7-year national registry study",2019,"Purpose: To assess the complication rates following chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and midtrimester amniocentesis in Taiwan. Methods: This is a national registry-based cohort study from Taiwan. We included all women with singleton pregnancies who received either CVS (n = 1409) or midtrimester amniocentesis (n = 250,566) during 2006–2012. We assessed preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), infection and spontaneous abortion (SA) that occurred within fourteen days after the procedures. We also assessed the risks of preterm delivery and miscarriage before 24 gestational weeks after amniocentesis. These complications were collected from the Genetic Disease Database of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan National Birth Certificate Registry, and the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Pearson χ2 tests were used to compare the distributions between groups. Results: For patients who underwent midtrimester amniocentesis, the rates of PPROM, IUFD, infection and SA within fourteen days were 0.24%, 0.11%, 0.05%, and 0.05%, respectively. Women with a normal fetal karyotype had a preterm birth rate (&lt;37 gestational weeks) of 9.38%. The miscarriage rate (&lt;24 gestational weeks) was 0.68%, which was 0.22% higher than those who did not receive the invasive procedures (p &lt; 0.0001). After CVS, the IUFD rate was 1.68%, and the SA rate within fourteen days was 0.77%. Conclusion: The use of our large cohort demonstrated that the procedure-related complication rates were comparable to recent review or meta-analysis. This dataset might facilitate counselling in women who consider invasive genetic diagnostic procedures. ? 2019","adult; amniocentesis; Article; chorion villus sampling; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; fetus death; gestational age; hemophilia; human; iatrogenic disease; infection; invasive procedure; karyotype; low birth weight; major clinical study; maternal age; population research; pregnant woman; premature fetus membrane rupture; premature labor; prenatal diagnosis; second trimester pregnancy; spinal muscular atrophy; spontaneous abortion; Taiwan; thalassemia; treatment indication; adverse event; amniocentesis; chorion villus sampling; labor complication; pregnancy; premature fetus membrane rupture; prematurity; register; risk factor; second trimester pregnancy; spontaneous abortion; Abortion, Spontaneous; Adult; Amniocentesis; Chorionic Villi Sampling; Female; Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture; Gestational Age; Humans; Obstetric Labor Complications; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Premature Birth; Registries; Risk Factors; Taiwan"
"Factors associated with disease-specific quality of life in Taiwanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Objective The aim of this study was to assess the factors associated with disease-specific quality of life in Taiwanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting A regional teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. Participants Adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis recruited from the outpatient rheumatology clinics of the study hospital. Primary outcome measure Disease-specific quality of life assessed by the Evaluation of Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (EASi-QoL). Results Of the 265 patients, 57% were 20-49 years of age, with a male preponderance (75.5%). Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that a higher disease activity, assessed by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score, was significantly and independently associated with a lower quality of life in all four domains (physical function, disease activity, emotional well-being and social participation) of the EASi-QoL. In addition, various independent factors, including educational level, nature of occupation, disease duration, dietary habit and body mass index, were significantly associated with different domains of the EASi-QoL. Conclusions Our findings indicated that, in addition to disease activity and perceived health status, a number of other factors could significantly impact the different aspects of quality of life in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, which warrant special consideration and support from healthcare providers. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

"HCV reinfections after viral clearance among HIV-positive patients with recent HCV infection in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Higher rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) reinfection after viral clearance have been well described among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Europe. The epidemiology of HCV reinfection, however, has rarely been investigated among HIV-positive patients in Asia-Pacific region. Methods: We retrospectively identified HIV-positive patients with recent HCV infection who had cleared their primary infection, either spontaneously or via treatment, between January 2011 and May 2018. All included patients were observed until 31 March 2019. HCV reinfection was defined as recurrent HCV viraemia after achieving viral clearance with anti-HCV treatment or after spontaneous clearance. Results: During the study period, 219 HIV-positive patients (90.4% MSM) were diagnosed with recent HCV infection. Viral clearance with successful treatment was achieved in 108 patients (49.3%) and spontaneous clearance occurred in 20 (9.1%); of them, 18 (14.1%) acquired HCV reinfections, resulting in an incidence rate of 8.2 per 100 person-years of follow-up (95% CI 5.2-13.1). With the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, we found a higher reinfection risk in patients with syphilis (adjusted hazard ratio 10.3, 95% CI 1.4-77.8, P?=.023) compared to those without syphilis. HCV RNA testing, if performed only following syphilis and elevated aminotransferases, might miss 44.4% and 33.3% of HCV reinfections, respectively. Conclusions: Similar to the findings in Europe, we observed a high incidence of HCV reinfection among HIV-positive Taiwanese with recent HCV infection, which was significantly associated with syphilis. To identify HCV reinfections, annual HCV RNA testing should be instituted instead of testing driven by symptoms, syphilis or elevated aminotransferases. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Influence of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on long-term outcome in patients with stable coronary artery disease receiving percutaneous coronary intervention",2019,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a life-threatening medical emergency which needs urgent medical attention. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is common and necessary for patients with CAD. The effect of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on long-term outcomes in patients with stable CAD receiving PCI is unclear.In this study, patients with stable CAD who underwent PCI were prospectively divided into 4 groups according to the presence or absence of diabetes or hypercholesterolemia. Clinical characteristics, risk factors, medications, angiographic findings, and outcome predictors were analyzed and long-term outcomes compared between groups.Of the 1676 patients studied, those with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes had the highest all-cause mortality rate after PCI (P?<?.01); those with diabetes only had the highest cardiovascular (CV) mortality (P?<?.01). However, the 4 groups did not differ in rates of myocardial infarction (MI) or repeated PCI. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with diabetes only had the highest rates of all-cause mortality and CV mortality (both P?<?.001). In the Cox proportional hazard model, patients with both hypercholesterolemia and diabetes had the highest risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.70), but groups did not differ in rates of MI, CV mortality, and repeated PCI.With or without hypercholesterolemia, diabetes adversely impacts long-term outcomes in patients receiving PCI. Diabetes mellitus seemed to be a more hazardous outcome predictor than hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia and diabetes seemed to have an additive effect on all-cause mortality in patients after receiving PCI.","case control study; comorbidity; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hypercholesterolemia; Kaplan Meier method; male; mortality; percutaneous coronary intervention; proportional hazards model; prospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; Case-Control Studies; Comorbidity; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome"

Methods: A human cell line (PANC-1) derived from the pancreatic ductal epithelium was used in this study. After transduction of OATP1B3, the cellular physiological functions and the ability of intracellular uptake of the MRI contrast medium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) were examined. Induced differentiation of the PANC-1 cells into hormone-secreting cells were performed to simulate pancreatic β-like cells. The hormone-secreting cells were implanted into rats and in vivo MRI was evaluated. Results: The mRNA and proteins of OATP1B3 were highly expressed. No significant change of cellular physiological functions was found after the expression. After induced differentiation, the hormone secretion capacities of the OATP1B3-expressing PANC-1 cells were confirmed. Intra-cellular uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA was determined in vitro by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and MRI. In vivo MRI of the OATP1B3-expressing xenograft revealed an increased signal intensity after contrast enhancement. Conclusion: OATP1B3 can be used as a safe and feasible in vivo MRI gene reporter for human pancreatic ductal cells. ? 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","gadoxetic acid; messenger RNA; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B3; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell differentiation; cell function; contrast enhancement; controlled study; feasibility study; female; gene expression; genetic transduction; hormone release; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; OATP1B3 gene; PANC-1 cell line; protein expression; reporter gene; tumor xenograft"
"Humoral immunity to mumps in a highly vaccinated population in Taiwan",2019,"Background: A resurgence of mumps was noted recently and outbreaks were increasingly reported in populations with high vaccine coverage. We aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence to mumps in Taiwan, where a two-dose childhood mumps-containing vaccine program, with a high coverage rate, had been implemented for >20 years. Methods: The anti-mumps IgG was determined in 3552 participants of all ages in Taiwan. The age-specific seropositivity rates were calculated and the sociodemographic variables associated with the seronegative sera were analyzed with a logistic regression method. Results: The overall seroprevalence to mumps was 71%, with a higher rate in adults ?19 years old than in the pediatric population <19 years old (80.4% versus 62.0%, P < 0.0001). In participants aged 2–20 years, who had been given at least one mumps-containing vaccine, the seropositivity fluctuated across different age subgroups and the lowest rate (36.8%) occurred in the 17–18 years age group. The multivariate analysis identified age within 17–18 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 8.598, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.990–24.722, P < 0.0001), within 19–20 years (aOR 5.076, 95% CI 1.702–15.133, P = 0.0080), and being a resident of the suburban area of northern Taiwan (aOR 1.089, 95% CI 0.823–1.414, P = 0.0008) as independent factors associated with an increased risk of seronegative sera. Conclusion: The seropositivity to mumps was unexpectedly low in highly vaccinated generations, and with a significant geographical discrepancy in Taiwan, which may have been responsible for the sustained reports of mumps cases in Taiwan. ? 2017","immunoglobulin G; measles mumps rubella vaccine; immunoglobulin G; mumps vaccine; virus antibody; adolescent; adult; age; antibody titer; Article; child; educational status; female; human; humoral immunity; immunoassay; infection risk; major clinical study; male; mumps; risk factor; seroprevalence; suburban area; Taiwan; vaccination; aged; blood; epidemic; humoral immunity; immunology; infant; middle aged; mumps; preschool child; risk factor; seroepidemiology; vaccination coverage; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Immunoglobulin G; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Mumps; Mumps Vaccine; Risk Factors; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Taiwan; Vaccination Coverage; Young Adult"

"Atractylodin Suppresses Dendritic Cell Maturation and Ameliorates Collagen-Induced Arthritis in a Mouse Model",2019,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of atractylodin, a polyethylene alkyne, on the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC) as well as its antirheumatic effect on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1 mice. Our results indicate that atractylodin effectively suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, expression of costimulatory molecules, and p38 MAPK, ERK, and NF-κBp65 signaling pathways in LPS-incubated dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, the proliferation and cytokine secretion (IFN-γand IL-17A) of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were reduced. In a murine CIA model, intraperitoneal injection of atractylodin significantly alleviated the severity of the disease progression, as indicated by reduced paw swelling, clinical arthritis scores, and pathological changes of joint tissues. In addition, the overall proliferation of T cells stimulated by type II collagen and the abundance of Th1 and Th17 in the spleens were also significantly decreased with atractylodin treatments. Furthermore, atractylodin significantly downregulated the expression levels of CD40, CD80, and CD86 of DCs in the spleens. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that atractylodin has potential to manipulate the maturation of BM-DCs and should be further explored as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell signaling; Collagen; Cytology; Diseases; Mammals; Thorium compounds; atractylodin; Collagen-induced arthritis; Costimulatory molecules; Dendritic cells; Immunomodulatory effects; Intraperitoneal injections; maturation; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; T-cells; atractylodin; collagen type 2; furan derivative; gamma interferon; interleukin 17; transcription factor RelA; animal; Atractylodes; C57BL mouse; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; chemically induced; chemistry; cytology; DBA mouse; dendritic cell; disease model; drug effect; genetics; human; immunology; male; mouse; pathophysiology; rheumatoid arthritis; Th17 cell; Animals; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Atractylodes; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Collagen Type II; Dendritic Cells; Disease Models, Animal; Furans; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-17; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred DBA; Th17 Cells; Transcription Factor RelA"
"Acute myocardial infarction hospitalizations between cold and hot seasons in an island across tropical and subtropical climate zones—a population-based study",2019,"We investigated the effects of cold and hot seasons on hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at the junction of tropical and subtropical climate zones. The hospitalization data of 6897 AMI patients from January 1997 to December 2011 were obtained from the database of the National Health Insurance, including date of admission, gender, age, and comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia. A comparison of AMI prevalence between seasons and the association of season-related AMI occurrences with individual variables were assessed. AMI hospitalizations in the cold season (cold-season-AMIs) were significantly greater than those in the hot season (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.10–1.21). In the subtropical region, cold-season-AMIs were strongly and significantly associated with the ?65 years group (OR1.28; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.48). In the tropical region, cold-season-AMIs, in association with dyslipidemia relative to non-dyslipidemia, were significantly strong in the non-DM group (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.09) but weak in the DM group (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99). The cold season shows increased risks for AMI, markedly among the ?65 years cohort in the subtropical region, and among the patients diagnosed with either DM or dyslipidemia but not both in the tropical region. Age and comorbidity of metabolic dysfunction influence the season-related incidences of AMI in different climatic regions. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Hematologic markers as prognostic factors in nonmetastatic esophageal cancer patients under concurrent chemoradiotherapy",2019,"Nonmetastatic esophageal cancer can demonstrate a high local recurrence rate even under the standard treatment. We evaluated platelet counts before and after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio for predicting esophageal cancer prognosis under CCRT. Newly diagnosed patients with esophageal cancer (stages IA-IIIC) who underwent CCRT during January 2013-December 2017 were enrolled. The data were collected retrospectively. Overall survival (OS), time to progressive disease (TPD), and time to metastasis (TM) were recorded for indicating prognosis. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. In total, 105 patients were enrolled. The stages of esophageal cancer and surgery were associated with prognosis (i.e., OS, TPD, and TM). Based on TPD and TM, women had better prognosis than men. In the univariate analysis, high pre- and post-CCRT platelet counts (>300,000/μL), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as well as low lymphocyte percentage were significantly associated with poor prognosis. However, in the multivariate analysis, only post-CCRT high platelet count (>300,000/μL) remained significantly associated with poor prognosis (P =.041,.045, and.023 for OS, TPD, and TM, respectively). Poor prognosis was observed in patients with high platelet counts, PLR, NLR, and low lymphocyte percentage. Surgery was an independent factor predicting better prognosis. Our findings may have clinical significance with regard to therapeutic decision-making. ? 2019 Yi-Feng Wu et al.","hemoglobin; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer surgery; chemoradiotherapy; disease duration; esophagus cancer; female; follow up; hematological parameters; human; human tissue; imaging; Kaplan Meier method; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; metastasis; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; overall survival; platelet count; platelet lymphocyte ratio; prognostic assessment; retrospective study; very elderly; blood; drug effect; esophagus tumor; lymphocyte; lymphocyte count; middle aged; neutrophil; pathology; prognosis; radiation response; thrombocyte; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Blood Platelets; Chemoradiotherapy; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymphocyte Count; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Neutrophils; Platelet Count; Prognosis"
"Breast Tumor Detection and Classification Using Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Hyperspectral Imaging Techniques",2019,"Breast cancer is a main cause of disease and death for women globally. Because of the limitations of traditional mammography and ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gradually become an important radiological method for breast cancer assessment over the past decades. MRI is free of the problems related to radiation exposure and provides excellent image resolution and contrast. However, a disadvantage is the injection of contrast agent, which is toxic for some patients (such as patients with chronic renal disease or pregnant and lactating women). Recent findings of gadolinium deposits in the brain are also a concern. To address these issues, this paper develops an intravoxel incoherent motion- (IVIM-) MRI-based histogram analysis approach, which takes advantage of several hyperspectral techniques, such as the band expansion process (BEP), to expand a multispectral image to hyperspectral images and create an automatic target generation process (ATGP). After automatically finding suspected targets, further detection was attained by using kernel constrained energy minimization (KCEM). A decision tree and histogram analysis were applied to classify breast tissue via quantitative analysis for detected lesions, which were used to distinguish between three categories of breast tissue: malignant tumors (i.e., central and peripheral zone), cysts, and normal breast tissues. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed IVIM-MRI-based histogram analysis approach can effectively differentiate between these three breast tissue types. ? 2019 Si-Wa Chan et al.","Article; breast cancer; breast cyst; breast tissue; decision tree; diffusion weighted imaging; histogram; image analysis; image processing; intravoxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imagin histogram; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis; radiological parameters; tumor classification; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image enhancement; mammography; pathology; procedures; three-dimensional imaging; contrast medium; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mammography"

"G-CSF enhances the therapeutic potency of stem cells transplantation in spinal cord-injured rats",2019,"Aim: The therapeutic effects of human wisdom teeth-derived neuronal stem cell (tNSC) cotreatment with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were evaluated for contusion-induced spinal cord injury in rats. Materials & methods: 7 days after contusion, tNSCs were transplanted to the injury site and followed by G-CSF cotreatment for 5 days. Behavioral deficits were evaluated by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan test. The injury site was collected for immunohistochemistry analysis. Results: The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan test significantly improved in the cotreated group compared with the tNSCs or G-CSF single treatment groups. However, inflammation indices did not differ among the three groups. In vitro experiment demonstrated that tNSCs express both G-CSF and its relevant receptor. G-CSF enhanced tNSC proliferation and neurotrophins secretion in vitro. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that G-CSF enhances neurotrophins secretion of tNSCs, and might help improving functional recovery from spinal cord injury in rats if they were given together. ? 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor; lenograstim; neurotrophin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Basso Beattie and Bresnahan test; behavior disorder; cell proliferation; controlled study; contusion; experimental behavioral test; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; inflammation; injection; male; motor function test; neural stem cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein secretion; rat; spinal cord injury; stem cell transplantation; third molar; treatment duration"
"Does Compulsory Admission Prevent Inpatient Suicide Among Patients with Schizophrenia? A Nationwide Cohort Study in Taiwan",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of inpatient suicide in patients with schizophrenia during 2007–2013 and to determine putative risk factors. Methods: We conducted a national population-based cohort study of 2,038 psychiatric inpatients in their first compulsory admission, matched with 8,152 controls who were voluntary inpatients. Only patients with schizophrenia were included in the study. We used data derived from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Database 2005, comprising 1?million beneficiaries randomly selected from the entire population of Taiwan. Results: During the follow-up period, 23 and 75 inpatient suicides were observed in the compulsory and control groups, respectively. Kaplan–Meier curves showed that the cumulative incidence rate of inpatient suicide was not significantly different between compulsory and voluntary admissions (log-rank test, p?=.206). Conclusions: Our results suggest that compulsory admission has no protective effects on risk reduction of inpatient suicide for patients with schizophrenia who are compulsorily admitted compared with voluntarily admitted controls. Clinicians should be more alert for the prevention of inpatient suicide among patients with schizophrenia and consider the close monitoring of inpatient suicide risk in the first week of admission. ? 2018 The American Association of Suicidology","adult; cohort analysis; female; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; involuntary commitment; Kaplan Meier method; male; middle aged; procedures; psychology; risk factor; schizophrenia; suicide; Taiwan; Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Inpatients; Involuntary Treatment; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Admission; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Suicide; Taiwan"
"Epigenetic targeting DNMT1 of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using interstitial control release biodegrading polymer reduced tumor growth through hedgehog pathway inhibition",2019,"Annually, 48,000 people die from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ranking it the fourth among cancer-related deaths in the United States. Currently, anti-cancer drugs are not effective against PDAC, and only extends survival by 3 months. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play an important role during carcinogenesis in PDAC, with approximately 80% of tumor overexpressing the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein. In the present study, we used DNMTs as a screening platform to find a new DNMT inhibitor, n-butylidenephthalide (n-BP), which is identified from a Chinese herbal drug. n-BP could inhibit DNMT1 expression in both dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. It also displays an effect in suppressing growth of PDAC cells and inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase leading apoptosis. Growth suppression can be restored by the overexpression of DNMT1 in PDAC cells. Furthermore, we found n-BP-mediated DNMT1 suppression influenced the protein stability rather than changing the RNA expression. Through microarray studies, we found that the patched domain contained 4 (PTCHD4) is the potential downstream gene of DNMT1. Following silencing of PTCHD4 expression by siRNA, n-BP decreased tumor growth inhibition. Finally, in vivo, two animal models were used to evaluate the efficacy and survival after n-BP treatment by interstitial control release polymer delivery. The results show that n-BP could effectively inhibit PDAC tumor volume growth and extend animal survival. In summary, n-BP may inhibit the growth of human PDAC cells though reducing DNMT1 and increasing the expression of PTCHD4 both in vitro and in vivo. ? 2018 The Authors","antineoplastic agent; Chinese drug; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; enzyme inhibitor; herbaceous agent; n butylidenephthalide; patched domain contained 4 protein; polymer; regulator protein; small interfering RNA; sonic hedgehog protein; unclassified drug; butylidenephthalide; DNA methyltransferase; phthalic anhydride; polymer; PTCH53 protein, human; repressor protein; sonic hedgehog protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; biodegradation; cancer inhibition; cancer model; cancer size; cancer survival; carcinoma cell; cell cycle arrest; concentration response; controlled release formulation; controlled study; DNMT1 gene; dose response; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug screening; drug targeting; epigenetics; G0 phase cell cycle arrest; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas adenocarcinoma; priority journal; protein expression; protein stability; treatment response time; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Bagg albino mouse; genetic epigenesis; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Modification Methylases; Epigenesis, Genetic; Hedgehog Proteins; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Phthalic Anhydrides; Polymers; Repressor Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering"
"Bathtub drowning mortality among older adults in Japan",2019,"We examined the bathtub drowning mortality among older adults in Japan. Mortality data from Japan and 30 other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were extracted from World Health Organization Cause of Death Query Online. During 2012–2014, unintentional drowning mortality rates in Japan were 9.5, 28.2 and 39.7 per 100,000 population for adults aged 65–74, 75–84 and ?85 years, respectively—rates highest among the 31 OECD countries. In total, 6377 older adults aged ?65 years died from unintentional drowning in 2014, of which 4857 (76%) deaths involved bathtubs. During 1995–2014, the bathtub drowning mortality rate for adults aged ?65 years was stable in Japan. During 2011–2014, approximately 4800 older adults died from bathtub drowning annually. Death predominantly occurred ‘while in a bathtub’, rather than ‘following a fall into a bathtub’. In 2014, 95% and 87% of bathtub drowning deaths among older women and men aged ?65 years, respectively, occurred at home. In conclusion, bathtub drowning deaths at home is an important public health problem among older adults Japanese and efforts are needed to reduce these preventable deaths. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","aged; bath; drowning; epidemiology; female; home accident; human; Japan; male; mortality; very elderly; Accidents, Home; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Baths; Drowning; Female; Humans; Japan; Male"

"Risk for a second primary hypopharyngeal and esophageal cancer after an initial primary oral cancer",2019,"Objective: To investigate the risk for second primary cancer in the hypopharynx and esophagus (SPC-HE) among individuals with an initial oral/oropharyngeal cancer. Materials and Methods: Mass screening data from Taiwan (2004–2009) included individuals who were ?18?years old and smoked cigarettes and/or chewed betel quid. Occurrence of SPC-HE was monitored until December 31, 2014. Results were expressed as adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: One hundred and fifty-eight out of 4,494 subjects with oral cancer developed SPC-HE (incidence rate: 6.47 per 1,000 person-years). Relative to patients with primary cancers in the lip, the risk of an SPC-HE was higher in patients with primary cancers in oropharynx (aRR: 19.98, 95% CI: 4.72–84.55), floor of mouth (aRR: 12.13, 95% CI: 2.67–55.15), and hard palate (aRR: 7.31, 95% CI: 1.65–32.37), but not in patients with cancers in tongue (aRR: 3.67, 95% CI: 0.89–15.17) or gum (aRR: 3.99, 95% CI: 0.92–17.35). Regression analyses also showed the risk of an SPC-HE was greater in alcohol drinkers than those who did not (aRR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.10–2.48). Conclusions: Compared with the initial cancer in the lip, patients with a cancer in the oropharynx, floor of mouth, and hard palate had a higher risk for the SPC-HE. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"β-catenin/LEF1/IGF-IIR Signaling Axis Galvanizes the Angiotensin-II-induced Cardiac Hypertrophy",2019,"Cardiovascular diseases have a high prevalence worldwide and constitute the leading causes of mortality. Recently, malfunctioning of β-catenin signaling has been addressed in hypertensive heart condition. Ang-II is an important mediator of cardiovascular remodeling processes which not only regulates blood pressure but also leads to pathological cardiac changes. However, the contribution of Ang-II/β-catenin axis in hypertrophied hearts is ill-defined. Employing in vitro H9c2 cells and in vivo spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) cardiac tissue samples, western blot analysis, luciferase assays, nuclear-cytosolic protein extracts, and immunoprecipitation assays, we found that under hypertensive condition β-catenin gets abnormally induced that co-activated LEF1 and lead to cardiac hypertrophy changes by up-regulating the IGF-IIR signaling pathway. We identified putative LEF1 consensus binding site on IGF-IIR promoter that could be regulated by β-catenin/LEF1 which in turn modulate the expression of cardiac hypertrophy agents. This study suggested that suppression of β-catenin expression under hypertensive condition could be exploited as a clinical strategy for cardiac pathological remodeling processes. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Ramipril and resveratrol co-treatment attenuates RhoA/ROCK pathway-regulated early-stage diabetic nephropathy-associated glomerulosclerosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats",2019,"Clinical studies have shown that hyperglycemia can induce early-stage diabetic nephropathy (DN). Furthermore, oxidative stress, tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix accumulation promote the progression of DN to chronic kidney disease and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. It is necessary to initiate treatment at the early stages of DN or even during the early stages of diabetes. In this work, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) presented early DN symptoms within 45 days, and collagen accumulation in the glomerulus of the rats was primarily mediated through the RhoA/ROCK pathway instead of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Resveratrol (15 mg/kg/day) and ramipril (10 mg/kg/day) co-treatment of STZ-induced DN rats showed that glomerulosclerosis in early-stage DN was reversible (P <.05 compared with that in STZ-induced DM rats). The results of this study support early intervention in diabetes or DN as a more efficient therapeutic strategy. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Diseases; Resveratrol; Chronic kidney disease; Collagen accumulation; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic nephropathy; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Extracellular matrices; Glomerulosclerosis; Ramipril; Rats; collagen; phr 1446; r 5010; ramipril; resveratrol; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; transforming growth factor beta; ramipril; resveratrol; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; streptozocin; collagen; diabetes; disease treatment; drug; physiological response; rodent; signaling; animal tissue; Article; combination drug therapy; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; disease course; early intervention; glomerulosclerosis; glomerulus; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; animal; chemically induced; complication; diabetic nephropathy; disease exacerbation; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; focal glomerulosclerosis; kidney; male; metabolism; pathology; severity of illness index; Sprague Dawley rat; Rattus; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetic Nephropathies; Disease Progression; Drug Therapy, Combination; Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental; Kidney; Male; Ramipril; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Resveratrol; rho-Associated Kinases; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Severity of Illness Index; Signal Transduction; Streptozocin"
"Videourodynamic factors predictive of successful onabotulinumtoxinA urethral sphincter injection for neurogenic or non-neurogenic detrusor underactivity",2019,"Objective: The aim of the present study was to analyze treatment outcomes and identify videourodynamic factors predictive of successful urethral onabotulinumtoxinA treatment of neurogenic and non-neurogenic detrusor underactivity (DU). Methods: Patients with DU refractory to medical treatment were treated with injections totaling 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA into the urethral sphincter. Treatment outcomes were assessed 1 month after treatment using the Global Response Assessment. The videourodynamic parameters evaluated included bladder neck status during voiding, bladder sensation, detrusor pressure, maximum flow rate, and post-void residual volume. Treatment outcome was analyzed by patient and baseline videourodynamic characteristics. Results: In all, 60 patients (27 with non-neurogenic and 33 with neurogenic DU) were included in the study and received urethral sphincter injections of 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA in total. Good outcomes were reported in 36 (60%) patients (20 [74.1%] with non-neurogenic and 16 [48.5%] with neurogenic DU). Treatment outcome was significantly better in patients with non-neurogenic than neurogenic DU (P =.039). However, good treatment outcome was not related to age, gender, or any videourodynamic variables, except for an open bladder neck during voiding vs non-opening bladder neck (94.3% vs. 12.0%; P <.0001). The duration of the therapeutic effect was similar between patients with non-neurogenic and neurogenic DU (mean [± SD] 7.37 ± 3.69 vs. 7.69 ± 3.18 months, respectively; P =.788). In all, 12 patients reported de novo urinary incontinence after urethral onabotulinumtoxinA injection, 4 of whom developed stress urinary incontinence and 8 who had exacerbated urgency urinary incontinence. Conclusion: Urethral sphincter injection of onabotulinumtoxinA is effective in 60% of patients with DU. Careful videourodynamic interpretation of bladder neck opening enables urologists to select appropriate candidates for onabotulinumtoxinA treatment. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","botulinum toxin A; botulinum toxin A; urinary tract agent; adult; aged; Article; bladder neck; bladder pressure; bladder sphincter; controlled study; disease exacerbation; female; human; hypotonic bladder; major clinical study; male; micturition; neurogenic bladder; non neurogenic bladder; non neurogenic bladder; postvoid residual urine volume; predictor variable; priority journal; retrospective study; stress incontinence; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment response; urinary urgency; urine flow rate; urodynamics; videorecording; complication; injection; middle aged; neurogenic bladder; off label drug use; pathophysiology; physiology; urethra; urine retention; urodynamics; videorecording; Aged; Botulinum Toxins, Type A; Female; Humans; Injections; Male; Middle Aged; Off-Label Use; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Urethra; Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic; Urinary Bladder, Underactive; Urinary Retention; Urodynamics; Urological Agents; Video Recording"

Materials and Methods: The study utilized a prospective observational cohort design. Thirty-three PD patients with a good levodopa response but drug-related morbidity were included. PD Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) scores, unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) scores, Hoehn and Yahr stages, Beck Depression Inventory-II scores, and levodopa equivalent daily doses (LEDD) were obtained at baseline and 1 year after surgery. Results: The enrolled patients showed a significant HRQoL improvement of 21.43% at 12 months after STN-DBS as assessed by the PDQ-39 total score. There was a 34.92% improvement in UPDRS scores after STN-DBS at 1 year follow-up. Subitem analysis revealed significant improvement in UPDRS part II, III, and IV scores. The LEDD was significantly reduced by up to 27.36% 12 months after surgery. The preoperative PDQ-39 total score and LEDD predicted postoperative HRQoL in PD following STN-DBS. Conclusions: The current study demonstrated that STN-DBS surgery significantly improved HRQoL and motor outcomes of patients with PD.

"Repeated intravesical injections of platelet-rich plasma are effective in the treatment of interstitial cystitis: a case control pilot study",2019,"Objective: Interstitial cystitis (IC), also known as bladder pain syndrome (BPS), is a debilitating chronic disease. There are few treatment options for IC/BPS refractory to current medical therapy. This study investigated the clinical efficacy of intravesical injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in IC/BPS. Methods: Fifteen patients with IC/BPS received 4 intravesical injections, at 1-monthly intervals, of 12 mL PRP extracted from 50 mL of the patient's whole blood, followed by cystoscopic hydrodistention. The primary endpoint was the change in O’Leary-Sant symptom (OSS) index from baseline to 1 month after the 4th PRP injection. Secondary endpoints were changes in pain (measured using a visual analog scale [VAS]), daily frequency, nocturia, functional bladder capacity (FBC), maximum flow rate, voided volume, post-void residual (PVR) volume, and global response assessment (GRA). Urinary cytokine levels were measured at baseline and 1 month after the 1st PRP treatment. Results: Of the 15 women in the study, 13 completed the 4 injections and follow-up visits (mean [± SD] age 52.9 ± 12.1 years). The OSS index and VAS pain score decreased significantly and FBC and GRA increased after the 1st PRP injection and lasted until the final endpoint. There was no change in PVR after repeated PRP injections, and all patients were free of urinary tract infections and difficulty urinating. Urinary interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 concentrations increased significantly after the 1st PRP injection. In patients with reductions in the VAS pain score ?1, urinary IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor increased. In patients without reductions in the VAS pain score, IL-6 concentrations increased after PRP injection. Conclusions: Repeated intravesical PRP injections are well tolerated and appear to be safe and effective in medically refractive IC/BPS, providing significant symptom improvement. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","cytokine; interleukin 2; interleukin 8; vasculotropin; adult; Article; bladder capacity; bladder distension; case control study; cell isolation; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; cystoscopy; cytokine urine level; female; follow up; hospital based case control study; human; human cell; interleukin 2 urine level; interleukin 8 urine level; interstitial cystitis; micturition disorder; nocturia; O Leary Sant symptom index; pain assessment; pilot study; postvoid residual urine volume; priority journal; protein urine level; retreatment; therapy effect; thrombocyte rich plasma; urinary tract infection; urine flow rate; urine volume; visual analog scale; interstitial cystitis; intravesical drug administration; middle aged; treatment outcome; Administration, Intravesical; Case-Control Studies; Cystitis, Interstitial; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Platelet-Rich Plasma; Treatment Outcome"

Methods: We made a cross-sectional examination of the sex-specific relationship using 6728 men and 766 women, aged 18-50 years from a large military cohort in Taiwan. SUA levels within the reference range (<7.0 mg/dL for men and <5.7 mg/dL for women respectively) were divided into quartiles and SUA levels greater than the upper reference limits were defined as hyperuricemia. Elevated ALT levels were defined as ?40 U/L. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between each SUA category and elevated ALT levels in men and women, respectively. Results: The prevalence of hyperuricemia and elevated ALT in men were 18.7% and 12.7%, respectively, and in women were 3.3% and 2.1%, respectively. As compared with the lowest SUA quartile, hyperuricemia was associated with elevated ALT in men (odds ratios (OR): 1.62, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.19-2.20) after controlling for age, service specialty, body mass index, metabolic syndrome components, current cigarette smoking, alcohol intake status, and weekly exercise times, but the associations for the other SUA quartiles were null. By contrast, the associations of hyperuricemia (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.10-6.64) and the other SUA quartiles with elevated ALT were null in women. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the relationship between each SUA level and elevated ALT may differ by sex among military young adults. The mechanism for the sex difference requires further investigations. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","alanine aminotransferase; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; alanine aminotransferase; biological marker; uric acid; adult; anthropometric parameters; area under the curve; army; Article; blood biochemistry; blood pressure; body mass; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; disease association; exercise; female; hospital admission; hyperuricemia; male; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; sex factor; smoking; uric acid blood level; adolescent; blood; cardiorespiratory fitness; human; middle aged; physiology; sexual characteristics; soldier; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alanine Transaminase; Biomarkers; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Retrospective Studies; Sex Characteristics; Uric Acid; Young Adult"
"Molecular basis for the association between depression and circadian rhythm",2019,"Depression is a life-threatening psychiatric disorder and a major public health concern worldwide with an incidence of 5% and a lifetime prevalence of 15%-20%. It is related with the social disability, decreased quality of life, and a high incidence of suicide. Along with increased depressive cases, health care cost in treating patients suffering from depression has also surged. Previous evidence have reported that depressed patients often exhibit altered circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythm involves physical, mental, and behavioral changes in a daily cycle, and is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus in responding to light and darkness in an environment. Circadian rhythm disturbance in depressive patients causes early morning waking, sleep disturbances, diurnal mood variation, changes of the mean core temperature, endocrine release, and metabolic functions. Many medical interventions have been used to treat depression; however, several adverse effects are noted. This article reviews the types, causes of depression, mechanism of circadian rhythm, and the relationship between circadian rhythm disturbance with depression. Pharmaceutical and alternative interventions used to treat depressed patients are also discussed. ? 2019 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","antidepressant agent; behavior change; chronotherapy; circadian rhythm; circadian rhythm disturbance; core temperature; daily life activity; darkness; depression; disease classification; environment; genetic association; health care cost; hormone release; human; hypothalamus; light; mental health; metabolism; molecular biology; mood change; nonhuman; pathophysiology; prevalence; Review; social disability; suprachiasmatic nucleus; wakefulness"
"Vascular fibrinoid necrosis in the urinary bladder of ketamine abusers: A new finding that may provide a clue to the pathogenesis of ketamine-induced vesicopathy",2019,"Two 31-year-old women who had abused ketamine, 1 for 8 years and 1 for 5 years, presented with ketamine-induced vesicopathy with urinary frequency, decreased bladder capacity, and detrusor overactivity. An enterocystoplasty was performed in both cases. The pathology of the urinary bladders in both women showed ulcerative cystitis and fibrinoid necrosis of vessels; the latter was confirmed by Masson trichrome staining. Fibrinoid necrosis of vessels is a kind of immune complex-mediated vasculitis that induces the release of inflammatory mediators, with subsequent thrombosis, ischemic injury, and eventual tissue necrosis in localized areas, the so-called Arthus reaction. The new finding of fibrinoid necrosis in the urinary bladders of ketamine abusers may provide a new clue to the pathogenesis of ketamine-induced vesicopathy. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","ketamine; ketamine; adult; adventitia; Article; bladder biopsy; bladder capacity; bladder disease; bladder mucosal tearing; bladder muscle; bladder surgery; bladder wall; bladder wall thickening; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; cystectomy; cystitis; cystography; cystoscopic hydrodistension; cystoscopy; disease duration; drug abuse; drug induced disease; enterocystoplasty; eosinophil; female; hematuria; human; human cell; human tissue; hypervascularization; intermittent hematuria; ketamine induced vesicopathy; lamina propria; lymphocyte; Masson trichrome staining; maximal bladder capacity; medical history; micturition; necrosis; nerve bundle hyperplasia; neuropathy; neutrophil; nocturia; onset age; overactive bladder; pathogenesis; pelvic pain; perivesical infiltration; priority journal; staining; submucosa; ulcerative cystitis; ureteral orifice; urinary frequency; urinary tract hemorrhage; urodynamics; urogenital system parameters; vascular fibrinoid necrosis; vascularization; video urodynamics; bladder; bladder disease; complication; cystitis; drug dependence; drug effect; necrosis; pathology; Adult; Cystitis; Female; Humans; Ketamine; Necrosis; Substance-Related Disorders; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Bladder Diseases"

"Higher urge severity score predicts resumption of overactive bladder (OAB) medication following discontinuation of mirabegron treatment in patients with OAB",2019,"Objectives: This study investigated factors predicting the resumption of mirabegron following its discontinuation with successful treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Methods: In all, 374 OAB patients reporting an improvement in subjective symptoms after a minimum of 3 months treatment with mirabegron 25 mg, q.d., were screened. Those wanting to continue with the medication (n = 109) were excluded from the study. The remaining 265 patients discontinued mirabegron and their outcomes were evaluated at baseline (discontinuation) and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), Urgency Severity Scale (USS), Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), and Global Response Assessment (GRA), as well as uroflowmetry and post-void residual (PVR). Results: After mirabegron discontinuation, 203 patients completed follow-up. The mean (±SD) duration from discontinuing medication to resumption of mirabegron was 2.25 ± 1.17 months (range 1–12 months). Compared with the 111 (54.7%) patients who did not resume mirabegron, the 92 (45.3%) patients who resumed mirabegron had a higher USS at time of discontinuation (1.18 ± 1.76 vs. 0.65 ± 1.33; P = 0.017). The USS was a strong predictor of mirabegron resumption (P = 0.02; odds ratio 1.315; 95% confidence interval 1.051–1.646). Conclusions: Among OAB patients who were successfully treated with mirabegron for ?3 months, nearly half requested resumption of mirabegron after discontinuation. A higher USS was found to predict retreatment after discontinuation of mirabegron in OAB patients. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent; mirabegron; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitor; acetanilide derivative; mirabegron; thiazole derivative; urinary tract agent; aged; Article; clinical assessment tool; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease severity; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; Global Response Assessment; human; International Prostate Symptom Score; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overactive bladder; Overactive Bladder Symptom Score; Patient Perception of Bladder Condition; postvoid residual urine volume; prediction; priority journal; rating scale; retreatment; scoring system; side effect; symptom; treatment duration; treatment response; Urgency Severity Scale; uroflowmetry; overactive bladder; pathophysiology; quality of life; recurrent disease; severity of illness index; Acetanilides; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Recurrence; Severity of Illness Index; Thiazoles; Urinary Bladder, Overactive; Urological Agents"
"Impact of concomitant dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome on symptom burden in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease",2019,"Background: Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) frequently report symptoms like dyspepsia or/and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of symptom overlap on GERD symptom burden. We also investigate whether GERD overlapping dyspepsia or/and IBS would have different clinical and psychological features as compared with GERD alone. Methods: A total of 2752 subjects were screened from a health check-up population. We compared the clinical and psychological factors among subjects with GERD alone and with overlap of two or all three diseases. All participants underwent an evaluation with questionnaires including Reflux Disease Questionnaire score, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before receiving endoscopic exam. Results: Among the GERD population, we identified 26 with IBS (GERD-IBS), 60 with dyspepsia (GERD-D), and 25 subjects with overlap of all three conditions (GERD-D-IBS). GERD-D and GERD-D-IBS subjects had more severe GERD symptoms as compared subjects with GERD alone (p < 0.001). Subjects with overlapping dyspepsia or/and IBS showed a significant increase in the severity of depression and poorer sleep quality than subjects with GERD alone. Notably, anxiety scores did not differ significantly between subjects with overlapping diseases and GERD alone. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that disease overlap in GERD population is associated with greater symptom burden, higher depression and poorer sleep quality, but not with anxiety. This study highlights the importance of identifying overlapping conditions as a therapeutic strategy for better management of GERD. ? 2018","adult; age; Article; body mass; comparative study; depression assessment; disease burden; disease severity; drinking behavior; dyspepsia; female; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal endoscopy; human; irritable colon; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; psychological aspect; reflux disease questionnaire score; sleep quality; smoking; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; symptom assessment; taiwanese depression questionnaire; anxiety; case control study; complication; cross-sectional study; depression; dyspepsia; epidemiology; gastroesophageal reflux; irritable colon; prevalence; psychological rating scale; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; Adult; Anxiety; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Dyspepsia; Female; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Symptom Assessment; Taiwan"
"Apoptosis induction and AKT/NF-κB inactivation are associated with regroafenib-inhibited tumor progression in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo",2019,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)is a malignant lung cancer type with poor prognosis. NF-κB, the oncogenic transcription factor, has been recognized as an important mediator in progression of NSCLC. Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, was demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression through suppression of ERK/NF-κB signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, whether regorafenib inhibit progression of NSCLC is ambiguous. Thus, the major purpose of present study was to evaluate anticancer efficacy and underlying mechanism of regorafenib on tumor progression in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. CL-1-5-F4 cells were treated with regorafenib, NF-κB (QNZ)or AKT (LY294002)inhibitor for 24 or 48 h. Then, we performed cell viability assay, NF-κB reporter gene assay, transwell invasion assay and apoptosis related flow cytometry assay on cellular level to verify anti-cancer effect and mechanism of regorafenib. CL-1-5-F4 bearing animal model was treated with vehicle or regorafenib for 28 days. The therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of regorafenib in CL-1-5-F4 bearing animal model were investigated by tumor size evaluation, whole body computer tomography (CT)scan, Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E)stain and immunohistochemistry (IHC)stain. Our results demonstrated regorafenib significantly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we also found the suppression of AKT/NF-κB signaling was required for regorafenib inhibited expression of progression-related and invasion-related proteins. Our finding indicated apoptosis induction and suppression of AKT/NF-κB signaling were associated with regorafenib-inhibited progression of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. ? 2019 The Authors","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; protein kinase B; regorafenib; carbanilamide derivative; death receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; protein kinase B; pyridine derivative; regorafenib; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer size; cell invasion assay; cell viability assay; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; flow cytometry; histopathology; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; reporter gene; signal transduction; whole body CT; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; disease exacerbation; DNA damage; drug effect; drug screening; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Disease Progression; DNA Damage; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Invasiveness; NF-kappa B; Phenylurea Compounds; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyridines; Receptors, Death Domain; Signal Transduction; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Association between use of Chinese herbal medicine and depression risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A nationwide retrospective cohort study",2019,"Aim: Depression is a common mental disorder in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and may provoke the onset of poor clinical prognoses. In view of this, whether or not the use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) can alleviate the risk of depression still remains unclear. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the association between CHMs us and depression risk among RA patients. Method: Using claims data from the National Health Insurance of Taiwan, we identified 6609 newly diagnosed RA patients aged 20?years or older between 1998 and 2010. From this sample, we recruited 3386 CHM users and randomly selected 3223 controls using propensity scores matching from the remaining cases as the non-CHMs users. They were followed until the end of 2012 to record depression incidence. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) of depression with regard to the use of CHMs. Results: During the 15-year follow-up, 249 CHM users and 314 non-CHM users developed depression, representing an incidence rate of 9.33 and 14.98, respectively, per 1000 person-years. We found that use of CHMs was associated with lower risk of depression by 38% (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.76). The most predominant effect was observed in those receiving CHMs for over 2?years (adjusted HR 0.34). Seven commonly prescribed CHMs could lessen the risk of depression: Chuan-niu-xi, Jie-geng, San-qi, Jia-wei-xia-yao-san, Dang-gui-nian-tong-tang, Zhi-gan-cao-tang, and Suan-zao-ren-tang. Conclusion: This study supports that adding CHMs into conventional therapy may prevent subsequent depression risk for RA patients. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","antirheumatic agent; bei mu; Chinese drug; chuan niu xi; dang gui nian tong tang; du huo ji sheng tang; ge gen; ge gen tang; herbaceous agent; huang qin; ji xue teng; jia wei xia yao san; jie geng; kan lu yin; kuei chih shao yaochih mu tang; san qi; shao yao gan cao tang; shu jing huo xue tang; suan zao ren tang; unclassified drug; wei ling xian; yan hu suo; ye jiao teng; zhi gan cao tang; antidepressant agent; herbaceous agent; adult; Article; Chinese herb; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; disease association; female; follow up; human; incidence; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; prescription; priority journal; propensity score; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; secondary analysis; Taiwan; administrative claims (health care); affect; aged; comparative study; depression; drug effect; factual database; psychology; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; Administrative Claims, Healthcare; Adult; Affect; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Databases, Factual; Depression; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Bariatric Surgery Did Not Increase the Risk of Gallstone Disease in Obese Patients: a Comprehensive Cohort Study",2019,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of bariatric surgery on gallstone disease in obese patients. Materials and Methods: This large cohort retrospective study was conducted based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. All patients 18–55?years of age with a diagnosis code for obesity (ICD-9-CM codes 278.00–278.02 or 278.1) between 2003 and 2010 were included. Patients with a history of gallstone disease and hepatic malignancies were excluded. The patients were divided into non-surgical and bariatric surgery groups. Obesity surgery was defined by ICD-9-OP codes. We also enrolled healthy civilians as the general population. The primary end point was defined as re-hospitalization with a diagnosis of gallstone disease after the index hospitalization. All patients were followed until the end of 2013, a biliary complication occurred, or death. Results: Two thousand three hundred seventeen patients in the bariatric surgery group, 2331 patients in the non-surgical group, and 8162 patients in the general population were included. Compared to the non-surgery group (2.79%), bariatric surgery (2.89%) did not elevate the risk of subsequent biliary events (HR = 1.075, p = 0.679). Compared to the general population (1.15%), bariatric surgery group had a significantly higher risk (HR = 4.996, p < 0.001). In the bariatric surgery group, female gender (HR = 1.774, p = 0.032) and a restrictive procedure (HR = 1.624, p = 0.048) were risk factors for gallstone disease. Conclusion: The risk for gallstone disease did not increase after bariatric surgery, although the risk was still higher than the general population. The benefit of concomitant cholecystectomy during bariatric surgery should be carefully evaluated. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","acute cholecystitis; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; cholecystectomy; cholelithiasis; cohort analysis; common bile duct stone; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; gastroenterostomy; gastroplasty; gout; hospital readmission; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; major clinical study; male; obese patient; obesity; partial gastrectomy; predictive value; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; adolescent; adverse event; complication; gallstone; middle aged; obesity; postoperative complication; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Bariatric Surgery; Gallstones; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult"

"Association between diuretic use and the risk of vertebral fracture after stroke: A population-based retrospective cohort study",2019,"Background: Stroke is a major risk factor for osteoporosis and fractures. No study has evaluated the association between diuretic use and risk of vertebral fracture in stroke patients, although a considerable proportion of stroke patients are prescribed diuretics for hypertension. Our study aimed to investigate whether treatment with thiazides or loop diuretics affects the risk of vertebral fracture after stroke. Methods: A population-based propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with a new diagnosis of stroke between 2000 and 2011 were included. After propensity score matching, 9468 patients were included in the analysis of the effect of thiazides, of who 4734 received thiazides within 2 years after stroke. To analyze the loop diuretic effect, 4728 patients were included, of who 2364 received loop diuretics. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of vertebral fractures among patients according to thiazide or loop diuretic use within 2 years following stroke. Sensitivity analyses based on the duration of thiazide or loop diuretic use were further conducted. Results: There was no significant difference in vertebral fracture risk between thiazide users and non-users (adjusted HR [aHR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88-1.47, p = 0.316). Loop diuretic users had a significantly higher vertebral fracture risk than non-users (aHR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.06-1.98, p = 0.019). However, the sensitivity analysis revealed that short-term thiazide use (exposure duration < 90 days within 2 years after stroke) significantly increased the risk of vertebral fracture versus non-use (aHR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.02-1.88, p = 0.039). Only short-term loop diuretic users had significantly higher risk of vertebral fracture (aHR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.11-2.20, p = 0.011). The other two subgroups with longer exposure duration in analyses for both thiazides and loop diuretics revealed no significant effect. Conclusions: Short-term thiazide or loop diuretic use was associated with an increased risk of vertebral fracture after stroke. Further prospective clinical trials are required to confirm this finding. ? 2019 The Author(s).","diuretic agent; thiazide diuretic agent; diuretic agent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; population research; propensity score; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; short course therapy; spine fracture; treatment duration; treatment outcome; cerebrovascular accident; chemically induced; health survey; longitudinal study; middle aged; procedures; risk factor; spine fracture; Taiwan; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Diuretics; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Spinal Fractures; Stroke; Taiwan"
"Association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use and colorectal cancer in a casecontrol study",2019,"Objectives: This study’s aim was to investigate whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use was associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. Methods: From the claims data of Taiwan National Health Insurance Program, a retrospective case-control study was conducted to examine 4739 aged 20-84 cases with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer in 2000-2013 and 4739 sex-matched and age-matched controls without colorectal cancer. The prescription history of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other comorbidities were compared between the cases and the matched controls. Results: After adjusting for the potential confounders, the multivariable logistic regression model showed that the odds of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use among cases with colorectal cancer were lower than the odds of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use among matched controls (adjusted OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.89). Conclusion: The odds of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use among cases with colorectal cancer are lower than among matched controls. This finding indicates that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use might be a protective factor against colorectal cancer. ? 2019, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India.

"A survey of traditional Chinese medicine use among rheumatoid arthritis patients: a claims data–based cohort study",2019,"Introduction/objectives: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is commonly used for symptom relief in patients with chronic diseases. Nevertheless, large-scale surveys focusing on the utilization of TCM among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are limited, especially in Taiwan, where TCM is highly popular. This cohort study aimed to describe the utilization of TCM and determine the factors related to TCM usage among RA patients. Method: A national health insurance database was used to identify 6532 newly diagnosed RA patients aged between 20 and 70?years, together with 12,246 subjects without RA matched by sex, age, and index year between 2000 and 2010. Incidence density of TCM use and its related factors was calculated by the Poisson regression model. Results: Findings indicated that RA patients experienced higher incidence density of TCM use than non-RA patients, with an adjusted incidence density ratio of 1.30 (95% confidence interval = 1.21–1.36). Multivariate analysis showed that RA patients who were female, were young, had high monthly income, had high Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index scores, and lived in the highly urbanized area with high TCM density were more likely to use TCM services. The top three reasons for seeking TCM services were diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue, the respiratory system, and the digestive system. Conclusions: The findings allow healthcare providers to identify the pattern of TCM use and characterize the factors that affect TCM utilization. Further research is required to fully address the efficiency and safety of TCM in treating RA patients. ? 2019, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).","Chinese drug; prescription drug; herbaceous agent; acupuncture; adult; aged; Article; Chinese medicine; cohort analysis; comorbidity; connective tissue disease; controlled study; female; follow up; gastrointestinal disease; human; incidence; income; major clinical study; male; manipulative medicine; musculoskeletal disease; national health insurance; priority journal; residential area; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; urbanization; Chinese medicine; insurance; middle aged; multivariate analysis; musculoskeletal manipulation; Poisson distribution; questionnaire; rheumatoid arthritis; sex factor; Taiwan; young adult; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Insurance Claim Review; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Musculoskeletal Manipulations; Poisson Distribution; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Anti-cancer effects of sulfasalazine and Vitamin E succinate in MDA-MB 231 triple-negative breast cancer cells",2019,"Aim: Sulfasalazine (SSZ) displayed anti-cancer activities. Vitamin E succinate (VES) could inhibit cell growth in various cancer cells. However, chemical therapies were often not useful for triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) treatment. Here, this study investigated the anti-cancer effects and the mechanisms on TNBCs under combination treatment with SSZ and VES. Methods: Cell viability was analyzed by using the MTT assay. The H2O2 levels were determined by using lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence method. In addition, caspase and MAPs signals were studied by using western blotting. Results: Low-dose VES antagonized the SSZ-induced cytotoxicity effects while high-dose VES promoted the SSZ-induced cytotoxicity effects on TNBCs. In addition, SSZ alone treatment activated both caspase-3 and ERK signals, however, VES alone treatment only activated JNK signals. On the other hand, activation of caspase-3, JNK, and ERK were found in SSZ plus VES-treated cells. Conclusion: Combined SSZ and VES has synergistic or antagonistic cytotoxic effects depending on VES concentration. In addition, different cytotoxic signals are induced on SSZ-treated, VES-treated and SSZ plus VES-treated cells. ?

"Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to determine 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels for clinical assessment of vitamin D deficiency",2019,"Vitamin D is responsible for multiple metabolic functions in humans. Rickets are the most common disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. It is caused by poor calcium intake resulting in poor serum-ionized calcium. The purpose of this study is to develop a rapid, sensitive, and feasible method to determine the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) levels in blood samples for clinical assessment. In this study, gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry with trimethylsilyl derivatization (TMS-GC-MS) is the most suitable protocol for quantitative analyses of 25(OH)D3. Performance of method was evaluated and compared with liquid chromatography and immunoassay. Method validation has been carried out with plasma specimens. The limit of quantitation of TMS-GC-MS method is 1.5 ppb with good linear correlation. Furthermore, the dietary intake and nutritional status of vegetarian and non-vegetarians in Taiwan were assessed by our validated method. As a result, this vitamin D nutrition survey demonstrates that most Taiwanese people have insufficient vitamin D. Due to dietary habits; the male vegans may have the highest risk of vitamin D deficiency. ? 2019","25 hydroxyvitamin D; calcifediol; calcium ion; colecalciferol; trimethylsilyl derivative; Article; blood sampling; calcium blood level; calcium intake; clinical assessment; controlled study; derivatization; dietary intake; feasibility study; female; gas chromatography; high risk population; human; human experiment; immunoassay; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography; male; mass spectrometry; multiple reaction monitoring; nutritional status; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; Taiwan; Taiwanese; vegetarian diet; vitamin D deficiency"

The estimated hazard ratios (95% CI) for oral cancer death increased from 1.48 (1.31-1.67) in buccal, 1.61 (1.43-1.82) in tongue, 1.68 (1.41-1.99) in floor of mouth, 1.79 (1.57-2.05) in gingiva, 1.97 (1.71-2.26) in hard palate, and 2.15 (1.89-2.45) in oropharynx. Conclusion: Different anatomic sites had variations in advanced stage of and death from oral cancer and need vigilant surveillance. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; advanced cancer; age; anatomical concepts; Article; betel quid; cancer staging; cancer survival; cigarette smoking; cohort analysis; female; follow up; gingiva; hard palate; human; lip cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth cancer; oropharynx; oropharynx cancer; priority journal; prospective study; sex difference; Taiwan; tongue cancer"
"Impact of type D personality on clinical outcomes in Asian patients with stable coronary artery disease",2019,"Background: Some personality types are associated with cardiovascular (CV) diseases and may be related to clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD). This study investigates the association between type D personality and clinical outcomes in stable CAD patients in an Asian cohort. Methods: Stable CAD patients were enrolled and prospectively followed up for at least 1 year in Taiwan. The inclusion criteria were at least one successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stable medical treatment for at least 1 month before enrollment. Vulnerability to psychological distress was measured by the Type D Personality Scale (DS14) after enrollment. The end point was the occurrence of total CV events. Cox regression models of CV events were used to investigate the role of type D personality in clinical outcomes. Results: The study included 777 patients, among which 122 (15.77%) had type D personality. Forty-two CV events were identified: 3 cardiac deaths, 5 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 1 stroke, 4 congestive heart failures (CHF), 6 peripheral arterial occlusive disorder cases, and 23 readmissions for angina/revascularization treatment. Patients with type D personality had significantly higher incidence of future CV events (9.84% vs. 4.58%, p = 0.018%) and admission for angina/revascularization (5.74% vs. 2.44%, p = 0.049). Patients with subsequent CV events were more likely to have type D personality (28.57% vs. 14.97%, p=0.018). After proportional Cox regression analysis, type D personality remained an independent predictor of future CV events (HR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.06–9.69). In subgroup analyses, type D personality was especially associated with higher risk of total CV events among females, the elderly, hypertension patients, diabetes patients, and non-smokers. Conclusion: Type D personality was an independent predictor of CV outcomes in an Asian cohort of stable CAD patients. This personality type may be identified in risk stratification for secondary prevention after PCI. ? 2018","acute coronary syndrome; acute heart infarction; adult; angina pectoris; Article; Asian; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; diabetic patient; distress syndrome; female; follow up; heart death; heart infarction; high risk patient; hospital readmission; human; hypertensive patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonsmoker; percutaneous coronary intervention; peripheral occlusive artery disease; personality assessment; prospective study; revascularization; type D behavior; Type D Personality Scale; unstable angina pectoris; aged; coronary artery disease; hypertension; mortality; procedures; register; risk factor; survival analysis; Taiwan; treatment outcome; Aged; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Prospective Studies; Registries; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Type D Personality"

"Association of vegetarian diet with chronic kidney disease",2019,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications are major global public health issues. Vegetarian diets are associated with a more favorable profile of metabolic risk factors and lower blood pressure, but the protective effect in CKD is still unknown. We aim to assess the association between vegetarian diets and CKD. A cross-sectional study was based on subjects who received physical checkups at the Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital from 5 September 2005, to 31 December 2016. All subjects completed a questionnaire to assess their demographics, medical history, diet pattern, and lifestyles. The diet patterns were categorized into vegan, ovo-lacto vegetarian, or omnivore. CKD was defined as an estimated GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or the presence of proteinuria. We evaluated the association between vegetarian diets and CKD prevalence by using multivariate analysis. Our study recruited 55,113 subjects. CKD was significantly less common in the vegan group compared with the omnivore group (vegan 14.8%, ovo-lacto vegetarians 20%, and omnivores 16.2%, P &lt; 0.001). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that vegetarian diets including vegan and ovo-lacto vegetarian diets were possible protective factors [odds ratios = 0.87 (0.77–0.99), P = 0.041; 0.84 (0.78–0.90), P &lt; 0.001]. Our study showed a strong negative association between vegetarian diets and prevalence of CKD. If such associations are causal, vegetarian diets could be helpful in reducing the occurrence of CKD. ? 2019 by the authors.

"E-cigarette use in a country with prevalent tobacco smoking: A population-based study in Taiwan",2019,"Background: The different profiles of e-cigarette users in different age groups have seldom been investigated, particularly in populations facing a high prevalence of cigarette smoking. This study aims to examine the prevalence and correlates of e-cigarette use separately for adolescents and adults in nationally representative samples in Taiwan. Methods: Among 17,837 participants in the 2014 National Survey of Substance Use in Taiwan, 4445 were aged 12 to 17 years and 13,392 were aged 18 to 64 years. Individuals’ lifetime tobacco use was divided into four groups: non-use, exclusive e-cigarette use, exclusive cigarette use, and dual use. Questions on sociodemographic features, use and problematic use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, and psychosocial distress, among others, were administered using a computer-assisted selfinterview on tablet computers. Results: Among lifetime users of e-cigarette (2.2% for adults and 0.8% for adolescents), 4.5% for adults and 36.6% for adolescents were exclusive e-cigarette users. From use of exclusive e-cigarettes to use of exclusive cigarettes to dual use, those usage groups were related to an increasing trend of adjusted odds ratios for use of other psychoactive substances, particularly problematic use of alcohol or drugs, and with more depressive symptoms. Two correlates were specific to e-cigarette use: alcohol use had stronger relationships with e-cigarette use among adolescents, and younger adults (18-34) were more likely to try e-cigarettes compared to older adults. Conclusions: These results provide essential information regarding e-cigarette use in the general population, and future prevention strategies should account for its specific correlates in young people. ? 2018 Yi-Lung Chen et al.","adolescent; adult; age distribution; child; cross-sectional study; electronic cigarette; epidemiology; female; health survey; human; male; middle aged; prevalence; smoking; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Taiwan; Tobacco Smoking; Young Adult"
"The molecular mechanism of epithelial–mesenchymal transition for breast carcinogenesis",2019,"The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway plays multiple regulatory roles in the tumorigenesis and development of cancer. TGF-β can inhibit the growth and proliferation of epithelial cells and induce apoptosis, thereby playing a role in inhibiting breast cancer. Therefore, the loss of response in epithelial cells that leads to the inhibition of cell proliferation due to TGF-β is a landmark event in tumorigenesis. As tumors progress, TGF-β can promote tumor cell invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. At present, the above-mentioned role of TGF-β is related to the interaction of multiple signaling pathways in the cell, which can attenuate or abolish the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis-promoting effects of TGF-β and enhance its promotion of tumor progression. This article focuses on the molecular mechanisms through which TGF-β interacts with multiple intracellular signaling pathways in tumor progression and the effects of these interactions on tumorigenesis. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Effect of proton pump inhibitors on mortality of cirrhotic patients with pneumonia",2019,"Objective Pneumonia is life-threatening in patients with liver cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of these patients developing pneumonia. However, whether PPIs increase mortality in patients with cirrhosis and pneumonia remain unknown. Methods We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to enroll 1,201 cirrhotic patients with pneumonia without active gastrointestinal bleeding who were receiving PPIs and were hospitalized between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. A one-to-three propensity score match was performed to select a comparison group based on age, gender, and comorbid disorders. Results The overall 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality rates were 13.7% and 26.9% in the PPI group, and 14.3% and 25.1% in the non-PPI group, respectively. After Cox regression model adjusting for age, gender, and comorbid disorders, the hazard ratios of the effect of PPIs on 30-day and 30 to 90-day mortality were 0.94 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.79–1.12, P = 0.468) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05–1.52; P = 0.013), respectively. Conclusions PPIs were not associated with 30-day mortality among cirrhotic patients with pneumonia but not active gastrointestinal bleeding. However, prolonged PPI therapy may be associated with higher mortality. ? 2019 Hung et al.

"Bioactive peptide vhvv upregulates the long-term memory-related biomarkers in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats",2019,"Hypertension is one of the growing risk factors for the progression of long-term memory loss. Hypertension-mediated memory loss and treatment remain not thoroughly elucidated to date. Plant-based natural compounds are an alternative solution to treating human diseases without side effects associated with commercial drugs. This study reveals that bioactive peptides extracted from soy hydrolysates mimic hypertension-mediated memory loss and neuronal degeneration and alters the memory molecular pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The SHR animal model was treated with bioactive peptide VHVV (10 mg/kg/oral administration) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (5 mg/kg/oral administration) for 24 weeks. We evaluated molecular level expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and survival markers phospho-protein kinase B (P-AKT) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) after 24 weeks of treatment for SHR in this study. Western blotting, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and immunohistochemistry showed long-term memory loss and neuronal degeneration in SHR animals. Bioactive peptide VHVV-treated animals upregulated the expression of long-term memory-relate proteins and neuronal survival. Spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with oral administration of bioactive peptide VHVV had activated CREB-mediated downstream proteins which may reduce hypertension-mediated long-term memory loss and maintain neuronal survival. ? 2019 by the authors.","beta actin; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; disks large homolog 4; eosin; glutamate receptor 1; glutamine; hematoxylin; neuroprotective agent; peptide; peptide vhvv; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein bcl 2; protein c fos; protein hydrolysate; protein kinase B; soybean protein; unclassified drug; biological marker; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; peptide; amnesia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain cortex; cell death; cell survival; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; controlled study; hydrolysis; hypertension; immunohistochemistry; long term memory; male; nerve cell; nerve cell degeneration; neuroprotection; nonhuman; protein expression; rat; signal transduction; spontaneously hypertensive rat; survival rate; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; blood brain barrier; chemistry; drug effect; hypertension; long term memory; metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Biomarkers; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cerebral Cortex; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Hypertension; Immunohistochemistry; Memory, Long-Term; Neurons; Peptides; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Signal Transduction"
"Remote transplantation of human adipose-derived stem cells induces regression of cardiac hypertrophy by regulating the macrophage polarization in spontaneously hypertensive rats",2019,"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertension has prognostic significance on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Recently, we have shown that n-butylidenephthalide (BP) improves human adipose-derived stem cell (hADSC) engraftment via attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This prompted us to investigate whether remote transplantation of BP-pretreated hADSCs confers attenuated LVH at an established phase of hypertension. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) aged 12 weeks were randomly allocated to receive right hamstring injection of vehicle, clinical-grade hADSCs, and BP-preconditioned hADSCs for 8 weeks. As compared with untreated SHRs, na?ve hADSCs decreased the ratio of LV weight to tibia, cardiomyocyte cell size, and collagen deposition independent of hemodynamic changes. These changes were accompanied by attenuated myocardial ROS production and increased p-STAT3 levels. Compared with na?ve hADSCs, BP-preconditioned hADSCs provided a further decrease of ROS and LVH and an increase of local hADSC engraftment, STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 activity, STAT3 nuclear translocation, myocardial IL-10 levels, and the percentage of M2 macrophage infiltration. SIN-1 or S3I-201 reversed the effects of BP-preconditioned ADSCs increase on myocardial IL-10 levels. Furthermore, SIN-1 abolished the phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas superoxide levels were not affected following the inhibition of STAT3. Our results highlighted the feasibility of remote transplantation of hADSCs can be considered as an alternative procedure to reverse cardiac hypertrophy even at an established phase of hypertension. BP-pretreated hADSCs polarize macrophages into M2 immunoregulatory cells more efficiently than na?ve hADSCs via ROS/STAT3 pathway. ? 2019","4 [[(4 methylphenyl)sulfonyloxy]acetamido]salicylic acid; antigen; brain natriuretic peptide; CD206 antigen; chemical compound; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; linsidomine; n butylidenephthalide; reactive oxygen metabolite; STAT3 protein; superoxide; unclassified drug; adipose derived stem cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood pressure measurement; cardiac muscle; cardiac muscle cell; cardiovascular parameters; cell size; collagen metabolism; controlled study; echocardiography; engraftment; flow cytometry; gene translocation; hamstring muscle; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart muscle fibrosis; heart rate; human; human cell; hypertension; in vivo study; LV weight to tibia ratio; macrophage; male; nonhuman; polarization; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; rat; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; ROS STAT3 signaling pathway; signal transduction; spontaneously hypertensive rat; stem cell transplantation; transcription initiation; Western blotting"
"2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan society of cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure",2019,"Heart failure is a growing epidemic, especially in Taiwan because of the aging population. The 2016 Taiwan Society of Cardiology - Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (TSOC-HFrEF) registry showed that the guidelinerecommended therapies were prescribed suboptimally both at the time of hospital discharge and during followup. We, therefore, conducted this 2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure to reinforce the importance of new diagnostic and therapeuticmodalities of heart failure. The 2019 focused update discusses new diagnostic criteria, pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological management, and certain co-morbidities of heart failure. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and If channel inhibitor is introduced as new and recommended medical therapies. Latest criteria of cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, heart transplantation, and ventricular assist device therapy are reviewed in the non-pharmacological management chapter. Co-morbidities in heart failure are discussed including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sleep-disordered breathing.We also explain the adequate use of oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation in heart failure management. A particular chapter for chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity is incorporated in the focused update to emphasize the importance of its recognition and management. Lastly, implications from the TSOC-HFrEF registry and post-acute care of heart failure are discussed to highlight the importance of guideline-directed medical therapy and the benefits of multidisciplinary disease management programs. With guideline recommendations, we hope that the management of heart failure can be improved in our society. ? 2019, Republic of China Society of Cardiology.

"Factors affecting parental intention to vaccinate kindergarten children against influenza: A cross-sectional survey in China",2019,"Background: The impact of influenza in children under 5 can be severe and fatal. However, the influenza vaccination uptake in China remains suboptimal. The objectives of this study were to investigate parents’ perceptions on influenza vaccination and to assess vaccination promotional factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey among 1506 parents with children in kindergarten was conducted in two areas with different policies: self-paid vaccination and free vaccination. The questionnaire was based on the structure of the Health Belief Model (HBM). Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the determinants of parental vaccination intention. Odds ratios (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are reported. Results: Within the free policy group versus the non-free group, vaccination intention rates were 76.3% versus 83.4%, and vaccination rates were 34.2% versus 3.1%. Results from multivariate analysis showed that parents with high scores for perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09–1.91), perceived benefits (OR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.30–2.50) and cues to action (OR = 3.32; 95% CI: 2.47–4.46) were more likely to get their children vaccinated, while those perceived more barriers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.37–0.68) had lower vaccination intention. More knowledge (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.18–2.56) and preferable attitudes (higher perceived necessity: OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.53–2.22; less safety worry: OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10–1.66) were associated with significantly higher vaccination intention. Adjusted for parents’ gender, age, education, income and children's age, the same significant factors were found. Parental intention was found to be influenced by different vaccination policies. Under a free policy, past influenza vaccination uptake (OR = 4.52; 95% CI: 1.07–19.02) greatly promoted parents’ willingness to vaccinate their children. Conclusion: Parents had high intention to get their kindergarten children vaccinated with the influenza vaccine in spite of the low uptake rate. Our results indicate that offering free influenza vaccines and parental education over the next years may increase the influenza vaccination rate. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; Article; child; China; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; Health Belief Model; health care policy; health education; health promotion; human; infection prevention; infection sensitivity; influenza; influenza vaccination; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; parental attitude; priority journal; questionnaire"

"Comparison of mortality and cardiovascular event risk associated with various insulin secretagogues: A nationwide real-world analysis",2019,"Aims: Several insulin secretagogues are widely used to treat diabetes; however, few outcome-based comparative studies have clarified which one of these should be used when indicated. We investigated mortality and cardiovascular event risk associated with optimal forms of insulin secretagogues. Methods: In this cohort study using real-world data from the diabetes database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance program, patients with diabetes were enrolled if their initial treatment was glimepiride, gliclazide, glipizide, glyburide, or repaglinide from 1999 to 2013. Each group was propensity score-matched to the glimepiride group before comparison. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and the combined cardiovascular event risk of acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: There were 66,790, 97,426, 38,806, 92,970, and 11,468 participants in the glimepiride, gliclazide, glipizide, glyburide, and repaglinide groups, respectively. The median follow-up time was 8 years. Glimepiride was associated with the best clinical outcome, showing the lowest mortality and lowest cardiovascular event risk of the five insulin secretagogues. Using patients on glimepiride as the reference group, the adjusted hazard ratios of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event risk were 1.52 (p < 0.001) and 1.22 (p = 0.005) for gliclazide, 1.42 (p < 0.001) and 1.19 (p = 0.073) for glipizide, 1.43 (p < 0.001) and 1.32 (p < 0.001) for glyburide, and 1.88 (p < 0.001) and 1.69 (p = 0.001) for repaglinide.

"Unintentional injury mortality among indigenous communities of Taiwan: Trends from 2002 to 2013 and evaluation of a community-based intervention",2019,"Introduction Indigenous communities in Taiwan shoulder a disproportionate burden of unintentional injury fatalities. We compare unintentional injury mortality rate trends among Taiwan's indigenous communities and the general population from 2002 to 2013, and evaluate potential impact of a community-based injury prevention programme on indigenous unintentional injury death rates. Methods Standardised and crude unintentional injury mortality rates were obtained from Taiwan government reports. Segmented linear regression was used to estimate and compare unintentional injury mortality rate trends before and after the intervention. Results Between 2002 and 2013, unintentional injury mortality rates among Taiwan's indigenous population significantly declined by about 4.5 deaths per 100 000 each year (p<0.0001). During that time, the unintentional injury mortality rate ratio between indigenous Taiwanese and the general population significantly decreased by approximately 1% each successive year (p=0.02). However, we were unable to detect evidence that the 'Healthy and Safe Tribe' programme was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the unintentional injury mortality rate trend among indigenous persons (p=0.81). Conclusion Taiwanese indigenous communities remain at significantly higher risk of unintentional injury death, though the gap may be slowly narrowing. We found no evidence that the 'Healthy and Safe Tribe' indigenous injury-prevention programme significantly contributed to the nationwide decline in unintentional injury mortality among indigenous Taiwanese communities from 2009 to 2013. Future interventions to address the disproportionate burden of unintentional injury fatalities among indigenous Taiwanese should consider interventions with wider coverage of the indigenous population, and complementing grass roots led community-based interventions with structural policy interventions as well. ?

"Metformin triggers the intrinsic apoptotic response in human AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells by activating AMPK and suppressing mTOR/AKT signalling",2019,"Metformin is commonly used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with a decreased risk of cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that metformin can act alone or in synergy with certain anticancer agents to achieve anti-neoplastic effects on various types of tumors via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. However, the role of metformin in AMPK-mediated apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells is poorly understood. In the current study, metformin exhibited a potent anti-proliferative effect and induced apoptotic characteristics in human AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells, as demonstrated by MTT assay, morphological observation method, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and caspase-3/7 assay kits. Western blot analysis demonstrated that treatment with metformin increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, and decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and p70S6k. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) suppressed AMPK phosphorylation and significantly abrogated the effects of metformin on AGS cell viability. Metformin also reduced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK, JNK and p38). Additionally, metformin significantly increased the cellular ROS level and included loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Metformin altered apoptosis-associated signaling to downregulate the BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2, pro-caspase-9, pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-7 expression, and to upregulate BAD, cytochrome c, and Apaf-1 proteins levels in AGS cells. Furthermore, z-VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) was used to assess mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis in metformin-treated AGS cells. The findings demonstrated that metformin induced AMPK-mediated apoptosis, making it appealing for development as a novel anticancer drug for the treating gastric cancer. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"High serum adipocyte fatty acid binding protein concentration linked with increased aortic arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes",2019,"Background: Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is a novel adipokine that contributes to the development of metabolic disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerosis. We determined the correlation between serum A-FABP and aortic stiffness in T2DM patients. Methods: Fasting blood samples were obtained from 156 patients with T2DM. Serum A-FABP concentration were determined using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) was measured using SphygmoCor System, and cfPWV values of >10 m/s were defined as high aortic stiffness. Results: Sixty participants (38.4%) fell under the high aortic stiffness group. This group, compared to the control group, showed older age (P =.004), higher systolic blood pressure (P <.001), diastolic blood pressure (P =.027), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (P =.003), serum A-FABP (P <.001) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P =.001). After adjusting for factors significantly associated with aortic stiffness using multivariable logistic regression analysis, serum A-FABP [OR = 1.029 (1.002–1.058), P =.039] was found to be an independent predictor of aortic stiffness in T2DM patients. Conclusions: Serum A-FABP is positively correlated with aortic arterial stiffness in patients with T2DM. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","albumin; creatinine; fatty acid binding protein 4; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; FABP4 protein, human; fatty acid binding protein; adult; age; aged; albumin to creatinine ratio; analytical parameters; arterial stiffness; Article; body mass; controlled study; correlational study; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; enzyme immunoassay; estimated glomerular filtration rate; fat mass; female; homeostasis model assessment; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; predictor variable; priority journal; protein blood level; pulse wave; sex difference; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; blood; drug effect; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Vascular Stiffness"
"The evaluation of a better intubation strategy when only the epiglottis is visible: A randomized, cross-over mannequin study",2019,"Background: The Cormack-Lehane (C-L) grade III airway is considered to be a challenging airway to intubate and is associated with a poor intubation success rate. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the holding position, shapes, bend angles of the endotracheal tube (ET) and the stylet-assisted lifting of the epiglottis could improve the success rate of intubation. Methods: Thirty-two participants, 26 physicians, 2 residents, and 4 nurse practitioners, with 12.09 ± 5.38 years of work experience in the emergency department and more than 150 annual intubation events, were enrolled in this randomized, cross-over mannequin study. We investigated the effects of straight-to-cuff ET shapes with 35° and 50° bend angles, banana-shaped ET with longitudinal distances of 28 cm and 26 cm, two methods of holding the ET (either on the top or in the middle), and lifting or not the epiglottis, on the intubation duration, its success rate, and its subjective difficulty. The aim of the study is to provide optimized intubation strategies for difficult airway with C-L IIb or III grades, when the inlet of the trachea cannot be visualized. Results: The two groups that lifted the epiglottis using the stylets, in bend angles of 35° and 50°, had the shortest duration of intubation (23.75 ± 14.24 s and 20.72 ± 6.90 s, hazard ratios 1.54 and 1.85 with 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] of 1.01-2.34 and 1.23-2.78, respectively) and a 100% success rate in intubations. In the survival analysis, lifting of the epiglottis was the only significant factor (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) associated with the success rate of intubation. Conclusions: The use of the epiglottic lift as an adjunctive technique can facilitate the intubation and improve its success rate without increasing procedure difficulty, in C-L III airway, when only the epiglottis is seen.

"The risk factors of nonunion after intramedullary nailing fixation of femur shaft fracture in middle age patients",2019,"Although the optimal treatment for femur shaft fracture is intramedullary nailing fixation, nonunion still occurs. We determined the oligotrophic nonunion rate among femur fractures managed operatively and identified risk factors for reoperation. This was a retrospective clinical study. The data of the patients between 40 and 70 years old with diaphyseal femur fracture who have received reamed and interlocked intramedullary nailing fixation in our hospital from February 2014 to April 2018 were collected. They were followed at regular intervals for at least 1 year after the operation. The primary outcome was nonunion of the fracture site that required reoperation in accordance with the radiographic union scale for tibial shaft fracture (RUST), which is a reasonable score system for lower limb diaphyseal fracture. Three of them were hypertrophic nonunion (1.9%) and the other 13 cases were oligotrophic nonunion (8.6%) at postoperative 12 months follow-up. All of the postoperative plain films showed adequate reduction quality. The three hypertrophic nonunion cases were all obese male with fracture site comminution. Fracture at the proximal third junction, hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) was significantly associated with oligotrophic nonunion of the fracture site from logistic regression analysis. The mean RUST score 3 months after the operation was not significantly different between the union group and nonunion group but was significantly lower 6 months after the operation in the nonunion group. In conclusion, intramedullary nailing of the femur shaft fractures was associated with a low risk of nonunion at the 1-year follow-up in the middle age group. Those with comorbidity such as obese, HTN, and DM, with fracture site at the proximal third junction or comminution should be followed up closely and rehabilitation with cause aggressively. Radiographic scale as the RUST score at postoperative 6 months could be used to predict this complication.","adult; aged; case report; closed fracture reduction; complication; diabetic complication; diagnostic imaging; female; femur fracture; follow up; fracture nonunion; human; hypertension; intramedullary nailing; male; middle aged; obesity; radiography; reoperation; retrospective study; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Closed Fracture Reduction; Diabetes Complications; Female; Femoral Fractures; Follow-Up Studies; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Fractures, Ununited; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Radiography; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"Vascular, cognitive, and psychomental survey on elderly recycling volunteers in northern Taiwan",2019,"Background: Stroke and dementia represent frequent causes of psychophysical and socioeconomic burdens. We conducted a vascular, cognitive, and psychomental survey involving elderly volunteers at community-based recycling stations in Northern Taiwan. Methods: Recycling volunteers aged ?60 years were surveyed. We recorded seven parameters, namely (1) body mass index (BMI), (2) fasting glucose, (3) fasting cholesterol, (4) ankle-brachial index (ABI), (5) carotid duplex sonography, (6) five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) score, and (7) eight-item Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia (AD8). During the carotid duplex study, we measured the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and the carotid total plaque score (CTPS) of the common and internal carotid arteries. Results: In total, 985 subjects (mean age: 70.8 years) participated in this study. Among these, 81% were women, and 52% were vegetarians. The average ABI, CIMT, and CTPS were higher in men, whereas women had higher cholesterol levels and BSRS-5 scores. Obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia were present in 21, 38, 9, and 27% of all subjects, respectively. Carotid plaques with mild (CTPS 1-5), moderate (CTPS 5.1-10), and severe (CTPS > 10) atherosclerosis were detected in 45, 16, and 7% of the subjects, respectively. Mild cognitive impairment (AD8 > 2) was observed in 13% of the subjects, whereas moderate mood disorder (BSRS-5≧10) was observed in only 1% of subjects. Vegetarians had a lower BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), cholesterol, CIMT, and CTPS than did non-vegetarians. Substantial predictors of severe atherosclerosis were advanced age (>70 years), male sex, history of heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and currently elevated SBP and cholesterol levels. Predictors of mild cognitive impairment were illiteracy, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and moderate mood disorder. Conclusions: Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis was common in elderly recycling volunteers, with 23% having moderate to severe stenosis. Vegetarians had a reduced risk of atherosclerosis. The low incidence of moderate mood disorder might indicate that recycling work enhances psychomental health. In addition, a healthier lifestyle, better mood condition, and vegetarian diet might contribute to lower incidence of mild cognitive impairment. ? 2019 Chen, Chen, Su, Hsiao, Yang, Hsu and Lin.","cholesterol; glucose; age; aged; ankle brachial index; arterial wall thickness; Article; body mass; Brief Symptom Rating Scale; carotid atherosclerosis; carotid duplex sonography; cholesterol blood level; cognition; common carotid artery; Differentiate Aging and Dementia Scale; disease severity; echography; female; gender; glucose blood level; human; hyperglycemia; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; internal carotid artery; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; mood disorder; obesity; prospective study; rating scale; recycling volunteer; systolic blood pressure; Taiwan; vegetarian; volunteer"

"Differentiating tower from bell curves in smooth continuous uroflowmetry curves of healthy adolescents",2019,"Introduction: The definition of each uroflow pattern is vague, and therefore, interpreting uroflowmetry curves is associated with low inter-rater agreement. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether subjective or objective parameters could better differentiate tower from bell curves. Materials and Methods: Uroflow curves of community healthy adolescents with smooth continuous curves and minimal fluctuations within optimal bladder volume were independent reviewed by two experienced pediatric urodynamists and classified as bell or tower. The objective parameters generated from uroflow curves including Franco-Yang (F-Y) index (≧80) and angle at peak flow rate (A-Qmax ≧80°) were also used to differentiate tower from bell. The participants were asked to complete dysfunctional voiding symptom score (10 items, score 0-3). Results: A total of 287 adolescents with a mean age of 15.3 ± 1.7 years were enrolled and 150 curves were eligible for analysis. The inter-rater agreement was low (kappa = 0.27). Adolescents with uroflow curves classified as tower though F-Y index and A-Qmax were associated with higher urgency score than those with bell curves. However, adolescents with the tower curves defined by interpreters did not have higher urgency scores. Conclusions: Objective classification of tower curves with may be more reliable than subjective classification by the urodynamists. However, a significant proportion of participants with tower curves did not have urgency symptoms. ? 2018 Urological Science | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","adolescent; article; bladder capacity; child; female; flow rate; human; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; uroflowmetry"
"Transcription-independent and -dependent p53-mediated apoptosis in response to genotoxic and non-genotoxic stress",2019,"We previously reported that p53-mediated apoptosis is determined by severity of DNA damage, not by the level of p53, in doxorubicin-treated prostate cancer cells. In addition to doxorubicin, our results here indicated that camptothecin and bortezomib, which are a topoisomerase 1 poison and a 26 S proteasome inhibitor, respectively, could also induce apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner in prostate cancer. Then, we examined whether p53-mediated apoptosis induced by genotoxic and non-genotoxic stress occur in the same or a different way. By using dominant negative p53 to compete with wild-type p53 in transcription activity, we demonstrated that p53-mediated apoptosis in response to doxorubicin- or camptothecin-induced genotoxic stress is transcription-independent. In contrast, p53-mediated apoptosis from bortezomib-induced stress is transcription-dependent. Interestingly, we also found that doxorubicin-induced p21 expression is activated by p53 in transcription-dependent manner, while camptothecin-induced p21 expression is p53-independent. We then investigated the p53 ratio of nucleus to cytosol corresponding to low and high dose doxorubicin, camptothecin, or bortezomib treatment. The results suggested that p53 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus actively drives cells toward apoptosis in either transcription-dependent or -independent manner for responding to non-genotoxic or genotoxic stress, respectively. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The role of tea and coffee in the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease",2019,"Objective: The incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is increasing, and the disease has a close association with dietary habits. This study aims to investigate the role of tea and coffee drinking in the development of GERD. Materials and Methods: This study prospectively enrolled individuals who underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during a health checkup. Each participant completed the reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ). Coffee or tea drinking was defined as drinking the beverage at least 4 days/week for 3 months. Heavy coffee or tea consumption was defined as drinking at least two cups every day. Results: A total of 1837 participants (970 men; age 51.57 ± 10.21 years), who had data on clinical characteristics and consumption of coffee and tea with or without additives such as milk or sugar were included for final analysis. Among them, 467 (25.4%) were diagnosed as having symptomatic GERD based on the RDQ score, and 427 (23.2%) had erosive esophagitis (EE) on endoscopy. Drinking coffee or tea was not associated with reflux symptoms or EE in univariate and multivariate analyses. In contrast, drinking coffee with milk was associated with reflux symptoms and drinking 'tea and coffee' was associated with EE in univariate analysis. However, these associations became insignificant after multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Drinking coffee or tea and adding milk or sugar was not associated with reflux symptoms or EE. ? 2019 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","sugar; adult; Article; beverage; coffee; disease association; drinking; female; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal endoscopy; Helicobacter pylori; human; major clinical study; male; milk; multivariate analysis; prospective study; questionnaire; reflux esophagitis; tea; univariate analysis"

Objective: To investigate the effects of touch-observation and task-based mirror therapy on the sensorimotor outcomes of patients with nerve repair. Design: An assessor-blinded study with a randomized controlled design. Setting: University hospital. Participants: We recruited 12 patients with median or ulnar nerve repair between the level of midpalm and elbow referred by the plastic surgeons. Intervention: The patients were randomized into touch-observation and task-based mirror therapy or control groups, and both groups received training for 12 wk. Outcomes and Measures: The Semmes–Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test, two-point discrimination test, Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT), Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT), and pinch-holding-up activity test were assessed at pretreatment, immediately after treatment, and 12 wk after the last treatment. Results: The experimental group showed greater improvements in the results of the pinch-holding-up activity test and the PPT Unilateral Pin Insertion, Bilateral Pin Insertion, and Assembly subtests. However, change on the SWM test revealed no significant difference between the two groups.

"An Exploration of Factors Related to Quality of Life in Indonesian Care Workers in Home-Based Care Settings",2019,"Background Indonesians constituted 79% of foreign care workers for long-term care in Taiwan in 2015. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the effect of work stress and quality of life (QoL) on this population. Purpose This study aims to explore stress levels, social support requirements, and perceived QoL among Indonesian care workers (ICWs) who work in home care settings. Methods A cross-sectional design was used. Data were collected between 2014 and 2016 from a convenience sample of ICWs working in eastern Taiwan using a self-administered questionnaire that comprised the Stress Perception Scale (SPS), Social Support Scale (SSS), and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief scale. One hundred fifty-seven valid questionnaires were collected. The response rate was 80.51%. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. Results The results found that the average SPS of the sample was 70.50, with low QoL scores and requirements for more social support. In addition, significant and positive correlations were found between QoL and SPS, SSS, duration of patient care, and hours of care per week. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the most predictive variables for QoL were time spent caring, preservice training, psychological stress, and emotional support, which together accounted for 60.9% of the total variance. Conclusions/Implications for Practice This study facilitated understanding of the stress on ICWs and the impact of social support on their QoL. The findings suggest that new immigrants in Taiwan should be introduced to foreign care workers or nursing attendants. Moreover, long-term-care-related teachers should work with home care institutions or agencies to develop a teaching model for innovative care skills to relieve the perceived stress of ICWs. ?

"Editor's Choice – Diabetic Limb Salvage With Endovascular Revascularisation and Free Tissue Transfer: Long-Term Follow up",2019,"Objective: Combining vascular bypass surgery with free flap coverage is one of the treatment methods for complex soft tissue defects in the ischaemic lower limb. Endovascular revascularisation has become the first line treatment for limb ischaemia in many centres. Surgeons now perform free tissue transfer after angioplasty. The early and long-term limb salvage rate in diabetic patients who had undergone infrapopliteal endovascular revascularisation and free flap reconstruction are assessed. Methods: This was retrospective study of all consecutive diabetic patients who had undergone endovascular revascularisation with free flap reconstruction for lower limb salvage between 2008 and 2014. They were followed up for at least 2 years or to death (mean follow up 39 ± 17 months). Cox regression analysis was used to analyse variables influencing outcome. Results: There were 55 patients who had undergone 60 procedures. Five patients had undergone the procedure to the contralateral leg. All tissue lesions were Wagner–Meggit classification Grades 3 or 4. Thirty-six patients had TASC C lesions and 24 patients with TASC D lesions. Combined below knee triple vessel disease was seen in 30% of the cases, 28% involved both the anterior and posterior tibial artery, 7% and 2% involved the anterior tibial or the posterior tibial and the peroneal arteries. The free flap success rate was 95%. The peri-operative mortality was 1.7%. Twenty-one cases required surgical re-intervention. Mean length of hospital admission was 32 ± 9 days. One and five year amputation free survival rates were 94% and 68%, patient survival rates were 95% and 67%, limb salvage rates were 93% and 91% and respectively. Conclusions: The results show that excellent early and late limb salvage can be achieved with free tissue transfer based on endovascular revascularisation of infrapopliteal arteries. This can be a further treatment option in diabetic patients with complex soft tissue defects. ? 2018 European Society for Vascular Surgery","acetylsalicylic acid; cilostazol; clopidogrel; adult; aged; angioplasty; ankle brachial index; anterolateral thigh flap; Article; cerebrovascular accident; coronary artery disease; critical limb ischemia; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; end stage renal disease; endarterectomy; endovascular surgery; female; follow up; free tissue graft; graft failure; hematoma; hospital admission; human; hypertension; leg amputation; leg revascularization; limb salvage; lung edema; major clinical study; male; necrotizing fasciitis; pneumonia; priority journal; rectus femoris muscle; retrospective study; sartorius muscle; soft tissue defect; sudden death; surgical infection; surgical mortality; survival rate; tibial artery; tissue injury; transfusion related acute lung injury; vastus lateralis muscle; complication; diabetic foot; free tissue graft; limb salvage; lower limb; middle aged; minimally invasive surgery; mortality; perioperative period; peripheral vascular disease; procedures; reoperation; statistics and numerical data; tissue transplantation; treatment outcome; vascularization; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angioplasty; Diabetic Foot; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Free Tissue Flaps; Humans; Limb Salvage; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Perioperative Period; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Tissue Transplantation; Treatment Outcome"
"Risk of hyperglycemic crisis episode in diabetic patients with bipolar disorder: A nationwide population-based cohort study",2019,"Background: Suboptimal management of diabetes can lead to a hyperglycemic crisis episode (HCE), which could be further enhanced in the presence of bipolar disorder (BD) and the prescription of antipsychotics. This study aims to investigate the risk of HCE in diabetic patients with BD. Additionally, the duration of antipsychotic prescription on HCE risk is examined. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 6099 diabetic patients with BD and 24,378 diabetic patients without BD matched by gender, age, index year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score were enrolled between 1999 and 2010 and followed to the end of 2013. Participants who developed HCE during the follow-up period were identified. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the HCE incidence rate between two groups studied. Results: Diabetic patients with BD were associated with an increased risk of HCE compared with unaffected controls after adjusted for baseline demographics and duration of antipsychotic prescription (3.84 versus 2.71 per 1,000 person-years, HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.15–1.71). Also, this study revealed that male gender, more comorbidities, and a longer duration of antipsychotic prescription were potential risk factors for developing HCE. Limitations: This study only deals with data on the duration of antipsychotic prescription, without showing the effects of different antipsychotics on HCE risk. Conclusion: This study highlights the need to pay attention to the risk of HCE in diabetic patients with BD and the importance of careful prescription of antipsychotics to reduce the HCE incident. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","antidiabetic agent; neuroleptic agent; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; demography; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; female; follow up; human; hyperglycemia; major clinical study; male; prescription; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; risk factor; treatment duration"
"Early breastfeeding is associated with low risk of postpartum depression in Taiwanese women",2020,"Breastfeeding during the first week postpartum is recognised as essential, affecting the mother’s mental health. The human milk from early breastfeeding also protects against infections via the secretory IgA antibodies and plays an important role in the newborn’s development. At a Baby-Friendly Hospital, early breastfeeding was promoted to increase the benefits for the newborn, but few focussed on the mother’s health. The association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression (PPD) has not been fully addressed. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum depression (PPD) and it included 333 Taiwanese pregnant women. Women who had a higher score of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were significant older (age ? 35, p <.037), had a caesarean section delivery (p <.001), and a higher score of Brief Symptom Rating Scale-5 (p <.001). Higher scores on EPDS were significantly associated with lower rates of breastfeeding, which reflected cessation of breastfeeding as an important risk factor for PPD (Odds ratio: 2.159, CI: 1.220–3.821, p =.008). Other risk factors included caesarean section delivery (Odds ratio: 2.814, CI: 1.617–4.899, p <.001) and age ?35 years (Odds ratio: 1.821, CI: 1.057–3.137, p =.031).IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject: Breastfeeding during the first week postpartum is recognised as essential, affecting the mother’s mental health.

"SCUBE1-enhanced bone morphogenetic protein signaling protects against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury",2019,"We previously reported that the membrane-bound SCUBE1 (signal peptide-CUB-epithelial growth factor domain-containing protein 1) forms a complex with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) ligand and its receptors, thus acting as a BMP co-receptor to augment BMP signal activity. However, whether SCUBE1 can bind to and facilitate signaling activity of BMP7, a renal protective molecule for ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) insult, and contribute to the proliferation and repair of renal tubular cells after I/R remains largely unknown. In this study, we first showed that I/R-induced SCUBE1 was expressed in proximal tubular cells, which coincided with the expression of renoprotective BMP7. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that SCUBE1 directly binds to BMP7 and its receptors, functioning as a BMP co-receptor to promote BMP7 signaling. Furthermore, we used a new Scube1 deletion (Δ2) mouse strain to further elucidate the renal pathophysiological function of SCUBE1 after I/R injury. As compared with wild-type littermates, Δ2 mice showed severe renal histopathologic features (extensive loss of brush border, tubular necrosis, and tubular dilation) and increased inflammation (neutrophil infiltrate and induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) during the resolution of I/R damage. They also showed reduced BMP signaling (phosphorylated Smad1/5/8) along with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of renal tubular cells. Importantly, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of SCUBE1 enhanced BMP signaling and conferred a concomitant survival outcome for Δ2 proximal tubular epithelial cells after hypoxia–reoxygenation treatment. The protective BMP7 signaling may be facilitated by stress-inducible SCUBE1 after renal I/R, which suggests potential targeted approaches for acute kidney injury. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","bone morphogenetic protein; bone morphogenetic protein 2; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; osteogenic protein 1; signal peptide cub epithelial growth factor domaincontaining protein 1; Smad1 protein; Smad5 protein; Smad8 protein; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; bone morphogenetic protein receptor; ligand; messenger RNA; osteogenic protein 1; protective agent; protein binding; Scube1 protein, mouse; signal peptide; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; cell survival; comparative study; disease exacerbation; enzyme activity; genetic transfection; Hep-G2 cell line; histopathology; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; kidney injury; kidney ischemia; kidney tubule cell; kidney tubule necrosis; mouse; nonhuman; outcome assessment; priority journal; renal protection; reperfusion injury; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; animal; epithelium cell; fibroblast; gene deletion; genetics; HEK293 cell line; kidney; kidney proximal tubule; male; metabolism; pathology; protein subunit; reperfusion injury; signal transduction; upregulation; Animals; Apoptosis; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7; Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors; Cell Proliferation; Epithelial Cells; Fibroblasts; Gene Deletion; HEK293 Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Kidney; Kidney Tubules, Proximal; Ligands; Male; Mice; Protective Agents; Protein Binding; Protein Subunits; Reperfusion Injury; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Up-Regulation"

"A Benzenoid 4,7-Dimethoxy-5-Methyl-L, 3-Benzodioxole from Antrodia cinnamomea Attenuates Dendritic Cell-Mediated Th2 Allergic Responses",2019,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in initiating immune responses; however, DCs also induce Th2-related allergic sensitivities. Thus, DCs become a target for therapeutic design in allergic diseases. In this study, we aim to investigate the anti-allergic effect of pure compounds from a medicinal mushroom Antrodia cinnamomea (Ac) on DC-induced allergic responses. We identified a benzenoid compound 4,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl-l,3-benzodioxole (DMB) which may modulate Th2 polarization in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and in a murine food allergy model. DMB effectively reduced the Th2 adjuvant cholera toxin (CT)-induced BMDC maturation and cytokine production. In studying the mechanism, DMB blocked the molecular processes involved in Th2 induction, including cAMP activation, IL-33 production, and IRF4/Tim4 upregulation, in CT-activated BMDCs. Furthermore, DMB treatment attenuated the symptoms, clinical scores, and Th2 responses of CT-induced ovalbumin (OVA)-specific food allergy in mice at sensitization stage. These results indicated that DMB could suppress DC function for Th2 polarization and mitigate allergic responses. Thus, DMB may have potential to be a novel agent for preventing or treating food allergy. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","4,7 dimethoxy 5 methyl levo,3 benzodioxole; antiallergic agent; aromatic compound; cholera toxin; cyclic AMP; interferon regulatory factor 4; interleukin 33; ovalbumin; plant extract; unclassified drug; 1,3 benzodioxole derivative; antiallergic agent; cytokine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiallergic activity; Antrodia camphorata; Article; bone marrow derived dendritic cell; cell maturation; controlled study; cytokine production; drug isolation; drug mechanism; drug synthesis; food allergy; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; polarization; sensitization; Th2 cell; upregulation; animal; Antrodia; Bagg albino mouse; cell culture; chemistry; dendritic cell; disease model; food allergy; hypersensitivity; immunology; metabolism; phytotherapy; Th2 cell; Animals; Anti-Allergic Agents; Antrodia; Benzodioxoles; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Disease Models, Animal; Food Hypersensitivity; Hypersensitivity; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Ovalbumin; Phytotherapy; Th2 Cells"
"Safety assessment, biological effects, and mechanisms of Myrica rubra fruit extract for anti-melanogenesis, anti-oxidation, and free radical scavenging abilities on melanoma cells",2019,"Objective: Currently, the cosmetic and medical industries are paying considerable attention to solve or prevent skin damage or diseases, such as hyperpigmentation and oxidation and free radical damage. In this study, the effective compounds in Myrica rubra fruit were extracted and studied the biological effects of these M.?rubra fruit extracts. Methods: In this study, we extracted M.?rubra fruit using solutions with various ratios of water to ethanol (100:0, 50:50, 5:95) and studied the anti-melanogenesis, anti-oxidation and radical scavenging effects of these M.?rubra fruit extracts on two melanoma cell lines: mouse melanoma (B16-F0) and human melanoma (A2058). The cytotoxicity, melanin synthesis, mushroom and cellular tyrosinase activities, enzyme kinetics, melanogenesis-related gene expression, melanogenesis-related protein secretion, radical DPPH scavenging activity and ROS inhibition after treatment with M.?rubra fruit extracts were determined. Results: The results showed that the water extract of M.?rubra fruit was less cytotoxic to the melanoma cell lines, effectively inhibited melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity and down-regulated the gene expression and protein secretion of MITF and TRP-1. In addition, the M.?rubra fruit extracts also showed the abilities to scavenge DPPH free radicals and suppress ROS production. Finally, the effective compounds in the water extract were Myricetin-O-deoxyhexoside, Quercetin-O-deoxyhexoside, and Kaempferol-O-hexoside determined by LC/MS/MS assay. Conclusion: Overall, the water extract of M.?rubra fruit is a safe and effective melanin inhibitor and anti-oxidant and can be applied widely in the fields of cosmetics and medicine. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","antineoplastic agent; kaempferol; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; Myrica rubra extract; myricetin; plant extract; quercetin; reactive oxygen metabolite; tyrosinase related protein 1; unclassified drug; free radical; melanin; membrane protein; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; MITF protein, human; Mitf protein, mouse; monophenol monooxygenase; oxidoreductase; plant extract; TYRP1 protein, human; Tyrp1 protein, mouse; A2058 cell line; animal cell; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; Article; B16-F0 cell line; biological activity; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme repression; free radical scavenging assay; fruit; gene expression; human; human cell; in vivo study; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; melanogenesis; melanoma cell; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; cell survival; drug effect; genetics; melanoma; metabolism; Myrica; oxidation reduction reaction; protein synthesis; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Free Radicals; Fruit; Gene Expression; Humans; Melanins; Melanoma; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Myrica; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Plant Extracts; Protein Biosynthesis; Reactive Oxygen Species"
"Pleiotropic association of LIPC variants with lipid and urinary 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine levels in a Taiwanese population",2019,"Background: Hepatic lipase (HL, encoded by LIPC) is a glycoprotein primarily synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes. Previous studies had demonstrated that HL is crucial for reverse cholesterol transport and affects the metabolism, composition, and level of several lipoproteins. In current study, we investigated the association of LIPC (Lipase C, Hepatic Type) variants with circulating and urinary biomarker levels by using subgroup and mediation analyses. Methods: A total of 572 participants from Taiwan were genotyped for three LIPC single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by using TaqMan assay. Fasting levels of glucose, lipid profile, inflammation markers, urine creatinine and 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured. The chi-square test, 2-sample t test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine differences among variables and genotype frequencies. Results: SNPs rs2043085 and rs1532085 were significantly associated with urinary 8-OHdG levels, whereas all three SNPs were more significantly associated with Triglycerides (TG) or HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels after additional adjustment for HDL-C or TG levels, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that the association of the LIPC SNPs with the levels of serum TG, HDL-C, and urinary 8-OHdG were predominantly observed in the men but not in the women. Differential associations of the LIPC SNPs with various lipid levels were observed in participants with different adiposity statuses. Mediation analyses indicated that TG levels acted as a suppressor masking the association of the LIPC genotypes with HDL-C levels, particularly in the men (Sobel test, all P < 0.01). Conclusion: Our data revealed that interaction and suppression effects mediated the pleiotropic association of the LIPC variants. The effects of the LIPC SNPs depended on sex, adiposity status, and TG levels. Thus, our findings can provide a method for identifying high-risk populations of cardiovascular diseases for clinical diagnosis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine; creatinine; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine; biological marker; deoxyguanosine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; LIPH protein, human; lipid; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; adult; Article; cholesterol blood level; creatinine urine level; female; gene; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; glucose blood level; human; LIPC gene; lipid fingerprinting; male; middle aged; obesity; pleiotropy; single nucleotide polymorphism; Taiwan; Taiwanese; triacylglycerol blood level; analogs and derivatives; biological model; blood; genetic association study; genetics; sexual characteristics; urine; Biomarkers; Cholesterol, HDL; Deoxyguanosine; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Pleiotropy; Humans; Lipase; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Obesity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sex Characteristics; Triglycerides"
"Taiwanese depression questionnaire revisit: Factor structure and measurement invariance across genders",2019,"Background/purpose: Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ) was widely used in Taiwan to measure individuals' proneness to depression. In light of well-established gender differences in the manifestation of depression, TDQ's structure invariance and measurement invariance across genders were examined in this study. Methods: Data from 2604 adults was analyzed. Exploratory factor analysis was first performed to explore the factor structure. Possible factor structures and the original 2-factor structure were then compared by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The best fitting model was tested for measurement invariance across genders using multi-group CFA. Results: EFA revealed 2 possible factor structures and suggested cross-loaded items deletion needed. This resulted in 4 models along with the original 2-factor structure to be tested in the follow-up CFA. Among the 5 models tested, the best-fitting model was the 3-factor solution with 3 cross-loaded items removed. The multi-group CFA performed on this 15-item TDQ revealed that the configural invariance, metrix invariance, and scalar invariance were all supported; partial strict invariance was supported when residual variances of items 1, 9, and 18 were set to vary. Conclusion: The 15-item TDQ with a 3-factor structure reflects the manifestations of depression of Taiwanese general population well. Although the results of measurement invariance suggest no gender difference in factor structure, the partial strict invariance suggests that there is gender difference in the amount of variance captured by TDQ. Hence, examining gender differences in the predictive value of different factors regarding health behaviors or medical conditions may bring fruitful results. ? 2018 Formosan Medical Association","adult; article; confirmatory factor analysis; exploratory factor analysis; female; follow up; health behavior; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; population; predictive value; questionnaire; sex difference; depression; factor analysis; middle aged; psychometry; reproducibility; sex factor; Taiwan; Depression; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan"
"Real-world database investigating the association between diabetes mellitus and herpes zoster in Taiwan",2019,"Little evidence is available about the correlation between diabetes mellitus and herpes zoster in Taiwan. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between diabetes mellitus and herpes zoster in Taiwan.A population-based cohort study was conducted using the database of Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. There were 27,369 subjects aged 20 to 84 years with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus from 2000 to 2012 as the diabetes mellitus group and 107,705 sex- and age-matched subjects without diabetes mellitus as the nondiabetes mellitus group. The incidence of herpes zoster at the end of 2013 was estimated. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of herpes zoster associated with diabetes mellitus.The overall incidence of herpes zoster was 1.16-fold higher in the diabetes mellitus group than the nondiabetes mellitus group (7.85 vs 6.75 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 1.12-1.20). After adjustment for co-variables, the adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.17 for subjects with diabetes mellitus (95% CI 1.10-1.23), compared with subjects without diabetes mellitus.Patients with diabetes mellitus are associated with 1.17-fold increased risk for developing herpes zoster. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"A preclinical evaluation of thiostrepton, a natural antibiotic, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma",2019,"Background Thiostrepton, a natural antibiotic, has recently been shown to be a potential anticancer drug for certain cancers, but its study in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is still limited. The aims of this study were to investigate the anticancer effect of thiostrepton on NPC cells and to explore its underlying mechanism. Methods The effects of thiostrepton on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NPC cells were investigated by a WST-1 assay, wound healing assay, and cell invasion assay, respectively. Microarrays were conducted and further analyzed by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to determine the molecular mechanism by which thiostrepton affects NPC cells. Results Our results showed that thiostrepton reduced NPC cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Thiostrepton inhibited the migration and invasion of NPC cells in wound healing and cell invasion assays. The microarray data analyzed by IPA indicated the top 5 ingenuity canonical pathways, which were unfolded protein response, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, retinoate biosynthesis I, choline biosynthesis III, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma signaling. Conclusion Thiostrepton effectively suppressed NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, likely by several mechanisms. Thiostrepton may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating NPC in the future. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Stroke and lower urinary tract symptoms: A neurosurgical view",2019,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are common neurological sequelae of stroke, which negatively impact the mortality of patients with stroke and the quality of life of both patients and their caregivers. There are three hierarchical micturition centers: The sacral spinal center, subconscious structures, and conscious structures. Several brain imaging modalities for micturition studies on humans and animals and neuroanatomical studies on animals have facilitated a better understanding of LUTSs. The urodynamic findings in patients with stroke may vary and tend to evolve with time; the identification of the underlying cause of poststroke voiding dysfunction helps optimize the management of these patients. For patients with stroke with overactive bladders, the first-line treatments include behavioral therapies and the second-line therapies include the use of drugs. Intermittent or indwelling catheterization can be used for patients with stroke with detrusor underactivity. In this article, we discuss the current consensus, relevant assessment modalities, and management of LUTSs in patients with stroke. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved..

"Impact of universal drug susceptibility testing and effective management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Taiwan",2019,"Background The treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in the 1990s in Taiwan was not satisfactory. To strengthen programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (PMDT), Taiwan MDR-TB Consortium (TMTC) was established in 2007. We assess the performance and epidemiologic impact of TMTC. Methodology/Principle findings We analyzed the trends of proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing, enrollment of MDR-TB patients into TMTC and outcomes of treatment of all MDR-TB patients in Taiwan from 2007–2016. We computed the trends of both incidence and prevalence of MDR-TB from 2007–2016. We assessed the trends of MDR-TB among both new and recurrent TB cases. The proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing results increased from 24.2% in 2007 to 97.9% in 2016. Of the 1,452 MDR-TB patients who were eligible for TMTC care, 1,197 (82.4%) were enrolled in TMTC, in whom 82.9% had treatment success. MDRTB incidence was 9.0 cases per million in 2007, which declined to 4.6 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). MDR-TB prevalence decreased from 19.4 cases per million in 2007 to 8.4 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). The proportion of MDR-TB among new TB cases decreased from 1.4% in 2010 to 1.0% in 2016 (p = 0.039); and that among recurrent TB cases from 9.0% in 2010 to 1.8% in 2016 (p<0.0001). Conclusions We concluded that effective PMDT have had a significant impact on the epidemic of drug-resistant TB in Taiwan. ? 2019 Lee et al.

"A CRYBB2 mutation in a Taiwanese family with autosomal dominant cataract",2019,"Background/Purpose: To identify the underlying genetic cause of a Taiwanese family with autosomal dominant cerulean cataract. Methods: A three-generation cerulean cataract family with 13 affected and 13 normal was identified. Whole exome sequencing, whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and haplotype analysis, and fine mapping using polymorphic short tandem repeat markers were used to identify the causative gene mutation. Results: Whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and haplotype analysis mapped the candidate disease loci to chromosome 18 and chromosome 22. Polymorphic short tandem repeat markers further narrowed down the disease interval to chromosome 22 between markers D22S1174 and D22S1163. Whole exome sequencing was performed on selected individuals. Polymorphisms detected were filtered based on their genomic positions, allele frequency (<1%), and segregation within the pedigree. Affected individuals were found to be heterozygous carrying a C to T mutation on exon 6 of the CRYBB2 gene (with SNP ID: rs74315489). The mutation was predicted to produce a premature stop mutation Q155X. The mutation is co-segregation across the pedigree and the disease “T” allele was not detected in healthy members of the family and in additional 50 normal controls (100 chromosomes). Phylogenic protein alignment was also performed for the CRYBB2 gene across 68 species ranging from fishes, Sauropsida, Placentalia, carnivores, rodents, and primates with total 56 orthologous genes. The Q155 residue is 100% conserved across the evolutionary tree, indicating its crucial function. Conclusion: Here we identify the first Taiwanese cerulean cataract family carrying a CRYBB2_Q155X mutation. ? 2018","crybb2 protein; genomic DNA; protein; unclassified drug; beta crystallin; beta-crystallin B2; adolescent; adult; allele; amino acid sequence; amplicon; Article; autosomal dominant disorder; autosomal dominant inheritance; carnivore; cataract; chromosome 18; chromosome 22; clinical article; controlled study; exome; exon; family; gene frequency; gene mutation; genotype; haplotype; homozygote; human; linkage analysis; lod score; missense mutation; nonhuman; nonsense mutation; pedigree; pedigree analysis; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; placental mammal; primate; Sanger sequencing; sauropsid; sequence alignment; short tandem repeat; simple sequence repeat; single nucleotide polymorphism; stop codon; Taiwanese; whole exome sequencing; cataract; chromosome 18; chromosome 22; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; male; mutation; phylogeny; Taiwan; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; beta-Crystallin B Chain; Cataract; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22; Exons; Family; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Male; Mutation; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Taiwan; Whole Exome Sequencing; Young Adult"
"Prognosticators of hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic vascular invasion",2019,"Objective: The prognosis of intrahepatic vascular invasion, including unilateral or main portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and hepatic vein thrombosis, is still poor. Many patients with intrahepatic vascular invasions never receive radiotherapy (RT). In recent years, more conformal RT techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) have been developed and applied to treat other cancers and have significantly improved treatment results and decreased side effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment results in patients with intrahepatic vascular invasion and explore the role of IMRT in these treatments. Materials and Methods: There were a total of 73 patients with newly diagnosed AJCC stage IIIB hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with either PVTT or hepatic vein tumor thrombosis between 2007 and 2015 in our hospital. IMRT was used for all patients who received RT. Prognostic factors, including treatment modalities, liver function, and comorbidities, were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis with the Cox model. Survival time was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The longest follow-up time was 45.3 months. The median age was 67 years. Univariate analyses indicated that IMRT, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), target therapy (sorafenib), tumor size, Child-Pugh class, and ascites were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, IMRT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.495; P = 0.019), sorafenib (HR, 0.340; P = 0.013), tumor size (HR, 2.085; P = 0.020), and Child-Pugh class (P = 0.004), were independent prognostic predictors for patients with intrahepatic vessel invasion, but TACE and ascites were not. The outcomes of patients who had different treatment modalities were significantly different (P < 0.001). Patients who received IMRT with TACE had the best outcomes. Patients who received an RT dose above 5400 cGy had better outcomes than those who with a dose below 5400 cGy, although the results were not significantly different (P = 0.248). Conclusion: IMRT is an important treatment component for patients with intrahepatic vascular invasion. Combined treatment modalities, such as IMRT with TACE, could improve the outcomes of HCC patients with intrahepatic vessel invasion. ? 2018 Tzu Chi Medical Journal","sorafenib; adult; aged; Article; ascites; cancer prognosis; chemoembolization; Child Pugh score; comorbidity; female; follow up; hepatitis C; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver function; major clinical study; male; middle aged; overall survival; radiation dose; retrospective study; tumor invasion; tumor thrombus; tumor volume"

"Hinokitiol suppresses growth of B16 melanoma by activating ERK/MKP3/proteosome pathway to downregulate survivin expression",2019,"Metastasis is the major cause of treatment failure in patients with cancer. Hinokitiol, a metal chelator derived from natural plants, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities as well as anticancer effects. We investigated the potential anticancer effects of hinokitiol in metastatic melanoma cell line B16-F10. Exposure of the melanoma B16-F10 cells to hinokitiol significantly inhibited colony formation and cell viability in a time and concentration-dependent manner. The hinokitiol-treated cells exhibited apoptotic features in morphological assay. Results from Western blot and immunoprecipitation showed that hinokitiol treatment decreased survivin protein levels and increased suvivin ubiquitination. Pretreatment with proteosome inhibitors effectively prevented hinokitiol-induced decrease in survivin expression, implying that ubiquitin/proteosome pathway involved in hinokitiol-reduced survivin expression. Hinokitiol rapidly induced ERK phosphorylation followed by a sustained dephosphorylation, which accompanied with an increase in expression of tumor suppressor MKP-3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3). Inhibition of hinokitiol-induced ERK activation by MEK inhibitor U0126 completely blocked expression of MKP-3. More importantly, inhibition of MKP-3 activity by NSC 95397 significantly inhibited hinokitiol-induced ERK dephosphorylation, ubiquitination and downregulation of survivin. These results suggested that hinokitiol inhibited growth of B16-F10 melanoma through downregulation of survivin by activating ERK/MKP-3/proteosome pathway. Hinokitiol-inhibition of survivin may be a novel and potential approach for melanoma therapy. Hinokitiol can be useful for developing therapeutic agent for melanoma. ? 2019","1,4 diamino 1,4 bis(2 aminophenylthio) 2,3 dicyanobutadiene; dual specificity phosphatase 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; nsc 95397; survivin; thujaplicin; tubulin; ubiquitin; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; beta-thujaplicin; Birc5 protein, mouse; dual specificity phosphatase 6; Dusp6 protein, mouse; mitogen activated protein kinase; proteasome; survivin; terpene; tropolone; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; controlled study; dephosphorylation; down regulation; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; melanoma B16; protein expression; signal transduction; ubiquitination; Western blotting; animal; cell proliferation; cell survival; drug effect; enzyme activation; enzymology; experimental melanoma; metabolism; mouse; pathology; phosphorylation; protein degradation; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Down-Regulation; Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6; Enzyme Activation; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Monoterpenes; Phosphorylation; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Proteolysis; Signal Transduction; Survivin; Tropolone; Ubiquitination"
"Risk stratification for low extremity amputation in critical limb ischemia patients who have undergone endovascular revascularization: A survival tree analysis",2019,"Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are a heterogeneous population and differ in risk of mortality and low extremity amputation (LEA), which complicates clinical decision-making. This study aimed to develop a simple risk scale using decision tree methodology to guide physicians in managing critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients who will benefit from endovascular therapy (EVT).A total of 736 patients with CLI, Rutherford classification (RC) stage ?4, and prior successful EVT were included. Variables significantly associated with LEA by univariate analysis (P < .05) were selected and put into classification tree analysis using the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model with a dependent variable, amputation, and depth of tree = 3. Four risk groups were generated according to the order of amputation rate. The amputation-free survival (AFS) times between groups were compared using the Kaplan-Meier curve with the log-rank test.Patients were classified as high risk for amputation (G4) (WBC counts ?10,000/μl, and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) ?130.337); intermediate risk group 1 (G3) (WBC < 10,000/μl and RC stage before EVT > 5); intermediate risk group 2 (G2) (WBC count ? 10,000/μl, and PLR < 130.337) and low-risk group (G1) (WBC < 10,000/μl, RC before EVT ? 5). G2, G3, and G4 risk groups had shorter AFS time (range, 58.7 to 65.5 months) than the G1 risk group (100 months) (P < .05). Risk of LEA was significantly higher in the G4, G3, and G2 groups than in the G1 group (P ? .05). The G4 group had the highest risk of amputation (odds ratio = 6.84, P < .001).This simple risk scale model can help healthcare professionals more easily identify and appropriately treat patients with CLI who are at different levels of risk for LEA following endovascular revascularization. ? 2019 the Author(s).","albumin; creatinine; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; aged; albumin blood level; amputation free survival; Article; chronic kidney failure; coronary artery disease; critical limb ischemia; decision tree; end stage renal disease; endovascular surgery; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; hematocrit; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; high risk population; human; iliac artery; intermediate risk population; leg amputation; leg revascularization; low risk population; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; observational study; platelet count; platelet lymphocyte ratio; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; amputation; endovascular surgery; ischemia; Kaplan Meier method; lower limb; middle aged; mortality; odds ratio; peripheral occlusive artery disease; postoperative complication; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; vascularization; Aged; Amputation; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Ischemia; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Postoperative Complications; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Male patients with a higher frequency of nocturnal urinary episodes are more likely to benefit from alpha-blocker therapy for bothersome nocturia",2019,"Objective: This retrospective study investigated the therapeutic effects of alpha-blockers on men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) to identify baseline variables that may predict therapeutic response in terms of nocturia improvement. Methods: The study included 348 men with LUTS, including bothersome nocturia, treated with tamsulosin 0.4 mg at bedtime (h.s.) for 3 months. Responders were defined as patients with a decrease of ?1 nocturia episodes/night after alpha-blocker therapy. Nocturnal urinary frequency, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) voiding and storage scores, as well as the voiding to storage (V/S) ratio, prostate measurements, uroflowmetry, and post-void residual were determined at baseline and 1 and 3 months after alpha-blocker therapy. Results: The overall response rate was 44.8% (156/348). Nocturia improved in 60 patients (17.2%) reporting a reduction of ?2 episodes/night and in 96 patients (27.6%) reporting a reduction of 1 episode/night. Total and storage IPSS scores, the IPSS V/S ratio and the number nocturia episodes were higher in responders than non-responders. IPSS storage subscores and nocturia episodes were significantly greater, whereas IPSS V/S ratio and maximum flow rate (Q max ) were lower, in those with a reduction of ?2 versus 1 episode/night. Multivariate analysis revealed that nocturia episodes and a lower V/S ratio were predictors of responders with an improvement of ?2 episodes/night. The quality of life index improved significantly more in responders than non-responders. Conclusion: Tamsulosin treatment (0.4 mg, h.s.) for 3 months not only improved voiding and storage symptoms, but also reduced nocturia episodes. Patients with more nocturia episodes may benefit more from alpha-blocker treatment in terms of reducing the number of nocturia episodes. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","tamsulosin; alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent; tamsulosin; aged; Article; bedtime dosage; controlled study; genital system disease assessment; human; International Prostate Symptom Score; lower urinary tract symptom; major clinical study; male; men's health; morphometry; multivariate analysis; nocturia; postvoid residual urine volume; prediction; priority journal; prostate; Quality of Life Index; retrospective study; treatment duration; treatment response; urinary frequency; uroflowmetry; voiding and storage score; voiding to storage ratio; lower urinary tract symptom; nocturia; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; urodynamics; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Aged; Humans; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Male; Nocturia; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Tamsulosin; Treatment Outcome; Urodynamics"
"Using nursing digital technology to reduce the rates of catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated urinary tract infection",2019,"Background & Problems: Urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common type of healthcare-associated infection, may result from negligence of care regardless of the presence or absence of catheterization. The UTI rate in our unit was 0.69?, which was the highest among all of the wards in the hospital. Purpose: This project aimed to reduce the UTI rate to 0.37?. Resolution: In order to achieve this goal, we amended the SOPs and audit table of catheterization, enhanced access to catheterization and perineal-wash-related instructional videos using quick response (QR) codes, encouraged and reminded patients to drink plenty of water, maintained the urinary drainage system free to avoid the growth of bacterial colonies, revised related healthcare education pamphlets and posters, and organized on-the-job training sessions for nursing staff. Result: The UTI rate fell from 0.69? to 0.30?. Moreover, patients and their families responded well to the QR code method of accessing relevant videos, which enhanced technical knowledge and made the new information easy to learn. Conclusion: The use of QR code scanning enabled patients and their families to easily and conveniently watch videos on catheterization and perineal washing on demand. Nurses may employ QR codes in health education more frequently in order to provide higher quality nursing care. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Utilization of a central venous catheter insertion care bundle in Taiwan: A cross-sectional analysis of the National Health Insurance Research Database",2019,"Objectives: The objectives of this study are to explore medical care utilization associated with promoting the central venous catheter (CVC) care bundle plan using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Materials and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of the data from patients who were admitted to a medical center for the first time between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012, in the NHIRD. The control group was patients who were admitted at nine medical center hospitals that participated in the pilot plan, and the study group was patients who were admitted at other ten medical center hospitals that did not participate in the pilot plan, and the differences between groups were analyzed. Results: After implementing the CVC care bundle, the average hospital stay decreased significantly (18.43 ± 12.96 vs. 15.49 ± 10.16, P < 0.05). In addition, the study group patients were clinically less likely to require antibiotics than the control group (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.07, 1.71] vs. 0.62, 95% CI = [0.40, 0.96], P = 3768), and their medical expenses were lower (220, 618 ± 226, 419 vs. 208, 079 ± 193, 610, P > 05). Furthermore, the incidence rate of CVC-associated sepsis decreased from 12.59% to 5.66%. Conclusions: By implementing the CVC care bundle in clinical practice in accordance with national policies, medical utilization decreased, thereby considerably improving medical resource usage. These results confirmed that implementing the CVC care bundle possibly decreased medical utilization in clinical practice. ? 2019 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","antibiotic agent; adult; aged; Article; catheter infection; catheterization; comparative study; confidence interval; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data base; descriptive research; female; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; medical research; national health insurance; odds ratio; pilot study; retrospective study; Taiwan; university hospital"
"Engineering a Nanoscale Al-MOF-Armored Antigen Carried by a “Trojan Horse”-Like Platform for Oral Vaccination to Induce Potent and Long-Lasting Immunity",2019,"Vaccination via the oral administration of an antigen faces many challenges, including gastrointestinal (GI) proteolysis and mucosal barriers. To limit GI proteolysis, a biomimetically mineralized aluminum-based metal–organic framework (Al-MOF) system that is resistant to ambient temperature and pH and can act synergistically as a delivery vehicle and an adjuvant is synthesized over a model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to act as armor. To overcome mucosal barriers, a yeast-derived capsule is used to carry the Al-MOF-armored OVA as a “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform. In vitro experiments reveal that the mineralization of Al-MOFs forms an armor on OVA that protects against highly acidic and degradative GI conditions. However, the mineralized Al-MOFs can gradually disintegrate in a phosphate ion-containing simulated intracellular fluid, slowly releasing their encapsulated OVA. In vivo studies reveal that the “Trojan Horse”-like transport platform specifically targets intestinal M cells, favoring the transepithelial transport of the Al-MOF-armored OVA, followed by subsequent endocytosis in local macrophages, ultimately accumulating in mesenteric lymph nodes, yielding long-lasting, high-levels of mucosal S-IgA and serum IgG antibodies. Such an engineered delivery platform may represent a promising strategy for the oral administration of prophylactic or therapeutic antigens for vaccination. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Epilepsy is associated with higher subsequent mortality risk in patients after stroke: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Objective: To use the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to determine whether patients with poststroke epilepsy (PSE) in Taiwan have an increased risk of mortality. Methods: We analyzed the data from the NHIRD of patients (?40 years) who had received stroke diagnoses between 2000 and 2012. The patients with stroke were divided into PSE and poststroke non-epilepsy (PSN) cohorts and compared against a sex-, age-, comorbidity-, and index-date-matched cohort from normal population. We calculated adjusted HRs (aHRs) and 95% CIs of all-cause mortality risk in these cohorts after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results: Among the poststroke patients, 12.14% constituted the PSE cohort. The cumulative mortality rate was considerably higher in the PSE than in the PSN cohort. The PSE (aHR=4.18, 95% CI=3.91-4.48) and PSN (aHR=1.90, 95% CI=1.83-1.98) cohorts were associated with higher risks of mortality than the comparison cohort. Furthermore, advanced age (?65 years), male sex, alcohol-related illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and cancer would further increase the risk of mortality after a stroke event. Conclusion: The mortality risk in poststroke patients is approximately two times the likelihood in those with PSE than in those without, and approximately four times higher than that in the normal population. Our findings provide crucial information for clinicians and the government to improve survival after stroke. ? 2019 Harnod et al.","adult; age; aged; all cause mortality; Article; Asia; asthma; cardiovascular risk; case control study; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; disease association; epilepsy; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mortality rate; mortality risk; retrospective study; risk factor; sex; Taiwan"
"Correlation between sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 with aortic arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes: A prospective, cross-sectional study",2019,"Background: Sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 are extracellular inhibitors of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, which is implicated in the development of arterial stiffness. However, the correlation between aortic stiffness and sclerostin or Dickkopf-1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is unknown. Methods: Fasting blood samples were collected from 125 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Aortic stiffness was measured by carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity, and high aortic stiffness was defined by a carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity of &gt;10 m/s. The serum sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 concentrations were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: In total, 46 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (36.8%) had high levels of aortic stiffness. Compared to the control group without aortic stiffness, this group was significantly older, had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, had higher blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and serum sclerostin levels, and had significantly lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and estimated glomerular filtration rates. After adjusting for confounders, serum sclerostin [odds ratio = 1.005 (1.002–1.007), p = 0.002] levels remained an independent predictor of aortic stiffness. Multivariate analysis showed that the serum sclerostin level (β = 0.374, adjusted R2 change = 0.221, p &lt; 0.001) was positively associated with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity. Conclusion: Serum levels of sclerostin, but not Dickkopf-1, are positively correlated with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity and independently predict aortic stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ?

"Treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Eastern Taiwan",2019,"Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the treatment outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) under special programmatic management in Eastern Taiwan over the past 10 years. Materials and Methods: All newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients and MDR-TB patients enrolled previously with persistent positive cultures were included in this study, from May 2007 to April 2017, in Eastern Taiwan. A panel of pulmonologists designed the initial MDR-TB regimens. Subsequently, regimens were adjusted according to drug susceptibility test results for second-line drugs. Mobile teams were organized for treatment support, and several measures were adapted to safeguard effective treatment support. Results: A total of 178 patients with bacteriological confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB were identified, of whom 167 had treatment outcomes when the study was conducted. Of these 167 patients, 120 (71.9%) were cured, 11 (6.5%) completed therapy (78.4% had successful treatment), 25 (15.0%) died, 9 (5.4%) had treatment failure, none were transferred out, and 2 (1.2%) were lost to follow-up. Surgery was performed on 8 (4.8%). Conclusions: This is an analysis of the treatment outcomes after adopting the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course Plus program to treat MDR-TB patients in Eastern Taiwan. We had a low proportion of loss-to-follow-up, resulting in a high treatment success rate. This program serves as an effective model in providing quality care to patients with MDR-TB. ? 2018 Tzu Chi Medical Journal","amikacin; capreomycin; ethambutol; isoniazid; kanamycin; levofloxacin; moxifloxacin; ofloxacin; pyrazinamide; rifabutin; adult; aged; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; arthralgia; Article; body mass; controlled study; dizziness; drug sensitivity; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; nausea; pulmonologist; short course therapy; sputum smear; treatment duration; treatment failure; treatment outcome; vertigo; vomiting"
"Androgen deprivation therapy and the risk of tenosynovitis in prostate cancer patients",2019,"Objectives: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use in prostate cancer (PCa) patients has been reported to have an association with rheumatoid arthritis. We aimed to assess the impact of ADT on the subsequent risk of tenosynovitis. Methods: Using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan between 2001 and 2013, 3309 patients with PCa were identified. Among them, 729 ADT patients comprised the study group with 729 matched non-ADT controls. We used a 1:1 propensity score matched analysis. The demographic characteristics and comorbidities of the patients were analyzed; Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of tenosynovitis. Results: There were 224 (15.3%) patients with newly diagnosed tenosynovitis. Compared with non-ADT patients, ADT patients had a lower risk of subsequent tenosynovitis with an adjusted HR of 0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28–0.51; P < 0.001]. Conclusions: ADT use apparently did not increase the risk of tenosynovitis in patients with PCa. Further studies are warranted to assess the clinical significance. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","bicalutamide; buserelin; cyproterone acetate; diethylstilbestrol; estramustine; flutamide; goserelin; leuprorelin; nilutamide; triptorelin; antiandrogen; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; adult; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; demography; human; major clinical study; male; patient identification; prostate cancer; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; tenosynovitis; drug monitoring; factual database; middle aged; pathology; procedures; prostate tumor; risk assessment; tenosynovitis; treatment outcome; Aged; Androgen Antagonists; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Databases, Factual; Drug Monitoring; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Taiwan; Tenosynovitis; Treatment Outcome"

"Population-based study of Entecavir and long-term mortality in chronic hepatitis B–related decompensated liver cirrhosis",2019,"Background and aims: We lack population-based studies that identify the role of entecavir (ETV) in extending long-term survival in chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related decompensated liver cirrhotic patients. Since 2010, National Health Insurance in Taiwan has covered long-term medical payment for antiviral therapy in CHB-related cirrhotic patients whose HBV DNA is ? 2000 IU/mL. We studied the effect of ETV on the mortality of CHB-related decompensated cirrhosis patients compared with patients who did not receive antiviral agents at baseline. Methods: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we collected 758 CHB-related decompensated cirrhosis patients with elevated viral loads (HBV DNA ? 2000 IU/mL) using ETV and discharged between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013. The comparison group consisted of 1516 selected CHB-related decompensated cirrhotic patients without antiviral therapy at baseline using propensity score matching analysis. Results: The 1-, 2-, and 3-year mortality probabilities were 34.7%, 42.5%, and 48.5 % in the ETV group and 21.1%, 37.8% and 51.3 % in the non-ETV group, respectively. Based on a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted by patients’ sex, age, and comorbid disorders, the hazard ratios (HR) in the ETV group for 1-year, 1–2-year, and 2–3-year mortalities were 1.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.43, P = .010), 1.02 (0.86–1.20, P = .866), and 0.59 (0.38–0.90, P = .016), compared with the non-ETV group. Conclusions: Even in CHB-related decompensated cirrhotic patients, higher initial viral loads were correlated with poor outcomes. However, the long-term usage of ETV can decrease long-term mortality in these patients. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; adult; age distribution; Article; chronic hepatitis B; comorbidity; controlled study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; female; hospital discharge; human; ICD-9-CM; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; population research; proportional hazards model; sex difference; survival rate; Taiwanese; virus load"
"Activation of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes in a mouse model of Schistosoma mansoni infection",2020,"Schistosomiasis is an inflammatory disease that occurs when schistosome species eggs are deposited in the liver, resulting in fibrosis and portal hypertension. Schistosomes can interact with host inflammasomes to elicit host immune responses, leading to mitochondrial damage, generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species ROS and activation of apoptosis during inflammation. This study aims to examine whether ROS and NF-κB p65 expression elicited other types of inflammasome activation in Schistosoma mansoni-infected mouse livers. We examine the relationship between inflammasome activation, mitochondrial damage and ROS production in mouse livers infected with S. Mansoni. We demonstrate a significant release of ROS and superoxides and increased NF-κB p65 in S. Mansoni-infected mouse livers. Moreover, activation of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes was triggered by S. Mansoni infection. Stimulation of HuH-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells with soluble egg antigen induced activation of the AIM2 inflammasome pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that S.

"Long-term clinical outcome of drug-eluting vs. Bare-metal stent implantation after percutaneous coronary intervention in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis: Nationwide Cohort Study in Taiwan",2019,"Background: Data on clinical outcome after drug-eluting stent (DES) vs. bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under hemodialysis are limited and controversial. Methods and Results: We identified 4,970 patients under chronic hemodialysis from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) who had their first coronary stenting between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2012. After 1:1 propensity score matching, we evaluated clinical outcomes for 1,151 patients in the DES group and 1,151 patients in the matched BMS group. We used ICD-9 CM codes or operation code to identify all outcomes in the study cohort after the index procedure. Primary outcomes including composite endpoints of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, and revascularization after the index procedure were similar in both groups (HR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.81–1.09; P=0.399). The results were consistent in various generations of DES vs. BMS groups. Secondary outcomes including mortality, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, revascularization, cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, peptic ulcer bleeding or blood transfusion were similar in both groups, except for a lower risk of peptic ulcer disease in the DES group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41–0.83; P=0.003) than the BMS group. Conclusions: In patients on chronic hemodialysis, implantation of DES did not have a better clinical outcome than BMS. ? 2019, Japanese Circulation Society.

"Immunopathological effects of Agaricus blazei Murill polysaccharides against Schistosoma mansoni infection by Th1 and NK1 cells differentiation",2019,"In this study, we examined the ability of A. blazei Murill polysaccharides (AB-PS) to activate the immune system in vivo and the protective activity exhibited against parasitic S. mansoni in the murine model. AB-PS treatment significantly reduced the worm and egg burden in infected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice with dose- and time-dependent manners. Additionally, a dose- and time-dependent expression of IL-2, INF-γ, and TNF-α cytokines was also observed in both strains of mice treatments. Using T1/T2 doubly transgenic mice, we demonstrated that AB-PS-treated mice splenocytes initiated early differentiation of Th1 and NK1 cells, which was consistent with the reduction course of Schistosoma infection. Although AB-PS treatment enhanced the Th1 response, it did not suppress Th2 cell activity in treated mice. Histopathological data of the livers showed AB-PS treatment significantly attenuated the liver fibrosis induced by S. mansoni eggs. AB-PS augmented type-1 responses by inducing Th1 and NK1 cell differentiation to effectively decrease the infection rate of S. mansoni. Furthermore, AB-PS treatment may not only inhibit the schistosome infection, but also improving the pathological effects of granulomas formation. This study provides evidence for a novel therapeutic potential, by which A. blazei Murill may be used to treat or prevent schistosome infection. ? 2019","gamma interferon; interleukin 2; messenger RNA; polysaccharide; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; polysaccharide; adult; Agaricus blazei; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell differentiation; controlled study; female; granuloma; histopathology; immunomodulation; infection rate; liver fibrosis; liver tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; schistosomiasis; schistosomiasis mansoni; spleen cell; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; worm burden; Agaricus; animal; Bagg albino mouse; C57BL mouse; drug effect; genetics; immunology; liver; natural killer cell; parasitology; schistosomiasis mansoni; transgenic mouse; Agaricus; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cytokines; Killer Cells, Natural; Liver; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Polysaccharides; Schistosomiasis mansoni; Th1 Cells"
"The Association Between Different Patterns of Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment and All-Cause Mortality Among Cancer Patients",2019,"Background: Cancer patients receiving Western medical treatment, frequently seek Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to alleviate adverse effects and prolong survival. Objective: This study evaluated the association between the use of TCM and cancer survival rate. Research into the effect of TCM on patient survival is limited, this analysis focused on 3 patterns of TCM use. Methods: Three retrospective cohorts with different patterns of TCM use were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan and analyzed. Patients with newly diagnosed cancer between 1997 and 2012 were classified into groups of prediagnosis, postdiagnosis, and continuous TCM use associated with awareness of cancer diagnosis. All demographic and clinical data were analyzed. Results: After propensity score matching, longevity of the postdiagnosis and continuous TCM user was significantly longer than the non-TCM user. The adjusted hazard ratios of death in postdiagnosis and continuous TCM use groups (0.59 and 0.61, respectively) were lower than the non-TCM use group. Conclusion: The analysis suggests that cancer patients using TCM in conjunction with Western medical treatment exhibited a higher survival rate than patients not using TCM treatment. ?

"Determinants of Parental Intentions to Vaccinate Kindergarten Children Against Seasonal Influenza in Xiamen, China",2019,"Seasonal influenza epidemics occur almost every year, and children under 6?years of age constitute one of the most susceptible groups. While free vaccinations are offered to preschool children in some large cities in China, Xiamen lacks a free vaccination policy and other effective policies aimed at increasing parents’ acceptance of the vaccine. Using the health belief model (HBM), we sought to: (1) investigate the determinants of parents’ intentions to vaccinate their kindergarten children against seasonal influenza if the free policy were implemented, and (2) explore the possible interaction effects between “cues to action” and “perceived susceptibility” and/or “perceived severity.” A total of 1350 parents with kindergarten children were selected by stratified random sampling from half the population in Xiamen, of whom 1211 responded effectively to our survey. Scobit models with testing for interactions among the key concepts of the HBM were used to investigate factors associated with parents’ intentions to vaccinate their children. In total, 85.1% of 1211 parents reported that they were willing to vaccinate their children if free influenza vaccinations were offered, although only 37 children (3.1%) had received influenza vaccination in the previous year, and 261 (21.6%) had been vaccinated since birth. Parents’ perceived susceptibility (AOR = 1.77), perceived benefits (AOR = 3.12), perceived barriers (AOR = 0.38) and cues to action (AOR = 3.54) in terms of childhood vaccination against influenza were significantly associated with their vaccination intentions. The only observed interaction effect was between perceived susceptibility and cues to action (AOR = 1.57), which had additive effects on strengthening parental intentions to vaccinate their children. Our findings can be used as a basis for formulating government strategies aimed at improving influenza vaccination coverage among children in kindergarten and guiding culturally informed primary prevention efforts among their parents. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Astragalus polysaccharide (PG2) ameliorates cancer symptom clusters, as well as improves quality of life in patients with metastatic disease, through modulation of the inflammatory cascade",2019,"Background: Improving patients’ quality of life (QoL) is a principal objective of all treatment in any clinical setting, including oncology practices. Cancer-associated inflammation is implicated in disease progression and worsening of patients’ QoL. Conventional anticancer therapeutics while selectively eliminating cancerous cells, are evaded by stem cell-like cells, and associated with varying degrees of adverse effects, thus reducing patients’ QoL. This necessitates novel therapeutic approaches with enhanced efficacy, minimal or no treatment-related adverse effects, and improved QoL in patients with cancer, especially those with metastatic/advance stage disease. Methods: Sequel to our team’s previous publication, the present study explores probable effects of Astragalus polysaccharides (PG2) on cancer-related inflammatory landscape and known determinants of QoL, as well as the probable link between the two to provide mechanistic insight. In an exploratory double blind randomized controlled trial using patients with metastatic disease (n = 23), we comparatively evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of high (500 mg) or low (250 mg) dose PG2 administered intravenously (i.v.), with particular focus on its suggested anti-inflammatory function and the probable effect of same on QoL indices at baseline, then at weeks 4 and 8 post-PG2 treatment. Results: All 23 patients with metastatic disease treated with either low or high PG2 experienced reduced pain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, as well as better appetite and sleep, culminating in improved global QoL. This was most apparent in the high dose group, with significant co-suppression of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, monocytes chemotactic protein (MCP)1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor growth factor (TGF)-β1, interferon (IFN)-γ, and immune suppressors IL-10 and IL-12. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that IL-1β, IL-13 and GM-CSF are independent prognosticators of improved QoL. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study provides premier evidence of functional association between PG2 anti-inflammatory effects and improved QoL in patients with advanced stage cancers, laying the groundwork for future larger cohort blinded controlled trials to establish the efficacy of PG2 as adjuvant anticancer therapy in metastatic or advanced stage clinical settings. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Long-term outcomes of anti-incontinence surgery and subsequent transvaginal sling incision for urethral obstruction",2019,"Introduction and hypothesis: The suburethral sling procedure has been widely used as the first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. Although the success rate is high, difficult urination and urine retention can occur in a small portion of patients. A transvaginal sling incision can solve this problem but recurrent SUI may occur. This study investigated the long-term outcomes of women who underwent the pubovaginal sling (PVS) procedure and subsequent transvaginal sling incision for urethral obstruction. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the voiding conditions of women who underwent transvaginal sling incision owing to bladder outlet obstruction after the PVS procedure over the past two decades. Urodynamic study was performed before and after each operation. The patients’ Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) and quality of life index (QoL-I) due to urinary symptoms were used for outcome evaluation. Results: Among 405 women who underwent PVS procedure, 14 (3.5%) underwent subsequent transvaginal sling incision. The main symptoms were severe dysuria, followed by urinary retention or severe wound discomfort. The average interval between the two operations was 147.6 ± 353.6 days (range 3~1,344). The mean follow-up time after sling incision was 91.1 ± 50.7?months. At follow-up, 12 patients (85.7%) could maintain urinary continence whereas 2 had urgency incontinence. Ten patients (71.4%) were satisfied with their quality of life postoperatively. Conclusions: Transvaginal sling incision is effective for urethral obstruction after PVS procedure. Voiding dysfunction after PVS could be resolved via sling incision. Most patients could maintain urinary continence and reported good satisfaction. ? 2018, The International Urogynecological Association.","adult; aged; Article; bladder function; bladder obstruction; body mass; clinical outcome; disease severity; dysuria; female; follow up; human; incision; major clinical study; micturition; middle aged; pelvis surgery; pregnancy; priority journal; pubovaginal sling procedure; quality of life; Quality of Life Index; retrospective study; urethra obstruction; urinary frequency; urinary urgency; urine incontinence; urine retention; uroflowmetry; wound; adverse device effect; procedures; stress incontinence; suburethral sling; surgical mesh; treatment outcome; urethra obstruction; urine retention; urologic surgery; Aged; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Suburethral Slings; Surgical Mesh; Treatment Outcome; Urethral Obstruction; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Urinary Retention; Urologic Surgical Procedures"
"Orally administered resveratrol enhances the therapeutic effect of autologous transplanted adipose-derived stem cells on rats with diabetic hepatopathy",2020,"Stem cell therapy is a promising treatment for hepatopathy due to diabetes mellitus (DM); oral resveratrol treatment exhibits protective effects. We investigated whether protective effects could be produced in liver of diabetic rats receiving autologous adipose-derived stem cell transplantation (ADSC) plus oral resveratrol administration. Male rats were divided into four groups: sham group; streptozotocin induced DM group; DM + ADSC group, in which DM rats were treated with 106?stem cells/rat; and DM + R + ADSC group, in which DM rats were treated with ADSC and oral resveratrol. The DM group exhibited apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis, whereas Sirt-1 and survival signaling were suppressed. Pathological conditions other than survival signaling were improved in the DM + ADSC group. All pathological conditions were improved in the DM + R + ADSC group. Also, the oxidative stress level in the blood was reduced in the DM + R + ADSC group compared to the sham group. Oral resveratrol administration appears to reduce oxidative damage and enhances survival signaling in diabetic liver. The therapeutic response in the DM + R + ADSC group was better than in the DM + ADSC group. ? 2020, ? 2020 The Biological Stain Commission.",""
"Molecular Characteristics of Underactive Bladder",2019,"Purpose of Review: Underactive bladder (UAB) is a common urological problem in elderly patients presenting with urinary retention and lower urinary tract symptoms. UAB causes chronic urinary retention or a large post-void residual urine which is usually difficult to manage. Treatment of UAB is a challenge to urologists. The underlying pathophysiology has not been completely elucidated. Molecular diagnosis for the clinical characteristics of UAB is important for us to understand the pathogenesis and develop new therapeutic modalities. Recent Findings: The urodynamic finding of UAB might be detrusor acontractility of low contractility and is often termed detrusor underactivity. UAB is frequently encountered in elderly patients with chronic medical or neurological diseases. The pathophysiology of UAB may involve neurogenic, myogenic, and bladder outlet pathologies. Recent studies also reveal that increased suburothelial inflammation and altered sensory protein expressions in bladder mucosa were prominent in patients with UAB. Impaired urothelial signaling and sensory transduction pathways might be associated with impaired bladder sensation as well as impaired detrusor contractility. In addition, the bladder outlet obstruction, inflammation, or bladder ischemia-induced oxidative stress might also decrease the energy of the detrusor and result in UAB. Neurogenic inhibition, myogenic factor, and psychogenic inhibition might also be the causes for UAB. Summary: This article reviews recent researches on the pathophysiology and molecular characteristics of UAB. Neurogenic, myogenic, urotheliogenic, bladder outlet, and psychogenic factors might all contribute to UAB. Comprehensive clinical investigations and basic researches may provide a better understanding and effective treatment for this common but difficult bladder disorder. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adenosine triphosphate; brain derived neurotrophic factor; connexin 43; inducible nitric oxide synthase; muscarinic M2 receptor; muscarinic M3 receptor; nerve growth factor; nitric oxide; prostaglandin; purinergic P2X3 receptor; transient receptor potential channel; aging; bladder distension; bladder dysfunction; bladder obstruction; clinical feature; cystometry; diabetes mellitus; down regulation; human; hypotonic bladder; immunoprecipitation; inflammation; micturition; molecular diagnosis; mRNA expression level; multiple sclerosis; muscle contractility; muscle contraction; muscle disease; nerve degeneration; neurologic disease; neuropathy; nonhuman; overactive bladder; oxidative stress; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prevalence; protein expression; rat; reperfusion injury; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; upregulation; urinary tract infection; urine incontinence; urine retention; urodynamics"
"Applying intelligent technology in gender competence training for nurses",2019,"Despite an increased focus on the healthcare rights of people of different genders and the establishment of gender policies related to healthcare in Taiwan, the promotion of gender rights in nursing education and clinical care remains unsatisfactory. Given the increasingly diversified nature of healthcare systems and nursing knowledge bases, many experienced nurses have expressed the need for self-growth through continuing education and in-service training. The professional knowledge required of nurses increases continuously, and gender issues have received little attention in conventional nursing education. Consequently, gender education has been overlooked because of insufficient teaching time and a lack of qualified teachers. In promoting online courses for nurses, the government should focus on the different nursing care needs of different genders and sexual orientations as well as design online courses based on intelligent technology that satisfy the desire of nurses to improve their gender competence. This study adopts an intelligent technology perspective in order to highlight the importance of gender competence for nurses and to propose incorporating augmented reality into case scenarios that facilitate the creation of online healthcare courses and teaching materials that enhance gender competence. This approach may effectively resolve the problem of teachers having insufficient time to provide gender education effectively. Nurses must possess diverse gender perspectives and reinforce their gender competence and cross-disciplinary integration capabilities in order to provide appropriate care for patients of different gender identities and sexual orientations. ? 2019, Taiwan Nurses Association.

"Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women associated with risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan",2019,"Objective:The aim of the study was to evaluate the risks and benefits of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women in Taiwan.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, a population-based healthcare claims dataset. Eligible women, aged 40 to 65, were matched 1:1 by age and menopause year to avoid confounding through imbalanced baseline characteristics among the two groups (2,491 pairs). The primary outcomes were acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and ischemic stroke (IS).Results:Mean follow-up in the HT group was 30 months. Mean age of the HT group was 50 years. After adjusting for age, statin and anticoagulant use, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) for the HT group were increased: ACS, 3.73 (2.01-6.91); IS, 3.51 (2.41-5.11); and VTE, 2.51 (1.15-5.47).Conclusions:In postmenopausal Taiwanese women, HT may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although the women in our population receiving HT were near menopausal age, their risk of cardiovascular disease was still higher than in the non-HT group. ? 2018 The Author(s).","anticoagulant agent; estrogen; gestagen; glibenclamide; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; statin (protein); acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; Article; brain ischemia; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; hormonal therapy; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; menopausal syndrome; outcome assessment; postmenopause; prescription; retrospective study; risk benefit analysis; Taiwan; venous thromboembolism"
"Effective treatment of bovine mastitis with intramammary infusion of angelica dahurica and rheum officinale extracts",2019,"Mastitis in dairy cattle is a highly prevalent infectious disease, causing considerable economic loss worldwide. In this study, we used Angelica dahurica and Rheum officinale extracts (designated as Yi-Xiong-Tang, YXT) for mastitis treatment. California mastitis test (CMT) was performed and 67 mastitis udder quarters were identified among 179 lactating dairy cows. These 67 mastitis udder quarters were subjected to treatments by intramammary infusion of YXT twice a day for three consecutive days. The mastitis indicators including clots, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, and total viable count of bacteria (TVC) in milk were examined before and after the YXT treatment to evaluate its effectiveness. Levels of mastitis indicators from mastitis udder quarters were elevated. After YXT treatment, normal levels of these indicators were restored: TVC, 2.10 × 104 – 9.20 × 106 CFU/mL; clots, 6.56 ± 0.43 mg/mL; LDH, 181.0 ± 18.55 U/L; TNF-, 0.02 ± 0.02 ng/mL; IL-6, 41.4 ± 11.46 pg/mL; and IL-8, 1.85 ± 0.60 pg/mL. Compared with the antibiotic therapy, YXT treatment has a shorter treatment course and might have lower probability for the causative agents to develop drug resistance because YXT is in fact a cocktail containing multiple active ingredients.

"Role of Sodium Taurocholate Cotransporting Polypeptide as a New Reporter and Drug-Screening Platform: Implications for Preventing Hepatitis B Virus Infections",2020,"Purpose: Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a transmembrane protein responsible for delivering indocyanine green (ICG), an ideal infrared fluorescent dye, from extracellular space into the cytoplasm. Additionally, NTCP located in the hepatocyte membrane is the portal for hepatitis B and D virus (HBV/HDV) infections. This study verified the feasibility of NTCP as a reporter and further established a drug-screening platform for HBV/HDV infections. Procedures: NTCP was transduced into HT-29, a colorectal cancer cell line. To examine the use of NTCP as a reporter, NTCP-expressing cells were treated with ICG and examined through flow cytometry, an in vivo imaging system (IVIS), and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, ICG was administrated to NTCP-expressing tumor-bearing nude mice and examined using the IVIS. To study the drug-screening platform, NTCP-expressing cells were treated with cyclosporin A, an NTCP inhibitor, and ICG, and examined using a multimode detection platform. Moreover, nude mice were injected with NTCP inhibitors and ICG, and subsequently, their ICG signal was examined in vivo and in the blood. Results: In the reporter study, the ICG signal was higher in NTCP-expressing cells/tumors than in control cells/tumors after ICG treatment. In the drug-screening platform study, NTCP-expressing cells had decreased ICG intensity after treatment with NTCP inhibitors and ICG. Nude mice that were administered cyclosporin A had lower ICG intensity in the liver and higher intensity in the peripheral tissue and blood. Conclusions: NTCP and ICG form an ideal reporter system with extensive applications in cancer biology, robust drug–drug interactions, and drug screening in HBV/HDV infections. ? 2019, World Molecular Imaging Society.",""
"Factors Associated With Adenoma Detection in Propofol-sedated Patients",2019,"Goals: To assess the factors associated with adenoma detection in propofol-sedated patients.Backgrounds: Low adenoma detection rate (ADR) are linked to increased risk of interval cancer and related deaths. Compared with air insufflation (AI) colonoscopy, the method of water exchange (WE) significantly decreased insertion pain and increased ADR in unsedated patients. Deep sedation with propofol has been increasingly used in colonoscopy. One report suggested that WE significantly increased ADR in propofol-sedated patients, but the factors associated with adenoma detection were not analyzed.Study: Post hoc multiple logistic regression analyses were performed based on pooled data from 2 randomized controlled trials to assess the factors associated with adenoma detection in propofol-sedated patients.Results: Propofol-sedated patients (n=510) were randomized to AI and WE. The baseline characteristics were comparable. Multiple logistic regression analyses show that age, withdrawal time, indications (screening vs. diagnostic), and WE were significantly and independently associated with higher ADR. WE had fewer patients with inadequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of <6. Despite a significantly shorter inspection time, WE had significantly higher overall ADR than AI, especially in those with adequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale of ?6. Right colon ADR (17.5% vs. 10.5%), flat ADR (32.3% vs. 19.4%), combined advanced and sessile serrated ADR (13.1% vs. 7.4%) of WE were significantly higher than those of AI.Conclusions: WE enhanced quality of colonoscopy in propofol-sedated patients by significantly improving colon cleanliness and overall ADR. Colonoscopists with patients under propofol sedation might consider evaluating WE method for performance improvement. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Auricular acupressure: reducing side effects of chemotherapy in women with ovarian cancer",2019,"Purpose: Many women with ovarian cancer may experience adverse effects from adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Non-pharmacological interventions can be used to reduce these side effects. We tested auricular acupressure to reduce treatment side effects in this population. Methods: A prospective, quasi-randomized controlled trial was carried out at a publicly-funded hospital in southern Taiwan. Thirty-four women in the intervention group received auricular acupressure at four points (Shenmen, subcortex, endocrine, and heart), three times per day for 3?min per time, for 6?weeks. Thirty-one women in the control group received routine nursing care alone. The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) was completed at four time points. Results: After receiving the third cycle of chemotherapy, side effect severity was elevated among both groups. Auricular acupressure reduced side effects such as disturbed sleep (t = ? 11.99; p <.001, eta squared = 0.69), fatigue (t = ? 2.57; p <.01, eta squared = 0.10), and lack of appetite (t = ? 2.37; p =.024, eta squared = 0.08).

"Acupuncture therapy improves health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent around the world and has a large impact on its patients, leading to a poor health-related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity. Even under optimal medications, there are still many patients with poor HRQL. Body acupuncture therapy (BAT) is a non-invasive and a popular therapy. Therefore, we aimed to comprehensively analyze the effects of BAT in COPD. Materials and methods: Eight electronic databases were searched. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of BAT, medication (M), and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). The primary outcome was HRQL evaluated by St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) or COPD assessment test (CAT). Results: Of the 922 articles, 12 studies were included with attesting a total of 798 participants. The result obtained indicated a significant improvement that favored the BAT + M group over the M group in CAT scores (MD: ?4.77; 95% CI: ?6.53 to ?3.01; p < 0.00001). Conclusions: BAT is an effective adjunctive non-pharmacological treatment to improve HRQL in patients under medical treatment for COPD. We suggested that BAT should be considered as one of the methods of management in patients with COPD. ? 2019","acupuncture; chronic obstructive lung disease; human; meta analysis; procedures; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment outcome; Acupuncture Therapy; Humans; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome"
"Smart restored by learning exercise alleviates the deterioration of cognitive function in older adults with dementia—A Quasi-experimental research",2019,"Maintaining cognitive function is essential for older adults with dementia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Smart Restored by Learning Exercise (SRLE) on cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and frontal lobe functions in elderly people with dementia. A total of 68 older adults with dementia participated in this study. A quasi-experimental design was used, and convenience sampling and assignment approaches were adopted to select the participants for experimental and control groups. The experimental group engaged in SRLE for 6 months. The control group received routine care without SRLE.

"Use of electronic portal images to evaluate setup error and intra-fraction motion during free-breathing breast IMRT treatment",2019,"Before delivering of intensity-modulated radiotherapy, kilo-voltage image-guidance radiotherapy is widely used in setup error correction and monitoring intra-fraction motion effectively. Accordingly, this study proposes and tests an image integration technique for observing intra-fraction motion during beam delivery, with the wider objective of reducing both image-guidance time and the dose delivered to normal breast tissue. The study sample comprised 33 female patients with breast cancer, and 241 sets of portal images acquired using a VARIAN aSi-1000 electronic portal imaging device. Motion amplitudes and vectors were collected and calculated separately by two senior therapists. The setup error in 3 axes was computed for every fraction, with average shifting for lateral, longitudinal and vertical direction was ?0.3-mm ± 0.5, ?0.1-mm ± 0.5 and ?0.6-mm ± 1.6, with the average vector of setup error being 2.9-mm ± 1.4. The average intra-fraction motion for vertical direction was (A: ?0.1-mm ± 1.0; B: ?0.0 ± 1.1), for longitudinal was (A: ?0.4-mm ± 1.7; B: 2.0 ± 1.1), and for lateral direction was (A: 0.3-mm ± 1.3; B: 0.2 ± 1.8).

"Effects of esophageal acid infusion vs mosapride on distension-induced secondary peristalsis in humans",2019,"Secondary peristalsis contributes to the clearance of the refluxate from the esophagus. Acute administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 (5-HT4) receptors agonist, mosapride or esophageal infusion of hydrochloric acid (HCl) facilitates secondary peristalsis. The aim of this study was to determine whether esophageal acid infusion and administration of mosapride had different effects on secondary peristalsis. Secondary peristalsis was performed with esophageal distension with rapid and slow air injections in 16 healthy subjects. We performed two separate sessions with HCl (0.1 N) and 40 mg oral mosapride to compare their influence on secondary peristaltic parameters. The threshold volume of secondary peristalsis was significantly lower with HCl infusion than mosapride (P = 0.01) by slow air injections. The threshold volume to generate secondary peristalsis was significantly lower with HCl infusion than mosapride (P = 0.002) by rapid air injections. More secondary peristalsis was trigged by rapid air injections after HCl infusion than mosapride (P = 0.003). Infusion of HCl or mosapride administration has similar effects on peristaltic wave amplitude and duration of primary and secondary peristalsis. Acute esophageal acid infusion can induce greater mechanosensitivity to distension-induced secondary peristalsis than 5-HT4 receptors agonist mosapride. The data suggest that acid-sensitive afferents are more likely to contribute to sensory modulation of esophageal secondary peristalsis; however, the motility aspects of secondary peristalsis are comparable between acute esophageal acidification and 5-HT4 receptors activation via mosapride. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Association between tamoxifen use and acute myocardial infarction in women with breast cancer",2019,"The relationship between tamoxifen use and acute myocardial infarction in women with breast cancer remains uncertain. The goal of the study was to assess whether tamoxifen use could be associated with acute myocardial infarction in women with breast cancer in Taiwan.A population-based case-control study was conducted to analyze the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. Totally, 489 women with breast cancer aged 20 to 84 years having the first episode of acute myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2011 were found as the cases. In addition, 1718 women with breast cancer aged 20 to 84 years without any type of ischemic heart disease were selected as the matched controls. Ever use of tamoxifen was classified as the studied women who had at least a prescription for tamoxifen before the index date. Never use of tamoxifen was classified as the studied women who never had a prescription for tamoxifen before the index date. We used the multivariable logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for acute myocardial infarction associated with tamoxifen use.In a multivariable-adjusted analysis, women with acute myocardial infarction were 1.71 times more likely to be exposed to tamoxifen than those women without acute myocardial infarction (adjusted OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38-2.13).The odds of tamoxifen use are 1.71 times higher in women with acute myocardial infarction versus those women without acute myocardial infarction in Taiwan.","antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; tamoxifen; adult; aged; breast tumor; case control study; chemically induced; comorbidity; epidemiology; female; heart infarction; human; middle aged; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Taiwan; Tamoxifen"
"Single-injecting, bioinspired nanocomposite hydrogel that can recruit host immune cells in situ to elicit potent and long-lasting humoral immune responses",2019,"Vaccination is an effective medical intervention for preventing disease. However, without an adjuvant, most subunit vaccines are poorly immunogenic. This work develops a bioinspired nanocomposite hyaluronic acid hydrogel system that incorporates N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (TMC/NPs) that carry a model subunit vaccine ovalbumin (OVA) that can elicit a potent and prolonged antigen-specific humoral response. Experimental results indicate that the nanocomposite hydrogel system (NPs-Gel) can retain a large proportion of its TMC/NPs that are bonded by covalent/electrostatic interactions and extend the release of the encapsulated OVA, enabling their localization at the site of hydrogel injection. The positively charged TMC/NPs can be effectively internalized by dendritic cells, significantly augmenting their maturation, suggesting that TMC can function as an adjuvant-based OVA delivery system. Upon subcutaneous implantation in mice, the NPs-Gel acts as an in situ depot that recruits and concentrates immune cells. The TMC/NPs that do not have any specific interactions with the hydrogel network are released rapidly and internalized by the neighboring immune cells, providing a priming dose, while those retained inside the NPs-Gel are ingested by the recruited and concentrated immune cells over time, acting as a booster dose, eliciting high titers of OVA-specific antibody responses. These experimental results suggest particulate vaccines that are integrated in such a bioinspired hydrogel system may be used as single-injection prime-boost vaccines, enabling effective and persistent humoral immune responses. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cells; Cytology; Hyaluronic acid; Hydrogels; Mammals; Nanocomposites; Vaccines; Adjuvant; Catechol; Humoral immune response; Hyaluronic acid hydrogels; N-trimethyl chitosans; Nanocomposite hydrogels; Specific interaction; Vaccine delivery; Immune system; chitosan nanoparticle; hyaluronic acid; nanocomposite; ovalbumin; animal cell; animal experiment; antibody response; antibody titer; antigen specificity; Article; cell maturation; covalent bond; dendritic cell; drug delivery system; drug release; experimental study; host cell; humoral immunity; hydrogel; immunocompetent cell; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; static electricity"
"Cisplatin resistant lung cancer cells promoted M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages via the Src/CD155/MIF functional pathway",2019,"Background: Lung cancer often ranks one of the most prevalent malignancies in the world. One of the most challenging aspects of treating late-stage lung cancer patients is the development of drug resistance, from both conventional chemo- and targeted therapeutic agents. Tumor-associated microphages (TAMs) have been shown to promote the survival and distant metastasis of lung cancer cells. Methods: This study investigated the TAMs - modulating potential of cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, A549R and H460R by using bioinformatics approach, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining, migration, invasion, colony, lung sphere formation and xenograft tumorigenecity assays. Results: In this study, we first demonstrated the elevated expression of oncogenic and stemenss markers such as Src, Notch1, macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) and CD155 in trained cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant A549 and H460 cells (A549R and H460R cells). When co-cultured with TAMs, A549R and H460R cells promoted the M2-polarization in TAMs. In addition, A549R and H460R cells showed an increased self-renewal ability as they formed tumor spheres at higher frequency comparing to their parental counterparts. The increased MIF secretion by the A549R and H460R cells could be suppressed by a multiple kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, which resulted in the decreased of oncogenic network of Src, CD155 and MIF expression. Similarly, dasatinib treatment reduced the M2 polarization in TAMs and suppressed self-renewal ability of the A549R and H460R cells. Conclusion: In summary, cisplatin resistant lung cancer cells not only showed an increased self-renewal ability but also promoted M2 polarization of TAMs via the secretion of MIF. These findings were linked to the increased Src-associated signaling as dasatinib treatment significantly reversed these phenomena. Thus, kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib may be of potential for treating cisplatin-resistant lung cancer by targeting both tumor and the tumor microenvironment. ? 2019 The Author(s).","beta catenin; CD155 protein; cisplatin; cytokine; dasatinib; macrophage migration inhibition factor; Notch1 receptor; protein tyrosine kinase; unclassified drug; cisplatin; dasatinib; isomerase; macrophage migration inhibition factor; MIF protein, human; poliovirus receptor; protein tyrosine kinase; virus receptor; A549-R cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cancer inhibition; carcinogenicity; cell invasion; cell migration; cell self-renewal; cisplatin-resistant cell line; coculture; colony formation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytokine release; drug potentiation; enzyme inhibition; gene silencing; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence; lung non-small cell carcinoma cell line; major clinical study; male; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; polarization; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor spheroid; tumor xenograft; A-549 cell line; animal; carcinogenesis; drug effect; drug resistance; drug screening; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; pathology; signal transduction; tumor microenvironment; A549 Cells; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Cisplatin; Dasatinib; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Intramolecular Oxidoreductases; Lung Neoplasms; Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors; Mice; Receptors, Virus; Signal Transduction; src-Family Kinases; Tumor Microenvironment; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"

"Characteristics of patients with endometrial hyperplasia under different air quality index conditions",2019,"Objective: Air pollution has been widely recognized to pose a threat to health. Urban outdoor air pollution was listed as the 14th biggest risk factor for global deaths in 2004 in the Global Health Risks report published by the World Health Organization in 2009. Many past studies have indicated that exposure to environmental contaminants promotes changes in the internal mechanisms of diseases, including the infection of various systems in the body, hormonal changes, and vascular proliferation. These changes may be related to the severity of endometrial hyperplasia. Therefore, this study used the air quality monitoring data of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to examine the effects of air pollutant concentration on patients with endometrial hyperplasia. Materials and methods: This population-based nationwide study used data for 2002–2013 from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients who developed endometrial hyperplasia before 2002 were excluded. In total, 14,883 patients with endometrial hyperplasia were tracked. The exposure levels and air quality index (AQI) values in this study were based on the taiwan air quality monitoring network data collected by the EPA from 2000 to 2013. The data were further divided into the good air quality group (AQI ? 50) and poor air quality group (AQI > 50). The study used linear regression model to estimate the correlation linking air pollutant concentration with endometrial hyperplasia. Results: The results indicated that, in comparison to endometrial hyperplasia patients who were exposed to air with good quality, those exposed to air with poor quality had a higher average age (p < 0.001) and higher proportion of living in southern Taiwan (p < 0.001), as well as higher rates of diabetes (p < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (p < 0.001), hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases (p = 0.024), cerebral vascular accidents (p = 0.024), and chronic kidney disease (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The patients with endometrial hyperplasia in poor AQI area had severe comorbidity. Thus, attention must be paid to the improvement of air quality and the implementation of preventive measures against contaminants. ? 2019","adult; aged; air pollutant; air quality; air quality control; air quality index; Article; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic kidney failure; chronic lung disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; concentration (parameter); congestive heart failure; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; endometrium hyperplasia; environmental exposure; exploratory research; female; heart infarction; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; peripheral vascular disease; population research; solid malignant neoplasm; Taiwan; trend study; air pollution; analysis; endometrium hyperplasia; environmental monitoring; health survey; retrospective study; severity of illness index; young adult; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Comorbidity; Endometrial Hyperplasia; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Real-world database examining the association between avascular necrosis of the femoral head and diabetes in Taiwan",2019,"OBJECTIVE No study has been conducted to evaluate the association between avascular necrosis of the femoral head and diabetes. This study’s aim was to assess this issue in Taiwan. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A population-based cohort study was performed to analyze the database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Program. There were 27,869 subjects aged 20–84 years with newly diagnosed diabetes from 2000 to 2012 as the group with diabetes. The group without diabetes included 111,476 sex- and age-matched subjects without diabetes. The incidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head at the end of 2013 was measured. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to measure the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI for avascular necrosis of the femoral head associated with diabetes. RESULTS The overall incidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head was 1.37-fold higher in the group with diabetes than in the group without diabetes (6.53 vs. 4.76 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 1.31–1.43]). After adjusting for confounders, the HR of avascular necrosis of the femoral head was 1.16 (95% CI 1.11–1.21) for the subjects with diabetes compared with the subjects without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Patients with diabetes have a 1.16-fold increased risk for developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head. ? 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.","adult; aged; Article; avascular necrosis; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease course; female; femoral head; groups by age; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; risk factor; sex ratio; Taiwan; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; factual database; femur head necrosis; middle aged; proportional hazards model; public health; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Femur Head Necrosis; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Young Adult"
"Assessment of esophageal function using provocative tests during high resolution manometry: A single-center experience",2019,"Background: Provocative tests were used to provide additional information during performing high resolution manometry (HRM). The study aimed to evaluate whether it is feasible to test esophageal function with different esophageal provocative tests during HRM. Methods: 23 healthy volunteers (9 women; mean age 25 years, range 21–30 years) underwent water-perfused HRM. Each subject received 10 liquid swallows, 10 solid swallows, 10 liquid swallows with abdominal compression, and 5 multiple rapid swallowing (MRS). Results: DCI was significantly greater during abdominal compression than that of solid swallows (p = 0.025). Compared with liquid swallows, there was a significant decrease in CFV during solid swallows (p = 0.04). DL was significantly greater during solid swallows than that of liquid swallows (p < 0.001) or abdominal compression (p < 0.001). IRP 4s was significantly lower during abdominal compression than that of liquids (p < 0.001) or solid swallows (p = 0.006). All subjects had complete inhibition during MRS and increased DCI after MRS as compared with liquid swallows (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Esophageal provocative test may provide additional utility in performing HRM studies. The data for esophageal provocative tests are distinct from standard liquid swallows. ? 2018","water; adult; Article; clinical assessment; compression; contractile front velocity; controlled study; digestive function; distal contractile latency; esophagus function; esophagus manometry; esophagus motility; feasibility study; female; high resolution manometry; human; human experiment; integrated relaxation pressure; intermethod comparison; latent period; liquid; male; multiple rapid swallowing; muscle contractility; muscle relaxation; normal human; perfusion; provocation test; solid; standard; swallowing; velocity; esophagus; manometry; physiology; pressure; young adult; Adult; Deglutition; Esophagus; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Manometry; Pressure; Young Adult"
"A rare case of cefepime-induced cholestatic liver injury",2019,"Cefepime is widely used in the hospital setting, and only a few studies have reported neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity as side effects of this drug. Herein, we present a 93-year-old man who exhibited features of cholestatic hepatitis including elevated blood transaminases and direct-form predominant bilirubin levels after administration of cefepime. Blood liver tests showed total recovery after discontinuing the offending agent. Cefepime was probable to cause drug-induced cholestatic hepatitis in our patient since the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method score for cefepime was 7. No drug interactions were likely according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale for this patient. No similar cases of cholestatic drug-induced liver injury related to cefepime have been reported previously. Hence, this rare condition requires a high degree of clinical suspicion for prompt diagnosis and treatment. ? 2019 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","alkaline phosphatase; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; C reactive protein; candesartan hexetil; cefepime; ceftazidime; cefuroxime; ciprofloxacin; colistin; cyanocobalamin; fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol xinafoate; folic acid; furosemide; gamma glutamyltransferase; hemoglobin; ipratropium bromide; iron; lactate dehydrogenase; teicoplanin; terbutaline sulfate; aged; alkaline phosphatase blood level; anemia; appetite; arterial gas; Article; artificial ventilation; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bone marrow biopsy; case report; cholestatic hepatitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; coughing; dizziness; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; erythrocyte transfusion; fatigue; heart failure; human; human tissue; hyperbilirubinemia; hypertransaminasemia; hypoxemia; iron binding capacity; jaundice; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; male; oxygen saturation; pneumonia; Pseudomonas pneumonia; respiratory acidosis; respiratory distress; respiratory failure; reticulocyte; sinus tachycardia; toxic hepatitis; tracheobronchial toilet; ventilator associated pneumonia; very elderly; wheezing"
"Phase-Changeable Nanoemulsions for Oral Delivery of a Therapeutic Peptide: Toward Targeting the Pancreas for Antidiabetic Treatments Using Lymphatic Transport",2019,"The oral absorption of a therapeutic peptide (such as exenatide; EXT) that can improve glycemic control in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is limited by multiple barriers of the intestinal epithelium. This work presents an oil-structured nanoemulsion system that consists of a phase-changeable fatty acid that allows EXT (EXT@PC/NEMs) to be delivered orally and absorbed efficiently in the small intestine. To construct an appropriate vehicle to encapsulate EXT, an oil-in-water single emulsion is generated at 37 °C, which is well above the melting point of the fatty acid but below the denaturation temperature of the peptide drug. The as-prepared EXT@PC/NEMs are physically stable when stored at 4 °C, as they form a solid core, which prevents drug leakage. Upon their oral delivery at body temperature, the deformable liquid EXT@PC/NEMs may undergo effective cellular uptake, enhancing their permeability across the intestinal epithelium. The orally administered PC/NEMs significantly improve the bioavailability of EXT via intestinal lymphatic transport, ultimately accumulating in the pancreas, suggesting the possibility of orally delivering labile peptide drugs. The delivered EXT may act on pancreatic β- and α-cells to stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion, respectively, reducing the blood glucose level, eventually having antidiabetic effects. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The aim of this study is to confirm the ethnicity of C?15:29 and to deduce a probable HLA haplotype in association with C?15:29 in Taiwanese population. Materials and Methods: A total of 12,534 healthy unrelated Taiwanese individuals were tested for HLA using a sequence-based typing method. The DNA material was subjected to HLA genotyping for the HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1 loci using a commercial polymerase chain reaction-sequencing-based typing kit as per the manufacturer's protocols. Results: The DNA sequence of C?15:29 is identical to C?15:02:01:01 in exons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 except for residues 420 and 1034 where A and G of C?15:02:01:01 are substituted by C and A in C?15:29, respectively. The nucleotide substitutions introduce two amino acid replacements at residues 116 and 321 where leucine (L) and cysteine (C) of C?15:02:01:01 are replaced by phenylalanine (F) and tyrosine (Y) in C?15:29, respectively. A probable HLA haplotype associated with C?15:29 in Taiwanese was deduced as A?29:01-B?07:05-C?15:29-DRB1?10:01-DQB1?05:01. The frequency of C?15:29 is estimated at about 0.064%. Conclusion: Information on the ethnicity and distribution of C?15:29 and its deduced probable HLA haplotype is of value for HLA testing laboratories for reference purposes and can help bone marrow donor registries find compatible donors for patients with this uncommon HLA allele. ? 2019 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","cysteine; HLA A antigen; HLA B antigen; HLA C antigen; HLA DQB1 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; leucine; nucleotide; phenylalanine; tyrosine; allele; amino acid substitution; Article; DNA sequence; ethnicity; exon; genotype; haplotype; human; normal human; polymerase chain reaction; Taiwanese"
"Resilience and coping styles as predictors of health outcomes in breast cancer patients: A structural equation modelling analysis",2020,"Introduction: Resilience has been associated with psychological adaptation to many threatening life events, but previous studies have rarely analysed the integrated relationships among demographic and disease characteristics and various health outcomes in Taiwan. This study examined the associations among demographic factors, disease characteristics, resilience, coping styles and adverse health outcomes, including anxiety and depressive symptoms and sleep disorders. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study design was used. Data from a convenience sample of 175 patients with breast cancer aged 20?years or older were collected using a self-reported questionnaire. A structural equation modelling approach was applied to examine the relationships among the variables. Results: The results showed that greater resilience was related to fewer depressive symptoms, lower anxiety levels and better sleep quality. All three coping styles, including active coping, minimising the situation and avoidance coping, were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms, but only active coping was significantly correlated with sleep quality. Resilience had a direct effect on depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep disorders. Furthermore, a mediating effect of resilience was observed on the relationship between marital satisfaction and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Resilience can strengthen breast cancer-related adaptation. Additionally, breast cancer survivors who used mainly the active and minimising coping styles tended to experience fewer depressive symptoms. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Tamoxifen use correlates with increased risk of hip fractures in older women with breast cancer: A case–control study in Taiwan",2019,"Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the association between tamoxifen use and hip fractures in older women with breast cancer in Taiwan. Methods: We carried out a retrospective nationwide case–control study using the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. A total of 762 female patients with breast cancer aged ?65 years newly diagnosed with hip fractures from 2000 to 2011 were identified for inclusion in the study. Additionally, 7620 female patients with breast cancer aged ?65 years without hip fractures were randomly selected as controls. Patients were defined as having used tamoxifen if they had an existing prescription for tamoxifen before the index date. Patients were defined as having never used tamoxifen if they had never been given a prescription for tamoxifen before the index date. We used an unconditional logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the association between tamoxifen use and risk of hip fractures. Results: After adjustment for confounding variables, compared with patients who did not use tamoxifen, the adjusted odds ratio of hip fracture was 2.29 for those who had used tamoxifen (95% confidence interval 1.92, 2.72). Furthermore, adjusted odds ratios were 2.74 (95% confidence interval 2.19, 3.42) among patients with a cumulative duration of tamoxifen use of >3 years. Conclusion: Tamoxifen use is associated with increased risk of hip fractures among older women with breast cancer in Taiwan.

"Thrombolysis for atlantoaxial dislocation mimicking acute ischemic stroke",2019,"The frequency of stroke mimics among stroke patients has been reported to be up to 30%, and that in patients who receive thrombolytic therapy ranges between 1% and 16%. Atlantoaxial dislocation with myelopathy mimicking stroke is extremely rare. An 83-year-old man with a history of old cerebellar infarction presented to the emergency department with acute left hemiplegia after a chiropractic manipulation of the neck and back several hours before symptom onset. Mild hypoesthesia was observed on his left limbs. No speech disturbance, facial palsy, or neck or shoulder pain was observed. Intravenous thrombolytic treatment was given 238 min after symptom onset. Brown–Sequard syndrome subsequently developed 6 h after thrombolysis with a hypoesthetic sensory level below the right C5 dermatome. An emergent brain magnetic resonance angiography did not reveal an acute cerebral infarct but rather an atlantoaxial dislocation causing upper cervical spinal cord compression. Clinical symptoms did not deteriorate after thrombolysis. He received successful decompressive surgery 1 week later, and his muscle power gradually improved, with partial dependency when performing daily living activities 2 months later. A literature review revealed that only 15 patients (including the patient mentioned here) with spinal disorder mimicking acute stroke who received thrombolytic therapy have been reported. Atlantoaxial dislocation may present as acute hemiplegia mimicking acute stroke, followed by Brown–Sequard syndrome. Inadvertent thrombolytic therapy is likely not harmful for patients with atlantoaxial dislocation-induced cervical myelopathy. The neurological deficits of patients should be carefully and continuously evaluated to differentiate between stroke and myelopathy. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","methylprednisolone; tissue plasminogen activator; fibrinolytic agent; aged; Article; atlantoaxial dislocation; blood clot lysis; body density; bone swelling; brain ischemia; Brown Sequard syndrome; cardiovascular risk; case report; cerebellum infarction; chiropractic; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; decompression surgery; fibrinolytic therapy; follow up; hemiplegia; human; hypesthesia; inflammation; limb weakness; male; medical history; muscle strength; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neurologic examination; priority journal; sensory dysfunction; spinal cord compression; treatment duration; very elderly; brain; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; cervical vertebra; complication; diagnostic error; diagnostic imaging; joint dislocation; magnetic resonance angiography; neck injury; spinal cord disease; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Brain Ischemia; Cervical Vertebrae; Decompression, Surgical; Diagnostic Errors; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Joint Dislocations; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Neck Injuries; Spinal Cord Diseases; Stroke"

"Serum osteoprotegerin is an independent marker of central arterial stiffness as assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in hemodialysis patients: A cross sectional study",2019,"Background: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into tertiles. Results: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p < 0.001) levels and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009). Conclusion: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening. ? 2019 The Author(s).","calcium; osteoprotegerin; parathyroid hormone; adult; arterial stiffness; Article; blood sampling; body height; calcium blood level; correlational study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; gender; hemodialysis patient; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; parathyroid hormone blood level; prevalence; protein blood level; pulse wave; systolic blood pressure; tonometry; trend study; validation process"
"Long-term exposure to oroxylin a inhibits metastasis by suppressing CCL2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells",2019,"Oroxylin A (Oro-A), the main bioactive flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria radix, has been reported to inhibit migration in various human cancer cell models. In this study, we further explored the anti-migration effects of Oro-A on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms. A 24-h (short-term) exposure of OSCC cells to non-cytotoxic concentrations (5-20 μM) of Oro-A significantly suppressed cell migration according to a wound-healing assay. Furthermore, a 30-day exposure (long-term) to Oro-A (20 μM), which did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect on OSCC cells, significantly suppressed cell migration more than short-term Oro-A exposure. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of long-term Oro-A exposure on OSCC migration, a cDNA microarray and the Ingenuity software were used. Overall, 112 upregulated and 356 downregulated genes were identified in long-term Oro-A-exposed cells compared with untreated OSCC cells. Among them, 75 genes were reported to be associated with cancer cell migration. Consistent with the cDNA microarray results, we found that the expression levels of several cell migration-related genes, such as LCN2, ID-1, MDK, S100A9 and CCL2, were significantly decreased in long-term Oro-A-exposed OSCC cells using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) assay. The Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results also demonstrated that CCL2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was significantly decreased in long-term Oro-A-exposed OSCC cells compared with untreated OSCC cells. Moreover, the expression levels of downstream CCL2 targets, including p-ERK1/2, NFkB, MMP2, and MMP9, were also decreased in long-term Oro-A-exposed OSCC cells. Further, Oro-A treatment suppressed in vivo metastasis. These results suggest that long-term Oro-A treatment inhibits metastasis via CCL2 signaling in OSCC cells. ? 2019 by the authors.","gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; oroxylin A; animal experiment; animal model; Article; CCL2 gene; cell migration; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA microarray; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme phosphorylation; gene; gene control; gene expression; human; human cell; ID 1 gene; in vivo study; LCN2 gene; long term exposure; MDK gene; metastasis inhibition; mouse; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; S100A9 gene; signal transduction; upregulation; Western blotting; wound healing assay"
"Bilateral erector spinae plane blocks using a small volume of local anesthetic for acute pain control after single-port laparoscopic surgery",2019,"In the era of enhanced recovery after surgery, clinicians are encouraged to develop optimized programs for patients who require surgery. Minimal intervention with laparoscopic surgery and multimodal pain management mostly with peripheral nerve block are key components. We are developing a departmental program for enhanced recovery after surgery for single-port laparoscopic surgery. We applied an erector spinae plane block, a novel, newly recognized block, bilaterally at the T10 transverse process with a small dose (10 mL) of local anesthetic. This method was effective and safe and resulted in successful analgesia in a patient who received single-port surgery. This surgery requires a 3-5 cm horizontal or longitudinal periumbilical incision, which was performed in this case, and our results were promising and encouraging. ? 2019 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","bupivacaine; dexamethasone; epinephrine; fentanyl; local anesthetic agent; morphine; ondansetron; paracetamol; propofol; rocuronium; ropivacaine; adult; Article; case report; clinical article; dermatome; drug efficacy; drug safety; erector spinae muscle; extubation; female; general anesthesia; hepatitis B; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; local anesthesia; nerve block; postoperative analgesia; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain; recovery room; single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy; surgical wound; transverse process; visual analog scale"
"Effects of far-infrared ray on temozolomide-treated glioma in rats",2019,"Background/Aim: Malignant glioma is a rapidly progressive primary brain cancer. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of far-infrared ray (FIR) on temozolomide (TMZ)-treated glioma in rats. Materials and Methods: Male, 8-week old, Fischer 344 inbred rats with glioma were randomly divided into three study groups (20 rats in each group). The control group received saline only once daily for 5 days. The TMZ group received TMZ (30 mg/kg) once daily for 5 days. The TMZ plus FIR group received TMZ (30 mg/kg) once daily for 5 days and infrared-c irradiation of 40 min twice daily for 4 weeks. The relative tumor fold and the expression of hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were compared using one-way ANOVA at the end of study. Results: The relative tumor fold of the TMZ+FIR group was significantly higher compared to the control group, and was borderline higher compared to the TMZ group at Day 7. The relative tumor fold of TMZ+FIR group was significantly higher compared to the control group and the TMZ group at Days 14, 21 and 28. HIF-1α expression of TMZ+FIR group was borderline higher compared to the control group at Day 28. The VEGF expression of TMZ+FIR group was significantly higher compared to the control group and the TMZ group at Day 28.

"Luteolin: A natural flavonoid enhances the survival of HUVECs against oxidative stress by modulating AMPK/PKC pathway",2019,"Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Dietary supplementation of anti-oxidants has been reported to have beneficial effects on the prevention of atherogenic diseases. Luteolin (a natural flavonoid) has been shown to possess antimutagenic, antitumorigenic, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of luteolin on cardiovascular systems are poorly explored. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test whether luteolin could protect against oxidative stress-induced endothelial cell injury and explore the underlying mechanisms. In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pre-treated with luteolin followed by hydrogen peroxide induction (H2O2). Our results showed that luteolin protected against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and ameliorated ROS and superoxide generation. In addition, we found that luteolin treatment inhibited the H2O2-induced membrane assembly of NADPH oxidase subunits, which was further confirmed by specifically inhibiting NADPH oxidase using DPI treatment. Furthermore, pAMPK protein expression was enhanced and p-PKC isoforms were significantly down-regulated by luteolin treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and a similar effect was observed upon DPI treatment. However, co-treatment with the specific inhibitor of AMPK (Compound C) restored p-PKC levels suggesting the role of AMPK signaling in regulating p-PKC expression under oxidative stress condition in HUVECs. Finally, we confirmed using siRNAs and specific inhibitor and/or activator of AMPK (AICAR) that luteolin treatment induced AMPK is a key player and regulator of activated expression of PKC isoforms and thereby confers protection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HUVECs. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine","flavonoid; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; luteolin; cell culture; cell survival; drug effect; human; MAPK signaling; metabolism; oxidative stress; umbilical vein endothelial cell; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Flavonoids; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Luteolin; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Oxidative Stress"
"Poorer sleep quality among adult patients with pectus excavatum in Taiwan: A pilot study",2019,"Objectives: Patients with pectus excavatum have a poorer quality of life than the general population. Sleep quality is a critical component of quality of life. This pilot study compared the sleep quality of adult patients with pectus excavatum with that of the general population in Taiwan. Methods: Participants comprised 30 healthy adults, 21 adult outpatients with pectus excavatum, and 33 adults with pectus excavatum receiving Nuss surgery. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index measured subjective sleep quality; the Visual Analog Scale for Pain, Brief Symptom Rating Scale-5, Beck Depression Inventory II, and 36-Item Short Form Survey measured quality of life; and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale measured excessive daytime sleepiness. Outcome measurements were obtained at baseline for all groups and 6 months after Nuss surgery for inpatients. Results: Patients with pectus excavatum had poorer sleep quality and worse quality of life than controls. Poorer sleep quality was not related to the severity of pectus excavatum per se, but to psychologic issues (beta = 0.18, P <.001 in multiple linear regression analysis). Measurement time had no effect on sleep quality (beta = 0.31, P =.594 for outpatient group; beta = 0.27, P =.665 for inpatients). Sleep quality of patients with pectus excavatum improved after Nuss surgery (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: 4 vs 7, P =.002). Conclusions: Our findings suggested an association between poor sleep quality and pectus excavatum; thus, sleep quality should be evaluated before and after the Nuss procedure. ? 2018 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery","adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; Brief Symptom Inventory; controlled study; daytime somnolence; disease severity; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; funnel chest; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; Nuss surgery; outcome assessment; outpatient; pilot study; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; priority journal; quality of life; Short Form 36; sleep quality; Taiwan; thorax surgery; visual analog scale; age; case control study; complication; funnel chest; orthopedic surgery; pathophysiology; risk factor; sleep; sleep disorder; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Case-Control Studies; Female; Funnel Chest; Humans; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Association between the first occurrence of allergic conjunctivitis, air pollution and weather changes in Taiwan",2019,"Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is one of the common allergic diseases, which may be influenced by environmental factors. This study was to examine the association between the first occurrence of AC, air pollution and weather changes, and demographic factors in Taiwan. A total of 100,636 eligible subjects were identified from the systematic sampling cohort database containing 1,000,000 insureds of the National Health Insurance of Taiwan from 2004 to 2013, and were matched with data from the environmental monitoring stations adjacent to their locations of clinics. The case-crossover design, using the same subjects experiencing exposures at the time of diagnosis for cases and that on the days one and two weeks before and after diagnosis for controls, was applied in the study. We found that the first occurrences of AC were significantly the most for youngsters by age (42.6%), for women by sex (56.2%), and in spring by season (29.6%) (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses indicated that nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and temperature were positively associated with AC (P &lt; 0.001), while relative humidity was negatively related to AC (P &lt; 0.001). Knowing these associations, we suggest that AC patients pay attention to air pollution and weather change in the ambient environments and manage accordingly to mitigate the problems. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric humidity; Diagnosis; Health insurance; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Patient monitoring; Regression analysis; Temperature; Allergic conjunctivitis; Case-crossover designs; Conditional logistic regressions; Demographic factors; Environmental factors; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen dioxides; Systematic sampling; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; allergy; atmospheric pollution; climate change; demography; environmental monitoring; eye disease; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; relative humidity; temperature effect; adult; air pollution; air quality; allergic conjunctivitis; Article; clinical practice; cohort analysis; crossover procedure; disease association; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; female; human; ICD-9-CM; major clinical study; male; national health insurance; particulate matter; perennial allergic conjunctivitis; physical examination; priority journal; spring; Taiwan; weather; Taiwan"
"Acute rhinosinusitis among pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis: A nationwide, population-based cohort study",2019,"Background: While chronic rhinosinusitis is a common complication of allergic rhinitis, the link between acute rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of incident acute rhinosinusitis among pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis, using a nationwide, population-based health claims research database. Methods: Newly diagnosed allergic rhinitis patients aged 5-18 years were identified from the health claim records of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A comparison cohort was assembled by randomly selecting patients from the same database with frequency matching by sex, age group, and index year. All patients were followed until a diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis or the end of the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between allergic rhinitis and acute rhinosinusitis. Results: Of the 43,588 pediatric patients included in this study, 55.4% were male and 43.9% were between the ages of 5.0-7.9 years. The risk of acute rhinosinusitis was significantly higher in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis compared to those without the condition (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.03, 95% confidence interval = 2.89-3.18). Similar hazard ratios were observed between male and female pediatric patients. Conclusions: This secondary cohort study using a nationwide, population-based health claim data of the Taiwan's NHIRD showed that allergic rhinitis was significantly associated with a higher risk of acute rhinosinusitis among pediatric patients. ? 2019 Lin et al.

"Comparing stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) versus re-trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (re-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma patients who had incomplete response after initial TACE (TASABR): A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 75-85% of primary liver cancers and is prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region. Till now, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is still one of common modalities in managing unresectable intermediate-stage HCC. However, post-TACE residual viable HCC is not uncommon, resulting in unsatisfied overall survival after TACE alone. Recently, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been suggested to manage HCC curatively. However, evidence from phase-III trials is largely lacking. Hence, the present phase III randomized trial is designed to compare clinical outcomes between SABR and re-TACE for unresectable HCC patients who had incomplete response after initial TACE. Methods: The present study is an open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial. A total of 120 patients will be included into two study groups, i.e., SABR and re-TACE, with a 1:1 allocation rate. A 3-year allocating period is planned. Patients with incomplete response after initial TACE will be enrolled and randomized. The primary endpoint is 1-year freedom-form-local-progression rate. Secondary endpoints are disease-progression-free survival, overall survival, local control, response rate, toxicity, and duration of response of the treated tumor. Discussion: SABR has been reported as an effective modality in managing intermediate-stage HCC patients, but evidence from phase-III randomized trials is largely lacking. As a result, conducting randomized trials to demarcate the role of SABR in these patients is warranted, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where HBV- and HCV-related HCCs are prevalent. Trial registration: Before enrolling participants, the present study was registered prospectively on ClinicalTrials.gov (trial identifier, NCT02921139) on Sep. 29, 2016.

"Targeting Telomerase and ATRX/DAXX Inducing Tumor Senescence and Apoptosis in the Malignant Glioma",2019,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a type of brain tumor that is notorious for its aggressiveness and invasiveness, and the complete removal of GBM is still not possible, even with advanced diagnostic strategies and extensive therapeutic plans. Its dismal prognosis and short survival time after diagnosis make it a crucial public health issue. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying GBM may inspire novel and effective treatments against this type of cancer. At a molecular level, almost all tumor cells exhibit telomerase activity (TA), which is a major means by which they achieve immortalization. Further studies show that promoter mutations are associated with increased TA and stable telomere length. Moreover, some tumors and immortalized cells maintain their telomeres with a telomerase-independent mechanism termed the ""alternative lengthening of telomeres"" (ALT), which relates to the mutations of the α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX), the death-domain associated protein (DAXX) and H3.3. By means of the mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter and ATRX/DAXX, cancers can immortalize and escape cell senescence and apoptosis. In this article, we review the evidence for triggering GBM cell death by targeting telomerase and the ALT pathway, with an extra focus on a plant-derived compound, butylidene phthalide (BP), which may be a promising novel anticancer compound with good potential for clinical applications.","signal transducing adaptor protein; telomerase; transcriptional regulator ATRX; animal; apoptosis; brain tumor; cell aging; glioma; human; metabolism; pathology; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Apoptosis; Brain Neoplasms; Cellular Senescence; Glioma; Humans; Telomerase; X-linked Nuclear Protein"
"IGF-axis confers transformation and regeneration of fallopian tube fimbria epithelium upon ovulation",2019,"Background: The fallopian tube fimbria is regarded as the main tissue of origin and incessant ovulation as the main risk factor of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. Previously, we discovered the tumorigenesis activity of human ovulatory follicular fluid (FF) upon injection to the mammary fat pad of Trp53-null mice. We also found a mutagenesis activity of FF-ROS and a apoptosis-rescuing activity of Hb from retrograde menstruation. However, neither of them can explain the tumorigenesis activities of FF. Methods: From two cohorts of ovulatory FF retrieved from IVF patients, the main growth factor responsible for the transformation of human fimbrial epithelial cells was identified. Mechanism of activation, ways of signal transduction of the growth factor, as well as the cellular and genetic phenotypes of the malignant transformation was characterized. Findings: In this study, we showed that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-axis proteins, including IGFBP-bound IGF2 as well as the IGFBP-lytic enzyme PAPP-A, are abundantly present in FF. Upon engaging with glycosaminoglycans on the membrane of fimbrial epithelial cells, PAPP-A cleaves IGFBPs and releases IGF2 to bind with IGF-1R. Through the IGF-1R/AKT/mTOR and IGF-1R/AKT/NANOG pathways, FF-IGF leads to stemness and survival, and in the case of TP53/Rb or TP53/CCNE1 loss, to clonal expansion and malignant transformation of fimbrial epithelial cells. By depleting each IGF axis component from FF, we proved that IGF2, IGFBP2/6, and PAPP-A are all essential and confer the majority of the transformation and regeneration activities. Interpretation: This study revealed that the FF–IGF axis functions to regenerate tissue damage after ovulation and promote the transformation of fimbrial epithelial cells that have been initiated by p53- and Rb-pathway disruptions. Fund: The study was supported by grants of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 106-2314-B-303-001-MY2; MOST 105-2314-B-303-017-MY2; MOST 107-2314-B-303-013-MY3), and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Taiwan (TCMMP104-04-01). ? 2019 The Authors","connective tissue growth factor; glycosaminoglycan; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase; nephroblastoma overexpressed protein; pregnancy associated plasma protein A; protein kinase B; protein p53; Ras protein; retinoblastoma protein; somatomedin; somatomedin B receptor; somatomedin binding protein; transcription factor NANOG; IGF1R protein, human; PAPPA1 protein, human; pregnancy associated plasma protein A; protein p53; small interfering RNA; somatomedin B; somatomedin binding protein; somatomedin receptor; anchorage independent growth; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carcinogenesis; cell culture; cell growth assay; cell survival; cell transformation; colony formation; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fallopian tube epithelium; fat pad; female; flow cytometry; gene; gene expression; gene knockdown; gene silencing; genotype; histopathology; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; karyotyping; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; ovary follicle fluid; ovulation; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; regeneration; signal transduction; spectrophotometry; tissue injury; Western blotting; xenograft; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; chromosome aberration; copy number variation; cytology; deficiency; epithelium cell; Fallopian tube; genetics; human; knockout mouse; metabolism; nonobese diabetic mouse; RNA interference; transplantation; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Chromosome Aberrations; DNA Copy Number Variations; Epithelial Cells; Fallopian Tubes; Female; Follicular Fluid; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, Knockout; Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A; Receptors, Somatomedin; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"
"A potential peptide derived from cytokine receptors can bind proinflammatory cytokines as a therapeutic strategy for anti-inflammation",2019,"Chronic inflammation is a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, and coronary artery disease. The efficacy of current treatment or preventive strategies for such inflammation is still inadequate. Thus, new anti-inflammatory strategies are needed. In this study, based on molecular docking and structural analysis, a potential peptide KCF18 with amphiphilic properties (positively charged and hydrophobic residues) derived from the receptors of proinflammatory cytokines was designed to inhibit cytokine-induced inflammatory response. Simulations suggested that KCF18 could bind to cytokines simultaneously, and electrostatic interactions were dominant. Surface plasmon resonance detection showed that KCF18 bound to both tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6, which is consistent with MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations. The cell experiments showed that KCF18 significantly reduced the binding of proinflammatory cytokines to their cognate receptors, suppressed TNF-α mRNA expression and monocyte binding and transmigration, and alleviated the infiltration of white blood cells in a peritonitis mouse model. The designed peptide KCF18 could remarkably diminish the risk of vascular inflammation by decreasing plasma cytokines release and by directly acting on the vascular endothelium. This study demonstrated that a combination of structure-based in silico design calculations, together with experimental measurements can be used to develop potential anti-inflammatory agents. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Reconstruction of Diabetic Foot Defects with the Proximal Lateral Leg Perforator Flap",2019,"Background In patients with diabetic foot ulcers requiring flap reconstruction, the choice of local flaps is limited by the lack of adequate tissue available. Free flaps are often bulky, presenting footwear difficulty due to poor contouring. Here, we present our experience of using the proximal lateral leg perforator flap in the reconstruction of thin diabetic foot ulcers. Methods This is a retrospective study of 17 patients with diabetic foot ulcers reconstructed with the proximal lateral leg perforator flap during January 2013 and December 2015. Results Nine patients had varying degrees of peripheral arterial disease. The perforator was located 7 to 14 cm (mean, 9.7 cm) from the fibula head. The pedicle length ranged from 5 to 9 cm (mean, 6.9 cm). The arterial diameter of the pedicle measured 0.8 to 1.9 mm (mean, 1.4 mm). There was 1 total flap failure. One other flap complicated by venous thrombosis was successfully salvaged. All donor sites were closed primarily without morbidities. All the wounds were stable without recurrent ulceration during a mean follow-up time of 12 months. Conclusion The thin, pliable proximal lateral leg perforator flap is an option for the reconstruction of small to moderate diabetic foot defects especially when it is located over the dorsal foot or the ankle. The flap is simple and quick to harvest without sacrificing a major artery. Although it is limited by the short length and the small diameter of the pedicle, for experienced microsurgeons, the success rate is high. ? Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",""
"Targeting the PI3K/STAT3 axis modulates age-related differences in macrophage phenotype in rats with myocardial infarction",2019,"Ageing is associated with impaired repair mechanisms in cardiovascular diseases. Macrophages contribute to cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI). The phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been shown to play a role in cardiac remodelling after MI. It remained unclear whether n-butylidenephthalide, a major component of Angelica sinensis, can attenuate cardiac fibrosis by regulating the PI3K/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated macrophage phenotypes in ageing rats after MI. Twenty-four hours after ligation of the left anterior descending artery, young (2-month-old) and ageing (18-month-old) male Wistar rats were treated with either vehicle or n-butylidenephthalide for 4?weeks. There were similar infarct sizes in both age groups. Compared with young rats, ageing rats exhibited significant increased cardiac fibrosis after MI, which can be attenuated after administering n-butylidenephthalide. MI was associated with decreased activities of PI3K and STAT3 in ageing rats compared with young rats. In both age groups, n-butylidenephthalide effectively provided a significant increase of STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 activity, STAT3 nuclear translocation, myocardial IL-10 levels and the percentage of M2c macrophage and a decrease of myofibroblast infiltration. The effects of n-butylidenephthalide on increased IL-10 levels were reversed by LY294002 or S3I-201. Furthermore, LY294002 abolished the STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas PI3K activity was not affected following the inhibition of STAT3. In conclusions, the host environment is responsible for ageing-related myofibroblast dysregulation in response to MI which can be improved by administering n-butylidenephthalide via macrophage differentiation towards M2 phenotype by targeting the PI3K/STAT3 axis. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Sleep Disturbance and Its Association with Gastrointestinal Symptoms/Diseases and Psychological Comorbidity",2019,"Background/Aims: We aimed to investigate gastrointestinal symptoms, clinical characteristics, and psychological factors in subjects with and without sleep disturbance (SD) in a health screening cohort. Methods: We enrolled 2,752 consecutive subjects during their health checkups. All participants underwent an evaluation with questionnaires. Demographic characteristics and biochemical data were recorded. SD was confirmed when Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was greater than 5. Results: Among the study population (n = 2,674), 956 (36%) individuals had SD. SD was associated with female gender, older age, lower level of education, higher systolic blood pressure, higher serum high-density lipoprotein levels and higher prevalence of functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). SD subjects also had more depression, more anxiety, more severe gastrointestinal reflux disease symptoms and higher prevalence of non-erosive reflux disease (NERD; p < 0.001). SD was -independently associated with female gender (OR 1.75, p < 0.001), older age (OR 1.03, p < 0.001), NERD (OR 1.88, p = 0.004), IBS (OR 1.51, p = 0.043), and depression (OR 1.16, p < 0.001) by multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Future studies will be needed to clarify the interrelationships among SD, psychological stress, and functional gastrointestinal disorders. ? 2018 S.

"Case-control study examining the association between allopurinol use and ischemic cerebrovascular disease",2019,"Few studies focus on the relationship between allopurinol and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The goal of the study was to investigate the association of long-term therapy of allopurinol with the first-time attack of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in Taiwan. We performed a case-control study using the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. The case group included 14,937 subjects aged 20-84 years with the first-time attack of ischemic cerebrovascular disease from 2000 to 2013. The control group included 14,937 sex-matched and age-matched subjects aged 20-84 years without any type of cerebrovascular disease. Ever use of allopurinol was defined as subjects who had at least a prescription for allopurinol before the index date. The OR and the 95% CI for ischemic cerebrovascular disease associated with allopurinol use were measured by the multivariable logistic regression model. The adjusted OR of ischemic cerebrovascular disease was 0.992 (95% CI 0.989 to 0.996) for subjects with increasing cumulative duration of allopurinol use for every 1 month, compared with never use. In a further analysis, the adjusted OR of ischemic cerebrovascular disease was 0.74 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.96) for cumulative duration of allopurinol use >3 years, compared with never use. Our findings suggest that lone-term therapy of allopurinol >3 years is associated with decreased risk of the first-time attack of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, compared with no allopurinol therapy. ?

"Immuohistochemical score of matrix metalloproteinase-1 may indicate the severity of symptomatic cervical and lumbar disc degeneration",2020,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is related to numerous risk factors, including obesity. Leptin, one of the commonly measured adipokines, is proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration. In the context of IVD degeneration, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), which is upregulated and activated by leptin, is the most abundant catabolic enzyme. It remains unclear which of the factors mentioned above is most strongly associated with IVD degeneration. PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of MMP-1 in IVD degeneration, we determined the strength of different predictors, including age, sex, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Modic changes (MCs), body mass index (BMI), leptin, and MMP-1. This was achieved by assessing the correlation among these factors and histologic degeneration score (HDS). STUDY DESIGN: This study included 89 patients undergoing cervical discectomy for disc herniation, 93 who underwent lumbar discectomy, and 90 control subjects. Herniated disc tissue and plasma were used after the study was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee at the authors’ institution. METHODS: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Alcian blue–PAS and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were performed to measure the expression levels of leptin and MMP-1. Circulating plasma levels of leptin and MMP-1 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To assess the correlation with HDS, measurements of age, sex, BMI, MRI scale, MCs scale, leptin/MMP-1 plasma concentration, and leptin/MMP-1 IHC expression were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with cervical or lumbar discectomy had significantly higher BMI than controls. Significantly more men than women were involved in the lumbar patients as compared with the cervical patients and the control subjects. After adjustment for age and sex, plasma leptin and leptin IHC score correlated significantly with BMI in patients with cervical or lumbar discectomy. Age, sex, MRI scale, MCs scale, and leptin/MMP-1 plasma concentration were not positively correlated with HDS. HDS was significantly associated with BMI, leptin IHC score, and MMP-1 IHC score. After a stepwise-multiple linear regression analysis to evaluate the strength of the correlations between HDS and various factors, only the MMP-1 IHC score demonstrated an independent association with HDS in patients with degeneration of the cervical or lumbar disc. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-1 IHC score is an independent predictor of the severity of cervical or lumbar IVD degeneration. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MMP-1 IHC score may be used as an indicator of IVD degeneration. ? 2019 The Authors","interstitial collagenase; leptin; adult; Article; body mass; cervical disk hernia; cervical spine; controlled study; discectomy; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; intervertebral disk degeneration; lumbar disk; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; prospective study; protein blood level; protein expression level; sex difference; symptomatology"
"A high seroprevalence of human herpesvirus type 8 already present in patients with chronic hepatitis before the development of cirrhosis",2019,"A high seroprevalence of human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) in mild cirrhotics is significantly associated with hepatitis activity. Cirrhosis is always derived from chronic hepatitis. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of HHV-8 infection in patients with chronic hepatitis. Blood samples collected from 129 patients with chronic hepatitis and 129 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analysed for monocyte and platelet counts, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), HHV-8 antibody and DNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Mean monocyte and platelet counts were significantly higher and lower in patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.02 and < 0.0001, respectively). Seropositive rate for HHV-8 antibodies was significantly greater in patients (32.6%) than in controls (20.9%, p = 0.04), particularly in patients with HCV infection, or higher plasma ALT levels, or both (p = 0.004, 0.01, and 0.0009, respectively). Antibody titres for HHV-8 in patients also exceeded those in controls (p = 0.02). The mean age of HHV-8 seropositive patients (60.3 years) was significantly older than that of seronegatives (52.3 years) (p = 0.0007). Patients aged 55 or older had higher seropositive rate and titres for HHV-8 antibodies than those younger (p = 0.005 and 0.007, respectively). A significantly high HHV-8 seroprevalence is already present in patients with chronic hepatitis before the development of cirrhosis, particularly in patients with HCV infection and/or higher plasma ALT levels. Advancing age seems to play an important role in HHV-8 seroprevalence in patients with chronic hepatitis. ? 2018 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia","alanine aminotransferase; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis C antibody; virus DNA; virus antibody; adult; antibody titer; Article; blood sampling; chemiluminescence immunoassay; chronic hepatitis; controlled study; female; Herpesviridae; human; human herpesvirus type 8; immunofluorescence; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; monocyte count; nonhuman; platelet count; priority journal; seroprevalence; aged; blood; chronic hepatitis; complication; herpes virus infection; Human herpesvirus 8; immunology; liver cirrhosis; seroepidemiology; virology; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Female; Hepatitis, Chronic; Herpesviridae Infections; Herpesvirus 8, Human; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Seroepidemiologic Studies"
"Water Exchange Produces Significantly Higher Adenoma Detection Rate Than Water Immersion: Pooled Data from 2 Multisite Randomized Controlled Trials",2019,"Goals: To test the hypothesis that water exchange (WE) significantly increases adenoma detection rates (ADR) compared with water immersion (WI). Background: Low ADR was linked to increased risk for interval colorectal cancers and related deaths. Two recent randomized controlled trials of head-to-head comparison of WE, WI, and traditional air insufflation (AI) each showed that WE achieved significantly higher ADR than AI, but not WI. The data were pooled from these 2 studies to test the above hypothesis. Study: Two trials (5 sites, 14 colonoscopists) that randomized 1875 patients 1:1:1 to AI, WI, or WE were pooled and analyzed with ADR as the primary outcome. Results: The ADR of AI (39.5%) and WI (42.4%) were comparable, significantly lower than that of WE (49.6%) (vs. AI P=0.001; vs. WI P=0.033). WE insertion time was 3 minutes longer than that of AI (P<0.001). WE showed significantly higher detection rate (vs. AI) of the >10 mm advanced adenomas. Right colon combined advanced and sessile serrated ADR of AI (3.4%) and WI (5%) were comparable and were significantly lower than that of WE (8.5%) (vs. AI P<0.001; vs. WI P=0.039). Conclusions: Compared with AI and WI, the superior ADR of WE offsets the drawback of a significantly longer insertion time. For quality improvement focused on increasing adenoma detection, WE is preferred over WI. The hypothesis that WE could lower the risk of interval colorectal cancers and related deaths should be tested. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Relationships among personality, coping, and concurrent health-related quality of life in women with breast cancer",2019,"Background: Theory has suggested that personality plays an important role related to health behavior and results in health outcomes, but inconsistent with the findings exist. Moreover, limited research has focused on style of coping with personality traits and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients with breast cancer. We tested how ways of coping and personality traits are associated with HRQOL in patients with breast cancer, after controlling for age, education, disease severity, and sleep disorders. Methods: In a cross-sectional study of 207 patients with breast cancer, they completed a set of questionnaires at two general hospitals. The measures used were demographic and individual characteristics, personality traits, ways of coping, and health surveys. We used correlations and hierarchical regressions to determine all relationships among factors, sleep disorders, personality, coping, and HRQOL. Results: Most participants were reported as having stage II (77, 37.2%) breast cancer. About 60% patients with breast cancer have poor sleep and sleep disorders having a negative association with HRQOL. Participants using more active coping, with lower neuroticism, and higher agreeableness traits are more likely to have a better physical quality of life (PQOL). In the PQOL regression model, clinical conditions (duration since cancer diagnosis; sleep disorders) and two personality traits (neuroticism and agreeableness) significantly explained 23% of variance. Moreover, fewer sleep disorders and two personality traits (neuroticism and conscientiousness) significantly explained 31% of variance in the mental quality-of-life (MQOL) regression model. Conclusions: A high prevalence of sleep disorders for patients with breast cancer has occurred and sleep disorders were negatively associated with PQOL and MQOL. In addition, neuroticism was positively related to sleep disorders and could be relevant to psycho-educational interventions. ? 2019, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.","adult; agreeableness; Article; breast cancer; cancer staging; conscientiousness; controlled study; coping behavior; cross-sectional study; demography; disease association; disease duration; female; human; major clinical study; neurosis; personality; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; Short Form 36; sleep disorder; sleep quality; breast tumor; complication; incidence; middle aged; neurosis; prevalence; psychology; quality of life; sleep disorder; social competence; Taiwan; women's health; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Extraversion, Psychological; Female; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neuroticism; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Skills; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Women's Health"

"Second repair of pediatric inguinal hernia: A longitudinal cohort study",2019,"Background: The objective of this nationwide observational study was to report the rate and risk factors for the second repair after pediatric inguinal herniorrhaphy. Materials and Methods: Children born from 1998 to 2005 were chosen from a cohort of 1,000,000 cases, which were randomly selected from an insured population of 23 million people in Taiwan (Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005). We identified all hernia repairs in the period of 1998-2012 for the sample population and then used a Cox proportional hazards regression model to analyze the risk factors for the second repair after pediatric inguinal herniorrhaphy. Results: The total sample population comprised 79,820 children, with a male-To-female ratio of 4.27:1. During a mean observation period of 11.4 ± 2.2 years, 3339 (4.18%) of the children in the sample population received primary inguinal hernia repair. Of the 251 children (7.52%) who underwent a second repair, 220 were boys (8.13%) and 31 were girls (4.9%); 244 (8.62%) underwent primary unilateral hernia repair, and 7 (1.38%) underwent primary bilateral hernia repair. Considering that bilateral hernia involves unilateral hernia on two sides, the expected recurrence rate after primary unilateral hernia repair was calculated as 0.69%. The calculated rates for late occurrence of contralateral hernia after primary unilateral hernia repair were 11.04%, 7.73%, and 3.28% for children aged 0-1, 1-4, and >4 years, respectively. Significant risk factors for second hernia repair were age at first primary hernia repair and unilateral hernia (P < 0.001). Gender and prematurity were not risk factors for second hernia repair. Conclusions: The second repair rate after primary unilateral or bilateral hernia repair was 7.52%. The only risk factor that predicted the second repair was age of <4 years at the time of operation. The expected recurrence rate after any hernia was estimated as 0.69%. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved..

"Transplanting human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and hyaluronate hydrogel repairs cartilage of osteoarthritis in the minipig model",2019,"Objectives: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease of degenerative joints. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used for cartilage regeneration in OA. We investigated the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (HUCMSCs) with hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel transplanted into a porcine OA preclinical model. Materials and Methods: The HUCMSCs were characterized with respect to morphology, surface markers, and differentiation capabilities. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to examine gene expressions in a HUCMSC-HA coculture. Two healthy female minipigs weighing 30-40 kg and aged approximately 4 months were used in this large animal study. A full-thickness chondral injury was created in the trochlear groove of each of the pig's rear knees. After 3 weeks, a second osteochondral defect was created. Then, 1.5 mL of a HUCMSC (5 × 10 6 cells) and HA composite (4%) was transplanted into the chondral-injured area in the right knee of each pig. Using the same surgical process, an osteochondral defect (untreated) was created in the left knee as a control. The pigs were sacrificed 12 weeks after transplantation. Macroscopic and microscopic histologies, qRT-PCR, and immunostaining evaluated the degree of chondral degradation. Results: The HUCMSCs exhibited typical MSC characteristics, including spindle morphology, expression of surface markers (positive for CD29, CD4, CD73, CD90, and human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-ABC; negative for CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR), and multipotent differentiation (adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis). More extensive proliferation of HUCMSCs was noted with 4% and 25% of HA than without HA. Expression of COL2A1 and aggrecan in the HUCMSC-derived chondrocytes was increased when HA was included. The treated knees showed significant gross and histological improvements in hyaline cartilage regeneration when compared to the control knees. The International Cartilage Repair Society histological score was higher for the treated knees than the control knees. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that cartilage regeneration using a mixture of HUCMSCs and HA in a large animal model may be an effective treatment for OA, and this study is a stepping stone toward the future clinical trials. ? 2018 Tzu Chi Medical Journal.","5' nucleotidase; beta1 integrin; CD4 antigen; cell surface marker; collagen type 2; HLA A antigen; HLA B antigen; HLA C antigen; hyaluronic acid; Thy 1 membrane glycoprotein; adipogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone development; cartilage; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell structure; chondrocyte; chondrogenesis; coculture; controlled study; cord blood stem cell transplantation; female; gene expression; histology; human; human cell; hyaline cartilage; hydrogel; immunohistochemistry; knee osteoarthritis; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; minipig; multipotent stem cell; nonhuman; protein expression; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; scoring system; tissue regeneration; treatment outcome"
"Potentiation of NMDA-Mediated Responses by Amyloid-β Peptide 1-40 in Rat Sympathetic Preganglionic Neurons",2019,"The abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) is one of the main characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases may be the risk factors for developing AD. The effect of Aβ on central sympathetic control of cardiovascular function remains unclear. The present study examines the acute effects of Aβ oligomers on the function of NMDA receptors, a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in rat sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs). In the in vitro electrophysiological study, Aβ 1-40 but not Aβ 1-42 applied by superfusion for 5 min significantly potentiated NMDA-induced depolarizations in SPNs of neonatal rat spinal cord slice preparation. Application of Aβ 1-40 had little effects on AMPA-induced depolarizations or GABA-induced hyperpolarizations. Treatment with a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor applied together with Aβ 1-40 blocked the augmentation by Aβ 1-40 of NMDA-induced depolarizations. Western blot analysis showed an increase in the levels of phosphoserine 896, selectively regulated by PKC, without significant changes in phosphoserine 897 on GluN1 subunits in lateral horn areas of spinal cord slices following treatment with Aβ 1-40. In the in vivo study, intrathecal injection of Aβ 1-40 (0.2 nmol) potentiated the pressor effects induced by NMDA (2 nmol) injected intrathecally in urethane-anesthetized rats. These results suggest that different fragments of Aβ may have differential effects on the NMDA receptor function and the selective augmentation of NMDA receptor function by Aβ 1-40 may involve PKC-dependent mechanisms in sympathetic preganglionic neurons. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Circulating chemerin levels, but not the RARRES2 polymorphisms, predict the long-term outcome of angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease",2019,"Chemerin, a novel adipokine, has been associated with metabolic, inflammatory, and atherosclerotic diseases. We aimed to determine the genetic basis of chemerin levels by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to investigate the role of RARRES2 polymorphisms and circulating chemerin levels in the long-term outcome of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 2197 participants from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) were recruited for the GWAS analysis, and 481 patients with angiographically confirmed CAD were enrolled for long-term outcome analysis. One locus of genome-wide significance with a single independent association signal was identified in the GWAS for chemerin levels with the peak association at the RARRES2 gene promoter region polymorphism rs3735167 (p = 2.35 × 10-21). In the CAD population, borderline significance was noted between RARRES2 polymorphisms and chemerin levels, whereas high chemerin levels were associated with obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, current smoking, high platelet and leukocyte counts, anemia, impaired renal function, high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and multi-vessel disease. Kaplan?Meier survival curves indicated that the patients with high chemerin and CRP levels, but not those with RARRES2 polymorphisms, had a lower survival rate and higher combined cerebral and cardiovascular event rates. Combined chemerin and CRP levels further revealed a stepwise increase in poor clinical outcomes from low- to high-risk subgroups. In conclusion, rs3735167 is the lead RARRES2 polymorphism for chemerin levels in Taiwanese. Chemerin levels, but not the rs3735167 genotypes, predicted the long-term outcome of CAD, especially when combined with CRP levels. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Fisetin activates Hippo pathway and JNK/ERK/AP-1 signaling to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of human osteosarcoma cells via ZAK overexpression",2019,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a tumor entity that can cause a large number of cancer-related deaths. Although chemotherapy can decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis of human OS cells, the clinical prognosis remains poor. Fisetin is a flavonol found in fruits and vegetables and is reported to inhibit cell growth in numerous cancers. But the molecular mechanism underlying fisetin in human OS cells is not clear. It is known that sterile-alpha motif and leucine zipper containing kinase (ZAK), a kinase in the MAP3K family, is involved in various cell processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. In our lab, we have demonstrated that overexpression of ZAK can induce apoptosis in human OS cells. In the previous studies, MAP4K, the upstream of MAP3K, can act in parallel to MST1/2 to activate LATS1/2 in the Hippo pathway. Turning on the Hippo pathway can decrease proliferation and otherwise cause cell apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, we found that fisetin can upregulate ZAK expression to induce the Hippo pathway and mediate the activation of JNK/ERK, the downstream of ZAK, to trigger cell apoptosis via AP-1 dependent manner in human OS cells. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying fisetin effect on human OS cells. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Amino acids; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Diagnosis; Diseases; Enzymes; Clinical prognosis; fisetin; Fruits and vegetables; hippo pathway; Human osteosarcoma cells; Molecular mechanism; Osteosarcoma; Proliferation and apoptosis; Cell signaling; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; caspase 3; connective tissue growth factor; fisetin; mitogen activated protein kinase; phosphotransferase; plasmid DNA; protein bcl xl; protein c jun; short hairpin RNA; stress activated protein kinase; transcription factor AP 1; unclassified drug; zipper containing kinase; antineoplastic agent; fisetin; flavonoid; Hippo protein, human; LATS2 protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein kinase; protein serine threonine kinase; stress activated protein kinase; transcription factor AP 1; tumor suppressor protein; ZAK protein, human; apoptosis; cancer; cell component; chemotherapy; enzyme; enzyme activity; gene expression; growth; inhibition; molecular analysis; tumor; apoptosis; Article; cell lysate; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; comparative study; controlled study; cytoplasm; flow cytometry; hippo signaling; human; human cell; MTT assay; osteosarcoma; osteosarcoma cell; percentage of apoptotic cells; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; transient transfection; upregulation; Western blotting; apoptosis; bone tumor; cell proliferation; enzymology; MAPK signaling; metabolism; osteosarcoma; pathology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Bone Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Flavonoids; Humans; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Osteosarcoma; Protein Kinases; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factor AP-1; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"Involvement of N-glycan in multiple receptor tyrosine kinases targeted by ling-zhi-8 for suppressing HCC413 tumor progression",2019,"The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is resulted from tumor metastasis. Signaling pathways triggered by deregulated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were the promising therapeutic targets for prevention of HCC progression. However, RTK-based target therapy using conventional kinase-based inhibitors was often hampered by resistances due to compensatory RTKs signaling. Herein, we report that Ling-Zhi-8 (LZ-8), a medicinal peptide from Ganoderma lucidium, was effective in suppressing cell migration of HCC413, by decreasing the amount and activity of various RTKs. These led to the suppression of downstream signaling including phosphorylated JNK, ERK involved in HCC progression. The capability of LZ-8 in targeting multiple RTKs was ascribed to its simultaneous binding to these RTKs. LZ-8 may bind on the N-linked glycan motif of RTKs that is required for their maturation and function. Notably, pretreatment of the N-glycan trimming enzyme PNGase or inhibitors of the mannosidase (N-glycosylation processing enzyme), kifunensine (KIF) and swainsonine (SWN), prevented LZ-8 binding on the aforementioned RTKs and rescued the downstream signaling and cell migration suppressed by LZ-8. Moreover, pretreatment of KIF prevented LZ-8 triggered suppression of tumor growth of HCC413. Our study suggested that a specific type of N-glycan is the potential target for LZ-8 to bind on multiple RTKs for suppressing HCC progression. ? 2018 by the authors.
