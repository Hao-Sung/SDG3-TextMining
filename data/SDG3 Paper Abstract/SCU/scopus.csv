"Relationship between alcohol use, blood pressure and hypertension: An association study and a Mendelian randomisation study",2019,"Background Past studies have found a strong relationship between alcohol drinking and human health. Methods In this study, we first tested the association of rs671 with alcohol use in 2349 participants in southeast China. We then evaluated the causal impact between alcohol use and cardiovascular traits through a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis. Results We found strong evidence for the association of rs671 in the ALDH2 gene with alcohol drinking (p=6.08×10 -47; OR adj G=4.50, 95% CI 3.67 to 5.52). We found that female G carriers of rs671 had a higher proportion of non-drinkers than male G carriers (88.01% vs 38.70%). In non-drinkers, the female G allele frequency was higher than the male G allele frequency (71.1% vs 55.2%). MR analysis suggested that alcohol use had a causal effect on blood pressure (increasing 9.46 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (p=9.67×10 -4) and 7.50 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (p=9.62×10 -5)), and on hypertension in men (p=0.011; OR =1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.36) and in pooled samples (p=0.013; OR =1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.39), but not in women. We did not observe a causal effect of alcohol use on body mass index and lipid levels; further studies are needed to clarify the non-causal relationship. Conclusions Compared to never-drinkers, current and previous alcohol use had a causal effect on blood pressure and hypertension in pooled samples and in men. These results reflect Chinese culture which does not encourage women to drink. ?

"Inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase 1 ameliorates alzheimer-like pathology in APP/PS1 transgenic mice through promoting lysosomal degradation of BACE1",2019,"Sphingolipids emerge as essential modulators in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with unclear mechanisms. Elevated levels of SM synthase 1 (SMS1), which catalyzes the synthesis of SM from ceramide and phosphatidylcholine, have been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a rate limiting enzyme in amyloid-β (Aβ) generation, are upregulated. In the present study, we show knockdown of SMS1 via andeno associated virus (serotype 8, AAV8) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, attenuates the densities of Aβ plaques, neuroinflammation, synaptic loss and thus rescuing cognitive deficits of these transgenic mice. We further describe that knockdown or inhibition of SMS1 decreases BACE1 stability, which is accompanied with decreased BACE1 levels in the Golgi, whereas enhanced BACE1 levels in the early endosomes and the lysosomes. The reduction of BACE1 levels induced by knockdown or inhibition of SMS1 is prevented by inhibition of lysosomes. Therefore, knockdown or inhibition of SMS1 promotes lysosomal degradation of BACE1 via modulating the intracellular trafficking of BACE1. Knockdown of SMS1 attenuates AD-like pathology through promoting lysosomal degradation of BACE1. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","beta secretase; beta secretase 1; sphingomyelin; sphingomyelin synthase 1; synthetase; unclassified drug; amyloid precursor protein; aspartic proteinase; Bace1 protein, mouse; phosphotransferase; presenilin 1; presenilin 1, mouse; secretase; sphingomyelin synthase 1, mouse; Adeno associated virus 8; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cognitive defect; controlled study; endosome; enzyme degradation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme stability; Golgi complex; hippocampus; immunofluorescence; lysosome; Morris water maze test; mouse; nervous system inflammation; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; synapse; transgenic mouse; upregulation; Alzheimer disease; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; gene knockdown; genetics; HEK293 cell line; human; metabolism; procedures; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Animals; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lysosomes; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Presenilin-1; Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)"
"Transforming growth factor β signaling pathway: A promising therapeutic target for cancer",2020,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is part of the transforming growth factor β superfamily which is involved in many physiological processes and closely related to the carcinogenesis. Here, we discuss the TGF-β structure, function, and its canonical Smads signaling pathway. Importantly, TGF-β has been proved that it plays both tumor suppressor as well as an activator role in tumor progression. In an early stage, TGF-β inhibits cell proliferation and is involved in cell apoptosis. In an advanced tumor, TGF-β signaling pathway induces tumor invasion and metastasis through promoting angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and immune escape. Furthermore, we are centered on updated research results into the inhibitors as drugs which have been studied in preclinical or clinical trials in tumor carcinogenesis to prevent the TGF-β synthesis and block its signaling pathways such as antibodies, antisense molecules, and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, it is highlighting the crucial role of TGF-β in tumor therapy and may provide opportunities for the new antitumor strategies in patients with cancer. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","antibody; ligand; phosphotransferase inhibitor; receptor; transforming growth factor beta; angiogenesis; apoptosis; cell proliferation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetic transduction; human; immunosurveillance; malignant neoplasm; metastasis; molecular interaction; nonhuman; priority journal; protein targeting; Review; TGF beta signaling; tumor invasion"
"One-step preparation of gold nanovectors using folate modified polyethylenimine and their use in target-specific gene transfection",2019,"Gene transfection, as an effective treatment for inherited and acquired life threatening diseases caused by genetic deficiencies and abnormalities, has evolved as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer and other intractable diseases. Non-target-specific vectors will affect normal cells as well as pathogenic cells, resulting in a relative decrease in transfection efficiency and unnecessary cytotoxicity. In the present work, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with folate (FA)-modified polyethylenimine (PEI-FA) were prepared by a single step method (without additional reducing agent) for targeted gene transfection in tumor cells. Moreover, an improved compound vector system was developed by mixing PEI-AuNPs and PEI-FA-AuNPs. It was shown that the compound vector system not only greatly increased transfection efficiency in HeLa cells, but also reduced cytotoxicity. By comparison, the transfection efficiency in L929 cells lacking folate receptor, was clearly lower than in tumor cells. The specific gene transfection of HeLa cells using this vector system could be clearly observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy in a co-culture system of HeLa cells and L929 cells. This transfection system with high-efficiency, high-specificity and low-toxicity appears to have potential in targeted cancer treatment and drug delivery. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cytology; Diseases; Efficiency; Fiber optic sensors; Gene therapy; Gold nanoparticles; Lanthanum compounds; Metal nanoparticles; Nanometals; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Vectors; Confocal laser scanning microscopy; Folate; Gene transfection; Genetic deficiencies; Polyethyleneimine; Therapeutic strategy; Transfection efficiency; Transfection system; Molecular biology; folate receptor; folic acid; gold nanoparticle; polyethyleneimine; folic acid; gold; metal nanoparticle; polyethyleneimine; Article; cell viability; coculture; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; genetic transfection; HeLa cell line; in vitro study; NCTC clone 929 cell line; particle size; priority journal; static electricity; synthesis; zeta potential; animal; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; gene therapy; gene transfer; gene vector; human; mouse; pharmacology; surface property; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Coculture Techniques; Drug Delivery Systems; Folic Acid; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Gold; HeLa Cells; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Particle Size; Polyethyleneimine; Surface Properties"
"Identification of novel T1D risk loci and their association with age and islet function at diagnosis in autoantibody-positive T1D individuals: Based on a two-stage genome-wide association study",2019,"OBJECTIVE Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly heritable disease with much lower incidence but more adult-onset cases in the Chinese population. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified &gt;60 T1D loci in Caucasians, less is known in Asians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We performed the first two-stage GWAS of T1D using 2,596 autoantibody-positive T1D case subjects and 5,082 control subjects in a Chinese Han population and evaluated the associations between the identified T1D risk loci and age and fasting C-peptide levels at T1D diagnosis. RESULTS We observed a high genetic correlation between children/adolescents and adult T1D case subjects (rg = 0.87), as well as subgroups of autoantibody status (rg ? 0.90). We identified four T1D risk loci reaching genome-wide significance in the Chinese Han population, including two novel loci, rs4320356 near BTN3A1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.26, P = 2.70 3 1028) and rs3802604 in GATA3 (OR 1.24, P = 2.06 3 1028), and two previously reported loci, rs1770 in MHC (OR 4.28, P = 2.25 3 102232) and rs705699 in SUOX (OR 1.46, P = 7.48 3 10220). Further fine mapping in the MHC region revealed five independent variants, including another novel locus, HLA-C position 275 (omnibus P = 9.78 3 10212), specific to the Chinese population. Based on the identified eight variants, we achieved an area under the curve value of 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.88). By building a genetic risk score (GRS) with these variants, we observed that the higher GRS were associated with an earlier age of T1D diagnosis (P = 9.08 3 10211) and lower fasting C-peptide levels (P = 7.19 3 1023) in individuals newly diagnosed with T1D. CONCLUSIONS Our results extend current knowledge on genetic contributions to T1D risk. Further investigations in different populations are needed for genetic heterogeneity and subsequent precision medicine. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

"TMCO1-mediated Ca 2+ leak underlies osteoblast functions via CaMKII signaling",2019,"Transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 1 (TMCO1) is a recently identified Ca 2+ leak channel in the endoplasmic reticulum. TMCO1 dysfunction in humans is associated with dysmorphism, mental retardation, glaucoma and the occurrence of cancer. Here we show an essential role of TMCO1 in osteogenesis mediated by local Ca 2+ /CaMKII signaling in osteoblasts. TMCO1 levels were significantly decreased in bone from both osteoporosis patients and bone-loss mouse models. Tmco1 ?/? mice exhibited loss of bone mass and altered microarchitecture characteristic of osteoporosis. In the absence of TMCO1, decreased HDAC4 phosphorylation resulted in nuclear enrichment of HADC4, which leads to deacetylation and degradation of RUNX2, the master regulator of osteogenesis. We further demonstrate that TMCO1-mediated Ca 2+ leak provides local Ca 2+ signals to activate the CaMKII-HDAC4-RUNX2 signaling axis. The establishment of TMCO1 as a pivotal player in osteogenesis uncovers a novel potential therapeutic target for ameliorating osteoporosis. ? 2019, The Author(s).","alkaline phosphatase; calcium; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; caspase 9; collagen type 1; growth hormone; histone deacetylase 4; small interfering RNA; thyrotropin; transcription factor RUNX2; Transmembrane and coiled coil domain 1; unclassified drug; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; calcium channel; Hdac5 protein, mouse; histone deacetylase; membrane protein; Runx2 protein, mouse; TMCO1 protein, human; TMCO1 protein, mouse; transcription factor RUNX2; bone; calcium; cancer; enzyme; enzyme activity; signaling; Adenoviridae; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone development; bone mass; bone microarchitecture; calcium cell level; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; controlled study; deacetylation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; fracture; genetic transfection; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; luciferase assay; male; micro-computed tomography; morphometry; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; ossification; osteoblast; osteolysis; osteoporosis; plasmid; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; signal transduction; ubiquitination; aged; animal; C57BL mouse; calcium signaling; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; mutant mouse strain; osteoblast; ovariectomy; pathophysiology; physiology; protein stability; signal transduction; Mus; Aged; Animals; Calcium Channels; Calcium Signaling; Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Female; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Mutant Strains; Middle Aged; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; Ovariectomy; Protein Stability; Signal Transduction"
"Carbenoxolone ameliorates insulin sensitivity in obese mice induced by high fat diet via regulating the IκB-α/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome",2019,"The characteristic feature of obesity and insulin resistance is chronic low-grade inflammation. Nod-Like Receptor Pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a central role in obesity-induced insulin resistance. However, how does Carbenoxolone (CBX) play its role in ameliorating insulin resistance in peripheral tissues of obese mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) remains unknown. In our study, we explored the molecular mechanism of CBX in improving insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle in mice induced by the HFD. Our results revealed that in the CBX group, a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR score were observed. CBX could attenuate intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammation aggravation in liver and skeletal muscle. Besides, treatment with CBX could significantly reduce expressions of p-IκB-α, p-NF-κB, p-IRS-1, NLRP3 and inflammatory factors, increase expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT. Therefore, CBX could dramatically improve insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle in mice induced by the high-fat diet. In conclusions, we demonstrate that CBX has a significant protective effect on diet-induced obesity in mice. The potential mechanisms include inhibiting IκB-α/NF-κB pathway, restricting the production of NLRP3 inflammasome and other inflammatory factors, reducing the expression of p-IRS-1, increasing the expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT, thus ameliorating insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle of high-fat diet mice. Therefore CBX is an active agent against diet-induced obesity and is given the opportunity for the treatment of obesity related diseases. ? 2019","carbenoxolone; cryopyrin; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inflammasome; insulin; insulin receptor substrate 1; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoprotein; protein kinase B; carbenoxolone; cryopyrin; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Nlrp3 protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; drug mechanism; glucose blood level; homeostasis model assessment; inflammation; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; liver tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; skeletal muscle; adverse event; animal; C57BL mouse; complication; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; insulin resistance; lipid diet; metabolism; obesity; randomization; Animals; Carbenoxolone; Diet, High-Fat; Gene Expression Regulation; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle, Skeletal; NF-kappa B; NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Obesity; Random Allocation"
"Bufalin suppresses the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through HOTAIR, the sponge of miR-520b",2019,"Bufalin, the major active component of the traditional Chinese medicine ChanSu obtained from the skin and parotid venom glands of toads, has long been known as an anticancer agent. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the anticancer activities of bufalin, while long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to interact with miRNAs to regulate various biological functions. In this paper, we investigated the possible network related to the antimetastatic effect of bufalin in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We demonstrated that bufalin (0.05?10 ?M) dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells with IC50 values of 0.89 and 1.28 ?M, respectively. Furthermore, bufalin treatment significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion. To explore the role of lncRNAs in the antimetastatic activity of bufalin, we used an lncRNA microarray and found that HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was the most markedly downregulated lncRNA in bufalin-treated PCa cells. Overexpression of HOTAIR counteracted the suppressing effects of bufalin on DU145 and PC3 cells. We then predicted and verified that HOTAIR upregulated FGFR1 expression by sponging miR-520b in PCa cells. In 40 patients with PCa bone metastasis, we used in situ hybridization or immunohistochemical assay to assess the HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression, which revealed that both HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression were significantly higher in bone metastasis tissues than in the primary PCa tissues. In addition, the level of serum HOTAIR was positively associated with the levels of serum bone metabolic markers (CTx, OST, B-ALP and PINP) and may serve as a reasonable biomarker for PCa bone metastasis. Taken together, this is the first study revealing that HOTAIR promotes PCa bone metastasis, and bufalin may be a promising candidate for the treatment of this disease. ? 2019, CPS and SIMM.","alkaline phosphatase bone isoenzyme; bufalin; carboxy terminal telopeptide; complementary RNA; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; Hox protein; HOX transcript antisense RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; microRNA 520b; osteocalcin; procollagen; procollagen type i n terminal propeptide; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; bufadienolide derivative; bufalin; FGFR1 protein, human; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; HOTAIR long untranslated RNA, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN520 microRNA, human; 3' untranslated region; Article; bone metastasis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; DU145 cell line; gene overexpression; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; male; metastasis inhibition; mRNA expression level; prostate cancer; protein blood level; protein expression level; tumor invasion; upregulation; wound healing assay; cell motion; drug effect; gene expression regulation; metabolism; prostate tumor; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Bufanolides; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1; RNA, Long Noncoding; Up-Regulation"
"Overexpression of CASC11 in ovarian squamous cell carcinoma mediates the development of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy",2019,"LncRNA CASC11 promotes gastric cancer and colon cancer. Our study analyzed the role of CASC11 in ovarian squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study we showed that plasma CASC11 was upregulated in OSCC, and the upregulation of CASC11 distinguished OSCC patients from control group. Plasma levels of CASC11 were further increased after chemotherapy. Treatment with oxaliplatin, tetraplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin mediated the upregulation of CASC11 in cells of OSCC cell line. In addition, overexpression of CASC11 led to increased cancer cell viability under oxaliplatin, tetraplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin treatment, while CASC11 siRNA silencing played an opposite role. Therefore, overexpression of CASC11 in OSCC mediated the development of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. ? 2019","carboplatin; cisplatin; long non coding CASC11; long untranslated RNA; oxaliplatin; small interfering RNA; tetraplatin; unclassified drug; carboplatin; cisplatin; long noncoding RNA CASC11, human; long untranslated RNA; oxaliplatin; platinum complex; tetraplatin; adult; aged; Article; blood level; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer resistance; cell viability; controlled study; female; gene overexpression; gene silencing; human; human cell; major clinical study; ovarian carcinoma cell line; ovary carcinoma; priority journal; squamous cell carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma cell line; upregulation; blood; case control study; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; middle aged; ovary tumor; prognosis; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; upregulation; Adult; Aged; Carboplatin; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Middle Aged; Organoplatinum Compounds; Ovarian Neoplasms; Oxaliplatin; Prognosis; RNA, Long Noncoding; Up-Regulation"
"CD33 + CD14 + CD11b + HLA-DR ? monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells recruited and activated by CCR9/CCL25 are crucial for the pathogenic progression of endometriosis",2019,"Problem: Endometriosis (EM) is a chronic immunoinflammatory disease associated with an abnormal immunotolerant microenvironment. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that play a major role in immunosuppression in cancer, inflammation and other diseases. This paper aims to elucidate whether or not MDSCs are involved in regulating this microenvironment in EM and how this regulation occurs. Method of Study: Immunochemistry (IHC) and qPCR were conducted to measure CD11b and ARG1 expression in the ectopic endometrium samples from EM patients. CCL25 levels in EM PF and the expression of CCR9 on M-MDSCs were measured by ELISA. M-MDSC migration was determined towards rhCCL25, α-CCR9, α-CCL25 and EM PF through in vitro chemotaxis assay. CD33 + CD14 + CD11b + HLA-DR - M-MDSCs isolated from EM PBMCs were added to CD8 + T cells stimulated with α-CD3/α-CD28 antibody. After 72?hours of co-culture, proliferation was measured to rate the immunosuppressive function of M-MDSCs. Finally, levels of IL-10, GM-CSF and arginase activity in the cultured supernatants were detected. Results: IHC and qPCR results revealed higher CD11b and ARG1 expression in EM endometrium than normal endometrium. MDSCs accumulated in the EM microenvironment, in which M-MDSCs were the predominant type. CD33 + CD14 + CD11b + HLA-DR ? M-MDSCs expressed high CCR9 levels and were recruited through CCL25. M-MDSCs from EM PBMCs inhibited proliferation and activity in autologous T cells. rhCCL25 promoted IL-10 and GM-CSF secretion and arginase enzymatic activity in CD33 + CD14 + CD11b + HLA-DR ? M-MDSCs. Conclusion: CD33 + CD14 + CD11b + HLA-DR ? M-MDSCs recruited and activated by CCR9/CCL25 play a crucial role in the pathogenic progression of endometriosis, thus providing a potential target for EM treatment. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Increased gene copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 worsens sepsis by inducing endothelial pyroptosis",2019,"Sepsis claims an estimated 30 million episodes and 6 million deaths per year, and treatment options are rather limited. Human neutrophil peptides 1–3 (HNP1–3) are the most abundant neutrophil granule proteins but their neutrophil content varies because of unusually extensive gene copy number polymorphism. A genetic association study found that increased copy number of the HNP-encoding gene DEFA1/DEFA3 is a risk factor for organ dysfunction during sepsis development. However, direct experimental evidence demonstrating that these risk alleles are pathogenic for sepsis is lacking because the genes are present only in some primates and humans. Here, we generate DEFA1/DEFA3 transgenic mice with neutrophil-specific expression of the peptides. We show that mice with high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 genes have more severe sepsis-related vital organ damage and mortality than mice with low copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 or wild-type mice, resulting from more severe endothelial barrier dysfunction and endothelial cell pyroptosis after sepsis challenge. Mechanistically, HNP-1 induces endothelial cell pyroptosis via P2X7 receptor-mediating canonical caspase-1 activation in a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we engineered a monoclonal antibody against HNP-1 to block the interaction with P2X7 and found that the blocking antibody protected mice carrying high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 from lethal sepsis. We thus demonstrate that DEFA1/DEFA3 copy number variation strongly modulates sepsis development in vivo and explore a paradigm for the precision treatment of sepsis tailored by individual genetic information. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Prognostic value of lymphovascular invasion in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis following surgery",2019,"Background: To evaluate the prognostic value of Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (SCCP) following surgery. Patients and methods: This retrospective study analyzed the data of 891 eligible patients with SCCP who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2014, obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The patients were categorized by LVI, age, grade, T stage, lymph nodes status, distant metastasis, regional lymph nodes removed, and surgery. Overall survival (OS) and penile carcinoma-specific survival (PCSS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: The presence of LVI was significantly associated with increased risk of advanced T stage, high grade, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (P < 0.001 for all). In Kaplan-Meier analyses, patients with the presence of LVI had significantly lower OS and PCSS than those with the absence of LVI (P < 0.001 for both,). The presence of LVI was also significantly associated with poorer OS and worse PCSS in patients with Tx + Ta + T1 stage (P = 0.007, P < 0.001), N0 stage (P < 0.001, P = 0.040), grade 1 (P = 0.001, P < 0.001), grade 2 (P = 0.001, P = 0.014), no distant metastasis (P < 0.001 for both), no regional lymph nodes removed (P < 0.001 for both), Non-radical surgery (P < 0.001 for both) and radical surgery(P = 0.037, P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses, the presence of LVI in patients with SCCP following surgery was found to be a significant independent predictor of decreased OS (hazard ratio 1.403, P = 0.039). Conclusions: The LVI status might be a crucial prognostic indicator for overall survival in patients with SCCP. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; advanced cancer; Article; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; clinical feature; controlled study; disease association; distant metastasis; high risk patient; human; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; overall survival; penile carcinoma specific survival; penis carcinoma; prediction; retrospective study; squamous cell carcinoma; cancer registry; female; Kaplan Meier method; pathology; penis tumor; prognosis; squamous cell carcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Penile Neoplasms; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program"
"Diagnostic and prognostic value of biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction",2019,"The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been increasing rapidly in recent years, seriously endangering human health. Cardiac biomarkers play critical roles in the diagnosis and prognosis of AMI. Troponin is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for AMI diagnosis and can independently predict adverse cardiac events. Other biomarkers such as N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and C reactive protein are also valuable predictors of cardiovascular prognosis. Recently, several novel biomarkers have been identified for the diagnosis and risk assessment in patients with AMI. A multibiomarker approach can potentially enhance the diagnostic accuracy and provide more information for the early risk stratification of AMI. In this review, we will summarise the biomarkers discovered in recent years and focus on their diagnostic and prognostic value for patients with AMI. ? 2019 Author(s).","adrenomedullin; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; CD40 antigen; CD40 ligand; fatty acid binding protein 3; gelatinase B; interleukin 1 receptor like 1 protein; interleukin 6; ischemia modified albumin; microRNA 1; microRNA 34a; myeloperoxidase; myoglobin; nitric oxide synthase; placental growth factor; procalcitonin; troponin; troponin I; troponin T; tumor necrosis factor; acute coronary syndrome; acute heart infarction; angiogenesis; artery embolism; atherosclerosis; calcium homeostasis; cardiac muscle cell; cardiovascular mortality; clinical decision making; coronary artery occlusion; coronary artery spasm; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle injury; heart muscle necrosis; heart ventricle function; human; hypertension; incidence; inflammation; major adverse cardiac event; natriuresis; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; predictive value; Review; sensitivity and specificity; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; upregulation; vasodilatation"
"An RNA-seq-Based Expression Profiling of Radiation-Induced Esophageal Injury in a Rat Model",2019,"Radiation-induced acute injury is the main reason for the suspension of radiotherapy and unsuccessful treatment of cancer. It is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanism of radiation-induced esophageal injury. We used RNA-seq data from normal esophageal tissue and irradiated esophageal tissues and applied computational approaches to identify and characterize differentially expressed genes and detected 40 059 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) previously annotated and 717 novel long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). There were 14 upregulated and 32 downregulated lncRNAs among the differentially expressed lncRNA group. Their target genes were involved in the mRNA surveillance pathway, pathological immune responses, and cellular homeostasis. Additionally, we found 853 differentially expressed mRNAs, and there were 384 upregulated and 469 downregulated mRNAs. Notably, we found that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched for steroid biosynthesis, the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, focal adhesion, pathways in cancer, extracellular matrix–receptor interaction, and so on. The response of normal esophageal tissues to ionizing radiation is multifarious. The radiation-induced cell damage response by multiple pathways followed by pathological immune responses activated. Studies on the dynamic network of molecules involved in radiation-induced esophageal injury are under way to clarify the regulatory mechanisms and identify the candidate targets. ?

"Neural stem cell therapies and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury",2019,"Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the adult as well as in the neonate. Extensive pre-clinical studies have shown promising therapeutic effects of neural stem cell-based treatments for hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. There are two major strategies of neural stem cell-based therapies: transplanting exogenous neural stem cells and boosting self-repair of endogenous neural stem cells. Neural stem cell transplantation has been proved to improve functional recovery after brain injury through multiple by-stander mechanisms (e.g., neuroprotection, immunomodulation), rather than simple cell-replacement. Endogenous neural stem cells reside in certain neurogenic niches of the brain and response to brain injury. Many molecules (e.g., neurotrophic factors) can stimulate or enhance proliferation and differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells after injury. In this review, we first present an overview of neural stem cells during normal brain development and the effect of hypoxic-ischemic injury on the activation and function of endogenous neural stem cells in the brain. We then summarize and discuss the current knowledge of strategies and mechanisms for neural stem cell-based therapies on brain hypoxic-ischemic injury, including neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and adult ischemic stroke. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","epidermal growth factor; erythropoietin; fibroblast growth factor; growth factor; leukemia inhibitory factor; microRNA; microRNA 124; microRNA 17 92; microRNA 210; microRNA 9; neurotrophic factor; Notch receptor; sonic hedgehog protein; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; Wnt protein; adult; brain development; brain ischemia; bystander effect; cell activation; cell function; DNA methylation; epigenetics; histone modification; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; hypothermia; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; immunomodulation; in vivo study; nervous system development; neural stem cell; neural stem cell transplantation; newborn; newborn hypoxia; nonhuman; Notch signaling; nuclear reprogramming; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; Review; Wnt signaling"
"One-stage reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects in the hands using multidigit, chimeric, lateral arm, perforator flaps",2019,"Purpose: To describe our experience using microsurgically fabricated, multilobed, chimeric, lateral arm (LA) flaps to reconstruct hand injuries with complex, multidigit, soft tissue defects and to evaluate the morbidity and esthetic and functional outcomes of the donor sites. Methods: We performed a single center, retrospective analysis of 21 patients with hand wounds treated from October 2013 to February 2016. All patients underwent reconstruction using multilobed, chimeric, free, LA flaps. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess donor site morbidity and satisfaction with the esthetic and overall functional result. Outcome measures were the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, static 2-point discrimination score, and visual analogue scale. Results: The study included 21 patients (20 males and 1 female), with an average age of 32.14 years (range 18–45 years), who sustained traumatic injuries in road traffic accidents (n = 2) or industrial devices (n = 19). The average DASH score was 28.25 ± 2.3, the average 2-PD score was 7.20 ± 1.30, and the average visual analogue scale (VAS) was 0.38 ± 0.40. All 21 patients had sensory disorders at the donor site. Postoperative donor site complications comprised wound dehiscence (n = 1) and hematoma (n = 3). The patient-rated satisfaction score for the donor site was 5.40 ± 0.90, and 70% of the patients would undergo the same surgery again. Conclusion: Microsurgical fabrication of multilobed, chimeric, LA flaps can exhibit sensory recovery and minimal pain but may cause hematoma and sensory disorders at the donor site. The flaps are a viable alternative for the reconstruction of complex, multidigit, soft tissue defects of the hands. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; Article; chimeric flap; clinical article; crush trauma; debridement; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); dissection; donor site; female; functional status; hand injury; hematoma; human; lateral arm flap; male; metacarpal bone fracture; microsurgery; middle aged; mobilization; morbidity; multidigit flap; nanofabrication; patient satisfaction; perforator flap; postoperative complication; priority journal; questionnaire; radial nerve; retrospective study; scar; sensory dysfunction; skin nerve; soft tissue defect; tissue flap; traffic accident; visual analog scale; wound dehiscence; young adult; adverse event; convalescence; devices; finger; free tissue graft; hand injury; injury scale; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; procedures; psychology; reconstructive surgery; soft tissue injury; Adult; Female; Fingers; Free Tissue Flaps; Hand Injuries; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Perforator Flap; Postoperative Complications; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Soft Tissue Injuries; Trauma Severity Indices"
"Multifunctional two-dimensional nanocomposites for photothermal-based combined cancer therapy",2019,"Two-dimensional (2D) nanocomposites have been widely used in biomedical applications during the past few years due to their extraordinary physicochemical properties, which has proved their importance in the field of nanomedicine. Benefiting from the excellent optical absorption in the near-infrared window and large specific surface area, many efforts have been devoted to fabricating 2D nanomaterial-based multifunctional nanoplatforms to realize photothermal therapy (PTT)-based or chemotherapy-based synergistic treatment, which exhibits obvious anti-tumor effects and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficiency of cancer compared with monotherapy. In particular, 2D nanocomposites are usually fabricated as intelligent nanoplatforms for stimuli-responsive nanocarriers, whose therapeutic effects could be specifically activated by the tumor microenvironment (TME). In addition, different fluorescent probes and functional inorganic nanomaterials could be absorbed on the surface of 2D nanomaterials to fabricate multifunctional hybrid nanomaterials with satisfactory magnetic, optical, or other properties that are widely used for multimodal imaging-guided cancer therapy. In this review, the latest development of multifunctional 2D nanocomposites for combination therapy is systematically summarized, mainly focusing on PTT-based synergistic cancer therapy, and the other forms and potential forms of synergistic cancer therapy are also simply summarized. Furthermore, the design principles of 2D nanocomposites are particularly emphasized, and the current challenges and future prospects of 2D nanocomposites for cancer theranostics are discussed simultaneously. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Chemotherapy; Infrared devices; Light absorption; Medical applications; Medical nanotechnology; Nanocomposites; Oncology; Physicochemical properties; Tumors; Biomedical applications; Inorganic nanomaterials; Large specific surface areas; Photothermal therapy; Therapeutic efficiency; Tumor microenvironment; Two Dimensional (2 D); Two-dimensional nanocomposites; Diseases; nanocomposite; chemistry; human; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; phototherapy; theranostic nanomedicine; thermotherapy; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Nanocomposites; Neoplasms; Phototherapy; Theranostic Nanomedicine"
"Vitamin D attenuates myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury by inhibiting inflammation via suppressing the RhoA/ROCK/NF-?B pathway",2019,"The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of vitamin D (VD) against myocardial ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury in hearts. An I/R injury model was induced by left coronary artery ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats (in vivo) and Langendorff perfusion of isolated hearts (in vitro). The infarction areas were determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Changes in the ST segment, cardiac function, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, creatine kinase (CK) activity, inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) levels and the RhoA/ROCK/NF-?B pathway were tested in rats with I/R injury treated with or without VD. VD notably alleviated myocardial injury with decreased infarction areas and had a restorative effect on cardiac function, which was specifically manifested as a restored ST segment, increased myocardial contractility and increased coronary blood flow in the isolated hearts. The levels of CK and LDH were also suppressed by VD. In addition, VD significantly decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in rat sera and isolated hearts. The RhoA/ROCK/NF-κB pathway in I/R-injured rats was also obviously inhibited with VD treatment. The present study demonstrates that VD plays a protective role against myocardial injury by inhibiting inflammation through repressing the RhoA/ROCK/NF-κB pathway. ? 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","Chlorine compounds; Heart; Pathology; Rats; Cardio-vascular disease; Inflammation; Lactate dehydrogenase activities; Myocardial contractility; Reperfusion; Triphenyltetrazolium chlorides; Tumor necrosis factor alpha; Vitamin-D; Vitamins; creatine kinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; triphenyltetrazolium; tumor necrosis factor; vitamin D; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; vitamin D; adult; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery ligation; creatine kinase blood level; enzyme activity; heart function; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle injury; in vitro study; in vivo study; isolated heart; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; left coronary artery; male; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; nonhuman; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; ST segment; staining; animal; inflammation; metabolism; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; pathology; Animals; Inflammation; Male; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; NF-kappa B; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; rho-Associated Kinases; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Vitamin D"
"The Cavan-Monaghan First Episode Psychosis Study (CAMFEPS): Arbitrary diagnostic boundaries across the gene-environment interface and within evolving models of care",2019,"As research into psychotic illness evolves along established lines, insights are emerging that deviate from those lines and challenge more fundamentally our understanding. On the background of a new generation of studies on first-episode psychosis, investigations across the gene-environment interface and the intersection with 'normal' human mentation heighten these concerns. Using findings from the Cavan-Monaghan First Episode Psychosis Study (CAMFEPS) as an exemplar, we here review the complexity of these challenges from the perspective of this real-world setting. They range from trans-diagnostic epidemiology and clinical characterisation, through molecular genetics, social milieu, developmental pathobiology and functional outcome across arbitrary diagnostic boundaries, to the evidence base for early intervention and more radical conceptualisations and structures for provision of mental health care. ? 2019 College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.","clinical feature; clinical outcome; developmental disorder; early intervention; evidence based medicine; functional assessment; genotype environment interaction; health service; human; mental disease; mental health care; molecular genetics; neurology; neuropsychology; psychiatric diagnosis; psychosis; quality of life; Review; social aspect"
"Tumor Vasculatures: A New Target for Cancer Immunotherapy",2019,"Immune cells rely on a functional vascular network to enter tissues. In solid tumors, blood vessels are abnormal and dysfunctional and, thus, immune effector cell infiltration is impaired. Although normalizing the tumor vasculature has been shown to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, recent studies suggest that enhanced immune stimulation also, in turn, improves tumor vascular normalization. Thus, this new paradigm of immune system–tumor vasculature mutual reprogramming opens the possibility of identifying new cancer treatment strategies that combine vascular targeting and immunotherapies. Here, we highlight current evidence supporting immune system–tumor vasculature crosstalk and outline how this relationship can provide new rationales for developing more effective combination immunotherapy strategies for treating human cancers. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","aflibercept; angiogenesis inhibitor; angiopoietin; antineoplastic agent; atezolizumab; avelumab; axitinib; bevacizumab; cabozantinib; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; demcizumab; durvalumab; ipilimumab; lenvatinib; nivolumab; pazopanib; pembrolizumab; ramucirumab; regulator of G protein 5 signaling; RGS protein; rivoceranib; shr 1210; sorafenib; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; vanucizumab; vasculotropin; advanced cancer; antiangiogenic therapy; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; brain metastasis; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; clear cell carcinoma; colorectal carcinoma; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; drug targeting; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; glioblastoma; human; immunosuppressive treatment; liver cell carcinoma; melanoma; metastasis; molecular interaction; non small cell lung cancer; ovary cancer; ovary carcinoma; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pericyte; peritoneum cancer; priority journal; renal cell carcinoma; Review; skin cancer; solid malignant neoplasm; stomach cancer; transitional cell carcinoma; triple negative breast cancer; tumor vascularization; urogenital tract cancer; uterine tube carcinoma"
"Hsa_circ_101555 functions as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-597-5p to promote colorectal cancer progression",2019,"CircRNAs have been reported to exert momentous roles in regulating pathophysiological process and guiding clinical diagnosis and treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there are still a lot of circRNAs that need to be unearthed. In this study, we evaluated the expression profile of circRNAs in 10 CRC tissues and their corresponding normal-appearing tissues (NATs) by microarray, and identified that hsa_circ_101555 (circ101555) was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues and closely related to the prognosis of CRC patients. A specific close loop structure of circ101555 was described, which was generated by back-splicing of the host gene CSNK1G1 and showed greater stability than the linear RNA. The results in vitro and in vivo showed that silencing circ101555 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and impaired the DNA repair capacity of CRC cells, while rescue experiments suggested that down-expression of miR-597-5p could significantly attenuate the biological effects of circ101555 knockdown on CRC cells. Subsequent experiments in vitro, including double fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) analysis, RIP analysis and biotin-coupled probe pull down assay, confirmed that miR-597-5p was effectively enriched by circ101555, and circ101555 might serve as a sponge of miR-597-5p. Moreover, two putative oncogenes (CDK6 and RPA3) were identified as the miR-597-5p potential targets. Taken together, our results proved that circ101555 might function as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-597-5p to up-regulate CDK6 and RPA3 expression in CRC. Circ101555 could be a useful prognostic indicator in patients with CRC, and silence of circ101555 provided a new attractive therapeutic measure for CRC. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Hsa circ 101555 RNA; microRNA; microRNA 597 5p; RNA; unclassified drug; CDK6 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase 6; DNA binding protein; microRNA; RPA3 protein, human; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; CDK6 gene; cell proliferation; clinical article; colorectal cancer; controlled study; CSNK1G1 gene; DNA repair; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene; gene expression regulation; gene function; gene knockdown; gene silencing; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; RNA splicing; RNA stability; RNA structure; RPA3 gene; tumor volume; animal; Bagg albino mouse; binding competition; C57BL mouse; colorectal tumor; disease exacerbation; female; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; HEK293 cell line; HT-29 cell line; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; tumor cell line; Animals; Binding, Competitive; Cell Line, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6; Disease Progression; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HCT116 Cells; HEK293 Cells; HT29 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Nude; Microarray Analysis; MicroRNAs; RNA, Circular"
"Tubeimoside-1, a triterpenoid saponin, induces cytoprotective autophagy in human breast cancer cells in vitro via Akt-mediated pathway",2019,"Autophagy, a form of cellular self-digestion by lysosome, is associated with various disease processes including cancers, and modulating autophagy has shown promise in the treatment of various malignancies. A number of natural products display strong antitumor activity, yet their mechanisms of action remain unclear. To gain a better understanding of how traditional Chinese medicine agents exert antitumor effects, we screened 480 natural compounds for their effects on autophagy using a high content screening assay detecting GFP-LC3 puncta in HeLa cells. Tubeimoside-1 (TBMS1), a triterpenoid saponin extracted from Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim) Franquet (Cucurbitaceae), was identified as a potent activator of autophagy. The activation of autophagy by TBMS1 was evidenced by increased LC3-II amount and GFP-LC3 dots, observation of autophagosomes under electron microscopy, and enhanced autophagic flux. To explore the mechanisms underlying TBMS1-activated autophagy, we performed cheminformatic analyses and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay that showed a higher likelihood of the binding between Akt protein and TBMS1. In three human breast cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that Akt–mTOR–eEF-2K pathway was involved in TBMS1-induced activation of autophagy, while Akt-mediated downregulations of Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2 led to the activation of apoptosis of the breast cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy enhanced the cytotoxic effect of TBMS1 via promoting apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the role and mechanism of TBMS1 in activating autophagy, suggesting that inhibition of cytoprotective autophagy may act as a therapeutic strategy to reinforce the activity of TBMS1 against cancers. ? 2018, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, CAS and Chinese Pharmacological Society.

"MiR-431 suppresses proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer via down-regulating DDX5",2019,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to detect the role and function of microRNA-431 (miR-431) in lung cancer, and to investigate the underlying mechanism in regulating the development of lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real- time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to measure the relative expression level of miR-431 in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays were employed to measure the proliferative ability of lung cancer cells. Meanwhile, transwell assay was recruited to detect the invasive and migratory abilities of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was designed to verify the target gene of miR- 431. Western blot assay was used to gauge the protein level of DDX5 (DEAD box polypeptide 5). RESULTS: MiR-431 expression was significantly lower in 122 lung cancer tissue samples or cell lines compared to the adjacent normal tissues or lung bronchial epithelial cell line, respectively. Over-expression of miR-431 significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion and migration of A549 cells. Down-regulation of miR-431 accelerated cell growth and metastasis of H1650 cells. DDX5 was proved to be a direct target for miR- 431 in lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-431 expression decreased in lung cancer tissues and cells. MiR-431 suppressed proliferation, invasion and migration of lung cancer cells via inhibiting the expression of DDX5. Our study might provide a novel target for the biological therapy of lung cancer. ? 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

"Effects of mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke patients with etiology of large artery atherosclerosis",2019,"Aims: Atherosclerosis is more prevalent in Asian population. This distinct etiology of stroke might disadvantage Asian patients when applying. mechanical thrombectomy (MT). The purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MT in a cohort of Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke. due to large artery atherosclerosis (LAA). Methods and results: A total of 649 patients treated with MT were included. Patients were classified according to etiology of stroke as LAA and cardioembolism ones. Successful revascularization was defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade ? 2b. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ? 2 at 90 days. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for functional outcomes. The patients with stroke of LAA etiology had significantly higher rate of favorable functional outcome (50.2% vs 36.5%, p <.001) and good collateral (grade of ASITN/SIRI: 2–3) (58.8% versus 43.2%, p <.001), and lower median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) (15.6 versus 18.2, p <.001), compared to patients with stroke of cardioembolism etiology. There was no significant difference in the rate of successful postprocedural mTICI between groups (84.5% versus 83.2%, p =.671). Rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (20.0% versus 11.7%, p =.004) and mortality (31.8% versus 18.8%, p <.001) within 3 months were notably higher in the cardioembolism group than that in the LAA group. Conclusion: Mechanical thrombectomy may be more efficacious in treating acute ischemic stroke of LAA etiology than that of cardioembolism etiology. ? 2018","alteplase; tirofiban; adult; aged; Article; blood clot lysis; brain atherosclerosis; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cardioembolic stroke; Chinese; cohort analysis; collateral circulation; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; mechanical thrombectomy; middle aged; mortality; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; patient safety; priority journal; Rankin scale; revascularization; scoring system; stroke patient; thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade; treatment outcome; atherosclerosis; blood pressure; cerebrovascular accident; complication; follow up; middle cerebral artery; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; procedures; statistical model; thrombectomy; Aged; Atherosclerosis; Blood Pressure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Cerebral Artery; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Stroke; Thrombectomy"
"Comparison between free-hand and O-arm-based navigated posterior lumbar interbody fusion in elderly cohorts with three-level lumbar degenerative disease",2019,"Purpose: This retrospective cohort study aims to evaluate the effects of introducing the O-arm-based navigation technique into the traditional posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) procedure treating elderly patients with three-level lumbar degenerative diseases. Methods: Forty-one consecutive elderly patients were enrolled according to the criteria. There were 21 patients in the free-hand group and 20 patients in the O-arm group. Both two groups underwent the PLIF with or without the O-arm-based navigation technique. The demographic features, clinical data and outcomes, and radiological information were collected for further analysis. Results: The average follow-up time was 18.3 (range, 12–28) months in the free-hand group and 16.7 (range, 12–24) months in the O-arm group. Comparison between two groups revealed no significant difference regarding demographic features. The operation time took in the navigation group was significantly less than that in the free-hand group (222.55 ± 38.00?mins versus 255.19 ± 40.26 mins, P < 0.05). Both VAS and ODI were improved post-operatively in two groups while comparison between groups showed no difference. The accuracy rate of pedicle screw positioning was 88.7% in the free-hand group to 96.9% in the O-arm group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The O-arm-based navigation is an efficacious auxiliary technique which could significantly improve the accuracy of pedicle screw insertion, especially in cases of patients with complex anatomic degenerative diseases, without sacrificing the feasibility and reliable outcome of traditional PLIF. ? 2018, SICOT aisbl.","aged; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; degenerative disease; demography; discectomy; female; fluoroscopy; follow up; human; length of stay; lumbar disk hernia; lumbar spine; male; operation duration; Oswestry Disability Index; posterior lumbar interbody fusion; postoperative complication; priority journal; retrospective study; spine radiography; spondylolisthesis; transfusion; vertebral canal stenosis; very elderly"

Here, we investigated the expression of a family of collagen-modifying enzymes, procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenases 1, 2, and 3 (PLOD1/2/3), in ccRCC tissues and assessed the prognostic value of wild-type and genetically mutated PLOD1/2/3 for ccRCC patients. Normal kidney and ccRCC mRNA and protein expression datasets were obtained from Oncomine, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Human Protein Atlas databases. Associations between PLOD1/2/3 expression, clinicopathological variables, and patient survival were evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. PLOD1/2/3 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly elevated in ccRCC tissues compared with normal kidney. Increased PLOD1/2/3 mRNA expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, high pathological grade, and shorter progression-free and overall survival (all p < 0.01). Genetic mutation of PLOD1/2/3 was present in ~3% of ccRCC patients and was associated with significantly poorer prognosis compared with expression of wild-type PLOD1/2/3 (p < 0.001). This study thus identifies tumor expression of wild-type or mutated PLOD1/2/3 mRNA as a potential predictive biomarker for ccRCC patients and sheds light on the underlying molecular pathogenesis of ccRCC. ?

"Systolic blood pressure trajectories in the acute phase and clinical outcomes in 2-year follow-up among patients with ischemic stroke",2019,"BACKGROUND Optimal blood pressure (BP) levels during acute ischemic stroke have not been established. We studied associations between systolic BP trajectories during acute phase and subsequent clinical outcomes among patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS A total of 4,036 patients with acute ischemic stroke and elevated BP from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke trial were included in this analysis. Three BPs were measured every 2 hours in day 1, every 4 hours during days 2 and 3, and every 8 hours thereafter until hospital discharge or death. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 3, 12, and 24 months. Latent variable mixture modeling was used to identify subgroups that share a similar underlying trajectory of systolic BP during the first 7 days after stroke onset. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between systolic BP trajectories and clinical outcomes during follow-up. RESULTS We identified 5 systolic BP trajectories of high, high-to-moderate-low, moderate-high, moderate-low, and low. Compared to participants in high trajectory, multiple-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of all-cause mortality at 3 months for individuals in highto-moderate-low, moderate-high, moderate-low, and low were 0.34 (0.15-0.77), 0.58 (0.32-1.04), 0.29 (0.15-0.56), and 0.56 (0.26-1.19), respectively. Likewise, the corresponding hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in 24 months were 0.66 (0.44-1.00), 0.74 (0.53-1.05), 0.45 (0.32-0.66), and 0.61 (0.40-0.93), respectively. Similar associations were observed for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular disease, and in both the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSIONS Patients with moderate-low systolic BP during acute ischemic stroke had a lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes. ? 2018 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

"The influence of maternal body mass index, maternal diabetes mellitus, and maternal smoking during pregnancy on the risk of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus in the offspring: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies",2019,"There is emerging evidence that events occurring before and shortly after birth may be important in determining the risk of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We aimed to summarize and synthesize the associations between maternal body mass index (BMI), maternal diabetes mellitus (DM), and maternal smoking during pregnancy and the risk of childhood-onset T1DM in the offspring by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. A random effects model was used to generate the summary risk estimates. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant observational studies. Twenty one observational studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Compared with offspring of mothers with normal weight, offspring of women with overweight or obesity were at an increased risk of developing childhood-onset T1DM (overweight: relative risk [RR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.15; obesity: RR 1.25, 95% CI, 1.16-1.34; per 5?kg?m?2 increase in BMI: RR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.06-1.13). No association was found for maternal underweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.75-1.13). Maternal DM was associated with an increased risk of childhood-onset T1DM (RR 3.26, 95% CI, 2.84-3.74). Regarding the type of maternal DM, the greatest risk of T1DM in the offspring appeared to be conferred by maternal T1DM (RR 4.46, 95% CI, 2.89-6.89), followed by maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (RR 1.66, 95% CI, 1.16-2.36), and lastly by maternal type 2 diabetes mellitus (RR 1.11, 95% CI, 0.69-1.80). Additional analysis of studies comparing maternal versus paternal T1DM within the same population revealed that offspring of fathers with T1DM had a 1.5 times higher risk of developing childhood-onset T1DM than offspring of mothers with T1DM (RR 9.58, 95% CI, 6.33-14.48 vs. RR 6.24, 95% CI, 5.52-7.07). Furthermore, a reduced risk of childhood-onset T1DM was observed in infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy compared with infants born to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy (RR 0.79, 95% CI, 0.71-0.87). In summary, our findings add further evidence that early-life events or environmental factors may play a role in modulating infants' risk of developing T1DM later in life. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","Article; body mass; body weight; childhood disease; comparative study; disease association; environmental factor; high risk population; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; maternal diabetes mellitus; maternal obesity; maternal smoking; Medline; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; onset age; population; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; progeny; quality control; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; underweight; Web of Science"
"LncRNA CASC11 promotes the cervical cancer progression by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway",2019,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that cancer susceptibility candidate 11 (CASC11), a newly discovered long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was aberrantly overexpressed in hepatic carcinoma, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. However, its effects on cervical cancer has been kept unknown up to now. The present study was aimed to investigate the relationship between lncRNA CASC11 and cervical cancer and further explore the mechanism of CASC11 effect on cervical cancer progression. MATERIALS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expressions of CASC11 in cancerous and adjacent normal tissues of patients with cervical cancer as well as in cell lines. The proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were assayed after transfecting the cell with si-CASC11 or pcDNA3.1-CASC11. TOP/FOP-Flash luciferase reporter assay and western blot were used to analysis the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Si-CASC11-transfected HeLa cells were subcutaneously inoculated into male athymic (nude) mice to investigate the effect of CASC11 on the tumor formation. RESULTS: We discovered that CASC11, the expression of which was positively associated with the tumor size and the FIGO staging and negatively related to the patients' survival rate, was up-regulated in the cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Silencing CASC11 inhibited the proliferation, migration as well as invasion and promoted the cell apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of CASC11 facilitated the cancer cell's proliferation, migration and invasion ability and suppressed the apoptosis. Further study showed that CASC11 promoted the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and silencing CASC11 inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that CASC11 promoted the cervical cancer progression by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway for the first time, which provides a new target or a potential diagnostic biomarker of the treatment for cervical cancer.","beta catenin; microRNA; animal; apoptosis; cell proliferation; complication; disease exacerbation; female; flow cytometry; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; human; mouse; papillomavirus infection; pathology; uterine cervix tumor; virology; Wnt signaling; Animals; Apoptosis; beta Catenin; Cell Proliferation; Disease Progression; Female; Flow Cytometry; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mice; MicroRNAs; Papillomavirus Infections; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Wnt Signaling Pathway"
"LncSNHG14 promotes the development and progression of bladder cancer by targeting miRNA-150-5p",2019,"OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether lncSNHG14 could influence the proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of bladder cancer cells via binding to microRNA-150-5p (miR-NA-150-5p). We aim to investigate the potential mechanism of miRNA-150-5p in the occurrence and progression of bladder cancer (BCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression levels of SNHG14 and miRNA-150-5p in BCa tissues and normal bladder tissues were determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Their expressions in BCa cell lines were detected as well. Regulatory effects of NHG14 and miRNA-150-5p on proliferative potential and cell cycle progression were evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry, respectively. Through the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, binding conditions between SNHG14 and miRNA-150-5p, as well as between miRNA-150-5p and synaptic vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), were verified. Finally, rescue experiments were performed to clarify whether SNHG14 regulated behaviors of BCa cells by absorbing miRNA-150-5p to degrade VAMP2. RESULTS: SNHG14 was highly expressed in BCa tissues and cell lines. The overexpression of SNHG14 accelerated the proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of BCa cells. SNHG14 was confirmed to bind to miRNA-150-5p. MiRNA-150-5p remained a low expression in BCa tissues. Moreover, miRNA-150-5p overexpression suppressed proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of BCa cells, which could reverse the promotive role of SNHG14 on behaviors of BCa cells. Furthermore, VAMP2 was the target gene of miRNA-150-5p. VAMP2 overexpression reversed the biological function of miRNA-150-5p in inhibiting proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of T24 and UC9 cells. CONCLUSIONS: LncSNHG14 overexpression accelerates proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of BCa cells through absorbing miRNA-150-5p to degrade VAMP2 expression. ? 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

"The safety of triple antiplatelet therapy under thromboelastography guidance in patients undergoing stenting for ischemic cerebrovascular disease",2019,"Objective To investigate the safety of triple antiplatelet therapy (TAT) with cilostazol in patients undergoing stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis. Methods A prospectively collected database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis and showed resistance to aspirin and/or clopidogrel as assessed by pre-stenting thromboelastography (TEG) testing. Patients were assigned to a TAT group and a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) group. Major complications were defined as thromboembolic events (transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, and stent thrombosis) or major bleeding events within 30 days, and minor complications were defined as extracranial bleeding that did not require vascular surgery or transfusion within 30 days. Results A total of 183 patients were identified. The incidence of major complications was significantly lower in the TAT group than in the DAT group (TAT group vs. DAT group, 1/110 vs. 6/73; P=0.017). TIAs occurred in four patients, with one in the TAT group and three in the DAT group (1/110 vs. 3/73; P=0.303). Ischemic strokes occurred in three patients in the DAT group (TAT group vs. DAT group, P=0.062). No major bleeding events or stent thrombosis was recorded in either group. Two patients (one in each group) experienced minor complications that resolved without additional treatment (1/110 vs. 1/73; P>0.999). Conclusions TAT under TEG guidance appears to be a safe antiplatelet strategy in patients undergoing stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis. By employing TAT under TEG guidance, favorable outcomes can be achieved in these patients. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"High expression of PQBP1 and low expression of PCK2 are associated with metastasis and recurrence of osteosarcoma and unfavorable survival outcomes of the patients",2019,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy, predominately affecting children and adolescents. Due to the introduction of chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate of OS patients has dramatically improved to 60–70%. Unfortunately, OS patients with recurrence or metastatic disease have less than a 20% chance of long-term survival, despite aggressive therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify gene expression patterns associated with metastasis and recurrence in order to identify potential biomarkers with prognostic power. We found that high expression of polyglutamine tract-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) and low expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) were related to a high probability of recurrence and metastasis in OS patients and also predicted shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) after adjustment for other clinical variables. Prediction models based on the combination of PQBP1 and PCK2 expression had good and robust predictive power for recurrence and metastasis. A PQBP1 and PCK2-centered protein interaction network was built, and the hypothetical regulatory path between them was identified and termed the PQBP1-SF3A2-UBA52-PCK2 axis. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that aberrations of metabolism might play an important role in recurrence and metastasis in OS patients. Accordingly, PQBP1 and PCK2 are crucial for recurrence and metastasis in OS, and these findings provide a molecular basis for the exploitation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for overcoming recurrence and metastasis in OS. ?

"Risk Factors for Severe Community-aquired Pneumonia among Children Hospitalized with CAP Younger Than 5 Years of Age",2019,"Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) causes great morbidity and mortality as well as enormous economic burden worldwide. This study intended to describe the clinical characteristics of CAP and explore the risk factors of severe CAP among children in downtown Suzhou, China. Methods: This was a retrospective study of childhood hospitalizations in Soochow University Affiliated Children's Hospital from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. Children who were residents of downtown Suzhou, 29 days to < 5 years of age, with discharge diagnosis codes J09 to J18 and J20 to J22 were included. Medical charts and chest radiograph reports were reviewed for included children to collect clinical information. CAP with intensive care unit (ICU) admission and poor clinical outcome were categorized as severe CAP. Results: A total of 28,043 children were identified with CAP; 17,501 (62.4%) of these children were male, and 20,747 (74.0%) children were less than 2 years of age. The common clinical symptoms at admission were cough (94.8%), fever (52.9%), wheezing (37.7%) and respiratory distress (9.5%). In total, 21,898 (78.1%) children had radiologic evidence of pneumonia, and 1,403 (5.0%) children developed at least 1 complication. Multivariate regression analysis showed that younger age, congenital heart disease and abnormal white blood cells, and C-reactive protein results were independent risk factors for both ICU admission and poor clinical outcome (odds ratio [OR] > 1 for all). Respiratory distress symptoms at admission (OR = 12.10) greatly increased the risk for ICU admission, while ICU admission (OR = 8.87) and complications (OR = 2.55) increased the risk of poor outcome. However, cough was a protective factor for ICU admission, so were wheezing, antibiotic and antiviral therapies for clinical failure. Conclusion: Pediatric CAP hospitalizations of those of younger age, with congenital heart diseases, respiratory distress symptoms/tachypnea, abnormal white blood cells and C-reactive protein results as well as complications were at higher risk for progressing to severe CAP. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Early ERP components to emotional facial expressions in young adult victims of childhood maltreatment",2019,"The ability to appropriately recognize the facial expression of emotions is essential for the development of adaptive functioning. Studies suggest that maltreated children are hypersensitive to expression of anger. However, the neural mechanism of emotional face processing in young adults with a history of childhood maltreatment has yet to be explored. To explore whether the history of childhood maltreatment has a potential relationship with processing of emotional facial expressions, the present study used event-related potentials in investigating the early ERP components (P100 and N170) to the processing of emotional (angry, fearful, disgusted, and happy) faces in young adult victims of childhood maltreatment. Seventeen young adults with a history of childhood maltreatment and seventeen age and gender-matched non-maltreated participants performed a modified dot-probe task, using emotional faces paired with neutral faces. Results revealed no significant differences between maltreated group and non-maltreated group in P100 amplitude, but the N170 amplitude in the maltreated group was larger than non-maltreated group when processing angry, fearful, and happy faces. As such, this study provides biological evidence of altered neural processing of emotional facial expressions in young adults with a history of childhood maltreatment. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; age; amplitude modulation; angry; Article; child abuse; cognitive function test; controlled study; disgust; emotion; emotionality; event related potential; facial expression; fear; female; happy; human; major clinical study; male; modified dot probe task; nervous system function; neural processing; priority journal; sex difference; victim; anger; child; electroencephalography; evoked response; happiness; physiology; young adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Anger; Child; Child Abuse; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Evoked Potentials; Facial Expression; Fear; Female; Happiness; Humans; Male; Young Adult"
"Lycorine inhibits melanoma cell migration and metastasis mainly through reducing intracellular levels of β-catenin and matrix metallopeptidase 9",2019,"Metastatic melanoma accounts for 60% of death for skin cancer. Although great efforts have been made to treat the disease, effective drugs against metastatic melanoma still lack at the clinical setting. In the current study, we found that lycorine, a small molecule of isoquinoline alkaloid, significantly suppressed melanoma cell migration and invasion in vitro, and decreased the metastasis of melanoma cells to lung tissues in tumor-bearing mice, resulting in significant prolongation of the survival of the mice without obvious toxicity. Molecular mechanistic studies revealed that lycorine significantly reduced intracellular levels of β-catenin protein through degradation of the protein via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, and decreased the expression of β-catenin downstream prometastatic matrix metallopeptidase 9 and Axin2 genes. Collectively, our findings support the notion that targeting the oncogenic β-catenin by lycorine is a new option to inhibit melanoma cell metastasis, providing a good drug candidate potential for development novel therapeutics against metastatic melanoma. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","axin2 protein; beta catenin; gelatinase B; lycorine; proteasome; protein; ubiquitin; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; C8161 cell line; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; female; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung metastasis; melanoma; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; survival time"

"The renal protection of flavonoid-rich ethanolic extract from silkworm green cocoon involves in inhibiting TNF-α-p38 MAP kinase signalling pathway in type 2 diabetic mice",2019,"Background: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major complications of diabetes. Sericin and flavonoids are two bioactive substances which have been demonstrated to have some therapeutical effect on diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of ethanolic extract (EE) rich in quercetin and kaempferol and their glucosides from the green cocoon of silkworm Bombyx mori on DN in type 2 diabetic (T2D) mice induced by high-fat and streptozotocin (STZ). Methods: Ethanolic extract from the green cocoon shell of silkworm Bombyx mori was used as material. Diabetic mice were orally treated with three doses (150, 250 and 350 mg/kg) of the extract for 7 weeks, then the levels of oxidases and related inflammatory factors were measured in kidneys. Results: Compared with the negative control, EE administration resulted in an evident reduction in blood glucose levels and an improvement of the body weight in diabetic mice. Oral EE could inhibit the expressions of renal tumour necrosis factor TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), fibronectin (FN) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in T2D mice. Moreover, the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) were significantly elevated in T2D mice treated with EE. Conclusions: The activities of anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammation contributed to the renal protective effects by reducing oxidative stress, which might be mediated by the inhibition of the TNF-α-p38 MAP kinase signalling pathway. It is suggested that the ethanolic extract from silkworm green cocoon might be potential as an herbal medicine for DN. ? 2019 The Authors","astragalin; fibronectin; flavonoid; glutathione peroxidase; kaempferol; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; probiotic agent; protective agent; quercetin; quercetin 3 o galactopyranoside; rutoside; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; alcohol; antioxidant; autacoid; fibronectin; flavonoid; plant extract; protective agent; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Bombyx mori; comparative study; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; fasting; glucose blood level; histopathology; kidney fibrosis; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; quantitative analysis; renal protection; signal transduction; animal; blood; body weight; Bombyx; chemistry; diet restriction; drug effect; enzymology; experimental diabetes mellitus; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; kidney; MAPK signaling; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oral drug administration; pathology; Administration, Oral; Animals; Antioxidants; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Bombyx; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Ethanol; Fasting; Fibronectins; Flavonoids; Inflammation Mediators; Kidney; Male; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice, Inbred ICR; Plant Extracts; Protective Agents; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
"Evaluation of renal dysfunction using texture analysis based on DWI, BOLD, and susceptibility-weighted imaging",2019,"Objective: To explore the value of texture analysis based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), blood oxygen level–dependent MRI (BOLD), and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in evaluating renal dysfunction. Methods: Seventy-two patients (mean age 53.72 ± 13.46?years) underwent MRI consisting of DWI, BOLD, and SWI. According to their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the patients were classified into either severe renal function impairment (sRI, eGFR &lt; 30?mL/min/1.73?m 2 ), non-severe renal function impairment (non-sRI, eGFR ? 30?mL/min/1.73?m 2 , and &lt; 80?mL/min/1.73?m 2 ), or control (CG, eGFR ? 80?mL/min/1.73?m 2 ) groups. Thirteen texture features were extracted and then were analyzed to select the most valuable for discerning the three groups with each imaging method. A ROC curve was performed to compare the capacities of the features to differentiate non-sRI from sRI or CG. Results: Six features proved to be the most valuable for assessing renal dysfunction: 0.25Quantile DWI , 0.5Quantile DWI , Homogeneity DWI , Entropy BOLD , Skewness SWI , and Correlation SWI . Three features derived from DWI (0.25Quantile DWI , 0.5Quantile DWI , and Homogeneity DWI ) were smaller in sRI than in non-sRI; Entropy BOLD and Correlation SWI were smaller in non-sRI than in CG (p &lt; 0.05). 0.25Quantile DWI , 0.5Quantile DWI , and Homogeneity DWI showed similar capacities for differentiating sRI from non-sRI. Similarly, Entropy BOLD and Correlation SWI showed equal capacities for differentiating non-sRI from CG. Conclusion: Texture analysis based on DWI, BOLD, and SWI can assist in assessing renal dysfunction, and texture features based on BOLD and SWI may be suitable for assessing renal dysfunction during early stages. Key Points: ? Texture analysis based on MRI techniques allowed for assessing renal dysfunction. ? Texture features based on BOLD and SWI, but not DWI, may be suitable for assessing renal function impairment during early stages. ? SWI exhibited a similar capacity to BOLD for assessing renal dysfunction. ? 2018, European Society of Radiology.","albumin; creatinine; nitrogen; urea; oxygen; adult; aged; Article; BOLD signal; creatinine blood level; diffusion weighted imaging; entropy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; evaluation study; female; human; image analysis; image artifact; image processing; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; major clinical study; male; priority journal; retrospective study; susceptibility weighted imaging; urea nitrogen blood level; blood; chronic kidney failure; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; glomerulus filtration rate; kidney; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; Adult; Aged; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve"
"Selenium Levels in Community Dwellers with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",2019,"Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient required by the human body and exerts biological functions through selenoproteins. The relationship between Se and diabetes remains ambiguous. This study aimed at, through measurements of serum selenoprotein P (SelP), glutathione peroxidase (GPx3), and Se content?in serum and hair, evaluating Se levels in community dwellers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 336 subjects, including 176 T2DM patients (65.5 ± 8.7?years old) and 160 healthy residents (63.7 ± 9.8?years old, as controls), were recruited in this cross-sectional community-based study performed in Suzhou. Samples of fasting venous blood and hair were collected for measurements of Se levels, glycometabolism, and biochemistry parameters. We found that the serum Se level and SelP concentration in T2DM patients were substantially higher than those in healthy residents (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in GPx3 activity and hair Se level between the two groups of subjects (p > 0.05). Serum Se was positively correlated with both GPx3 and hair Se in T2DM patients (r = 0.167 and 0.164, respectively, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with SelP in healthy controls (r = ? 0.293, p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study showed significantly higher levels of serum Se and SelP in community dwellers with T2DM than in matched healthy residents. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","glutathione peroxidase; selenium; selenoprotein P; glutathione peroxidase; selenium; selenoprotein P; aged; Article; community dwelling person; controlled study; cross-sectional study; fasting; female; hair level; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; protein blood level; selenium blood level; blood; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glutathione Peroxidase; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Selenium; Selenoprotein P"
"Fatty acid 2-hydroxylation inhibits tumor growth and increases sensitivity to cisplatin in gastric cancer",2019,"Background: Most gastric cancers are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage with poor prognosis and survival rate. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) with high expression in stomach generates chiral (R)-2-hydroxy FAs ((R)-2-OHFAs) and regulates glucose utilization which is important for cell proliferation and invasiveness. We hypothesized that FA2H impacts gastric tumor growth and could represent a novel target to improve gastric cancer therapy. Methods: FA2H level in 117 human gastric tumors and its association with tumor growth, metastasis and overall survival were examined. Its roles and potential mechanisms in regulating tumor growth were studied by genetic and pharmacological manipulation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Findings: FA2H level was lower in gastric tumor tissues as compared to surrounding tissues and associated with clinicopathologic status of patients, which were confirmed by analyses of multiple published datasets. FA2H depletion decreased tumor chemosensitivity, partially due to inhibition of AMPK and activation of the mTOR/S6K1/Gli1 pathway. Conversely, FA2H overexpression or treatment with (R)-2-OHFAs had the opposite effects. In line with these in vitro observations, FA2H knockdown promoted tumor growth with increased level of tumor Gli1 in vivo. Moreover, (R)-2-OHFA treatment significantly decreased Gli1 level in gastric tumors and enhanced tumor chemosensitivity to cisplatin, while alleviating the chemotherapy-induced weight loss in mice. Interpretation: Our results demonstrate that FA2H plays an important role in regulating Hh signaling and gastric tumor growth and suggest that (R)-2-OHFAs could be effective as nontoxic wide-spectrum drugs to promote chemosensitivity.

"Integrated analyses of microRNA-29 family and the related combination biomarkers demonstrate their widespread influence on risk, recurrence, metastasis and survival outcome in colorectal cancer",2019,"Background: Emerging evidence has revealed miR-29 family as promising biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC), but their biomarker potential and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate the biomarker performance of individual miR-29 and the related miRNA combination biomarkers. Meanwhile, we conducted an integrative bioinformatics analysis to unfold the underlying biological function of miR-29 and their relationship with CRC. Results: Using miR-29 expression to diagnose CRC produced 0.82 area under the curve, 70% sensitivity and 81% specificity while the combination biomarkers based on miR-29 enhanced the diagnostic power with an AUC of 0.86, a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 91%. For the prognosis evaluation, patients with higher expression of miR-29 had better survival outcome (pooled HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.56-1.07). In addition, miR-29 has also been identified as potential biomarker for predicting recurrence and metastasis in CRC. Then the genes regulated by the miR-29 family were retrieved and found closely associated with the molecular pathogenesis of CRC according to the gene ontology and pathway analysis. Furthermore, hub nodes and significant modules were identified from the protein-protein interaction network constructed with miR-29 family targets, which were also confirmed highly involved in the establishment and development of CRC. Conclusions: Current evidences suggest miR-29 family may become promising biomarkers for risk, recurrence, metastasis and survival outcome of CRC. Meanwhile our data highlight the potential clinical use of miRNA combination biomarkers. Nevertheless, further prospective studies are warranted before the application of the useful biomarkers in the clinical. ? 2019 The Author(s).","microRNA 29; tumor marker; Article; bioinformatics; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer survival; colorectal cancer; diagnostic value; gene control; gene ontology; human; meta analysis; metastasis; molecular pathology; mRNA expression level; protein protein interaction; receiver operating characteristic; RNA analysis; sensitivity and specificity; signal transduction; systematic review"
"Promoter methylation changes and vascular dysfunction in pre-eclamptic umbilical vein",2019,"Background: Hypertension is one of primary clinical presentations of pre-eclampsia. The occurrence and progress of hypertension are closely related to vascular dysfunction. However, information is limited regarding the pathological changes of vascular functions in pre-eclamptic fetuses. Human umbilical cord vein was used to investigate the influence of pre-eclampsia on fetal blood vessels in this study. Results: The present study found that the vasoconstriction responses to arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) were attenuated in the pre-eclamptic umbilical vein as compared to in normal pregnancy, which was related to the downregulated AVP receptor 1a (AVPR1a), OXT receptor (OXTR), and protein kinase C isoform β (PKCβ), owing to the deactivated gene transcription, respectively. The deactivated AVPR1a, OXTR, and PKCB gene transcription were respectively linked with an increased DNA methylation within the gene promoter. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study first revealed that a hyper-methylation in gene promoter, leading to relatively reduced patterns of AVPR1a, OXTR, and PKCB expressions, which was responsible for the decreased sensitivity to AVP and OXT in the umbilical vein under conditions of pre-eclampsia. The data offered new and important information for further understanding the pathological features caused by pre-eclampsia in the fetal vascular system, as well as roles of epigenetic-mediated gene expression in umbilical vascular dysfunction. ? 2019 The Author(s).","argipressin receptor; oxytocin receptor; protein kinase C; protein kinase C isoform beta; unclassified drug; adult; Article; AVPR1a gene; clinical article; controlled study; DNA methylation; female; gene expression; gene location; genetic transcription; human; OXTR gene; PKCB gene gene; preeclampsia; pregnancy; priority journal; receptor down regulation; renovascular disease; umbilical cord; umbilical vein; vasoconstriction"
"Circular RNA CircCACTIN Promotes Gastric Cancer Progression by Sponging MiR-331-3p and Regulating TGFBR1 Expression",2019,"Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of RNAs that play a significant role in regulating gene expression and biological function. However, the expression profile and function of circRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) remain mostly uncertain. In the present study, we researched the expression profile of circRNAs in human GC tissues and explored the role of circCACTIN (hsa_circ_0092303). Methods: Circular RNA microarray assays were performed to detect circular RNA expression profiles of GC and circCACTIN was identified for further investigation. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of circCACTIN, miR-331-3p and TGFBR1 in GC specimens and cell lines. CircCACTIN was stably silenced and overexpressed in GC cells, and cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as tumorigenesis in nude mice were performed to assess the effect of circCACTIN on GC. Results: CircCACTIN expression was obviously up-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of circCACTIN inhibited GC cells proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT. Enforced-expression of circCACTIN promoted GC cells migration, invasion and EMT, but had no effect on GC cells proliferation. Moreover, in vivo experiments, circCACTIN up-regulation promoted GC tumor growth and EMT, and circCACTIN down-regulation inhibited GC tumor growth and EMT. Binding interactions were detected between circCACTIN and miR-331-3p, and between miR-331-3p and TGFBR1 by Dual-luciferase reporter assays. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circCACTIN promoted gastric cancer progression by sponging miRNA-331-3p and regulating TGFBR1 mRNA expression. Conclusion: The circCACTIN/miR-331-3p/TGFBR1 axis affected the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of GC through the mechanism of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA). Furthermore, our results identified circCACTIN as a novel oncogenic circRNA in GC.",""
"Vitamin D protects against particles-caused lung injury through induction of autophagy in an Nrf2-dependent manner",2019,"Fine particulate matter is a well-known air pollutant threatening public health. Studies have confirmed long-term exposure to the particles could decrease the pulmonary function, induce asthma exacerbation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as increase the incidence and mortality of lung cancer. A clinical study has explored that the prevalence and risks of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in various chronic disease and toxins induced tissue damage. Our current study aimed to explore the mechanism and further therapeutic potential of VD administration to ameliorate fine particles exposure induced pulmonary damage in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the effects and mechanisms of VD in particles-induced pulmonary damage, a murine model was established with fine particles intratracheal instillation along with VD intramuscular injection. Our study demonstrated that treatment with VD attenuated particles-induced pulmonary damage and promoted tissue repair by repressing of TGFβ1 signaling pathway and upregulation of MMP9 expression. VD treatment could also regulate the autophagy-related signals along with activation of Nrf2 transcription factor. Furthermore, the results from the in vitro study demonstrated that VD protected against particles-induced cells' damage through the induction of autophagy in an Nrf2-dependent manner. VD treatment caused the degradation of P62 and its bound Keap1, which decreased the Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing its protein stability. Our work explored a novel potential mechanism in the protection of VD in particles-induced pulmonary injury and tissue repair, and could further bring insights into exploring antifine particles exposure caused inflammation among other natural products and contributes to inflammation disease medical therapies. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Biological organs; Pathology; Pulmonary diseases; Repair; Tissue; Vitamins; Autophagy; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Fine particulate matter; Intramuscular injections; Intratracheal instillation; Potential mechanism; Therapeutic potentials; Vitamin-D; Disease control; calcitriol; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; lc3 protein; protein; sequestosome 1; silicon dioxide; synaptotagmin I; transcription factor Nrf2; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; gelatinase B; NFE2L2 protein, human; Nfe2l2 protein, mouse; transcription factor Nrf2; transforming growth factor beta1; vitamin D; asthma; atmospheric pollution; cancer; disease incidence; disease prevalence; gene expression; health risk; induced response; injury; mortality; particulate matter; protein; public health; vitamin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autophagy; cell infiltration; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytokine release; drug mechanism; human; human cell; lung epithelium; lung injury; lung parenchyma; lymphocyte; macrophage; male; mouse; mRNA expression level; neutrophil; nonhuman; particulate matter; pneumonia; priority journal; protein degradation; protein stability; signal transduction; THP-1 cell line; tissue repair; ubiquitination; upregulation; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin supplementation; air pollutant; animal; autophagy; chemically induced; drug effect; genetics; lung injury; metabolism; particulate matter; pathology; toxicity; Murinae; Air Pollutants; Animals; Autophagy; Humans; Lung Injury; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Particulate Matter; Signal Transduction; THP-1 Cells; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Ubiquitination; Up-Regulation; Vitamin D"
"Reactive Oxygen Species–Activatable Liposomes Regulating Hypoxic Tumor Microenvironment for Synergistic Photo/Chemodynamic Therapies",2019,"Tumors have adapted various cellular antidotes and microenvironmental conditions to subsist against photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Here, the development of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activatable liposomes (RALP) for therapeutic enhancement by simultaneously addressing the critical questions in PDT and CDT is reported. The design of RALP@HOC@Fe3O4 features ROS-cleavable linker molecules for improved tumor penetration/uptake and ondemand cargo releasing, and integration of Fe3O4 and an oxaliplatin prodrug for smart regulation of hypoxia tumor microenvironment. Glutathione stored by the tumor cells is consumed by the prodrug to produce highly toxic oxaliplatin. Depletion of glutathione not only avoids the undesired annihilation of ROS in PDT, but also modulates the chemical specie equilibria in tumors for H2O2 promotion, leading to greatly relieved tumor hypoxia and PDT enhancement. Synergistically, Fe (II) in the hybrid RALP formulation can be fuelled by H2O2 to generate ?OH in the Fenton reaction, thus elevating CDT efficiency. This work offers a strategy for harnessing smart, responsive, and biocompatible liposomes to enhance PDT and CDT by regulating tumor microenvironment, highlighting a potential clinical translation beneficial to patients with cancer. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Prevalence of amblyopia and strabismus in Hani school children in rural southwest China: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Purpose To determine the prevalence rate of amblyopia and strabismus in Chinese Hani ethnic school-aged children. Methods All grade 1 and grade 7 students in Mojiang Hani Autonomous County, located in southwest China, were invited for comprehensive eye examinations performed by experienced ophthalmologists and optometrists, including visual acuity, ocular alignment and movements, cycloplegic autorefraction, anterior segment and fundus examinations. Standard definitions of amblyopia and strabismus were applied to calculate their prevalence rate. Results A total of 1656 (91.0% response rate) grade 1 Hani students and 1394 (92.8% response rate) grade 7 Hani students participated in the study. Amblyopia was present in 25 Hani students (0.82%, 95% CI 0.55% to 1.20%), with no significant differences in grade (p=0.42) and gender (p=0.69). Among these 25 amblyopic children, 17 had unilateral amblyopia and eight had bilateral amblyopia, including 16 anisometropic, eight binocular refractive and one strabismic. Strabismus was found in 59 Hani students (1.93%, 95% CI 1.50% to 2.48%), including 47 with intermittent exotropia, six with constant exotropia, five with constant esotropia and one with unilateral superior oblique palsy. The prevalence rate of strabismus was higher in grade 7 students than grade 1 students with borderline significance (2.44%vs1.50%, p=0.07), but was similar by gender (2.16% in boys vs 1.68% in girls, p=0.36). Conclusion The prevalence of amblyopia and strabismus in Chinese Hani school children are both lower than that previously reported for Chinese Han children in China and for many other racial/ethnic populations from non-China studies. Refractive error is the major cause for amblyopia and intermittent exotropia is the primary strabismus type. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"Mechanisms and roles of mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases",2019,"Mitochondria are double-membrane-encircled organelles existing in most eukaryotic cells and playing important roles in energy production, metabolism, Ca2+ buffering, and cell signaling. Mitophagy is the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy. Mitophagy can effectively remove damaged or stressed mitochondria, which is essential for cellular health. Thanks to the implementation of genetics, cell biology, and proteomics approaches, we are beginning to understand the mechanisms of mitophagy, including the roles of ubiquitin-dependent and receptor-dependent signals on damaged mitochondria in triggering mitophagy. Mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitophagy have been broadly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This review is aimed at summarizing the mechanisms of mitophagy in higher organisms and the roles of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Although many studies have been devoted to elucidating the mitophagy process, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms leading to mitophagy defects in neurodegenerative diseases is required for the development of new therapeutic interventions, taking into account the multifactorial nature of diseases and the phenotypic heterogeneity of patients. ? 2019 The Authors.

"One-stage reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects in the hands using multidigit, chimeric, lateral arm, perforator flaps",2019,"Purpose: To describe our experience using microsurgically fabricated, multilobed, chimeric, lateral arm (LA) flaps to reconstruct hand injuries with complex, multidigit, soft tissue defects and to evaluate the morbidity and esthetic and functional outcomes of the donor sites. Methods: We performed a single center, retrospective analysis of 21 patients with hand wounds treated from October 2013 to February 2016. All patients underwent reconstruction using multilobed, chimeric, free, LA flaps. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess donor site morbidity and satisfaction with the esthetic and overall functional result. Outcome measures were the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, static 2-point discrimination score, and visual analogue scale. Results: The study included 21 patients (20 males and 1 female), with an average age of 32.14 years (range 18–45 years), who sustained traumatic injuries in road traffic accidents (n = 2) or industrial devices (n = 19). The average DASH score was 28.25 ± 2.3, the average 2-PD score was 7.20 ± 1.30, and the average visual analogue scale (VAS) was 0.38 ± 0.40. All 21 patients had sensory disorders at the donor site. Postoperative donor site complications comprised wound dehiscence (n = 1) and hematoma (n = 3). The patient-rated satisfaction score for the donor site was 5.40 ± 0.90, and 70% of the patients would undergo the same surgery again. Conclusion: Microsurgical fabrication of multilobed, chimeric, LA flaps can exhibit sensory recovery and minimal pain but may cause hematoma and sensory disorders at the donor site. The flaps are a viable alternative for the reconstruction of complex, multidigit, soft tissue defects of the hands. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; Article; chimeric flap; clinical article; crush trauma; debridement; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); dissection; donor site; female; functional status; hand injury; hematoma; human; lateral arm flap; male; metacarpal bone fracture; microsurgery; middle aged; mobilization; morbidity; multidigit flap; nanofabrication; patient satisfaction; perforator flap; postoperative complication; priority journal; questionnaire; radial nerve; retrospective study; scar; sensory dysfunction; skin nerve; soft tissue defect; tissue flap; traffic accident; visual analog scale; wound dehiscence; young adult; adverse event; convalescence; devices; finger; free tissue graft; hand injury; injury scale; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; procedures; psychology; reconstructive surgery; soft tissue injury; Adult; Female; Fingers; Free Tissue Flaps; Hand Injuries; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Perforator Flap; Postoperative Complications; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Soft Tissue Injuries; Trauma Severity Indices"
"Spatiotemporally Light-Activatable Platinum Nanocomplexes for Selective and Cooperative Cancer Therapy",2019,"Highly efficient nanoarchitectures are of great interest for achieving precise chemotherapy with minimized adverse side effects in cancer therapy. However, a major challenge remains in exploring a rational approach to synthesize spatiotemporally selective vehicles for precise cancer chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate a rational design of bifunctional light-activatable platinum nanocomplexes (PtNCs) that produce dually cooperative cancer therapy through spatiotemporally selective thermo-chemotherapy. The Pt4+-coordinated polycarboxylic nanogel is explored as the nanoreactor template, which is exploited to synthesize bifunctional PtNCs consisting of a zero-valent Pt0 core and a surrounding bivalent Pt2+ shell with tunable ratios through a facile and controllable reduction. Without light exposure, chemotherapeutic Pt2+ ions are tightly bound on the surface of PtNCs, efficiently reducing undesirable drug leakage and nonselective damage on normal tissues/cells. Upon light exposure, PtNCs generate much heat via photothermal conversion from the Pt0 core and simultaneously trigger a rapid release of chemotherapeutic Pt2+ ions, thereby leading to the spatiotemporally light-activatable synergistic effect of thermo-chemotherapy. Moreover, PtNCs show enhanced tumor accumulation through the heat-triggered hydrophilicity hydrophobicity transition upon immediate light exposure after injection, dramatically facilitating in vivo tumor regression through their cooperative anticancer efficiency. This rational design of spatiotemporally activatable nanoparticles provides an insightful tool for precise cancer therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Nanoreactors; Oncology; Tumors; Adverse side effects; Cancer Chemotherapy; Cancer therapy; Nanocomplexes; Photo-thermal conversions; Photothermal therapy; Synergistic effect; Tumor accumulation; Platinum compounds"
"Two-dimensional metal-organic-framework as a unique theranostic nano-platform for nuclear imaging and chemo-photodynamic cancer therapy",2019,"Nanoscale metal organic frameworks (NMOFs) with porous structure and inherent biodegradability are attractive nanomedicine platforms. In addition to conventional particulate NMOFs, two-dimensional (2D) NMOFs are emerging as a unique type of NMOFs which however have been relatively less explored for nanomedicine applications. Herein, 2D-NMOFs composed of Zn2+ and tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) are fabricated and functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Compared to their particulate counterpart, such 2D-NMOFs show greatly increased drug loading capacity and enhanced light-triggered singlet oxygen production, promising for chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT), respectively. Utilizing the porphyrin structure of TCPP, our 2D-NMOFs could be labeled with a diagnostic radioisotope, 99mTc, for single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging, which reveals efficient tumor homing of those 2D-NMOFs upon intravenous injection. While offering a remarkable synergistic in vivo antitumor effect for the combined chemo-PDT, such 2D-NMOFs show efficient biodegradation and rapid renal clearance. Our work presents the great promise of 2D-NMOFs for nanomedicine applications.

"Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase regulates the cross-talk between autophagy and pyroptosis in doxorubicin-treated human melanoma cells in vitro",2019,"Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K), a negative regulator of protein synthesis, has been shown to play an important role in modulating autophagy and apoptosis in tumor cells under various stresses. In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of eEF-2K in pyroptosis (a new form of programmed necrosis) in doxorubicin-treated human melanoma cells. We found that doxorubicin (0.5–5 μmol/L) induced pyroptosis in melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, and A-375 with high expression of DFNA5, but not in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 with little expression of DFNA5. On the other hand, doxorubicin treatment activated autophagy in the melanoma cells; inhibition of autophagy by transfecting the cells with siRNA targeting Beclin1 or by pretreatment with chloroquine (20 μmol/L) significantly augmented pyroptosis, thus sensitizing the melanoma cells to doxorubicin. We further demonstrated that doxorubicin treatment activated eEF-2K in the melanoma cells, and silencing of eEF-2K blunted autophagic responses, but promoted doxorubicin-induced pyroptotic cell death. Taken together, the above results demonstrate that eEF-2K dictates the cross-talk between pyroptosis and autophagy in doxorubicin-treated human melanoma cells; suppression of eEF-2K results in inhibiting autophagy and augmenting pyroptosis, thus modulating the sensitivity of melanoma cells to doxorubicin, suggesting that targeting eEF-2K may reinforce the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin, offering a new insight into tumor chemotherapy. ? 2019, CPS and SIMM.","beclin 1; caspase 3; chloroquine; doxorubicin; elongation factor 2 kinase; lactate dehydrogenase; small interfering RNA; antineoplastic agent; CASP3 protein, human; caspase 3; doxorubicin; EEF2K protein, human; elongation factor 2 kinase; estrogen receptor; GSDME protein, human; MAP1LC3B protein, human; microtubule associated protein; A-375 cell line; Article; autophagy; cancer chemotherapy; cell viability; controlled study; drug efficacy; gene silencing; human; human cell; in vitro study; MCF-7 cell line; melanoma; protein expression; pyroptosis; regulatory mechanism; SK-MEL-28 cell line; SK-MEL-5 cell line; Western blotting; autophagy; drug effect; melanoma; metabolism; physiology; pyroptosis; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Autophagy; Caspase 3; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin; Elongation Factor 2 Kinase; Humans; Melanoma; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Pyroptosis; Receptors, Estrogen"
"Inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase 1 ameliorates alzheimer-like pathology in APP/PS1 transgenic mice through promoting lysosomal degradation of BACE1",2019,"Sphingolipids emerge as essential modulators in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with unclear mechanisms. Elevated levels of SM synthase 1 (SMS1), which catalyzes the synthesis of SM from ceramide and phosphatidylcholine, have been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a rate limiting enzyme in amyloid-β (Aβ) generation, are upregulated. In the present study, we show knockdown of SMS1 via andeno associated virus (serotype 8, AAV8) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, attenuates the densities of Aβ plaques, neuroinflammation, synaptic loss and thus rescuing cognitive deficits of these transgenic mice. We further describe that knockdown or inhibition of SMS1 decreases BACE1 stability, which is accompanied with decreased BACE1 levels in the Golgi, whereas enhanced BACE1 levels in the early endosomes and the lysosomes. The reduction of BACE1 levels induced by knockdown or inhibition of SMS1 is prevented by inhibition of lysosomes. Therefore, knockdown or inhibition of SMS1 promotes lysosomal degradation of BACE1 via modulating the intracellular trafficking of BACE1.

"Tre2 (USP6NL) promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation via Wnt/β-catenin pathway",2019,"Background: Most colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage with poor prognosis. Ubiquitin-specific protease 6 N-terminal-like protein (USP6NL) with high expression in CRC tissues regulates CRC cell proliferation via Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We hypothesized that USP6NL impacts CRC growth and inhibition of USP6NL may be a novel treatment strategy to improve CRC therapy. Methods: USP6NL level in human CRC tissues and its association with tumor growth and metastasis were examined. Its roles and potential mechanisms in regulating tumor growth were studied by genetic and pharmacological manipulation of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: Herein, we found that USP6NL was up-regulated in tumorous tissues of CRC patients. Our data suggested that knockdown of USP6NL in human CRC cell lines (HCT116 and LOVO cells) inhibited cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and prevented the tumorigenicity of HCT116 cells in nude mice, and which was associated with the prevention of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. On the contrary, USP6NL overexpression in human CRC cells (SW480) showed the opposite result. Our data suggested that the promoted cell proliferation, G1/S cell cycle progression, and the enhanced expression of β-catenin Cyclin D1 and C-myc while reduced P27 induced by the overexpression of USP6NL were significantly reversed by additional treatment of XAV939, indicating that activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway was the mechanism, by which USP6NL exerted carcinogenesis in CRC in vitro. Besides, our data suggested that knockdown of USP6NL increased the ubiquitination of β-catenin, indicating that USP6NL may serve as a deubiquitinase that regulated β-catenin accumulation in this process. Furthermore, 10058-F4 down-regulated USP6NL, inhibited CRC cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest. The result demonstrated a possible feedback loop between USP6NL, β-catenin and C-myc in regulating CRC cell growth. Conclusion: USP6NL was an oncogene in CRC, and it may be a potential target for the treatment of CRC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","7,8 dihydro 2 [4 (trifluoromethyl)phenyl] 5h thiopyrano[4,3 d]pyrimidin 4 ol; beta catenin; cyclin D1; deubiquitinase; Myc protein; protein p27; Tre2 protein; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer tissue; carcinogenicity; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; feedback system; flow cytometry; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; growth regulation; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; LoVo cell line; luciferase assay; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; SW480 cell line; tissue level; tumor xenograft; TUNEL assay; ubiquitination; upregulation; Western blotting; Wnt signaling"
"Amplification of Tumor Oxidative Stresses with Liposomal Fenton Catalyst and Glutathione Inhibitor for Enhanced Cancer Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy",2019,"Amplification of intracellular oxidative stress has been found to be an effective strategy to induce cancer cell death. To this end, we prepare a unique type of ultrasmall gallic acid-ferrous (GA-Fe(II)) nanocomplexes as the catalyst of Fenton reaction to enable persistent conversion of H2O2 to highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (?OH). Then, both GA-Fe(II) and l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, are coencapsulated within a stealth liposomal nanocarrier. Interestingly, the obtained BSO/GA-Fe(II)@liposome is able to efficiently amplify intracellular oxidative stress via increasing ?OH generation and reducing GSH biosynthesis. After chelating with 99mTc4+ radioisotope, such BSO/GA-Fe(II)@liposome could be tracked under in vivo single-photon-emission-computed-tomography (SPECT) imaging, which illustrates the time-dependent tumor homing of such liposomal nanoparticles after intravenous injection. With GA-Fe(II)-mediated ?OH production and BSO-mediated GSH depletion, treatment with such BSO/GA-Fe(II)@liposome would lead to dramatically enhanced intratumoral oxidative stresses, which then result in remarkably improved therapeutic efficacies of concurrently applied chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

However, the role of lncRNA LINC00152 in OS remains elusive. In this study, LINC00152 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Moreover, MTT and colony formation assays revealed that knockdown of LINC00152 significantly suppressed cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of LINC00152 knockdown on OS cell migration and invasion was analyzed and demonstrated by transwell assays. Additionally, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays suggested that LINC00152 was transcriptionally activated by the transcription factor TCF3. More importantly, mechanism investigation revealed that LINC00152 was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of OS cells and acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in OS by regulating miR-1182/CDK14 axis. Collectively, LINC00152 was activated by TCF3 and promotes cell proliferation and migration in osteosarcoma via miR-1182-CDK14 axis. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","cyclin dependent kinase; cyclin dependent kinase 14; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; microRNA 1182; RNA; transcription factor 7 like 1; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; CDK14 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase; long non-coding RNA Linc00152, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN1182 microRNA, human; TCF3 protein, human; adult; Article; bioinformatics; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer survival; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clinical feature; colony formation; controlled study; enzyme activation; female; gene control; gene expression; gene function; human; human cell; human tissue; LINC00152 gene; loss of function mutation; luciferase assay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; MTT assay; oncogene; osteosarcoma; osteosarcoma cell line; overall survival; aged; bone tumor; carcinogenesis; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; osteosarcoma; pathology; physiology; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Bone Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Osteosarcoma; RNA, Long Noncoding"
"Micro-RNA 205-5p is involved in the progression of gastric cancer and targets phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells",2019,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the role of micro-RNA 205-5p (miR-205-5p) in the progression of gastric cancer, and the target of miR-205-5p in human gastric cancer cells in vitro. Material/Methods: Expression of miR-205-5p and PTEN in gastric cancer tissue samples and adjacent normal gastric tissue from 35 patients was studied using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells included a normal control (NC) group, a group transfected with empty vector (Vector), a group treated with miR-205-5p inhibitor (miR-inhibitor), and a group treated with miR-205-5p inhibitor and small interfering PTEN mRNA (miR-inhibitor+si-PTEN). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measured miR-205-5p expression, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, transwell and wound healing assays measured cell migration, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed ultrastructural changes in SGC-7901 cells. PTEN, AKT and p-AKT protein expression were measured using Western blot. The correlation between miR-205-5p and PTEN was analyzed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: Increased expression of miR-205-5p and PTEN in gastric cancer tissues were correlated with tumor stage. In SGC-7901 cells, miR-205-5p mRNA expression in the miR-inhibitor and miR-inhibitor+si-PTEN groups was significantly lower than that in the NC group (P<0.001). In the miR-inhibitor group, cell proliferation was significantly decreased, and apoptosis was significantly increased (P<0.001). Conclusions: In gastric cancer, increased expression of miR-205-5p was associated with tumor stage, and in SGC-7901 cells PTEN was a target gene for miR-205-5p. ?

"HMGA1 in cancer: Cancer classification by location",2019,"The high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene plays an important role in numerous malignant cancers. HMGA1 is an oncofoetal gene, and we have a certain understanding of the biological function of HMGA1 based on its activities in various neoplasms. As an architectural transcription factor, HMGA1 remodels the chromatin structure and promotes the interaction between transcriptional regulatory proteins and DNA in different cancers. Through analysis of the molecular mechanism of HMGA1 and clinical studies, emerging evidence indicates that HMGA1 promotes the occurrence and metastasis of cancer. Within a similar location or the same genetic background, the function and role of HMGA1 may have certain similarities. In this paper, to characterize HMGA1 comprehensively, research on various types of tumours is discussed to further understanding of the function and mechanism of HMGA1. The findings provide a more reliable basis for classifying HMGA1 function according to the tumour location. In this review, we summarize recent studies related to HMGA1, including its structure and oncogenic properties, its major functions in each cancer, its upstream and downstream regulation associated with the tumourigenesis and metastasis of cancer, and its potential as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis of cancer. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Fabrication of H2O2-driven nanoreactors for innovative cancer treatments",2019,"The increased production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a typical feature of cancerous cells. This feature is closely associated with elevated oxidative stress inside solid tumour microenvironments, which thus impairs either the growth of cancer cells or their sensitivity to many cancer therapeutics. To date, numerous innovative strategies that target tumour H2O2 have been designed for effective cancer treatment. More recently, with the rapid advancement of nanomedicine, several nanoreactors, which are highly efficient in converting endogenous H2O2 to more toxic reactive oxygen species, promoting in situ H2O2, or decomposing endogenous H2O2 to molecular oxygen for tumour hypoxia attenuation, have been designed and attempted for effective cancer treatment. This review focuses on the latest progress of such innovative H2O2-driven nanoreactor-mediated cancer treatments. Afterwards, future perspectives on the development of tumour H2O2-driven nanoreactor-mediated cancer treatments and their potential clinical translations will be discussed. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Hydrogen production; Medical nanotechnology; Molecular oxygen; Nanoreactors; Tumors; Cancer therapeutics; Cancerous cells; Clinical translation; Future perspectives; Innovative strategies; Microenvironments; Production of hydrogen; Reactive oxygen species; Diseases; hydrogen peroxide; nanomaterial; animal; art; human; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; Animals; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Nanostructures; Neoplasms; Portraits as Topic"
"miR-106b promotes proliferation and invasion by targeting capicua through MAPK signaling in renal carcinoma cancer",2019,"Background: MiR-106b has been reported to play a vital role in pathogenesis of some types of cancer, whilst the role of miR-106b in renal carcinoma cancer (RCC) remains unknown. Purpose: The objective of this study was to identify the mechanism of miR-106b regulating the progression of renal carcinoma. Method: The expression of miR-106b was analyzed in RCC cell lines, RCC and adjacent normal renal tissues through qRT-PCR assays. Target mRNA of miR-106b was predicted with databases and verified by luciferase reporter assays. And the effects of miR-106b or targeted mRNA on cell proliferation, invasion, the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) were assessed in vitrothrough CCK-8, transwell cell invasion assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays respectively. In addition, the effects of miR-106b on the growth of xenografts mice were analyzedin vivo. Results: The results demonstrated that miR-106b was significantly increased both in RCC tissues and cell lines. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-106b inhibited Capicua expression by targeting its 3?-UTR sequence. And miR-106b promoted cell proliferation, invasion, EMT progression in RCC cellin vitro, as well as promoted the tumor growth of 786-O cells derived xenografts mice. Additionally, loss of Capicua promoted the activation of MAPK signaling pathway. Conclusion: The study suggested that miR-106b regulated RCC progression through MAPK signaling pathway partly by targeting Capicua, which might provide valuable evidence for therapeutic target development of RCC. ? 2019 Miao et al.","microRNA; microRNA 106b; tumor marker; unclassified drug; 3' untranslated region; 786-O cell line; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Bagg albino mouse; cell activation; cell invasion; cell invasion assay; cell proliferation; CIC gene; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene sequence; gene silencing; gene targeting; genetic correlation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney carcinoma; luciferase assay; major clinical study; male; MAPK signaling; middle aged; molecular pathology; mouse; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; renal cell carcinoma cell line; tumor growth; Western blotting"
"Alcohol Drinking and the Risk of Chronic Kidney Damage: A Meta-Analysis of 15 Prospective Cohort Studies",2019,"The relationship between alcohol drinking and chronic kidney damage, mainly including declined glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria, and end-stage renal disease, was conflicting. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate their potential associations. PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify prospective studies assessing the associations between alcohol drinking and chronic kidney damage published up to March 2019. Random-effects model was employed to pool the relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup meta-analyses stratified by the basic characteristics of subjects were performed. A total of 15 cohort studies were included in the present study, with 268,723 participants and 31,766 incident cases. Participants with low (<13?g/d), moderate (13 to 26?g/d), and high (26 to 60?g/d) dose of alcohol drinking had 12% (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.93), 24% (RR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.83), and 21% (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.88) lower risk of chronic kidney damage compared with the reference group (non- or occasional drinkers), respectively. The lower risk for chronic kidney damage remained significant for the declined GFR, or in men, or for participants aged less than 55?yrs, or studies with longer than 8?yrs of follow-up, while severe alcohol drinking (?60?g/d) insignificantly increased 7% risk of chronic kidney damage (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.15). No obvious heterogeneity and no publication bias were observed. Based on our meta-analysis, participants with alcohol drinking less than 60?g/d were at lower risk of declined GFR, especially in men or participants aged less than 55?yrs. Much more prospective cohort studies are required to confirm our present findings. ? 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism","alcohol consumption; chronic kidney failure; drinking behavior; end stage renal disease; glomerulus filtration rate; human; meta analysis; practice guideline; priority journal; proteinuria; Review"
"The optimal treatment for improving cognitive function in elder people with mild cognitive impairment incorporating Bayesian network meta-analysis and systematic review",2019,"It's widely acknowledged that, as a neurodegenerative aging disease representing an intermediate stage between cognitive intactness and Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) poses an excessive burden on patients’ well-being, family members, health-care providers as well as the whole society. This study focuses on three cognitive interventions proposed by Clare and Woods, which are, Cognitive stimulation (CS), Cognitive training (CT) and Cognitive rehabilitation (CR). Our Network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to compar them with one another to determine the optimal cognitive intervention for elderly adults with MCI in improving their cognitive function. We applied extensive strategies to preliminary literature retrieval to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which scrupulously compared any two of the three cognitive interventions with one another or any one of the three with a control group as the placebo or non-active group in treating elder patients with MCI in accordance with Petersen's criteria. Our NMA of cognitive interventions for patients diagnosed with MCI appraised the relative effectiveness of cognitive interventions across trials simultaneously. Our study attempts to summarize available data to suggest that CS (Mean difference [MD] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.27, 1.70) and CT (MD = 0.70, [CI]:0.11,1.30) were significantly beneficial to MCI patients for improving their cognition status while CR (MD = 0.59, [CI]:-0.30,1.50) scored lowest. Our study suggested CS was most likely to be the best intervention for improving the cognitive function of MCI patients. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bayes theorem; cognition; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; comparative study; disorders of higher cerebral function; human; meta analysis; mild cognitive impairment; network meta-analysis; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; treatment outcome"
"Treatment abandonment in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in China: A retrospective cohort study of the Chinese Children's Cancer Group",2019,"Objectives Before 2003, most children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) abandoned treatment, with only approximately 30% treated in China. With the development of national insurance for underprivileged patients, we assessed the current frequency and causes of treatment abandonment among patients with ALL who were enrolled in the Chinese Children's Cancer Group ALL protocol between 2015 and 2016. Methods Demographic, clinical and laboratory data on patients who abandoned treatment, as well as economic and sociocultural data of their families were collected and analysed. General health-related statistics were retrieved from publicly accessible databanks maintained by the Chinese government. Results At a median follow-up of 119 weeks, 83 (3.1%, 95% CI 2.5% to 3.8%) of the 2641 patients abandoned treatment. Factors independently associated with abandonment included standard/high-risk ALL (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.77), presence of minimal residual disease at the end of remission induction (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.90 to 6.74) and low-income economic region (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.89 to 7.05). According to the family members, economic constraints (50.6%, p=0.0001) were the main reason for treatment abandonment, followed by the belief of incurability, severe side effects and concern over late complications. Conclusions The rate of ALL treatment abandonment has been greatly reduced in China. Standard/high-risk ALL, residence in a low-income region and economic difficulties were associated with treatment abandonment. Clinical trial registration number ChiCTR-IPR-14005706, pre-results. ?

"B7-H3 promotes aerobic glycolysis and chemoresistance in colorectal cancer cells by regulating HK2",2019,"Accumulating evidence suggests that aerobic glycolysis is important for colorectal cancer (CRC) development. However, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. B7-H3, an immunoregulatory protein, is broadly overexpressed by multiple tumor types and plays a vital role in tumor progression. In this study, we found that overexpression of B7-H3 effectively increased the rate of glucose consumption and lactate production, whereas knockdown of B7-H3 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, we showed that B7-H3 increased glucose consumption and lactate production by promoting hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression in CRC cells, and we also found that HK2 was a key mediator of B7-H3-induced CRC chemoresistance. Depletion of HK2 expression or treating cells with HK2 inhibitors could reverse the B7-H3-induced increase in aerobic glycolysis and B7-H3-endowed chemoresistance of cancer cells. Moreover, we verified a positive correlation between the expression of B7-H3 and HK2 in tumor tissues of CRC patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that B7-H3 may be a novel regulator of glucose metabolism and chemoresistance via controlling HK2 expression in CRC cells, a result that could help develop B7-H3 as a promising therapeutic target for CRC treatment. ? 2019, The Author(s).","b7 h3 protein; beta actin; glucose; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 4; hexokinase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; membrane protein; messenger RNA; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; pyruvate kinase; small interfering RNA; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; aerobic glycolysis; Article; cancer resistance; colorectal cancer; glucose intake; glucose metabolism; human; human cell; priority journal; protein expression; upregulation"
"Comparison of Laparoscopic and Open Approach in Treating Gallbladder Cancer",2019,"Background: Preliminary study on the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and radical cholecystectomy in stage Tis-T3 gallbladder cancer (GBC). Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 102 patients with GBC from August 2008 to August 2017 in the Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. The clinical and pathological data of laparoscopic surgery and open surgery were compared. Results: Of 102 patients with GBC, 41 underwent laparoscopic treatment, 12 of whom underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the others underwent laparoscopic radical cholecystectomy/extended radical cholecystectomy. Sixty-one patients underwent radical cholecystectomy/extended radical cholecystectomy. Based on the individual patient's condition, excision of the extrahepatic biliary tract and cholangioenterostomy were performed. There were no perioperative deaths. There was no significant difference in the operative blood loss (P = 0.732), operative time (P = 0.058), postoperative complications (P = 0.933), R0 margins (P = 0.679), and tumor-related death (P = 0.396) between the laparoscopic group and the laparotomy group. The postoperative activity time (P < 0.001), postoperative eating time (P < 0.001), drainage tube removal time (P < 0.001), and postoperative hospital discharge time (P < 0.001) in the laparoscopic group were all earlier than those in the laparotomy group, and the difference was statistically significant. The number of lymph nodes resected in the laparoscopic group and the laparotomy group was 1-17, average (5 ± 3) and 1-13 average (5 ± 3), respectively, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.973). The 1-, 3-, and 5-y survival rates in the laparoscopic group were 97.1%, 69.4%, and 51.9%, respectively, and those in the laparotomy group were 94.7%, 64.9%, and 55.7%, respectively; there were no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.453). In terms of different pathologic T stages, the 5-y survival rates of patients with stage Tis (9 cases), T1a (2 cases), T1b (8 cases), T2 (14 cases), and T3 (8 cases) disease in the laparoscopic group were 100%, 100%, 75%, 48.1%, and 12.5%, respectively, and the 5-y survival rates in patients with stage Tis (4 cases), T1b (9 cases), T2 (32 cases), and T3 (16 cases) disease in the laparotomy group were 100%, 87.5%, 64.7%, and 16%, respectively; there were no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions: Laparoscopic treatment of stage Tis-T3 GBC is feasible. Laparoscopic treatment of GBC does not increase the incision metastasis rate on the basis of the intact gallbladder wall. The same survival rates can be achieved with laparoscopic treatment as with open treatment of GBC. In terms of postoperative rehabilitation, laparoscopic treatment has more advantages. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","abdominal radiography; adult; Article; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cholangioenterostomy; cholecystectomy; comparative study; extrahepatic bile duct; female; follow up; gallbladder cancer; hospital discharge; human; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; major clinical study; male; open surgery; operation duration; operative blood loss; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; radical cholecystectomy; retrospective study; surgical approach; surgical margin; survival rate; adenocarcinoma; adenoma; aged; feasibility study; gallbladder tumor; laparoscopy; middle aged; mortality; pathology; postoperative complication; procedures; squamous cell carcinoma; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adenocarcinoma; Adenoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cholecystectomy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gallbladder Neoplasms; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome"
"Study description and baseline characteristics of the population enrolled in a multinational, observational study of teriparatide in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: the Asia and Latin America Fracture Observational Study (ALAFOS)",2019,"Objective: To describe the study design and baseline patient characteristics of the Asia and Latin America Fracture Observational Study (ALAFOS) to better understand the profile of patients receiving teriparatide during the course of routine clinical practice in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Russia. Methods: Prospective, observational, non-interventional study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are prescribed teriparatide for up to 24 months, according to local medical standards, with a 12 month post-treatment follow-up. Measures: Demographics, risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures, history of fracture, prior osteoporosis medications, comorbidities, physical function, back pain and quality of life (QoL). Results: In total 3031 postmenopausal women (mean age 72.5 years) recruited at 152 sites in 20 countries were analyzed; 62.9% had a history of fragility fracture after age 40 (33.0% of patients with spinal, 14.2% with hip fractures). The mean (SD) bone mineral density T-scores at baseline were ?3.06 (1.40) and ?2.60 (1.05) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, respectively. At entry, 43.7% of patients were na?ve to prior osteoporosis treatments; 40.5% of patients reported ?1 fall in the past year. The median (Q1; Q3) EuroQoL Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) for perceived overall health status was 60 (50; 80). The mean (SD) worst back pain Numeric Rating Scale in the last 24 hours was 4.6 (3.3). Conclusions: Our data indicates that patients who were prescribed teriparatide in the ALAFOS participant countries had severe osteoporosis, high prevalence of fractures, disabling back pain and poor QoL.

"Expression of the lncRNA ZFAS1 in cervical cancer and its correlation with prognosis and chemosensitivity",2019,"Objective: To investigate the expression of the lncRNA ZFAS1 in cervical cancer and its relationship with patient prognosis and cervical cancer cell chemosensitivity. Methods: The expression of ZFAS1 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. The cervical cancer CaSki and the HeLa cell lines were transfected to be divided into Blank, siR-Control, and siR-ZFAS1 groups. MTT, wound-healing, and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell biological function. Cisplatin with different concentrations was used to treat cells in different transfection groups, and MTT assays were used to detect the cell growth inhibition rate and the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin was measured. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. A xenograft mouse model was used to investigate the effects of siR-ZFAS1 on the chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Results: ZFAS1 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, and increased ZFAS1 levels led to poor prognoses in patients. In addition, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group showed remarkably reduced ZFAS1 expression as well as cell proliferation, invasion and migration. After being treated with cisplatin at different concentrations, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group had dramatically increased cell growth inhibition and apoptosis but lower cisplatin IC50s. In addition, siR-ZFAS1 reduced the volumes and weights of tumors in nude mice treated with cisplatin and enhanced the chemosensitivity of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin. Conclusion: The lncRNA ZFAS1 was upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and its high expression indicated a poor prognosis. Silencing ZFAS1 may inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion and enhance cisplatin chemosensitivity. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","cisplatin; long untranslated RNA; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; long untranslated RNA; small interfering RNA; ZFAS1 long non-coding RNA, human; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; Ca Ski cell line; cancer diagnosis; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer tissue; cell culture; cell function; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell selection; cervical cancer cell line; chemosensitivity; clinical evaluation; controlled study; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; gene silencing; genetic transfection; growth inhibition; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; middle aged; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; oncogene; pathophysiology; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; tumor volume; tumor weight; tumor xenograft; upregulation; uterine cervix cancer; wound healing assay; ZFAS1 gene; animal; cell motion; drug effect; drug resistance; follow up; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mortality; nude mouse; pathology; prognosis; survival analysis; tumor invasion; uterine cervix; uterine cervix tumor; Adult; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cervix Uteri; Cisplatin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HeLa Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, Nude; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Prognosis; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Small Interfering; Survival Analysis; Up-Regulation; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"
"HOXC10 Regulates Osteogenesis of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Through Interaction with Its Natural Antisense Transcript lncHOXC-AS3",2019,"The characteristics of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) which derived from multiple myeloma (MM) patients are typically impaired in osteogenic differentiation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be further investigated. lncRNAs are emerging as critical regulation molecules in oncogenic pathways. In this study, we identified that bioactive lncRNA HOXC-AS3, which is transcribed in opposite to HOXC10, was presented in MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM) of MM patients (MM-MSCs). HOXC-AS3 was able to interact with HOXC10 at the overlapping parts and this interaction increased HOXC10 stability, then promoted its expression, conferring osteogenesis repression to MM-MSCs. In mouse models, intravenously administered siHOXC-AS3 was proven to be effective in prevention of bone loss, sustained by both anticatabolic activities and bone-forming. These data showed that lncHOXC-AS3 was required for osteogenesis in BM-MSCs by enhancing HOXC10 expression. Our finding thus unveils a novel insight for the potential clinical significance of lncRNA HOXC-AS3 as a therapeutic target for bone disease in MM. Stem Cells 2019;37:247–256. ?

Results: Lower calcium level at admission was associated with larger initial hematoma volumes, baseline NIHSS and mRSscore (p <.05), but not with platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio on admission (p >.05). For outcome assessment, 30 days mortality and 6 months mRS were adjusted for age, gender and time from onset to admission, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, history of hypertension, baseline NIHSS score, Baseline mRS score and hematoma position, lower calcium level at admission was associated with worse outcomes. Conclusion: Low calcium level at admission is associated with worse outcome and might be a prognostic factor for acute ICH. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Neurosurgical Foundation.","calcium; calcium; adult; aged; Article; brain hematoma; brain hemorrhage; calcium blood level; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease association; female; hospital admission; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; outcome assessment; priority journal; Rankin scale; retrospective study; age; blood; brain hemorrhage; diagnostic imaging; drinking behavior; hematoma; hospital admission; international normalized ratio; mortality; partial thromboplastin time; platelet count; predictive value; prognosis; sex factor; smoking; treatment outcome; Age Factors; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Calcium; Female; Hematoma; Humans; International Normalized Ratio; Intracranial Hemorrhage, Hypertensive; Male; Middle Aged; Partial Thromboplastin Time; Patient Admission; Platelet Count; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Smoking; Treatment Outcome"
"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus-induced macrophage differentiation is regulated by miR-146",2019,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate in humans, which is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family, is tick borne and endemic in Eastern Asia. Previous study found that SFTSV can infect and replicate in macrophages in vivo and in vitro. However, the role of macrophages in virus replication and the potential pathogenic mechanisms of SFTSV in macrophage remain unclear. In this study, we provided evidence that the SFTSV infection drove macrophage differentiation skewed to M2 phenotype, facilitated virus shedding, and resulted in viral spread. We showed evidence that miR-146a and b were significantly upregulated in macrophages during the SFTSV infection, driving the differentiation of macrophages into M2 cells by targeting STAT1. Further analysis revealed that the elevated miR-146b but not miR-146a was responsible for IL-10 stimulation. We also found that SFTSV increased endogenous miR-146b-induced differentiation of macrophages into M2 cells mediated by viral nonstructural protein (NSs). The M2 skewed differentiation of macrophages may have important implication to the pathogenesis of SFTS. ? 2019 Zhang, Fu, Wang, Guan, Zhu, Guo, Zheng and Wu.

"One-step preparation of gold nanovectors using folate modified polyethylenimine and their use in target-specific gene transfection",2019,"Gene transfection, as an effective treatment for inherited and acquired life threatening diseases caused by genetic deficiencies and abnormalities, has evolved as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer and other intractable diseases. Non-target-specific vectors will affect normal cells as well as pathogenic cells, resulting in a relative decrease in transfection efficiency and unnecessary cytotoxicity. In the present work, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with folate (FA)-modified polyethylenimine (PEI-FA) were prepared by a single step method (without additional reducing agent) for targeted gene transfection in tumor cells. Moreover, an improved compound vector system was developed by mixing PEI-AuNPs and PEI-FA-AuNPs. It was shown that the compound vector system not only greatly increased transfection efficiency in HeLa cells, but also reduced cytotoxicity. By comparison, the transfection efficiency in L929 cells lacking folate receptor, was clearly lower than in tumor cells. The specific gene transfection of HeLa cells using this vector system could be clearly observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy in a co-culture system of HeLa cells and L929 cells. This transfection system with high-efficiency, high-specificity and low-toxicity appears to have potential in targeted cancer treatment and drug delivery. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cytology; Diseases; Efficiency; Fiber optic sensors; Gene therapy; Gold nanoparticles; Lanthanum compounds; Metal nanoparticles; Nanometals; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Vectors; Confocal laser scanning microscopy; Folate; Gene transfection; Genetic deficiencies; Polyethyleneimine; Therapeutic strategy; Transfection efficiency; Transfection system; Molecular biology; folate receptor; folic acid; gold nanoparticle; polyethyleneimine; folic acid; gold; metal nanoparticle; polyethyleneimine; Article; cell viability; coculture; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; genetic transfection; HeLa cell line; in vitro study; NCTC clone 929 cell line; particle size; priority journal; static electricity; synthesis; zeta potential; animal; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; gene therapy; gene transfer; gene vector; human; mouse; pharmacology; surface property; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Coculture Techniques; Drug Delivery Systems; Folic Acid; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Gold; HeLa Cells; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Particle Size; Polyethyleneimine; Surface Properties"
"Salinomycin reduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition-mediated multidrug resistance by modifying long noncoding RNA HOTTIP expression in gastric cancer cells",2019,"Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) has become a major obstacle in chemotherapy in many tumors, including gastric cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is considered an important process in cancer development, also contributes toward tumor MDR. Salinomycin, an EMT blocker, shows broad-spectrum antitumor and chemosensitization properties. Here, we hypothesized that salinomycin could reverse the MDR of SGC7901/cisplatin (CDDP) gastric cancer cell by inhibiting EMT and further explored its possible underlying mechanisms. Our results indicated higher 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) and stronger migration capacity in SGC7901/CDDP than in SGC7901 cells, whereas salinomycin could reduce the IC50 (50% inhibition of the concentration of chemodrugs after 4 μmol/l salinomycin treatment) and migration capacity in SGC7901/CDDP cells. At the molecular level, we found that the expression of E-cadherin, ZO-1 decreased, whereas the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB-1, and Twist increased in SGC7901/CDDP cells, and that salinomycin potently blocked the EMT by enhancing the expression of E-cadherin, ZO-1 and reducing the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB-1, and Twist in the above MDR cells. In addition, we also found that long noncoding RNA HOTTIP, an oncogenic regulator, was upregulated in SGC7901/CDDP cells, whereas its downregulation could markedly attenuate the EMT, thereby reversing the MDR. Furthermore, our data showed that the salinomycin-elicited MDR-reversion effect was associated closely with suppression of EMT through inhibition of the expression of long noncoding RNA HOTTIP. Collectively, our findings suggest a new underlying mechanism and applicable therapeutic regimen for MDR gastric cancer. Copyright ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Facile preparation of pH-responsive PEGylated prodrugs for activated intracellular drug delivery",2019,"PEGylated prodrug, covalent attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains to therapeutic drugs, is one of the most promising techniques to improve the water-solubility, stability, and therapeutic effect of drugs. In this study, three PEGylated acid-sensitive prodrugs DOX-PEG-DOX with different molecular weights, were prepared via Schiff-base reaction between aldehyde-modified PEG and the amino groups of doxorubicin (DOX). This kind of amphiphilic polymeric prodrug could be self-assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous solution. The average particle size and morphologies of the prodrug nanoparticles under different pH conditions were observed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. It turned out that the nanoparticles could be kept stable in the physiological environment, but degraded in acidic medium. Subsequently, we also investigated in vitro drug release behavior and found that the prodrug had acid-sensitive property. The cytotoxicity and intracellular uptake assays revealed that the prodrugs could rapidly internalized by HeLa or HepG2 cells to release DOX and effectively inhibited the proliferation of the tumor cells, which have the potential for use in cancer therapy. ? 2019 The Author",""
"Diversity, immunoregulatory action and structure-activity relationship of green sea turtle cathelicidins",2019,"Cathelicidins are a family of gene-encoded immune effectors in vertebrate innate immunity. Here, we reported the diversity and biological activity of cathelicidins in green sea turtle, a marine reptile species known for long lifespan and disease resistance. Four novel cathelicidins (Cm-CATH1-4) were identified from green sea turtle. All of them, especially Cm-CATH2, exhibited potent, broad-spectrum and rapid bactericidal and anti-biofilm activities by inducing the disruption of cell membrane integrity. Additionally, Cm-CATH2 effectively induced the macrophages/monocytes and neutrophils trafficking to the infection site, and inhibited the LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines, by blocking TLR4/MD2 complex and the downstream signaling pathway activation. In mouse peritonitis and pneumonia models, Cm-CATH2 exhibited evident protection against drug-resistant bacterial infections. Taken together, the diverse structures and functions of Cm-CATHs indicated their pleiotropic role in innate immunity of green sea turtle, and the potent antimicrobial, anti-biofilm and immunomodulatory properties make them ideal candidates for the development of novel anti-infective drugs. ? 2019","cathelicidin; cathelicidin 1; cathelicidin 2; cathelicidin 3; cathelicidin 4; complementary DNA; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; cathelicidin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial infection; bactericidal activity; biodiversity; biofilm; cell membrane; cell migration; Chelonia; controlled study; DNA synthesis; drug identification; drug stability; drug structure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hemolysis assay; human; human cell; HUVEC cell line; immunomodulation; immunoregulation; lung parenchyma; macrophage; male; molecular docking; monocyte; neutrophil; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; peritonitis; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; pneumonia; priority journal; protection; RAW 264.7 cell line; real time polymerase chain reaction; scanning electron microscopy; sequence alignment; signal transduction; structure activity relation; Western blotting; A-549 cell line; amino acid sequence; animal; bacterial infection; cell culture; cell survival; chemistry; classification; drug effect; genetic variation; genetics; immunology; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; mouse; nucleotide sequence; protein conformation; sequence homology; structure activity relation; tumor cell line; turtle; A549 Cells; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacterial Infections; Base Sequence; Cathelicidins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Genetic Variation; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Phylogeny; Protein Conformation; RAW 264.7 Cells; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Structure-Activity Relationship; Turtles"
"Zwitterionic shielded polymeric prodrug with folate-targeting and pH responsiveness for drug delivery",2019,"Zwitterionic polymers are a class of polymers that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid in solution. These polymers not only have excellent properties of hydration, anti-bacterial adhesion, charge reversal and easy chemical modification, but also have characteristics of long-term circulation and suppress nonspecific protein adsorption in vivo. Here, we describe a novel folate-targeted and acid-labile polymeric prodrug under the microenvironment of tumor cells, abbreviated as FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX, which was synthesized via a combination of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization, Schiff-base reaction, Click chemistry, and a reaction between the amine group of doxorubicin (DOX) and aldehyde functionalities of P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ) pendants, wherein MPC and PEGMA-BZ represent 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine and polyethylene glycol methacrylate ester benzaldehyde, respectively. The polymeric prodrug could self-assemble into nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. The average particle size and morphologies of the prodrug nanoparticles were observed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. We also investigated the in vitro drug release behavior and observed rapid prodrug nanoparticle dissociation and drug release under a mildly acidic microenvironment. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay verified that the P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ) copolymer possessed good biocompatibility and the FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX prodrug nanoparticles showed higher cellular uptake than those prodrug nanoparticles without the FA moiety. The results of cytotoxicity and the intracellular uptake of non-folate/folate targeted prodrug nanoparticles further confirmed that FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX could be efficiently accumulated and rapidly internalized by HeLa cells due to the strong interaction between multivalent phosphorylcholine (PC) groups and cell membranes. This kind of multifunctional FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX prodrug nanoparticle with combined target-ability and pH responsiveness demonstrates promising potential for cancer chemotherapy. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Biocompatibility; Chemical modification; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Dynamic light scattering; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lanthanum compounds; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Polymers; Acidic microenvironment; Average particle size; Intracellular uptake; Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays; Non-specific protein adsorption; Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer; Schiff base reaction; Zwitterionic polymers; Targeted drug delivery"
"Platelets as platforms for inhibition of tumor recurrence post-physical therapy by delivery of anti-PD-L1 checkpoint antibody",2019,"Cancer local physical therapy (PT)by using heat, cold, electrical stimulation, irradiation or ultrasound to treat tumor is accepted as alternative choice for cancer patients. However, local recurrence and metastasis after such treatments remains to be the major cause of treatment failure and mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a therapeutic strategy to inhibit local recurrence and metastasis. Inspired by the excellent inflammatory targeting ability of platelets, here we expect that the monoclonal antibody against programmed-death ligand 1 (aPDL1)engineered platelets could inhibit tumor local recurrence effectively, by facilitating transport of anti-PD-L1 antibodies to the ablated area with residue tumors. Using triple-negative breast carcinomas (4T1)bearing mouse model, we proved that antibody-coupled platelets could effectively target incompletely ablated tumor with thermal ablation (TA). We found the release of anti-PD-L1 can be triggered upon the platelets activation, together with many pro-inflammatory cytokines. The release of anti-PD-L1 is likely due to the dissociation of platelets upon the activation. Our findings approved that our platelet-based platform could facilitate the delivery of immune checkpoint antibody to tumor residues and remarkably prevent tumor recurrence after ablation. Moreover, this platelet-based delivery strategy may be extended to the targeted delivery of therapeutics post other types of local therapies including photodynamic therapy, high-intensity-focused-ultrasound ablation therapy, and even radiotherapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ablation; Chemical activation; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Drug delivery; Monoclonal antibodies; Pathology; Photodynamic therapy; Physical therapy; Platelets; Tumors; Ultrasonics; Breast carcinomas; Cancer immunotherapy; Cancer recurrence; Controlled release; Electrical stimulations; High intensity focused ultrasound; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; Therapeutic strategy; Targeted drug delivery; monoclonal antibody; programmed death 1 ligand 1; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer radiotherapy; cell engineering; controlled study; female; high intensity focused ultrasound; immune response; mouse; nonhuman; photodynamic therapy; physiotherapy; priority journal; T lymphocyte; thrombocyte; triple negative breast cancer; tumor localization; tumor recurrence; tumor xenograft"

"Methylation of bone SOST impairs SP7, RUNX2, and ERα transactivation in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis",2019,"Sclerostin (SOST), a glycoprotein predominantly secreted by bone tissue osteocytes, is an important regulator of bone formation, and loss of SOST results in Van Buchem disease. DNA methylation regulates SOST expression in human osteocytes, although the detailed underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we compared 12 patients with bone fractures and postmenopausal osteoporosis with eight patients without postmenopausal osteoporosis to understand the mechanisms via which SOST methylation affects osteoporosis. Serum and bone SOST expression was reduced in patients with osteoporosis. Bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction revealed that the methylation rate was higher in patients with osteoporosis. We identified osterix (SP7), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and estrogen receptor α (ERα) as candidate transcription factors activating SOST expression. Increased SOST methylation impaired the transactivation function of SP7, RUNX2, and ERα in MG-63 cells. AzadC treatment and SOST overexpression in MG-63 cells altered cell proliferation and apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that higher methylation was associated with reduced SP7, RUNX2, and ERα binding to the SOST promoter in patients with osteoporosis. Our studies provide new insight into the role of SOST methylation in osteoporosis. ? 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.","Alkylation; Cell death; Cell proliferation; Diseases; Methylation; Polymerase chain reaction; Transcription; Transcription factors; Bisulfite-sequencing; Chromatin immunoprecipitation; DNA Methylation; Estrogen receptor; Osteoporosis; Proliferation and apoptosis; Sclerostin; Trans-activation function; Bone; bisulfite; estrogen receptor alpha; sclerostin; transcription factor osterix; transcription factor RUNX2; bone morphogenetic protein; decitabine; estrogen receptor alpha; RUNX2 protein, human; SOST protein, human; Sp7 protein, human; transcription factor osterix; transcription factor RUNX2; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clinical article; controlled study; female; gene overexpression; hip fracture; human; MG-63 cell line; osteoporosis; polymerase chain reaction; postmenopause osteoporosis; promoter region; transactivation; bone; drug effect; genetic marker; genetics; metabolism; methylation; pathology; postmenopause osteoporosis; tumor cell line; Apoptosis; Bone and Bones; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Decitabine; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Genetic Markers; Humans; Methylation; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Sp7 Transcription Factor"
"LINC00612 enhances the proliferation and invasion ability of bladder cancer cells as ceRNA by sponging miR-590 to elevate expression of PHF14",2019,"Background: Bladder cancer (BC) is a common type of cancer that involves tumors of the urinary system and poses a serious threat to human health. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial biomarkers and regulators in many cancers. Novel lncRNA biomarkers in BC urgently need to be investigated in regard to its function and regulatory mechanisms. Methods: Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs in BC tissue was performed via microarray analysis. To investigate the biological functions of LINC00612, loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, AGO2-RIP assays, RNA pull-down assays, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) arrays, fluorescence in situ hybridization assays, and western blot assays were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Results: LINC00612 was upregulated in BC tissues and cell lines. Functionally, downregulation of LINC00612 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of LINC00612 resulted in the opposite effects. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays revealed that miR-590 was a direct target of LINC0061, which was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assays, AGO2-RIP assays, RNA pull-down assays, RT-qPCR arrays, and rescue experiments. Additionally, miR-590 was shown to directly target the PHD finger protein 14 (PHF14) gene. LNIC00612 modulated the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin by competitively sponging miR-590 to elevate the expression of PHF14, thus affecting BC cellular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conclusions: Our results indicate that LINC00612 enhances the proliferation and invasion ability of BC cells by sponging miR-590 to upregulate PHF14 expression and promote BC cellular EMT, suggesting that LINC00612 may act as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for BC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","competitive endogenous RNA; long untranslated RNA; membrane protein; microRNA; microRNA 590; PHD finger protein 14; RNA; unclassified drug; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN590 microRNA, human; nuclear protein; PHF14 protein, human; transcription factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; bioluminescence; bladder cancer; cell invasion; cell proliferation; cell viability; cellular distribution; colony formation; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gain of function mutation; gene expression profiling; gene function; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; LINC00612 gene; loss of function mutation; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; PHF14 gene; plasmid; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; Western blotting; animal; bladder tumor; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Nuclear Proteins; RNA, Long Noncoding; Transcription Factors; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"
"Endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) has a critical role in supporting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic B-cells",2019,"The molecular underpinnings of b-cell dysfunction and death leading to diabetes are not fully elucidated. The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) in pancreatic b-cells. Chemically induced ERAD deficiency in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 markedly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The mechanistic basis for this effect was studied in cells and mice lacking ERAD as a consequence of genetic ablation of the core ERAD protein SEL1L. Targeted disruption of SEL1L in INS-1 cells and in mouse pancreatic b-cells impaired ERAD and led to blunted GSIS. Additionally, mice with SEL1L deletion in b-cells were chronically hyperglycemic after birth and increasingly glucose intolerant over time. SEL1L absence caused an entrapment of proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment in both INS-1 cells and mouse pancreatic b-cells. Both folding-competent and folding-deficient proinsulin can physiologically interact with and be efficiently degraded by HRD1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the ERAD complex. GSIS impairment in insulinoma cells was accompanied by a reduced intracellular Ca 2+ ion level, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and lowered mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these findings suggest that ERAD plays a pivotal role in supporting pancreatic b-cell function by targeting wild-type and folding-deficient proinsulin for proteosomal degradation. ERAD deficiency may contribute to the development of diabetes by affecting proinsulin processing in the ER, intracellular Ca 2+ concentration, and mitochondrial function. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","glucose; hrd1 protein; proinsulin; reactive oxygen metabolite; sel1l protein; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; glucose; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; calcium cell level; calcium signaling; cell death; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; cytosol; diabetes mellitus; diabetogenesis; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; gene deletion; gene editing; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; Golgi complex; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; hyperglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; INS-1 cell line; insulin release; insulin tolerance test; male; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell function; priority journal; protein degradation; protein processing; protein protein interaction; rat; secretory pathway; animal; drug effect; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; insulin release; metabolism; pancreas islet beta cell; physiology; transgenic mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Death; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation; Glucose; Insulin Secretion; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Mice; Mice, Transgenic"
"Doxorubicin conjugated with nanodiamonds and in free form commit glioblastoma cells to heterodromous fates",2019,"Aim: To mechanistically compare the effects of doxorubicin (DOX) and DOX conjugated with nanodiamonds (Nano-DOX) on human glioblastoma cells (GC). Materials & methods: GC viablity, proliferation and activation of apoptosis and autophagy was assayed in response to DOX and Nano-DOX. Expression and release of HMGB1 were measured and its role in apoptosis and autophagy probed in response to DOX and Nano-DOX. Results: DOX induced apoptosis in GC while Nano-DOX induced autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy in Nano-DOX-Treated GC promoted apoptosis. DOX suppressed the emission of HMGB1 while Nano-DOX stimulated HMGB1 emission which was attenuated when autophagy was repressed. Blocking of HMGB1 emission mitigated autophagy and enhanced apoptosis in Nano-DOX-Treated GC. Exogenously administered HMGB1 promoted autophagy and protected against apoptosis in both Nano-DOX-Treated GC and DOX-Treated GC. Conclusions: Nano-DOX is a potent autophagy activator as opposed to DOX as an apoptosis inducer. Nano-DOX initiates a mutual reinforcement loop between autophagy and HMGB1 in GC and thereby protects GC against apoptosis. ? 2019 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","doxorubicin; high mobility group B1 protein; doxorubicin; high mobility group B1 protein; nanodiamond; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cell proliferation; cell viability; concentration response; confocal microscopy; controlled study; down regulation; drug delivery system; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; staining; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting; animal; chemistry; drug effect; glioblastoma; metabolism; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin; Glioblastoma; HMGB1 Protein; Humans; Nanodiamonds"

"MicroRNA-590-5p antagonizes the inhibitory effect of high glucose on osteoblast differentiation by suppressing Smad7 in MC3T3-E1 cells",2019,"Objective: MicroRNA-590-5p (miR-590-5p) has been reported to stimulate osteoblast differentiation; however, its effect in diabetic osteoporosis remains unknown. This study investigated the effect of miR-590-5p on high glucose (HG)-suppressed osteoblast differentiation. Methods: The effect of HG on MC3T3-E1 cell survival was assessed using the MTT assay. The expression levels and activities of osteoblastic proteins were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, and immunoblotting assay. Tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in MC3T3-E1 cells was assessed using luciferase assay, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting. Mineralized nodule formation in MC3T3-E1 cells was examined by using the mineralization assay. Results: When MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to HG conditions, there was significant downregulation of miR-590-5p and osteoblastic proteins (e.g., collagen I, Runx2, and ALP); in contrast, Smad7 was upregulated. Furthermore, miR-590-5p targeted Smad7 and inhibited its expression. Additionally, overexpression of miR-590-5p significantly promoted osteoblast growth and differentiation by upregulating TGF-β signaling in HG-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. Conclusions: Collectively, the results showed that miR-590-5p was involved in osteogenesis; moreover, miR-590-5p may represent a potential target for the treatment of diabetic osteoporosis. ?

"PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden status for prediction of response to chemotherapy and targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"Background: Several targeted immunotherapies have recently showed significant advances in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including antibodies and inhibitors targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1). Methods: Tumor tissue samples were prospectively collected from 183 patients with NSCLC including lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC). PD-L1 expression level was measured by immunohistochemistry assay and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status was assessed by next generation sequencing. Correlations between PD-L1 expressions, TMB status with clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Results: PD-L1 expression was detected in 37% of ADC group and 55% in SQCC group while all clinicopathological characteristics were found comparable between these two groups. PD-L1 expression was negatively associated with overall survival in ADC group (P < 0.0001) but not in SQCC group (P = 0.418). In consistent with PD-L1 expression level, TMB status was significantly lower in ADC subjects as compared to SQCC subjects (P = 0.024) while PD-L1 positive subgroup and TMB high subgroup shared less subjects within ADC group than SQCC group. More importantly, the combination of TMB status and PD-L1 expression successfully identified responders, who showed significant longer median overall survival than non-responders (32 months vs. 8.5 months) in ADC subjects (P < 0.0001) but not in SQCC subjects. Conclusions: Here we tested the hypothesis that monitoring TMB, in addition to the existing PD-L1 expression level, could represent valuable non-invasive biomarkers for the chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Further analyses are in need to further assess the prognostic value of TMB for ADC and SQCC patients receiving immunotherapy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","carboplatin; cisplatin; docetaxel; programmed death 1 ligand 1; CD274 protein, human; immunological antineoplastic agent; programmed death 1 ligand 1; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; controlled study; correlation analysis; drug targeting; female; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; mutational analysis; next generation sequencing; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; population research; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; protein expression; retrospective study; squamous cell lung carcinoma; treatment response; tumor volume; very elderly; cancer grading; cancer staging; disease management; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; lung tumor; middle aged; molecularly targeted therapy; mortality; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; treatment outcome; tumor cell line; workflow; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; B7-H1 Antigen; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Management; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Treatment Outcome; Workflow"
"Influenza-associated Hospitalization in Children Younger Than 5 Years of Age in Suzhou, China, 2011-2016",2019,"Background: Studying the burden and risk factors associated with severe illness from influenza infection in young children in eastern China will contribute to future cost-effectiveness analyses of local influenza vaccine programs. Methods: We conducted prospective, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance at Suzhou University-Affiliated Children's Hospital to estimate influenza-associated hospitalizations in Suzhou University-Affiliated Children's Hospital by month in children younger than 5 years of age from October 2011 to September 2016. SARI was defined as fever (measured axillary temperature ? 38°C) and cough or sore throat or inflamed/red pharynx in the 7 days preceding hospitalization. We combined SARI surveillance data with healthcare utilization survey data to estimate and characterize the burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations in Suzhou within this age group in the 5-year period. Results: Of the 36,313 SARI cases identified, 2,297 from respiratory wards were systematically sampled; of these, 259 (11%) were influenza positive. Estimated annual influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates per 1,000 children younger than 5 years of age ranged from 4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2-5) in the 2012-2013 season to 16 (95% CI, 14-19) in the 2011-2012 season. The predominant viruses were A/H3N2 (59%) in 2011-12, both A/H1N1pdm09 (42%) and B (46%) in 2012-13, A/H3N2 (71%) in 2013-14, A/H3N2 (55%) in 2014-15 and both A/H1N1pdm09 (50%) and B (50%) in 2015-16. The age-specific influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates for the 5-year period were 11 (95% CI, 8-15) per 1,000 children 0-5 months of age; 8 (95% CI, 7-10) per 1,000 children 6-23 months of age and 5 (95% CI, 4-5) per 1,000 children 24-59 months of age, respectively. Conclusions: From 2011 to 2016, influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates in children aged younger than 5 years of age in Suzhou, China, were high, particularly among children 0-5 months of age. Higher hospitalization rates were observed in years where the predominant circulating virus was influenza A/H3N2. Immunization for children > 6 months, and maternal and caregiver immunization for those < 6 months, could reduce influenza-associated hospitalizations in young children in Suzhou. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Male Sexual Function: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review",2019,"Introduction: Obesity is a worldwide public health issue with serious psychological and social impacts. Erectile dysfunction is also a common clinical condition, and obesity is one of its main risk factors. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on male sexual function. Methods: A systematical research was carried out in Medline via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to March 16, 2019, to identify published articles related to bariatric surgery and male sexual function in men. Two reviewers screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. I2 index was applied to estimate the heterogeneity. All analyses were done using RevMan5.3 and Stata14. Results: A total of 12 studies involving 420 participants were included. Analysis showed that bariatric surgery significantly reduced body mass index in morbidly obese patients (mean difference [MD] = -13.73; 95% CI -17.23 to -10.22; P &lt;.00001). From 10 studies that reported the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, bariatric surgery led to a significant increase in IIEF-total score (MD = 8.2; 95% CI = 5.52?10.88; P &lt;.00001), and erectile function score (MD = 3.76; 95% CI = 2.34?5.19; P &lt;.00001), sexual desire (MD = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.55?1.32; P &lt;.00001), sexual intercourse satisfaction (MD = 1.73; 95% CI = 0.43?3.03; P &lt;.01), and total satisfaction (MD = 1.28; 95% CI = 0.56?2.00; P =.0005) were also significantly improved. However, bariatric surgery did not affect orgasm function (MD = 0.26; 95% CI = -0.15 to 0.68; P =.21). Three studies that reported the IIEF-5 score also showed a significant improvement of erectile function (MD = 5.45; 95% CI = 3.38?7.52; P &lt;.00001). Conclusions: Bariatric surgery could improve the erectile function, sexual desire, sexual intercourse satisfaction, and total satisfaction in morbidly obese men. Due to limited data on body mass index and hormone levels, our meta-analysis had some limitations. More clinical studies are needed to further explore the relationship between bariatric surgery and male sexual function. Xu J, Wu Q, Zhang Y, et al.

"B-type natriuretic peptide attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress in H9c2 cardiomyocytes underwent hypoxia/reoxygenation injury under high glucose/high fat conditions",2019,"Exogenously administered B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been shown to provide cardioprotection against various heart diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study explores whether BNP exerts its cardioprotection against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury under high glucose/high fat (HG/HF) conditions in cardiac H9c2 cells and uncovers the underlying mechanisms. Our data revealed that BNP significantly increased the cell viability and decreased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), with a maximal effect at the BNP concentration of 10 ?7 mol/L. In addition, by analyzing the activation of cleaved caspase-3 and by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, we showed that BNP attenuated H/R-induced cell apoptosis in HG/HF conditions. Western blot analysis showed enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like endoplastmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)(one of the three main signaling pathways in endoplastmic reticulum (ER) stress), and increased expression of GRP78 and CHOP proteins (ER stress-related proteins) in H9c2 cells which underwent H/R in HG/HF conditions. Treatment with BNP or 8-Br-cGMP (an analog of cGMP) reversed this activation. However, this effect was significantly weakened by KT-5823, a selective cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor. In addition, similar to BNP, treatment with a specific inhibitor of ER stress tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) protected the cells against H/R injury exposed to HG/HF conditions. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that BNP effectively protected cells against H/R injury under HG/HF conditions by inhibiting the ER stress via activation of the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","8 bromo cyclic GMP; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; beta actin; creatine kinase; enzyme; glucose; glucose regulated protein 78; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; initiation factor 2alpha; kt 5823; lactate dehydrogenase; protein kinase rna like endoplastmic reticulum kinase; tauroursodeoxycholic acid; unclassified drug; brain natriuretic peptide; glucose; animal cell; Article; cardiac muscle cell; endoplasmic reticulum stress; H9c2(2-1) cell line; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein expression level; rat; reoxygenation; reperfusion injury; signal transduction; Western blotting; animal; apoptosis; cell line; drug effect; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fat intake; flow cytometry; metabolism; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Dietary Fats; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Flow Cytometry; Glucose; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Myocytes, Cardiac; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Rats; Signal Transduction"
"MicroRNA-510 Plays Oncogenic Roles in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer by Directly Targeting SRC Kinase Signaling Inhibitor 1",2019,"An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play key roles in various cancer carcinogenesis and progression, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the expressions, roles, and mechanisms of miR-510 in NSCLC have, up to now, been largely undefined. In vivo assay showed that miR-510 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared with that in adjacent nontumor lung tissues. miR-510 expression was significantly correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. In vitro assay indicated that expressions of miR-510 were also increased in NSCLC cell lines. Downregulation of miR-510 suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. We identified SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) as a direct target gene of miR-510 in NSCLC. Expression of SRCIN1 was downregulated in lung cancer cells and negatively correlated with miR-510 expression in tumor tissues. Downregulation of SRCIN1, leading to inhibition of miR-510 expression, reversed cell proliferation and invasion in NSCLC cells. These results showed that miR-510 acted as an oncogenic miRNA in NSCLC, partly by targeting SRCIN1, suggesting that miR-510 can be a potential approach for the treatment of patients with malignant lung cancer.",""
"Intermediate screws or kyphoplasty: Which method of posterior short-segment fixation is better for treating single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures?",2019,"Purpose: To compare intermediate screws (IS) with kyphoplasty (KP) in posterior short-segment fixation (PSSF) for patients with single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures. Methods: Between 2010 and 2016, 1465 patients were retrospectively reviewed; 48 patients were enrolled with a minimal follow-up of 2?years. Perioperative and functional outcomes were compared. The regional Cobb angle (CA) was included in radiographic analysis. Implant failures or CA correction loss over 10° were regarded as surgical failures. Multiple linear regression was performed to investigate the risk factors of kyphosis recurrence. Results: Fluoroscopic time (23.7 ± 3.6 vs. 79.3 ± 12.1?s, p < 0.001), operative time (109.6 ± 13.1 vs. 123.8 ± 19.0?min, p = 0.006) and blood loss (104.6 ± 34.9 vs. 129.1 ± 21.7?ml, p = 0.005) were all lower in the IS group. The KP group had lower Visual Analogue Scale scores (3.3 ± 0.9 vs. 2.7 ± 0.8, p = 0.028) and greater anterior body height (ABH) (30.3 ± 9.0 vs. 36.3 ± 11.0%, p = 0.044) after surgery, and less correction loss (5.6 ± 2.7 vs. 0.4 ± 1.2%, p < 0.001). Both groups had a CA correction loss of 4° with a 10% failure rate. The A3 Magerl subclassification, smaller preoperative ABH and smaller postoperative CA had positive correlations with CA correction loss. Conclusion: PSSF with KP provides better back pain relief, greater ABH reduction and less correction loss, while IS has the advantages of less operative time, fluoroscopic time and blood loss. Magerl subclassification of burst fracture is a potential predictor for recurrent kyphosis. Reducing fractured vertebral body height rather than segmental curvature may be more important in PSSF.

"Circulating Heme Oxygenase-1 and Complement Activation in Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy",2019,"Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a severe complication in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The pathogenesis of TA-TMA is still unclear. Previous studies showed that complement activation plays an important role in the development of TA-TMA. However, no data showed which kind of complement component triggers this process. In this study we found that heme oxygenase-1, which could induce decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and inhibit the membrane-attack complex, was significantly decreased in patients with TA-TMA. DAF levels in the TA-TMA group were in line with the levels in the myocardial infarction group but were lower than levels in the healthy, noncomplication, infection, and graft-versus-host disease groups (P <.05). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with TA-TMA plasma showed lower DAF levels compared with that incubated with normal human plasma. Notably, treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a drug against oxidation, increased the level of DAF. NAC could also inhibit complement activation in HUVECs incubated with TA-TMA plasma. Taken together, we propose that NAC represents a new potential therapy for patients facing TA-TMA. ? 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","acetylcysteine; complement component C3b; complement membrane attack complex; decay accelerating factor; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; heme oxygenase 1; messenger RNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; acute graft versus host disease; acute heart infarction; antigen expression; Article; cell protection; clinical article; complement activation; complement dependent cytotoxicity; complement deposition; controlled study; drug efficacy; gene expression regulation; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; graft dysfunction; graft infection; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; human cell; mRNA expression level; promoter region; protein blood level; retrospective study; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy; umbilical vein endothelial cell; upregulation"
"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) plays an important role in neonatal infection",2019,"Objective: To explore the expression and function of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins NOD1 and NOD2 and provide guidance for prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal infection. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from preterm infants, term infants and, healthy adult volunteers. A portion of collected blood was used to examine the expression of NOD1 and NOD2 by real-time PCR. The remaining blood was stimulated in vitro with NOD2 agonist L-Ala-D-Glu-meso (Tri-DAP) or NOD1 agonist muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGln; MDP) for 4 h. Consequently, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: NOD1 expression was found to be decreased in preterm and term newborns compared with adults. NOD2 was significantly lower in preterm infants alone in comparison with adults. After treated by Tri-DAP or MDP, the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in peripheral blood were significantly lower in preterm and term newborns when comparing to adults. Conclusion: NOD1 and NOD2 expression and induced release of pro-inflammatory mediators were impaired in infants, contributing to the high susceptibility of infants to infection. Our results insisted on developing a new immunological approach for prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal infection. ? 2018","caspase recruitment domain protein 15; caspase recruitment domain protein 4; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; tumor necrosis factor; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; caspase recruitment domain protein 4; interleukin 6; lymphotoxin; messenger RNA; NOD1 protein, human; NOD2 protein, human; Article; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine release; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; in vitro study; male; mRNA expression level; newborn; newborn infection; prematurity; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; adult; blood; disease predisposition; gene expression regulation; genetics; infection; metabolism; Adult; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infection; Interleukin-6; Lymphotoxin-alpha; Male; Nod1 Signaling Adaptor Protein; Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein; RNA, Messenger"
"Selective activation of tumor-suppressive MAPKP signaling pathway by triptonide effectively inhibits pancreatic cancer cell tumorigenicity and tumor growth",2019,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, 1K)family members ERK, JNK, and p38 play a divergent role in either promoting tumorigenesis or tumor-suppression. Activation of ERK and JNK promotes tumorigenesis; whereas, escalation of p38 inhibits carcinogenesis. As these three MAPK members are controlled by the common up-stream MAPK signaling proteins which consist of MAPK kinases (2K)and MAPK kinase kinases (3K), how to selectively actuate tumor-suppressive p38, not concurrently stimulate tumorigenic ERK and JNK, in cancer cells is a challenge for cancer researchers, and a new opportunity for novel anti-cancer drug discovery. Using human pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft mice as models, we found that a small molecule triptonide first discerningly activated the up-stream MAPK kinase kinase MEKK4, not the other two 3K members ASK1 and GADD45; and then selectively actuated the middle stream MAPK kinase MKK4, not the other two 2K members MKK3 and MKK6; and followed by activation of the MAPK member p38, not the other two members ERK and JNK. These data suggest that triptonide is a selective MEKK4-MKK4-p38 axis agonist. Consequently, selective activation of the MEKK4-MKK4-p38 signaling axis by triptonide activated tumor suppressor p21 and inhibited CDK3 expression, resulting in cancer cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and marked inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell tumorigenic capability in vitro and tumor growth in xenograft mice. Our findings support the notion that selective activation of tumor-suppressive MEKK4-MKK4-p38-p21signaling pathway by triptonide is a new approach for pancreatic cancer therapy, providing a new drug candidate for development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics. ? 2019","antineoplastic agent; cyclin dependent kinase 3; triptonide; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cell cycle M phase; colony formation; controlled study; DNA content; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; IC50; malignant neoplasm; MAPK signaling; mouse; nonhuman; PANC-1 cell line; pancreas cancer; PaTu 8988t cell line; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; second cervical vertebra; tumor growth; tumor xenograft; Western blotting"
"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate stimulates autophagy and reduces apoptosis levels in retinal M?ller cells under high-glucose conditions",2019,"Retinal neurodegeneration is an early feature in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic process involved in protein and organelle degradation that has been linked in DR. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol in green tea that has beneficial effects in diabetic. however, it is not currently known whether EGCG can regulate M?ller cell autophagy. Here, we showed that EGCG increased autophagy by promoting the formation of autophagosomes, increasing lysosomal acidification, and stimulating autophagic flux in M?ller cells, while high glucose (HG) induced a decrease in autophagy and an increase in apoptosis. However, retinal M?ller cells in HG treated with EGCG showed autophagy machinery activation and reestablishment of cargo degradation, protecting the cells from apoptosis. EGCG could increase the ability of cells to proliferate by increasing autophagy. In an experimental model of diabetic retinopathy, EGCG reduced the reactive gliosis of M?ller cells and decreased retinal damage. These results highlight that HG downregulates autophagy and accumulates P62 cargo due to lysosomal dysfunction and then increases apoptosis, which was reversed by treatment with EGCG. This finding might be valuable for developing a novel therapeutic strategy to treat DR. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","beclin 1; caspase 3; epigallocatechin gallate; glucose; microtubule associated protein 1; microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 i; microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 ii; sequestosome 1; unclassified drug; acidification; animal cell; antiapoptotic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; cell pH; cell protection; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; drug mechanism; gliosis; in vitro study; lysosome; Mueller cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; rat"
"Whole genome sequencing of pairwise human subjects reveals DNA mutations specific to developmental dysplasia of the hip",2019,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)is a common congenital malformation characterized by mismatch in shape between the femoral head and acetabulum, and leads to hip dysplasia. To date, the pathogenesis of DDH is poorly understood and may involve multiple factors, including genetic predisposition. However, comprehensive genetic analysis has not been applied to investigate a genetic component of DDH. In the present study, 10 pairs of healthy fathers and DDH daughters were enrolled to identify genetic hallmarks of DDH using high throughput whole genome sequencing. The DDH-specific DNA mutations were found in each patient. Overall 1344 genes contained DDH-specific mutations. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes played important roles in the cytoskeleton, microtubule cytoskeleton, sarcoplasm and microtubule associated complex. These functions affected osteoblast and osteoclast development. Therefore, we proposed that the DDH-specific mutations might affect bone development, and caused DDH. Our pairwise high throughput sequencing results comprehensively delineated genetic hallmarks of DDH. Further research into the biological impact of these mutations may inform the development of DDH diagnostic tools and allow neonatal gene screening. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","DNA; Article; bone development; cell function; cell maturation; cell structure; child; clinical article; controlled study; cytoskeleton; female; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic predisposition; genetic screening; genetic variation; high throughput sequencing; hip dysplasia; human; infant; male; microtubule; pathogenesis; priority journal; sarcoplasm; whole genome sequencing; adult; congenital hip dislocation; genetics; mutation; pathology; pedigree; preschool child; whole genome sequencing; Adult; Child, Preschool; Female; Hip Dislocation, Congenital; Humans; Infant; Male; Mutation; Osteogenesis; Pedigree; Whole Genome Sequencing"
"Co-delivery of VEGF siRNA and etoposide for enhanced anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferation effect via multi-functional nanoparticles for orthotopic Non-Small cell lung cancer treatment",2019,"Targeting tumor angiogenesis pathway via VEGF siRNA (siVEGF) has shown great potential in treating highly malignant and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, anti-angiogenic monotherapy lacked sufficient antitumor efficacy which suffered from malignant tumor proliferation. Therefore, the combined application of siVEGF and chemotherapeutic agents for simultaneous targeting of tumor proliferation and angiogenesis has been a research hotspot to explore a promising NSCLC therapy regimen. Methods: We designed, for the first time, a rational therapy strategy via intelligently co-delivering siVEGF and chemotherapeutics etoposide (ETO) by multi-functional nanoparticles (NPs) directed against the orthotopic NSCLC. These NPs consisted of cationic liposomes loaded with siVEGF and ETO and then coated with versatile polymer PEGylated histidine-grafted chitosan-lipoic acid (PHCL). We then comprehensively evaluated the anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferation efficiency in the in vitro tumor cell model and in bioluminescent orthotopic lung tumor bearing mice model. Results: The NPs co-delivering siVEGF and ETO exhibited tailor-made surface charge reversal features in mimicking tumor extracellular environment with improved internal tumor penetration capacity and higher cellular internalization. Furthermore, these NPs with flexible particles size triggered by intracellular acidic environment and redox environment showed pinpointed and sharp intracellular cargo release guaranteeing adequate active drug concentration in tumor cells. Enhanced VEGF gene expression silencing efficacy and improved tumor cell anti-proliferation effect were demonstrated in vitro. In addition, the PHCL layer improved the stability of these NPs in neutral environment allowing enhanced orthotopic lung tumor targeting efficiency in vivo. The combined therapy by siVEGF and ETO co-delivered NPs for orthotopic NSCLC simultaneously inhibited tumor proliferation and tumor angiogenesis resulting in more significant suppression of tumor growth and metastasis than monotherapy. Conclusion: Combined application of siVEGF and ETO by the multi-functional NPs with excellent and on-demand properties exhibited the desired antitumor effect on the orthotopic lung tumor. Our work has significant potential in promoting combined anti-angiogenesis therapy and chemotherapy regimen for clinical NSCLC treatment. ?

In our study, we compared the cytogenetic changes and gene mutations (NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and C-KIT)with clinical outcomes in 1132 patients with AML enrolled at our center over a 10-year period. A total of 977 patients provided gene mutation data. There were subsets of patients who exhibited mutations in NPM1 (17.9%), CEBPA (16.4%), FLT3-ITD (18.5%), FLT3-TKD (3.9%), DNMT3A (8.6%), and C-KIT (8.8%). A total of 557 patients (49.2%)underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)as consolidation therapy. Multivariate analysis identified an adverse karyotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; P =.001), the presence of FLT3-ITD (HR, 1.90; P &lt;.001), and receipt of nonstandard first-line induction chemotherapy (HR, 1.45; P =.003)as significant risk factors for poor overall survival (OS), and the presence of CEBPA mut (HR,.42; P &lt;.001)and receipt of HSCT (HR,.35; P &lt;.001)as prognostic factors for favorable OS. In addition, the presence of FLT3-ITD mut (HR, 2.11; P &lt;.001)was identified as an independent risk factor for poor disease-free survival (DFS), and receipt of HSCT was correlated with improved DFS (HR,.74; P =.046).

Aims: To present the epidemiological trends and geographic distributions of four major GI cancers (esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer) in China from 2010 to 2014. Methods: It used standardized data extracted from the National Central Cancer Registry database. Results: The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) of esophageal cancer decreased from 16.7 to 12.2 per 100,000 and the age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) decreased from 12.0 to 8.8 per 100,000. The ASIR and the ASMR of stomach cancer dropped from 23.7 to 19.5 per 100,000 and from 16.6 to 13.3 per 100,000. The ASIR of liver cancer fell from 21.4 to 17.8 per 100,000 and its ASMR fell from 18.4 per 100,000 to 15.3 per 100,000. The ASIR of colorectal cancer increased from 16.1 to 17.5 per 100,000, whereas the ASMR fluctuated between 7.6 and 7.9 per 100,000. Moreover, the incidence and mortality of each cancer differed between males and females, urban and rural residence, as well as various regions. Conclusion: From 2010 to 2014, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer and liver cancer showed downward trend, while the ASIR of colorectal cancer slightly rose and its ASMR presented stable. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","age; Article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer registry; China; colorectal cancer; esophagus cancer; female; geographic distribution; human; liver cancer; major clinical study; male; priority journal; rural area; sex difference; stomach cancer; urban area; adenocarcinoma; adult; aged; colorectal tumor; esophagus tumor; gastrointestinal tumor; incidence; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; mortality; register; rural population; sex factor; squamous cell carcinoma; stomach tumor; urban population; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; China; Colorectal Neoplasms; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Incidence; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Stomach Neoplasms; Urban Population"
"Fatty acid receptor GPR120 promotes breast cancer chemoresistance by upregulating ABC transporters expression and fatty acid synthesis",2019,"Background: Chemoresistance is the major cause of neoadjuvant treatment failure in breast cancer patients. Despite recent progress, the mechanism underlying chemoresistance remains to be further defined. Methods: Expression of G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the biopsies of primary breast cancer who subsequently underwent preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of -function studies were performed to reveal the effects and related mechanism of GPR120 signaling pathway in the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells. Findings: We identified that GPR120, a receptor for long-chain fatty acids, was important for the acquisition of chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. We showed that GPR120 expression was positively associated with clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients. In breast cancer cells, GPR120 enhanced the de novo synthesis of fatty acids that served as GPR120 ligands to activate GPR120 signaling via a feedback mechanism. Upregulated GPR120 signaling rendered cells resistant to epirubicin-induced cell death by upregulating ABC transporters expression and thus decreasing the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin. Akt/NF-κB pathway was responsible for the GPR120-mediated expression of ABC transporters leading to modulation of the concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in cells. The functional importance of GPR120 in chemoresistance was further validated using epirubicin-treated tumor xenografts, in which we showed that blockade of GPR120 signaling with AH7614 or GPR120-siRNA significantly compromised chemoresistance. Interpretation: Our results highlight that GPR120 might be a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer chemoresistance.

"Upregulation of circular RNA CircNFIB attenuates cardiac fibrosis by sponging miR-433",2019,"Cardiac fibrosis is the pathological consequence of fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. As a new class of endogenous non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified in many cardiovascular diseases including fibrosis, generally acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges. Here, we report that the expression of circRNA-circNFIB was decreased in mice post-myocardial infarction heart samples, as well as in primary adult cardiac fibroblasts treated with TGF-β. Forced expression of circNFIB decreased cell proliferation in both NIH/3T3 cells and primary adult fibroblasts as evidenced by EdU incorporation. Conversely, inhibition of circNFIB promoted adult fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, circNFIB was identified as a miR-433 endogenous sponge. Overexpression of circNFIB could attenuate pro-proliferative effects induced by the miR-433 mimic while inhibition of circNFIB exhibited opposite results. Finally, upregulation of circNFIB also reversed the expression levels of target genes and downstream signaling pathways of miR-433. In conclusion, circNFIB is critical for protection against cardiac fibrosis. The circNFIB-miR-433 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of fibrotic diseases. ? 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided totally implantable venous access ports via the right innominate vein in adult patients with cancer: Single-centre experience and protocol",2019,"Background: Totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAPs) are widely used and are an essential tool in the efficient delivery of chemotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of implantation of ultrasound (US)-guided TIVAPs via the right innominate vein (INV) for adult patients with cancer. Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 283 adult patients with cancer who underwent US-guided INV puncture for TIVAPs between September 2015 and September 2017. It also analysed the technical success rate, operation time, and short-term and long-term surgical complications. Results: Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%). The mean operation time was 28.31 ± 7.31 min (range: 23–39 min), and the puncture success rate for the first attempt was 99.30% (281/283). Minor complications included artery puncture during the operation in one patient, but no pneumothorax was encountered. The mean TIVAP time was 304.16 ± 42.54 days (range: 38–502 days). The rate of postoperative complications was 2.83% (8/283), including poor healing of the incision in one patient, catheter-related infections in three patients, port thrombosis in one patient, and fibrin sheath formation in three patients; no catheter malposition, pinch-off syndrome, catheter fracture, or other serious complications were observed. Conclusions: TIVAPs are widely employed for chemotherapy. The present study found that the novel approach of using US-guided INV puncture to implant TIVAPs in adult patients with cancer is both short-termly feasible and safe for long-term central venous access. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology","antibiotic agent; anticoagulant agent; fibrinolytic agent; adult; antibiotic therapy; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; Article; brachiocephalic vein; breast cancer; catheter infection; catheter removal; catheter thrombosis; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; feasibility study; female; fibrin sheath formation; fibrinolytic therapy; human; implantation; interventional ultrasonography; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medical device complication; medical record review; middle aged; operation duration; patient safety; priority journal; retrospective study; stomach cancer; suture technique; vein puncture; wound healing impairment; aged; brachiocephalic vein; central venous catheterization; indwelling catheter; neoplasm; patient safety; postoperative complication; procedures; surgery; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Brachiocephalic Veins; Catheterization, Central Venous; Catheters, Indwelling; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Operative Time; Patient Safety; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional"
"Oncostatin M receptor, positively regulated by SP1, promotes gastric cancer growth and metastasis upon treatment with Oncostatin M",2019,"Background: Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) is a member of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor family that transduces signaling events of Oncostatin M (OSM). OSM–OSMR signaling plays a key role in inflammation and cancer progression. However, the role of OSM–OSMR in gastric cancer (GC) is still unknown. Methods: OSMR expression in GC was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot. The effects of OSM–OSMR on GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and metastasis in vivo were examined. The pathways underlying OSM–OSMR signaling were explored by Western blot. Regulatory mechanism between SP1 and OSMR was explored in vitro. Results: OSMR was highly expressed in GC tissues and its expression level was closely associated with age, T stage, Lauren classification, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage and worse prognosis of patients with GC. Knockdown of OSMR expression in GC cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis and peritoneal metastasis in vivo induced by OSM. These effects mediated by OSM–OSMR were dependent on the activation of STAT3/FAK/Src signaling. SP1 could bind to the promoter region of human OSMR gene from ? 255 to ? 246?bp, and transcriptionally regulated OSMR overexpression in GC cells. Conclusions: OSM–OSMR contributes to GC progression through activating STAT3/FAK/Src signaling, and OSMR is transcriptionally activated by SP1. ? 2019, The International Gastric Cancer Association and The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association.","focal adhesion kinase; oncostatin M; oncostatin M receptor; protein tyrosine kinase; STAT3 protein; transcription factor Sp1; antineoplastic agent; oncostatin M; oncostatin M receptor beta; OSMR protein, human; Sp1 protein, human; STAT3 protein; transcription factor Sp1; tumor marker; adult; age; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer classification; cancer growth; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; dose response; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; major clinical study; male; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneum metastasis; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; stomach cancer; stomach carcinoma; treatment outcome; tumor volume; Western blotting; adenocarcinoma; animal; apoptosis; cell motion; drug effect; drug screening; follow up; gene expression regulation; genetics; lymph node metastasis; metabolism; middle aged; nude mouse; pathology; prognosis; stomach tumor; survival rate; tumor cell culture; tumor invasion; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Oncostatin M; Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit; Prognosis; Signal Transduction; Sp1 Transcription Factor; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Stomach Neoplasms; Survival Rate; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes encapsulated in functional peptide hydrogels promote cardiac repair",2019,"Stem cell-derived exosomes have been recognized as a potential therapy for cardiovascular disease. However, the low retention rate of exosomes after transplantation in vivo remains a major challenge in clinical applications. The aim of this study is to investigate whether human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes (UMSC-Exo) encapsulated in functional peptide hydrogels could increase the retention and stability of exosomes and improve heart function in a rat myocardial infarction model. Our results demonstrated that the PA-GHRPS peptide protected H9C2 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative stress. The gelatinization ability of PA-GHRPS can be enhanced by peptide NapFF. Therefore, these two peptides were mixed to form the PGN hydrogel, which was used to encapsulate exosomes. Our data showed that the PGN hydrogel was able to encapsulate exosomes effectively and ensured a stable and sustained release of exosomes. The exosome/PGN hydrogel mixture was injected into the infarcted border zone of rat hearts. Compared to the exosome treatment alone, the mixture improved the myocardial function by reducing inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis, and by promoting angiogenesis. The strategy used in this study provided a practical and effective method to harness exosomes for myocardial regeneration. ?

"Astragaloside suppresses tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 5 signaling pathway and alleviates neurodegenerative changes in retinal pigment epithelial cells induced by isoflurane",2019,"Epidemiological studies showed that isoflurane, a general anesthetic widely used in surgery including those for the children, is associated with impairment of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which are related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Astragaloside (AS) is an antioxidant derivative from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine Astragalus membraneaceus Bunge. In this study, we used retinal pigment epithelial cells, which share plenty of features with neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and AMD to investigate the effect of AS. Cell cycle re-entry and proapoptosis were seen in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells treated with isoflurane, which was alleviated by pretreatment of AS. Further, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 5 (TRAF5) and downstream nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were investigated to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying protective effect of AS. RPE cells exposed to isoflurane expressed higher TRAF5 and NF-κB than those pretreated with AS, suggesting a critical role of TRAF5 therein. In Morris water maze (MWM) assay, Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with AS and then exposed to isoflurane spent less time in swimming to the platform, and their TRAF5 expression was significantly lower than those received anesthesia alone. Further studies on the consequence of forced downregulation or upregulation are warranted that may employ cutting-edge technologies such as optogenetics to overcome the difficulties in manipulating expression of TRAF5. Although the link between TRAF5 and neurodegeneration requires more in-depth investigations, our study provide a novel hint on the pathological mechanism of isoflurane and suggest a potential target for eliminating persistent side effect of anesthesia. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","amyloid beta protein; antioxidant; aph1b protein; appbp2 protein; astragaloside; caspase 3; caspase 7; cyclin A2; isoflurane; ncstn protein; pold1 protein; protein; protein Cdc42; reactive oxygen metabolite; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 5; unclassified drug; age related macular degeneration; Alzheimer disease; amygdala; anesthesia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle S phase; cell viability; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; down regulation; epithelium cell; flow cytometry; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; intracellular signaling; Morris water maze test; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; optogenetics; oxidative stress; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; rat; retinal pigment epithelium; swimming; upregulation; Western blotting"
"microRNA-4500 inhibits human glioma cell progression by targeting IGF2BP1",2019,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) overexpression promotes glioma cell progression. The aim of the current study is to silence IGF2BP1 in glioma cells by the microRNA (miRNA) strategy. The bio-informatic analyses identified that microRNA-4500 (miR-4500) putatively targets 3′-UTR (3′-untranslated region) of IGF2BP1. In A172 cells and primary human glioma cells ectopic overexpression of the wild-type miR-4500 (but not the mutant form) downregulated IGF2BP1 and its target genes (Gli1, IGF2 and c-Myc). Functional studies show that ectopic miR-4500 overexpression inhibited glioma cell growth, survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. Conversely, in A172 cells miR-4500 inhibition, by a lentiviral construct, increased expression of IGF2BP1 and its targets, promoting cell survival, proliferation and migration. Furthermore, IGF2BP1 knockout by the CRISPR/Cas9 method inhibited A172 cell progression. Significantly, miR-4500 overexpression or miR-4500 inhibition was ineffective in IGF2BP1 knockout A172 cells. At last, we show that miR-4500 levels are downregulated in human glioma tissues, correlating with IGF2BP1 upregulation. Together, we conclude that miR-4500 inhibits human glioma cell progression by targeting IGF2BP1. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","caspase 3; caspase 9; insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1; microRNA; microRNA 4500; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; RNA binding protein; somatomedin B; somatomedin binding protein 1; unclassified drug; 3' untranslated region; A-172 cell line; Article; bioinformatics; cancer diagnosis; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical indicator; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; down regulation; gene expression regulation; gene knockout; gene overexpression; gene silencing; gene targeting; genetic identification; Gli1 gene; glioma cell; human; human cell; human tissue; IGF2 gene; IGF2BP1 gene; oncogene c myc; priority journal; protein cleavage; tumor gene; tumor invasion; U-251MG cell line; upregulation; wild type"
"GLI1 overexpression promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration and induces drug resistance by combining with the AKT-mTOR pathway",2019,"Hedgehog (HH) pathway significantly affected the pathogenesis of Gastric cancer (GC), but the multiple uncanonical HH pathways that are mediated by Zinc Finger protein GLI1 (GLI1) are still unclear. In the present work, we evaluated GLI1 and p-AKT expression in GC using immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. GLI1 and AKT specific shRNA was transfected into GC cell lines to investigate the cross-regulation between HH pathway and AKT-mTOR pathway. The effect of GLI1 and p-AKT on proliferation, migration, and drug resistance were examined. Moreover, a mouse xenograft model of GC was established to verify the role of GLI1 and p-AKT in promoting drug sensitivity in vivo. Our results suggested the clinicopathological factors and prognosis by the differential expression of GLI1 and p-AKT in GC patients. GLI1 was activated by the AKT-mTOR pathway. Co-expression of GLI1 and p-AKT was associated with cell viability, migration, and drug resistance and indicated a poor prognosis in GC patients. Agents targeted against both GLI1 and p-AKT may reverse drug-resistance and achieve better inhibition than agents targeted against a single molecule. There was a significant correlation between the high expression of GLI1 and p-AKT in GC. Additionally, our study confirmed the activity of the AKT-mTOR-GLI1 axis, which provided a new viable field for GC treatment. ? 2019","cisplatin; short hairpin RNA; transcription factor Gli1; GLI1 protein, human; MTOR protein, human; protein kinase B; target of rapamycin kinase; transcription factor Gli1; adult; Akt/mTOR signaling; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer therapy; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; correlational study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene overexpression; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; MKN45 cell line; primary tumor; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; stomach cancer; tumor invasion; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; wedge resection; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; prognosis; signal transduction; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Resistance; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Stomach Neoplasms; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Zinc Finger Protein GLI1"
"Effects of Perioperative Dexmedetomidine on Postoperative Mortality and Morbidity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",2019,"Purpose: Major postoperative complications translate into increased health care resource utilization, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality. We aimed to assess the effects of perioperative dexmedetomidine use on postoperative mortality and the prevalence of major complications after cardiac and noncardiac surgery. Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to analyze all published evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing perioperative dexmedetomidine use versus no dexmedetomidine use in adult patients undergoing cardiac and noncardiac surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes were the durations of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay, and the prevalence of major complications. Findings: Twenty-three studies in cardiac surgery (n = 7635) and 8 studies in noncardiac surgery (n = 1805) were included. In cardiac surgery, dexmedetomidine use reduced postoperative 30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.35 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.51]); durations of mechanical ventilation (mean difference [MD], ?1.56 h [–2.52 to ?0.60]), ICU stay (MD, ?0.22 day [–0.35 to ?0.08]), and hospital stay (MD, ?0.65 day [–1.12 to ?0.18]); and the prevalences of delirium (RR, 0.50 [0.36 to 0.69]), atrial fibrillation (RR, 0.74 [0.57 to 0.97]), and cardiac arrest (RR, 0.34 [0.13 to 0.87]). In noncardiac surgery, dexmedetomidine use was associated with decreases in the durations of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, with a trend toward a lower prevalence of delirium (RR, 0.57 [0.32 to 1.01]). The prevalence of bradycardia was increased in dexmedetomidine-treated patients undergoing cardiac surgery (RR, 1.70 [1.19 to 2.44]) and noncardiac surgery (RR, 1.64 [1.05 to 2.58]). Implications: Dexmedetomidine use may help to reduce postoperative 30-day mortality, durations of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay, and the prevalences of delirium, atrial fibrillation, and cardiac arrest in patients who undergo cardiac surgery. The majority of the benefits of dexmedetomidine were not significant in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. An increased risk for bradycardia should be taken into consideration when prescribing dexmedetomidine.

"Intratumoral delivery of M-CSF by calcium crosslinked polymer micelles enhances cancer immunotherapy",2019,"Immunotherapy has shown promising results in multiple malignancies. However, there are still significant challenges in cancer immunotherapy including the powerful immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and adverse off-target side effects. Nanomaterials with defined physico-biochemical properties are versatile drug delivery platforms that may address these key technical challenges faced by cancer immunotherapy. Here, a tumor acidity-responsive biomacromolecule delivery system was designed to intratumorally deliver an immune-activating cytokine, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and attenuate the acidic microenvironment. This nanoparticle was prepared by introducing CaCO3 as a crosslinker to form an M-CSF-loaded stable micelle (NP/M-CSF/CaCO3). Administration of NP/M-CSF/CaCO3 significantly inhibited tumor growth by enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and reversing the TAM-mediated immunosuppression. This study provides new avenues for cascade amplification of the antitumor effects by targeting the tumor microenvironment. This approach may also help avoid unwanted complications. ?

"Metformin suppresses gastric cancer progression through calmodulin-like protein 3 secreted from tumor-associated fibroblasts",2019,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor types worldwide, with a high morbidity and associated mortality. The interaction between gastric cancer cells and their microenvironment has a significant role in their maintenance and progression. Gastric tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) are among the major regulators of the gastric cancer microenvironment. Metformin, a classical anti-diabetic drug, is known to prevent cancer progression. However, the effect of metformin on gastric TAFs and TAF-associated cancer progression has remained to be elucidated. In the present study, TAFs were isolated from gastric cancer patients, pre-treated with metformin and then co-cultured with gastric cancer cell lines. It was demonstrated that pre-treatment with 200 μM metformin reduced the stimulatory effect of TAFs on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in co-culture, suggesting that metformin impairs the tumor-promoting role of TAFs. Using tandem mass tags-based quantitative proteomic analysis, it was identified that metformin significantly affected the secretion of 32 proteins (14 upregulated and 18 downregulated) in the culture medium of gastric TAFs. Among these proteins, calmodulin-like protein 3 (Calml3) was 2.88-fold upregulated in the culture medium of gastric TAFs after metformin treatment and a further experiment using recombinant Calml3 indicated its suppressive effect on the clonogenicity of gastric cancer cells. It was concluded that metformin suppresses gastric cancer through stimulating Calml3 secretion from TAFs, which represents a novel anticancer mechanism of metformin. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS). Results: In total, 143 lipid species were identified, quantified, and classified into free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of fatty acids palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and arachidonic acid (C20:4), FFA especially palmitic acid (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys. Conversely, the levels of most PE species were obviously reduced in the obese monkeys. Conclusion: Collectively, our work suggests that lipids such as FFA C16:0 and 16:0-LPA may be potential candidates for the diagnosis and study of obesity-related diseases. ? 2019 The Author(s).","arachidonic acid; fatty acid; lysophosphatidic acid; lysophosphatidylcholine; palmitoleic acid; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylglycerol; phosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylserine; sphingomyelin; fatty acid; lysophosphatidic acid; lysophosphatidylcholine; lysophospholipid; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylglycerol; phosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylserine; sphingomyelin; arachidonic acid blood level; Article; controlled study; fatty acid blood level; female; lipid blood level; lipidomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lysophosphatidic acid blood level; lysophosphatidylcholine blood level; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; obesity; palmitoleic acid blood level; phosphatidylcholine blood level; phosphatidylethanolamine blood level; phosphatidylglycerol blood level; phosphatidylinositol blood level; phosphatidylserine blood level; quantitative analysis; rhesus monkey; sphingomyelin blood level; ultra performance liquid chromatography; animal; blood; case control study; classification; lipid metabolism; metabolome; obesity; pathophysiology; veterinary medicine; Animals; Case-Control Studies; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Lipid Metabolism; Lysophosphatidylcholines; Lysophospholipids; Macaca mulatta; Metabolome; Obesity; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Phosphatidylglycerols; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphatidylserines; Sphingomyelins"
"Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 enhances STAT3 signaling and promotes cell growth in non-small-cell lung cancer",2019,"Background and objectives: Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 (USP28) has been reported to play significant roles in several tumors, but its roles in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biological function and molecular mechanisms of USP28 in NSCLC. Materials and methods: Immunoblotting analysis was used to detect relative proteins’ expression. Luciferase assay was performed to explore the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Immunoprecipitation was performed to assess whether USP28 interacted with STAT3 or deubiquitinated STAT3. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the relative mRNA levels of STAT3 and USP28. Cycloheximide chase assay was carried out to examine whether USP28 affected the half-life of STAT3 protein. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and xenograft model were used to assess whether USP28 regulated NSCLC cell growth. Results: In this study, the deubiquitinating enzyme USP28 was found to mediate STAT3 signaling in NSCLC cells. USP28 interacted with STAT3, and increased the stability of STAT3 by inducing its deubiquitination. Further studies showed that USP28 was upregulated in both the primary tissues and cell lines of NSCLC. The Kaplan–Meier plotter also indicated that USP28 predicted a poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Moreover, knockdown of USP28 inhibited cell growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and delayed NSCLC tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that USP28 was functional in NSCLC cells, and promoted NSCLC cell growth by inducing STAT3 signaling. This suggests that USP28 could be a novel target for NSCLC therapy. ? 2019 Li et al.","cycloheximide; deubiquitinase; messenger RNA; STAT3 protein; ubiquitin specific peptidase 28; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cell growth; controlled study; deubiquitination; female; gene knockdown; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; Kaplan Meier method; luciferase assay; lung carcinogenesis; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein stability; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transcription initiation; tumor xenograft; upregulation"
"Impact of RSV coinfection on human bocavirus in children with acute respiratory infections",2019,"Objective: The objective of this study was to assess epidemiological and clinical features of human bocavirus (HBoV) coinfection with other viruses. Method: Children coinfected with HBoV between January 2012 and December 2014 were enrolled and retrospectively reviewed. Result: A total of 984 patients were stratified into five groups: HBoV infection alone (n = 249), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection alone (n = 649), HBoV coinfection with RSV (n = 28), with human rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 39) and with other virus (n = 19). Length of hospitalization was longer in HBoV coinfection with RSV group than HBoV (9.0 days vs. 7.0 days, p = 0.001), RSV (9.0 days vs. 8.0 days, p = 0.016) infection alone group. Pneumonia was more common in the HBoV coinfection with RSV group compared with the HBoV, RSV infection alone group, respectively (75.0% vs. 44.2%, 31.3%, p < 0.001). HBoV DNA copy numbers (383 000 copies/ml) were positively correlated with the length of hospitalization (r = 0.334, p < 0.001). Conclusion: HBoV coinfection with RSV increases HBoV infection severity. ? The Author(s) [2018]. Published by Oxford University Press.

"Exosomes from Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin-Activated Dendritic Cells Promote Th2 Differentiation through the OX40 Ligand",2019,"Objectives: Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released from various inflammatory cells, such as T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and mast cells, which have been implicated in the modulation of immune response in asthma. This study aimed to investigate whether exosomes from DCs activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) play a role in T-helper cell differentiation through the OX40 ligand (OX40L). Methods: Serum samples from patients with asthma were collected to measure the levels of OX40L, T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ, and T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Exosomes were isolated from TSLP-activated DCs and co-cultured with CD4+ T cells. Western blot and ELISA assays were used to measure the levels of OX40L, IFN-γ, and IL-4 in DCs and CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry was applied to detect Th1 and Th2 cells. Results: OX40L and IL-4 were increased and IFN-γwas decreased in serum from asthmatic patients compared with healthy controls. TSLP induced DCs to express OX40L in released exosomes, which could promote proliferation of CD4+ T cells, elevate the level of IL-4, and promote Th2 differentiation. Conclusion: Blockade of OX40L in DC-derived exosomes could inhibit exosome-mediated CD4+ T proliferation and Th2 differentiation. ? 2018 S.

"NCR ? group 3 innate lymphoid cells orchestrate IL-23/IL-17 axis to promote hepatocellular carcinoma development",2019,"Background: Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a newly discovered family of immune cells that have similar cytokine-secreting profiles as T helper cell subsets. Although ILCs are critical for host defense against infections and tissue homeostasis, their roles in tumor development are not well established. Methods: We studied the function of ILC3 cells in the liver for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in murine HCC models using flow cytometry, adoptive transfer, and in vitro functional assays. Findings: We found that ILC3 lacking the natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor (NCR ? ILC3) promoted the development of HCC in response to interleukin 23 (IL-23). IL-23 serum level is elevated in HCC patients and its high expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We found that IL-23 could promote tumor development in murine HCC tumor models. IL-23 promoted the expansion of NCR ? ILC3 and its differentiation from group 1 ILCs (ILC1s). Furthermore, NCR ? ILC3 initiated IL-17 production upon IL-23 stimulation and directly inhibited CD8 + T cell immunity by promoting lymphocyte apoptosis and limiting their proliferation. Interpretation: Together, our findings suggest that NCR ? ILC3 initiates the IL-17-rich immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promotes the development of HCC, thus may serve as a promising target for future cancer immunotherapy.

"The safety of triple antiplatelet therapy under thromboelastography guidance in patients undergoing stenting for ischemic cerebrovascular disease",2019,"Objective To investigate the safety of triple antiplatelet therapy (TAT) with cilostazol in patients undergoing stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis. Methods A prospectively collected database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis and showed resistance to aspirin and/or clopidogrel as assessed by pre-stenting thromboelastography (TEG) testing. Patients were assigned to a TAT group and a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) group. Major complications were defined as thromboembolic events (transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, and stent thrombosis) or major bleeding events within 30 days, and minor complications were defined as extracranial bleeding that did not require vascular surgery or transfusion within 30 days. Results A total of 183 patients were identified. The incidence of major complications was significantly lower in the TAT group than in the DAT group (TAT group vs. DAT group, 1/110 vs. 6/73; P=0.017). TIAs occurred in four patients, with one in the TAT group and three in the DAT group (1/110 vs. 3/73; P=0.303). Ischemic strokes occurred in three patients in the DAT group (TAT group vs. DAT group, P=0.062). No major bleeding events or stent thrombosis was recorded in either group. Two patients (one in each group) experienced minor complications that resolved without additional treatment (1/110 vs. 1/73; P>0.999). Conclusions TAT under TEG guidance appears to be a safe antiplatelet strategy in patients undergoing stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis. By employing TAT under TEG guidance, favorable outcomes can be achieved in these patients. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"Influenza vaccination coverage among US children from 2004/2005 to 2015/2016",2019,"Background Quantify the influenza vaccine coverage is essential to identify emerging concerns and to immunization programs for targeting interventions. Methods Data from National Health Interview Survey were used to estimate receipt of at least one dose of influenza vaccination among children 6 months to 17 years of age. Results Influenza vaccination coverage increased from 16.70% during 2004/2005 to 49.43% during 2015/2016 (3.18% per year, P < 0.001); however, the coverage increased slightly after 2010/2011. Children at high risk of influenza complications had higher influenza vaccination coverage than non at-risk children. Boys and girls had similar coverage each year. While the coverage increased from 2004/2005 to 2015/2016 for all age groups, the coverage decreased with age each year (-0.64 to -1.58% per age group). There was a higher and rapid increase of coverage in Northeast than Midwest, South and West. American Indian or Alaskan Native and Asian showed higher coverage than other race groups (White, Black/African American, Multiple race). Multivariable analysis showed that high-risk status and region had the greatest associations with levels of vaccine coverage. Conclusions Although the influenza vaccination coverage among children had increased remarkably since 2004/2005, establishing more effective immunization programs are warranted to achieve the Healthy People 2020 target. ?

"A review of arsenic exposure and lung cancer",2019,"As a well-established human carcinogen, arsenic has increased the risk of lung cancer over the past decades. Wide exposure to arsenic in the environment has attracted the attention of scientists. Its carcinogenicity at early life stages has been observed in certain animal studies already, yet current evidence is insufficient to extrapolate this to humans. Although the mechanisms of lung cancer induced by arsenic remain unclear, most of them are related to the biotransformation of arsenic, which would further provide target sites for precaution and therapy. This review comprehensively summarizes current studies associated to arsenic exposure and lung cancer and the mechanism of its carcinogenesis in lung cancer in three sections, namely, epidemiological studies, experimental studies, and mechanistic studies. In addition, prevention and treatment strategies as well as directions for future studies are discussed. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.","arsenic; histone; microRNA; autophagy; biotransformation; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer prevention; DNA repair; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; epigenetics; experimental study; gene expression; human; lung cancer; lung carcinogenesis; priority journal; Review; signal transduction"
"Prognostic role of preoperative platelet, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: A multicenter prospective study",2019,"Background: The relationships between coagulation factors and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis have been intensively studied. However, no previous study has investigated the combined effects of preoperative platelet (PLT), fibrinogen (FIB), and D-dimer (D-D) levels on the prognosis of NSCLC. Methods: A multicenter prospective study was conducted over seven hospitals. A total of 395 patients diagnosed with operable NSCLC for the first time were included and followed-up until disease progression or the end of the study. Baseline demographic and clinicopathological information, and preoperative coagulation test results were collected for each patient. Univariate and multilevel survival analyses were conducted using Cox regression and shared frailty models. Results: Multilevel analyses revealed that there was a marginally significant association between elevated PLT level (&gt; 215 × 10 9 /L) and unfavorable progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio 2.42, P = 0.05), whereas preoperative FIB and D-D were not significant prognostic factors for PFS (P = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Compared to patients with one elevation of the three coagulation factors, patients with at least two elevations of the three factors had a significantly higher risk of cancer progression (hazard ratio 4.62, P = 0.02). Conclusion: The number of elevated preoperative coagulation factors may have a significant effect on PFS and could be used to predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients after surgery. Future studies are warranted to further investigate the interactions between these three coagulation factors. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Interaction of EZH2 and P65 is involved in the arsenic trioxide-induced anti-angiogenesis in human triple-negative breast cancer cells",2019,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female malignancy in the world. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of BC characterized by the lack of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), resulting in the limited therapeutic options. Due to the aggressive behaviors at early stage, TNBC exhibits poorer outcomes compared to other BC subtypes. Hematogenous metastasis, which spreads cancerous cells to lungs and/or bones, plays a pivotal role in the progression of TNBC. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the anti-angiogenesis regulation mechanism for finding new treatment options for TNBC. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) exhibits anti-cancer effect on solid tumors, including TNBC. However, the roles and the molecular mechanism of ATO in the anti-angiogenesis of TNBC remain less well documented. Our data showed that ATO restrained the expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and impaired the angiogenic ability in TNBC cells. In addition, ATO suppressed the angiogenic ability in TNBC by inhibiting the interaction of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) with p65, downregulating the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, hence contributing to the regulation of IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway. All of our findings would help to better understand the mechanism of ATO anti-angiogenesis in TNBC, thus highlighting the therapeutic potential of ATO in TNBC by targeting angiogenesis. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","arsenic trioxide; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; STAT3 protein; synaptotagmin I; transcription factor EZH2; vasculotropin; antiangiogenic activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; drug mechanism; human; human cell; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein secretion; signal transduction; triple negative breast cancer"
"Mutant and wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 share enhancing mechanisms involving distinct tyrosine kinase cascades in cancer",2019,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is important for reductive carboxylation in cancer cells, and the IDH1 R132H mutation plays a pathogenic role in cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the regulatory mechanisms modulating mutant and/ or wild-type (WT) IDH1 function remain unknown. Here, we show that two groups of tyrosine kinases (TK) enhance the activation of mutant and WT IDH1 through preferential Y42 or Y391 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Y42 phosphorylation occurs in IDH1 monomers, which promotes dimer formation with enhanced substrate (isocitrate or α-ketoglutarate) binding, whereas Y42-phosphorylated dimers show attenuated disruption to monomers. Y391 phosphorylation occurs in both monomeric and dimeric IDH1, which enhances cofactor (NADP+ or NADPH) binding. Diverse oncogenic TKs phosphorylate IDH1 WT at Y42 and activate Src to phosphorylate IDH1 at Y391, which contributes to reductive carboxylation and tumor growth, whereas FLT3 or the FLT3-ITD mutation activates JAK2 to enhance mutant IDH1 activity through phosphorylation of Y391 and Y42, respectively, in AML cells. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated an intrinsic connection between oncogenic TKs and activation of WT and mutant IDH1, which involves distinct TK cascades in related cancers. In particular, these results provide an additional rationale supporting the combination of FLT3 and mutant IDH1 inhibitors as a promising clinical treatment of mutant IDH1-positive AML. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","2 oxoglutaric acid; CD135 antigen; dimer; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; isocitric acid; Janus kinase 2; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; peptides and proteins; platelet derived growth factor receptor; protein kinase p60; protein tyrosine kinase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; tyrosine protein kinase abl 1; unclassified drug; acute myeloid leukemia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; binding assay; binding site; carboxylation; cell counting; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; density gradient centrifugation; dimerization; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetic assay; enzyme substrate complex; flow cytometry; gene mutation; genetic transfection; genetic variability; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; lipogenesis; lung cancer; malignant neoplasm; mouse; nonhuman; protein binding; protein phosphorylation; spectrophotometry; tumor growth; Western blotting"
"Identification of key genes and pathways downstream of the β-catenin-TCF7L1 complex in pancreatic cancer cells using bioinformatics analysis",2019,"As a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, the β-catenin-transcription factor 7 like 1 (TCF7L1) complex activates transcription and regulates downstream target genes that serve important roles in the pathology of pancreatic cancer. To identify associated key genes and pathways downstream of the β-catenin-TCF7L1 complex in pancreatic cancer cells, the current study used the gene expression profiles GSE57728 and GSE90926 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. GSE57728 is an array containing information regarding β-catenin knockdown and GSE90926 was developed by high throughput sequencing to provide information regarding TCF7L1 knockdown. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were sorted separately and the shared 88 DEGs, including 37 upregulated and 51 downregulated genes, were screened. Clustering analysis of these DEGs was performed by heatmap analysis. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were then performed using FunRich software and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, which revealed that the DEGs were predominantly enriched in terms associated with transport, transcription factor activity, and cytokine and chemokine mediated signaling pathway process. A DEG-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, consisting of 58 nodes and 171 edges, was then constructed using Cytoscape software and the 15 genes with top node degrees were selected as the hub genes. Overall survival (OS) analysis of the 88 DEGs was performed and the relevant gene expression datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Consequently, three upregulated and seven downregulated genes were identified to be associated with prognosis. Furthermore, high expression levels of five downregulated genes, including CXCL5, CYP27C1, FUBP1, CDK14 and TRIM24, were associated with worse OS. In addition, CDK14 and TRIM24 were revealed as hub genes in the PPI network and both were confirmed to be involved in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Promoter analysis was also applied to the five downregulated DEGs associated with prognosis, which revealed that TCF7L1 may serve as a transcription factor of the DEGs. In conclusion, the genes and pathways identified in the current study may provide potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Risk of Cardiovascular Involvement in Patients with Primary Sj?gren’s Syndrome: a large-scale cross-sectional cohort study [Risk of Cardiovascular Involvement in Patients with Primary Sj?gren's Syndrome: a large-scale cross-sectional cohort study]",2019,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of cardiovascular involvement and analyze potential risk factors independently associated with cardiovascular involvement in primary Sj?gren's syndrome (PSS) patients. METHODS: We recruited a cohort of 367 PSS patients and 367 age- and gender-matched controls from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, and overt cardiovascular involvement events were recorded. Potential risk factors associated with cardiovascular involvement were determined by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: PSS patients had a significantly higher cardiovascular involvement rate than that of the controls (61.6% versus 29.7%; p<0.01). Compared with PSS patients without cardiovascular involvement, those with cardiovascular involvement were significantly older; had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipemia; were more likely to have extraglandular organ involvement; and had a higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (all p<0.05). In the multivariate analysis, age, hypertension, and extraglandular organ involvement were found to be risk factors independently correlated with cardiovascular events in PSS patients. CONCLUSIONS: PSS patients are more vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In addition to traditional CVD risk factors such as age and hypertension, extraglandular organ involvement was found to be independently associated with cardiovascular involvement in PSS patients, which suggests the need for early detection and prevention measures to improve the prognosis in those patients.","C reactive protein; adult; age; blood; cardiovascular disease; case control study; complication; diabetic angiopathy; female; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; hypoalbuminemia; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; prevalence; risk factor; Sjoegren syndrome; Adult; Age Factors; C-Reactive Protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Diabetic Angiopathies; Female; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Hypertension; Hypoalbuminemia; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sjogren's Syndrome"
"Translation of bone wax and its substitutes: History, clinical status and future directions",2019,"Bone wax, primarily composed of beeswax and softening agent, is a century-old material used to control bleeding of disrupted bone surfaces by acting as a mechanical barrier to seal the wound. The current bone wax products are commonly packed in easy-to-open foil in the form of sterile sticks or plates, with excellent malleability and smooth consistency, enabling cost-effective and easy handling approach for bleeding control. It has also been reported that the inert nature of bone wax causes complications including foreign body reaction, infection promotion and bone healing inhibition. With the advances in biomaterials and the market boost of bone haemostatic materials, the arena of bone wax substitute research has expanded to a wide spectrum of material formulations and forms. However, the development of substitutes of bone wax for translation is a pivotal yet challenging topic because currently a potential candidate is recommended to be just as simple to use, effective and inexpensive to produce as traditional bone wax but also be absorbable and osteogenic. This review provides an overview of bone wax including its history, clinical applications and associated complication. In addition, emerging substitutes of bone wax and outlooks of future directions including the standardised evaluation methods are also discussed as an effort to catalyse the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future. The translational potential of this article: Occurrence of osseous haemorrhage is common in surgically incised or traumatically fractured bone. It is essential to stop bone bleeding to avoid further pathologic consequences such as tissue necrosis and eventually mortalities due to blood loss. Medical sterile bone wax is a classical material for haemostasis of bone during orthopaedic surgeries, thoracic surgeries, neurological surgeries and so on. Along with its widespread use, complications such as foreign body reaction, bone healing inhibition and infection promotion associated with bone wax are observed. With the growing knowledge in biomaterials and the boost of market of bone haemostatic materials, bone wax substitute research is thriving. An overview of bone and its substitutes together with evolution of their design criteria is carried out in this work, providing information for the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future. ? 2019 The Authors","bioceramics; bone wax; calcium phosphate; chitosan; hydroxyapatite; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; microcrystalline collagen; molecular scaffold; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; angiogenesis; biological activity; bleeding; bone development; bone regeneration; cauterization; cell proliferation; compressive strength; coronary artery bypass graft; cost effectiveness analysis; discectomy; drug delivery system; drug formulation; foreign body reaction; human; hydrogel; immune response; microenvironment; ossification; osteomyelitis; postoperative complication; Review; tissue engineering; tissue necrosis; total knee arthroplasty"
"Nomogram incorporating clinicopathological parameters to predict the survival of patients with mantle cell lymphoma",2019,"This study intended to present a practicable prognostic nomogram for patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The clinical data of 281 patients were reviewed. A nomogram that could predict overall survival (OS) was constructed based on the Cox proportional hazard model. To compare the capacity of the nomogram with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI) scoring systems, we used the concordance index (C-index) to validate the veracity and the calibration curve.

"Recent advances in oncolytic virus-based cancer therapy",2019,"Administration of oncolytic viruses (OVs) is an emerging anticancer strategy that exploits the lytic nature of viral replication to enhance the killing of malignant cells. OVs can be used as tools to directly induce cancer cell death and to trigger local and/or systemic immune responses to metastatic cancer in vivo. The effectiveness of OV therapy was initially highlighted by the clinical use of the genetically modified herpes virus, talimogene laherparepvec, for melanoma therapy. A number of OVs are now being evaluated as potential treatments for cancer in clinical trials. In spite of being engineered to specifically target tumor cells, the safety and off-target effects of OV therapy are a concern. The potential safety concerns of OVs are highlighted by current clinical trial criteria, which exclude individuals harbouring other viral infections and people who are immunocompromised. Despite the potential for adverse effects, clinical trials to date revealed relatively minimal adverse immune-related effects, such as fever. With advances in our understanding of virus replication cycles, several novel OVs have emerged. Reverse genetic systems have facilitated the insertion of anticancer genes into a range of OVs to further enhance their tumor-killing capacity. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in OV therapy for a range of human cancers in in vitro and in in vivo animal studies. We further discuss the future of OVs as a therapeutic strategy for a range of life-threatening cancers. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","oncolytic virus; cancer therapy; glioblastoma; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer; melanoma; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; priority journal; Review; virotherapy"
"Alpha-enolase promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via regulating AKT signaling pathway",2019,"Increased aerobic glycolysis is considered as a hallmark of cancer and targeting key glycolytic enzymes will be a promising therapeutic approach in cancer treatment. Alpha-enolase (ENO1), as a prominent glycolytic enzyme, is upregulated in multiple cancers and its overexpression is involved in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of ENO1 in the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). Here, we found that ENO1 expression was upregulated in human GC and was associated with Lauren type, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TNM stage. Knockdown of ENO1 attenuated GC cell proliferation and metastasis and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress in vitro while ENO1 overexpression did the opposite. ENO1 could modulate AKT signaling pathway in GC cells and the enhanced proliferation and migration ability induced by ENO1 overexpression was impaired after incubation with PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 in SGC7901 cells. Our data demonstrated that ENO1 enhances GC cell proliferation and metastasis through the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, indicating that ENO1/AKT signaling axis may serve as a potential target for treatment of GC. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; alpha enolase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; DNA binding protein; ENO1 protein, human; enolase; protein kinase B; tumor marker; tumor suppressor protein; adult; aged; Akt signaling; Article; cancer cell; cancer growth; cancer staging; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme induction; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene knockdown; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; SGC-7901 cell line; stomach cancer; cell proliferation; gene expression regulation; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycolysis; Humans; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Phosphopyruvate Hydratase; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Stomach Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"Long-term prognostic significance of interleukin-17-producing T cells in patients with non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"The presence of interleukin (IL)-17-producing T cells has recently been reported in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the long-term prognostic significance of these populations in NSCLC patients remains unknown. In the present study, we collected peripheral blood from 82 NSCLC patients and 22 normal healthy donors (NC). Percentages of IL-17-producing CD4+T (Th17), CD8+T (Tc17) and γδT cells (γδT17) were measured to determine their association with clinical outcomes and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC. All NSCLC patients were followed up until July 2018. Median follow-up time was 13.5?months (range 1-87?months). The 3- and 5-year survival rate was 27% and 19.6%, respectively. We found that Th17 cells and γδT17 cells were significantly increased, whereas Tc17 cells were markedly decreased in patients with NSCLC compared with those in NC. In addition, Th17 cells were significantly positively associated with T helper type 1 cells (Th1), whereas γδT17 cells were significantly negatively associated with γδT + interferon (IFN)-γ+ cells. High percentages of peripheral Tc17 cells were significantly associated with favorable 5-year OS (P?=.025), especially in patients with early TNM stage (P?=.016). Furthermore, high percentages of peripheral Th17 cells were positively associated with favorable 5-year OS in patients with late TNM stage (P?=.002). However, no significant association was observed between γδT17 cells and OS, regardless of the TNM stage. In conclusion, our findings suggest that enhanced Th17 and reduced Tc17 cells in the peripheral blood could be a significant predictor of a favorable prognosis for NSCLC patients. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Targeting Keap1 by miR-626 protects retinal pigment epithelium cells from oxidative injury by activating Nrf2 signaling",2019,"Activation of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) cascade can offer significant protection against oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Here, we identified a novel kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-targeting microRNA, microRNA-626 (miR-626) that activates Nrf2 signaling. In ARPE-19 cells and primary human RPE cells, ectopic overexpression of miR-626 targeting the 3′-UTR (3′-untranslated region) of Keap1 downregulated its expression, promoting Nrf2 protein stabilization and nuclear translocation, leading to expression of ARE-dependent genes (HO1, NOQ1 and GCLC). Functional studies showed that miR-626 protected RPE cells from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative injury. Conversely, miR-626 inhibition induced Keap1 upregulation and Nrf2 cascade inhibition, exacerbating oxidative injury in RPE cells. Further studies demonstrated that miR-626 was ineffective in Keap1-knockout or Nrf2-knockout RPE cells. Importantly, miR-626 also activated Keap1-Nrf2 signaling cascade in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) and primary human retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), providing protection from H2O2. At last, we show that plasma miR-626 levels are significantly downregulated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients than those in the healthy donors. We conclude that targeting Keap1 by miR-626 protects RPE cells and other ophthalmic cells from oxidative injury via activation of Nrf2 signaling cascade. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","hydrogen peroxide; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; microRNA; transcription factor Nrf2; visual pigment; 3' untranslated region; age related macular degeneration; ARPE-19 cell line; Article; cell protection; controlled study; donor; down regulation; epithelium cell; GCLC gene; gene; gene knockout; gene overexpression; gene targeting; gene translocation; HO1 gene; human; human cell; NOQ1 gene; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein analysis; protein stability; protein targeting; retina ganglion cell; retinal pigment epithelium; signal transduction; upregulation"
"Identification of a Novel Bcl-2 Inhibitor by Ligand-Based Screening and Investigation of Its Anti-cancer Effect on Human Breast Cancer Cells",2019,"Bcl-2 family protein is an important factor in regulating apoptosis and is associated with cancer. The anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2, are overexpression in numerous tumors, and contribute to cancer formation, development, and therapy resistance. Therefore, Bcl-2 is a promising target for drug development, and several Bcl-2 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials. In this study, we carried out a QSAR-based virtual screening approach to develop potential Bcl-2 inhibitors from the SPECS database. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay was performed to examine the interaction between Bcl-2 protein and the screened inhibitors. After that, we measured the anti-tumor activities of the 8 candidate compounds, and found that compound M1 has significant cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cells. We further proved that compound M1 downregulated Bcl-2 expression and activated apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, we identified a novel Bcl-2 inhibitor by QSAR screening, which exerted significant cytotoxic activity in breast cancer cells through inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. ? 2019 Wen, Deng, Jiang, Guan, Wu, Wang, Xiao, Zhang, Yang, Cao and Cheng.

"Dual PI3K-BRD4 inhibitor SF1126 inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo",2019,"Background/Aims: Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are key oncogenic cascades in colorectal cancer (CRC). SF1126 is a novel and potent PI3K-BRD4 dual inhibitor. Methods: CRC cells and human colon epithelial cells were treated with SF1126. Cell survival was tested by MTT and soft agar colony formation assays. Cell proliferation was tested by BrdU ELISA method. Cell apoptosis was tested by a TUNEL staining method and Histone DNA ELISA. Western blotting was utilized to test the signaling proteins. A HT-29 xenograft mice model was established to study the anti-tumor activity of SF1126 in vivo. Results: SF1126 potently inhibited the survival, proliferation, and progression of the cell cycle in an established CRC cell line (HT-29) and primary human colon cancer cells. Significant activation of apoptosis was detected in SF1126-treated CRC cells. In CRC cells, SF1126 blocked Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex1/2 signaling and downregulated BRD4 target proteins (Myc and cyclin D1). Further studies showed that SF1126 activated p38 signaling in CRC cells. In contrast, the p38 inhibitors or p38 short hairpin RNA inhibited SF1126-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in CRC cells. In vivo, subcutaneous administration of SF1126 significantly inhibited HT-29 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Conclusion: SF1126 inhibits CRC cell growth possibly by targeting PI3K-Akt-mTOR, BRD4, and p38 signaling. ? 2019 The Author(s).","bromodomain containing protein 4; cyclin D1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; Myc protein; protein kinase B; transcription factor; unclassified drug; [1 (4 oxo 8 phenyl 4h 1 benzopyran 2 yl)morpholinio]methoxysuccinylarginylglycylaspartylserine acetate; BRD4 protein, human; chromone derivative; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; mitogen activated protein kinase 14; nuclear protein; oligopeptide; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; transcription factor; [1 (4 oxo 8 phenyl 4h 1 benzopyran 2 yl)morpholinio]methoxysuccinylarginylglycylaspartylserine acetate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; cell survival; colon epithelium; colorectal cancer; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug potency; drug targeting; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; tumor xenograft; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell cycle checkpoint; colorectal tumor; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; RNA interference; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chromones; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2; Mice; Mice, Nude; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14; Nuclear Proteins; Oligopeptides; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Transplantation, Heterologous"
"Histogram analysis of diffusion kurtosis imaging in the differentiation of malignant from benign breast lesions",2019,"Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of histogram analysis of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in breast lesions. Materials and methods: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Seventy-two breast lesions (30 benign and 42 malignant) in 71 patients were histopathologically confirmed. All breast lesions were evaluated by 3.0-T diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with 4 b-values of 0, 500, 800, and 2000s/mm2 and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Histogram analyses of conventional DWI and DKI were performed using FireVoxel software for whole lesions. The parameters included apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), diffusivity (D), and kurtosis (K). The metrics of ADC and DKI parameters (D and K) for benign lesions were compared with those for malignant lesions. The effectiveness of the ADC and DKI parameters (D and K) for diagnosing breast lesions was analysed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) regression models. Results: For the malignant breast lesions, the mean, median, and 10th/25th/75th percentile values of ADC and D were significantly lower, while the skewness of ADC and D were significantly higher in comparison of the benign lesions(all p &lt; 0.05). The malignant lesions had significantly higher mean, median, and 10th/25th/75th/90th percentile K values than did the benign lesions (all p &lt; 0.05). Within each set of parameters, the 10th percentile ADC (Az = 0.752) and D, (Az = 0.834) coupled with the 75th percentile K (Az = 0.904) were the best metrics for differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions. After comparing the parameters in pairs, the Az for the 75th percentile K was significantly higher than that for the 10th percentile ADC (p = 0.0321) in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions. When comparing the combination of the 75th percentile K and the 10th percentile D (Az = 0.937) with the 10th percentile D, 75th percentile K and the mean K, a significantly higher Az was observed for the combination than that for the 10th percentile D and the mean K (p = 0.0097 and p = 0.0431, respectively). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the combination of the 75th percentile K and the 10th percentile D were 85.71% and 93.33%, respectively. Conclusion: Histogram analysis of DKI can accurately reflect the histologic characteristics and heterogeneity and is a reliable method for diagnosing breast lesions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adolescent; adult; Article; benign breast tumor; breast cancer; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; diffusion kurtosis imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; female; histogram; histopathology; human; image analysis; imaging and display; major clinical study; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; breast tumor; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; Breast Neoplasms; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity"
"Effects of acrylate/acrylamide polymers on the adhesion, growth and differentiation of Muse cells",2019,"Background. Acrylate/acrylamide copolymers have excellent optical properties and biocompatibility and are ideal biomaterials that have been widely used in tissue engineering. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cells (Muse cells) are a specific subset of mesenchymal stem cells that have an excellent potential for the regenerative medicine. Objective. This study was designed to investigate the effects of acrylate/acrylamide copolymers on the adhesion, proliferation and pluripotent-like properties of Muse cells, which were derived from normal human dermal fibroblasts by long-term trypsin incubation. Methods. In an initial experiment, Muse cells were seeded on primary microarrays containing micro-spots of 275 different mixtures of acrylate/acrylamide. Each mixture was composed of two of 11 different monomers in various proportions, and was replicated in four micro-spots each. According to the adhesion and growth characteristics of Muse cells on those substrates, specific polymer candidates for Muse cells were selected and secondary microarrays were prepared. We then observed the effects of those specific polymer candidates on the adherence, proliferation and differentiation of Muse cells and suitable candidates for their optimal culture were identified. Results. According to the adhesion and growth patterns of Muse cells on the primary microarrays, ten suitable mixtures of acrylate/acrylamide copolymers were identified. Muse cells grew well on six of those combinations and around the four other combinations of those polymer mixtures. Muse cells cultured on three of those combinations proliferated and differentiated into long spindle-shaped cells that looked like fibroblasts, while Muse cells cultured on one combination formed clusters that were ring-shaped. Muse cells cultured on some of those combinations of acrylate/acrylamide proliferated and formed clusters that appeared to be very healthy, whereas Muse cells cultured on other combinations formed clusters that expanded outwards. Conclusions. These results identified a polymer combination that was optimum for the adhesion, proliferation and maintenance of Muse cells in an undifferentiated state. ? 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","monomer; polyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; acrylamide; acrylic acid derivative; biomaterial; polymer; trypsin; Article; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell proliferation; controlled study; human; human cell; mesenchymal stem cell; microarray analysis; multilineage differentiating stress enduring cell; normal human; skin fibroblast; spindle cell; ultraviolet radiation; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell proliferation; chemistry; DNA microarray; drug effect; fibroblast; male; mesenchymal stem cell; metabolism; procedures; regenerative medicine; skin; tissue engineering; tissue microarray; Acrylamide; Acrylates; Biocompatible Materials; Cell Adhesion; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cell Proliferation; Fibroblasts; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymers; Regenerative Medicine; Skin; Tissue Array Analysis; Tissue Engineering; Trypsin"
"Substrate stiffness- and topography-dependent differentiation of annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells is regulated by Yes-associated protein",2019,"Annulus fibrosus (AF) tissue engineering has attracted increasing attention as a promising therapy for degenerative disc disease (DDD). However, regeneration of AF still faces many challenges due to the tremendous complexity of this tissue and lack of in-depth understanding of the structure-function relationship at cellular level within AF is highly required. In light of the fact that AF is composed of various types of cells and has gradient mechanical, topographical and biochemical features along the radial direction. In this study, we aimed to achieve directed differentiation of AF-derived stem cells (AFSCs) by mimicking the mechanical and topographical features of native AF tissue. AFSCs were cultured on four types of electrospun poly(ether carbonate urethane)urea (PECUU) scaffolds with various stiffness and fiber size (soft, small size; stiff, small size; soft, large size and stiff, large size). The results show that with constant fiber size, the expression level of the outer AF (oAF) phenotypic marker genes in AFSCs increased with the scaffold stiffness, while that of inner AF (iAF) phenotypic marker genes showed an opposite trend. When scaffold stiffness was fixed, the expression of oAF phenotypic marker genes in AFSCs increased with fiber size. While the expression of iAF phenotypic marker genes decreased. Such substrate stiffness- and topography-dependent changes of AFSCs was in accordance with the genetic and biochemical distribution of AF tissue from the inner to outer regions. Further, we found that the Yes-associated protein (YAP) was translocated to the nucleus in AFSCs cultured with increasing stiffness and fiber size of scaffolds, yet it remained mostly phosphorylated and cytosolic in cells on soft scaffolds with small fiber size. Inhibition of YAP down-regulated the expression of tendon/ligament-related genes, whereas expression of the cartilage-related genes was upregulated. The results illustrate that matrix stiffness is a potent regulator of AFSC differentiation. Moreover, we reveal that fiber size of scaffolds induced changes in cell adhesions and determined cell shape, spreading area, and extracellular matrix expression. In all, both mechanical property and topography features of scaffolds regulate AFSC differentiation, possibly through a YAP-dependent mechanotransduction mechanism. Statement of Significance: Physical cues such as mechanical properties, topographical and geometrical features were shown to profoundly impact the growth and differentiation of cultured stem cells. Previously, we have found that the differentiation of annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs) could be regulated by the stiffness of scaffold. In this study, we fabricated four types of poly(ether carbonate urethane)urea (PECUU) scaffolds with controlled stiffness and fiber size to explore the potential of induced differentiation of AFSCs. We found that AFSCs are able to present different gene expression patterns simply as a result of the stiffness and fiber size of scaffold material. This work has, for the first time, demonstrated that larger-sized and higher-stiffness substrates increase the amount of vinculin assembly and activate YAP signaling in pre-differentiated AFSCs. The present study affords an in-depth comprehension of materiobiology, and be helpful for explain the mechanism of YAP mechanosensing in AF in response to biophysical effects of materials. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","protein; unclassified drug; yes associated protein; annulus fibrosus; annulus fibrosus derived stem cell; Article; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell isolation; cell proliferation; cell shape; cell spreading; cell structure; electrospinning; extracellular matrix; gene expression; human; image analysis; immunohistochemistry; Leporidae; mechanotransduction; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; rigidity; Western blotting"
"microRNA-181b suppresses the metastasis of lung cancer cells by targeting sex determining region Y-related high mobility group-box 6 (Sox6)",2019,"Background: The aim of the study was to measure the expression of microRNA (miR)-181b in patients with lung cancer, investigate its biological function and elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with the development of lung cancer. Methods: miR-181b expression in tissues was measured via RT-qPCR. After A549 cells were transfected with miR-181b mimic or si-Sox6, the proliferation, migration and cell cycle distribution of A549 were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. The levels of cell cycle-related proteins and Sox6 were analyzed by western blotting. Gene targets of miR-181b were predicted via bioinformatics analysis and verified using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Results: Expression of miR-181b was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues (P < 0.05), and was inversely correlated with the degree of cell differentiation and clinical stages of lung cancer (both P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of miR-181b was significantly lower in adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma in the lungs (P < 0.05). Overexpression of miR-181b significantly decreased the protein level of Sox6 and significantly suppressed the cell proliferation and metastasis (both P < 0.05); this effect was also observed in A549 cells transfected with si-Sox6. The luciferase activity of a Sox6 3′-untranslated region-based reporter construct was significantly lower when transfected with miR-181b (P < 0.05), which suggests that Sox6 is a direct target of miR-181b. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that miR-181b may function as a tumor inhibitor in the development of lung cancer via targeting Sox6 to decrease the proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer cells. ? 2018 The Authors","microRNA; microRNA 181b; transcription factor Sox6; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIrn181 microRNA, human; SOX6 protein, human; transcription factor Sox; 3' untranslated region; A-549 cell line; Article; cancer staging; cell differentiation; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; human; human cell; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; metastasis; oncogene; squamous cell lung carcinoma; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; small cell lung cancer; tumor invasion; A549 Cells; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; SOXD Transcription Factors"

"Neuroendocrine cells of prostate cancer: Biologic functions and molecular mechanisms",2019,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health risk for older men worldwide. Existing systemic therapies mostly target androgen receptor (AR). Although treatments are initially effective, the disease always recurs. A potential mechanism for the treatment failure is that PCa contains, in addition to the AR-positive luminal type tumor cells, a small component of neuroendocrine (NE) cells. The function of NE cells in PCa remains poorly understood, and one important characteristic of these cells is their lack of expression of AR and resistance to hormonal therapy. In addition, many patients develop the more aggressive small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC) after hormonal therapy. Although this clinical phenomenon of disease transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCNC is well established, the cell of origin for SCNC remains unclear. Recently, loss of function of Rb and TP53 and amplification and overexpression of MYCN and Aurora A kinase have been identified as important biomarkers and potential disease drivers. In this article, we systematically review the histology of normal prostate and prostate cancer including the main histologic types: adenocarcinoma and SCNC. We also review the findings from many studies using cellular and animal models as well as human specimens that attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms of treatment failure, disease progression, and tumor transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCNC. ?

"Regional biomechanical imaging of liver cancer cells",2019,"Liver cancer is one of the leading cancers, especially in developing countries. Understanding the biomechanical properties of the liver cancer cells can not only help to elucidate the mechanisms behind the cancer progression, but also provide important information for diagnosis and treatment. At the cellular level, we used well-established atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to characterize the heterogeneity of mechanical properties of two different types of human liver cancer cells and a normal liver cell line. Stiffness maps with a resolution of 128x128 were acquired for each cell. The distributions of the indentation moduli of the cells showed significant differences between cancerous cells and healthy controls. Significantly, the variability was even greater amongst different types of cancerous cells. Fitting of the histogram of the effective moduli using a normal distribution function showed the Bel7402 cells were stiffer than the normal cells while HepG2 cells were softer. Morphological analysis of the cell structures also showed a higher cytoskeleton content among the cancerous cells. Results provided a foundation for applying knowledge of cell stiffness heterogeneity to search for tissue-level, early-stage indicators of liver cancer. ?

"LncRNA CASC11 promotes the cervical cancer progression by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway",2019,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that cancer susceptibility candidate 11 (CASC11), a newly discovered long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was aberrantly overexpressed in hepatic carcinoma, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. However, its effects on cervical cancer has been kept unknown up to now. The present study was aimed to investigate the relationship between lncRNA CASC11 and cervical cancer and further explore the mechanism of CASC11 effect on cervical cancer progression. MATERIALS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expressions of CASC11 in cancerous and adjacent normal tissues of patients with cervical cancer as well as in cell lines. The proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were assayed after transfecting the cell with si-CASC11 or pcDNA3.1-CASC11. TOP/FOP-Flash luciferase reporter assay and western blot were used to analysis the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Si-CASC11-transfected HeLa cells were subcutaneously inoculated into male athymic (nude) mice to investigate the effect of CASC11 on the tumor formation. RESULTS: We discovered that CASC11, the expression of which was positively associated with the tumor size and the FIGO staging and negatively related to the patients' survival rate, was up-regulated in the cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Silencing CASC11 inhibited the proliferation, migration as well as invasion and promoted the cell apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of CASC11 facilitated the cancer cell's proliferation, migration and invasion ability and suppressed the apoptosis. Further study showed that CASC11 promoted the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and silencing CASC11 inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that CASC11 promoted the cervical cancer progression by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway for the first time, which provides a new target or a potential diagnostic biomarker of the treatment for cervical cancer.","beta catenin; microRNA; animal; apoptosis; cell proliferation; complication; disease exacerbation; female; flow cytometry; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; human; mouse; papillomavirus infection; pathology; uterine cervix tumor; virology; Wnt signaling; Animals; Apoptosis; beta Catenin; Cell Proliferation; Disease Progression; Female; Flow Cytometry; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mice; MicroRNAs; Papillomavirus Infections; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Wnt Signaling Pathway"

"Nanoscale metal-organ frameworks and coordination polymers as theranostic platforms for cancer treatment",2019,"Both nanoscale metal organic frameworks (NMOFs) with ordered crystalline structure and nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) which instead show non-crystalline structure are formed by coordination interactions between inorganic metal ions or clusters with organic bridging ligands. NMOFs and NCPs have shown great potential in the field of biomedicine in recent years, owning to their unique advantages including inherent biodegradability, the mesoporous structure to enable loading of various therapeutic or imaging molecules, as well as diverse compositions in both metal ions and organic ligands to render them multiple functionalities in a single system. In this review article, the synthesis and modification strategies of NMOFs/NCPs, together with their applications in drug delivery, biomedical imaging and various types of cancer therapies will be summarized. In addition to reviewing the latest advances in this rapid growing direction, the future prospects of applying NMOFs/NCPs for cancer theranostics will also be addressed. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",""
"Biofunctional magnetic hybrid nanomaterials for theranostic applications",2019,"Cancer is a major disease that seriously threatens human health and is a leading cause of human death. At present, the commonly used cancer treatment methods are surgical therapy, chemical drug therapy and radiation therapy (RT). However, these treatments all have their own shortcomings and cannot perfectly meet the needs of clinical diagnosis and treatment. It is of great significance to improve the diagnosis and treatment level, so that the curative effect and quality of life of tumor patients can be improved. The rapid development of nanotechnology has brought hope to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and the appearance of biofunctional magnetic hybrid nanomaterials (MHNs) has provided a new possibilities for the integration of cancer diagnosis and treatment. As a promising research direction, the multifunctional nanoplatform integrates imaging diagnosis, drug therapy and drug delivery. Better treatment effects and fewer side effects can be achieved by optimizing materials to build stable, efficient, and safe MHNs with combined functions of multimodal imaging and various treatments. This review focuses on not only the research progress of MHNs but also their applications and development trend in the integration of cancer diagnosis and treatment. A description of the applications of MHN structure optimization for both magnetic resonance imaging-based multimodal diagnosis and cancer therapy is given. Furthermore, RT is introduced and the development of MHNs for diagnosis and treatment system is investigated. ? 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Diseases; Drug delivery; Magnetic resonance imaging; Nanomagnetics; Nanostructured materials; Radiotherapy; Structural optimization; Clinical diagnosis; Combined functions; Development trends; Hybrid nanomaterials; Multi-modal imaging; Multimodal diagnosis; Structure optimization; theranostic; Diagnosis"
"Efficient Click Synthesis of a Protonized and Reduction-Sensitive Amphiphilic Small-Molecule Prodrug Containing Camptothecin and Gemcitabine for a Drug Self-Delivery System",2019,"Drug self-delivery systems consisting of small-molecule active drugs with nanoscale features for intracellular delivery without the need for additional polymeric carriers have drawn much attention recently. In this work, we proposed a highly efficient strategy to fabricate protonized and reduction-responsive self-assembled drug nanoparticles from an amphiphilic small-molecule camptothecin-ss-1,2,3-triazole-gemcitabine conjugate (abbreviated as CPT-ss-triazole-GEM) for combination chemotherapy, which was prepared via a Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) ""click"" reaction. To obtain this drug-triazole-drug conjugate, we first prepared a CPT derivate containing a propargyl group linked with a disulfide group and a GEM derivate attached to an azide group. Subsequently, the two kinds of modified drugs were connected together through a CuAAC reaction between the alkynyl and azide groups to yield the CPT-ss-triazole-GEM prodrug. The characterizations of chemical structures of these intermediates and the final product were performed by 1H NMR, Fourier transform infrared, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry measurements. This amphiphilic small-molecule drug-triazole-drug conjugate displayed a high drug loading content, that is, 36.0% of CPT and 27.2% of GEM. This kind of amphiphilic small-molecule prodrugs could form spherical nanoparticles in an aqueous solution in the absence of any other polymeric carriers, in which the hydrophobic CPT formed the core of the nanoparticles, whereas the hydrophilic GEM and protonated 1,2,3-triazole group yielded the shell. In the tumor microenvironment, the prodrug nanoparticles could release both pristine drugs simultaneously. Under the conditions of pH 7.4, and pH 7.4 and 2 μM glutathione (GSH), the prodrug nanoparticles could maintain stability and only 7% of CPT was leaked. However, in a high-GSH environment (pH 7.4 and 10 mM GSH) with the same incubation time, the disulfide linkage would be dissociated and lead to about 34% of CPT release. The results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test demonstrated that these prodrug nanoparticles showed a higher cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells than free CPT and free GEM on both 48 and 72 h of incubation. Both in vitro cellular uptake and flow cytometry results implied that these prodrug nanoparticles could be internalized by HepG2 cells with efficient drug release inside cells. The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of the prodrug showed a moderate half-life in vivo, and the prodrug peak concentration in most of the collected tissues appeared at 0.25 h after administration. In addition, the CPT-ss-triazole-GEM prodrug could not cross the blood-brain barrier. Even more important is the fact that there is no accumulation in tissues and a rapid elimination of this small-molecule prodrug could be achieved. In brief, this protonized and reduction-sensitive prodrug simultaneously binds both antitumor drugs and has good self-delivery behavior through the donor-acceptor interaction of the H-bonding ligand, that is, the 1,2,3-triazole group. It provides a new method for combined drug therapy.

"KIAA1199 promotes sorafenib tolerance and the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by activating the EGF/EGFR-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition program",2019,"Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will almost always develop acquired tolerance after sorafenib therapy, and the molecular mechanism of sorafenib tolerance remains poorly characterized. Here, using our established sorafenib-resistant HCC cell and xenograft models, we identified a novel gene, KIAA1199, which was markedly elevated among the differentially expressed genes involved in sorafenib tolerance. Moreover, elevated expression of KIAA1199 was positively correlated with a high risk of recurrence and metastasis and advanced TNM stage in HCC patients. Functionally, loss- and gain-of-function studies showed that KIAA1199 promoted the migration, invasion, and metastasis of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 is required for EGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells by aiding in EGFR phosphorylation. In summary, our data uncover KIAA1199 as a novel sorafenib-tolerant promoting gene that plays an indispensable role in maintaining sorafenib-resistant HCC cell metastasis. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","epidermal growth factor; epidermal growth factor receptor; sorafenib; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer resistance; cancer staging; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene; gene expression; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; KIAA1199 gene; liver cell carcinoma; liver metastasis; major clinical study; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; recurrence free survival; tumor recurrence; tumor xenograft"
"Comprehensive profiling of JMJD3 in gastric cancer and its influence on patient survival",2019,"Histone methylation is thought to control the regulation of genetic program and the dysregulation of it has been found to be closely associated with cancer. JMJD3 has been identified as an H3K27 demethylase and its role in cancer development is context specific. The role of JMJD3 in gastric cancer (GC) has not been examined. In this study, JMJD3 expression was determined. The prognostic significance of JMJD3 and its association with clinical parameters were evaluated. JMJD3 dysregulation mechanism and targets were analyzed. The effect of JMJD3 mutation was determined by functional study. Results showed that JMJD3 was overexpressed in different patient cohorts and also by bioinformatics analysis. High JMJD3 expression was correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with GC and was an independent prognosis predictor. Genetic aberration and DNA methylation might be involved in the deregulation of JMJD3 in GC. Downstream network of JMJD3 was analyzed and several novel potential targets were identified. Furthermore, functional study discovered that both demethylase-dependent and demethylase-independent mechanisms were involved in the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC. Importantly, histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 could reverse the oncogenic effect of JMJD3 overexpression. In conclusion, our study report the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC for the first time. JMJD3 might serve as an important epigenetic therapeutic target and/or prognostic predictor in GC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"NSD2 circular RNA promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer by targeting miR-199b-5p-mediated DDR1 and JAG1 signalling",2019,"Liver metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we searched for CRC metastasis-associated circular RNA in a mouse model of liver metastasis of CRC by using RNA (transcriptome)-sequencing. We identified a novel and conserved circular RNA, circ-NSD2, functioning as a promoter of CRC metastasis. Circ-NSD2 expression was elevated in CRC tissues and was markedly increased in advanced stages or metastatic tumours of CRC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that circ-NSD2 promoted migration and metastasis of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-NSD2 acted as a sponge for the tumour suppressor miR-199b-5p and activated DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1) and JAG1 (Jagged 1) genes, which synergistically helped with cell–matrix interaction, migration and metastasis of CRC cells. Taken together, our findings highlight a novel oncogenic function of circ-NSD2 and uncover a key mechanism for the circ-NSD2/miR-199b-5p/DDR1/JAG1 axis in CRC metastasis, which may serve as a prognostic factor and therapeutic target for antimetastatic therapy in CRC patients.

"Non-coding RNA involvement in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy",2019,"In recent years, the incidence of diabetes has been increasing rapidly, which seriously endangers human health. Diabetic cardiomyopathy, an important cardiovascular complication of diabetes, is characterized by myocardial fibrosis, ventricular remodelling and cardiac dysfunction. It has been documented that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, autophagy, apoptosis, diabetic microangiopathy and myocardial fibrosis are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. With the development of molecular biology technology, accumulating evidence demonstrates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are critically involved in the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy. In this review, we summarize the pathological roles of three types of ncRNAs (microRNA, long ncRNA and circular RNA) in the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Robust and durable self-healing superhydrophobic polymer-coated MWCNT film for highly efficient emulsion separation",2019,"The discharge of large amounts of oily wastewater causes serious environmental pollution and is a threat to human health. It is therefore necessary to develop products to deal with the challenges posed by such wastewater discharges. One important area is the separation of oil/water emulsions. In this study, a modified multi-walled carbon nanotube film was fabricated. Polydivinylbenzene decoration and a POTS (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane) layer were formed by a solvothermal method and chemical vapor deposition, respectively. The film had outstanding superhydrophobicity and demulsification, separated water-in-oil emulsions with high efficiency (99.98% for water-in-chloroform emulsion), and high reusability (above 99.7% after 20 cycles). Because of its self-healing ability, the film can maintain its superhydrophobicity after severe damage caused by O2 plasma treatment. These features make the film suitable for practical sewage treatment. The self-healing mechanism is also discussed in this article. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Chemical vapor deposition; Chlorine compounds; Emulsification; Emulsions; Health risks; Hydrophobicity; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Ostwald ripening; Plasma applications; Reusability; Separation; Sewage treatment; Yarn; Emulsion separations; Environmental pollutions; Modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes; Self healing mechanism; Self-healing abilities; Solvothermal method; Wastewater discharge; Water in oil emulsions; Self-healing materials; carbon nanotube; emulsion; film; hydrophobicity; plasma; polymer; separation; sewage treatment"
"Scoring system for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and its prognostic value for gastric cancer",2019,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is the internal environment of malignant tumor progression, and the host antitumor immune response and normal tissue destruction occur in the TME. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is a crucial component of the TME and reflect the host antitumor immune response. The purpose of this study was to discuss the methodology for TIL evaluation and assess the prognostic value of TIL in gastric cancer. In total, we reviewed 1,033 gastrectomy cases between 2002 and 2008 at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. To understand the prognostic value of TIL in gastric cancer (GC), TIL were assessed by optical microscopy, and verified by immunohistochemistry. There is no current consensus on TIL scoring in GC. In this study, we discussed a TIL evaluation system that includes an analysis of the amount and percentage of TIL in a tumor. Ultimately, 439 (52.7%) cases showed high levels of TIL and 394 (47.3%) cases had low levels. There was a statistically significant relationship among TIL, tumor size, histological grade, LN metastasis, nerve invasion, tumor thrombus, pTN stage, and WHO subtypes (p &lt; 0.001, respectively). TILhi was a positive significant predictor of overall survival (OS) in Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (P &lt; 0.001) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR = 0.431, 95% CI: 0.347–0.534, P &lt; 0.001). After surgery, patients with malignant tumors underwent chemoradiotherapy according to standard therapeutic guidelines based on TNM stage. The TNM scoring system cannot reflect the full information of TME; therefore, TIL can be used as a diagnostic supplement. We constructed a nomogram model that showed more predictive accuracy for OS than pTN stage. In summary, this study proves that high levels of TIL are associated with a positive prognosis and that TIL reflect the protective host antitumor immune response. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Glioma stem cells reconstruct similar immunoinflammatory microenvironment in different transplant sites and induce malignant transformation of tumor microenvironment cells",2019,"Purpose: This study aimed to examine whether the different tumor-transplanted sites could construct a similar immunoinflammatory microenvironment and to investigate the interactions between tumor microenvironment cells. Methods: The red fluorescent protein-SU3 (SU3-RFP) or SU3 glioma stem cells (GSC) were inoculated into the brain, liver, abdominal cavity, and subcutis of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-nude mice. The tumor tissues were taken to observe the tissue cell distribution. The single cell suspension of tumor tissues was prepared and cultured, while the SU3-RFP cells were co-cultured with the cells from GFP-transgenic mice. The RFP + , GFP + , and RFP + /GFP + cells were traced by fluorescence microscope, and their protein expressions were determined by Western blot analysis. The markers of immunoinflammatory cells, including F4/80, CD11b, CD11c, CD80, CD47, and SIRP-α, were determined by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry assays, respectively. Results: The xenograft models of all transplant sites were inducible, and the red tumor cells of tumor tissues were encircled by a great quantity of host-derived green cells, including immunoinflammatory cells with CD80, F4/80, CD11b, and CD11c expressions, which might generate the cell colonies and possess the pseudopodia. Additionally, the interactions between red tumor cells and green immunoinflammatory cells, including cell fusion process and yellow fusion cell formation, were observed in cultured cells. The fusion cells-derived B4 cells with expressions of CD47 and SIRP-α proteins had the strong proliferation ability and tumorigenic effect. Conclusions: The similar tumor immunoinflammatory microenvironment was constructed by GSC in different transplant sites, and the cell fusion indicated a malignant transformation of the tumor microenvironment cells. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","B7 antigen; CD11b antigen; CD47 antigen; f4/80 antibody; glycoprotein p 15095; green fluorescent protein; protein; red fluorescent protein; signal regulatory protein alpha; unclassified drug; green fluorescent protein; photoprotein; red fluorescent protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain slice; cancer transplantation; carcinogenesis; cell fusion; cell proliferation; cell suspension; cellular distribution; controlled study; glioma stem cell; human; human cell; immunocytochemistry; immunohistochemistry; malignant transformation; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; pseudopodium; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor microenvironment; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; cancer stem cell; cell communication; cell transformation; coculture; drug screening; glioma; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; transgenic mouse; tumor cell culture; tumor microenvironment; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Communication; Cell Fusion; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Coculture Techniques; Glioma; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Inflammation; Luminescent Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Mice, Transgenic; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Microenvironment; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Second near-infrared photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy of orthotopic malignant glioblastoma with ultra-small Cu2-: XSe nanoparticles",2019,"The treatment of malignant glioblastoma is a huge challenge due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier. Herein, we report the treatment of orthotopic malignant glioblastoma with imaging guided second near-infrared (NIR-II) photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy by using drug-loaded ultra-small Cu2-xSe theranostic nanoparticles (NPs). Ultra-small Cu2-xSe NPs possess a strong absorbance in the NIR-II window, and their absorption at 1064 nm is around 2 times that at 808 nm. Their strong NIR-II absorbance and the deeper-tissue penetration of NIR-II light ensure excellent photodynamic therapy performance under irradiation with a 1064 nm laser. We also demonstrate that ultra-small Cu2-xSe NPs can produce vast amounts of reactive oxygen species via electron transfer (for OH generation) and energy transfer (for 1O2 generation) mechanisms under irradiation. In addition, these NPs can be effectively and locally transported into orthotopic malignant glioblastoma with the assistance of focused ultrasound. The deposited Cu2-xSe NPs can be used for photoacoustic imaging to guide the combined NIR-II photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The results show that the tumor growth can be significantly suppressed. This work demonstrates the great potential of drug-loaded ultra-small Cu2-xSe NPs as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of orthotopic malignant glioblastoma. ?

"Relaxin gene delivery mitigates liver metastasis and synergizes with check point therapy",2019,"Activated hepatic stellate cell (aHSC)-mediated liver fibrosis is essential to the development of liver metastasis. Here, we discover intra-hepatic scale-up of relaxin (RLN, an anti-fibrotic peptide) in response to fibrosis along with the upregulation of its primary receptor (RXFP1) on aHSCs. The elevated expression of RLN serves as a natural regulator to deactivate aHSCs and resolve liver fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesize this endogenous liver fibrosis repair mechanism can be leveraged for liver metastasis treatment via enforced RLN expression. To validate the therapeutic potential, we utilize aminoethyl anisamide-conjugated lipid-calcium-phosphate nanoparticles to deliver plasmid DNA encoding RLN. The nanoparticles preferentially target metastatic tumor cells and aHSCs within the metastatic lesion and convert them as an in situ RLN depot. Expressed RLN reverses the stromal microenvironment, which makes it unfavorable for established liver metastasis to grow. In colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer liver metastasis models, we confirm the RLN gene therapy results in significant inhibition of metastatic progression and prolongs survival. In addition, enforced RLN expression reactivates intra-metastasis immune milieu. The combination of the RLN gene therapy with PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy further produces a synergistic anti-metastatic efficacy. Collectively, the targeted RLN gene therapy represents a highly efficient, safe, and versatile anti-metastatic modality, and is promising for clinical translation. ? 2019, The Author(s).","alpha smooth muscle actin; calcium phosphate; chaperone; fibroblast growth factor; nanoparticle; plasmid DNA; relaxin; retinoid X receptor alpha; stromal cell derived factor 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; carbon tetrachloride; Cd274 protein, mouse; G protein coupled receptor; Lgr7 protein, mouse; nanoparticle; programmed death 1 ligand 1; relaxin; Rln1 protein, mouse; cancer; cell component; DNA; gene; gene expression; immune system; inhibition; lesion; nanoparticle; plasmid; tumor; Article; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer immunotherapy; cancer survival; colorectal cancer; endoplasmic reticulum; gene expression; gene targeting; gene therapy; Kupffer cell; liver fibrosis; liver metastasis; microenvironment; off-target effect; pancreas cancer; real time polymerase chain reaction; scale up; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; chemistry; disease exacerbation; experimental liver cirrhosis; female; gene transfer; gene vector; genetics; hepatic stellate cell; human; immunology; liver; liver tumor; metabolism; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; pathology; plasmid; procedures; transplantation; treatment outcome; tumor cell line; tumor microenvironment; Animals; B7-H1 Antigen; Carbon Tetrachloride; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Humans; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Nanoparticles; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Plasmids; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Relaxin; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Microenvironment; Up-Regulation"
"MicroRNA-184 promotes apoptosis of trophoblast cells via targeting WIG1 and induces early spontaneous abortion",2019,"Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) refers to the unintentional termination of two or more consecutive pregnancies that severely threatens human reproductive health. Our previous study has shown that miR-184 is expressed more highly in RSA than in normal pregnancy, whether in the villus or decidua. In this study, compared with normal pregnant women, the expression of miR-184 in decidual stromal cells (DSCs) and decidual immune cells (DICs), as well as in peripheral blood, from RSA patients was enhanced similarly. Moreover, we found miR-184 could promote the apoptosis and repress the proliferation of trophoblast cells. Further exploration indicated that miR-184 upregulated the expression of Fas by targeting WIG1 thus inducing cell apoptosis. Finally, after miR-184 overexpression in vivo, the embryo resorption rate in pregnant mice was increased significantly. Therefore, our study outlines the pivotal role of miR-184 in maintaining successful pregnancy, providing a new diagnostic and therapeutic target for RSA. ? 2019, The Author(s).","caspase 3; caspase 7; caspase 8; caspase 9; cell protein; Fas ligand; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 184; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; unclassified drug; wig1 protein; adult; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; controlled study; decidua; embryo; embryo resorption; female; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; spontaneous abortion; stroma cell; trophoblast; upregulation"
"Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor–Associated Factor 6 Promotes Hepatocarcinogenesis by Interacting With Histone Deacetylase 3 to Enhance c-Myc Gene Expression and Protein Stability",2020,"The oncogene c-Myc is aberrantly expressed and plays a key role in malignant transformation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we report that c-Myc is significantly up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in hepatocarcinogenesis. High TRAF6 expression in clinical HCC samples correlates with poor prognosis, and the loss of one copy of the Traf6 gene in Traf6+/– mice significantly impairs liver tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, TRAF6 first interacts with and ubiquitinates histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) with K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which leads to the dissociation of HDAC3 from the c-Myc promoter and subsequent acetylation of histone H3 at K9, thereby epigenetically enhancing the mRNA expression of c-Myc. Second, the K63-linked ubiquitination of HDAC3 impairs the HDAC3 interaction with c-Myc and promotes c-Myc protein acetylation, which thereby enhances c-Myc protein stability by inhibiting carboxyl terminus of heat shock cognate 70-kDa–interacting protein–mediated c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation. Importantly, TRAF6/HDAC3/c-Myc signaling is also primed in hepatitis B virus–transgenic mice, unveiling a critical role for a mechanism in inflammation–cancer transition. In clinical specimens, TRAF6 positively correlates with c-Myc at both the mRNA and protein levels, and high TRAF6 and c-Myc expression is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, suggesting that TRAF6 collaborates with c-Myc to promote human hepatocarcinogenesis. Consistently, curbing c-Myc expression by inhibition of TRAF6 activity with a TRAF6 inhibitor peptide or the silencing of c-Myc by small interfering RNA significantly suppressed tumor growth in mice. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the oncogenic potential of TRAF6 during hepatocarcinogenesis by modulating TRAF6/HDAC3/c-Myc signaling, with potential implications for HCC therapy. ? 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","4 (2 aminoethylamino) 1,8 dimethylimidazo[1,2 a]quinoxaline; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; histone acetyltransferase; histone deacetylase 3; histone H3; Myc protein; short hairpin RNA; small interfering RNA; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; carboxy terminal sequence; chronic hepatitis B; colony formation; controlled study; deacetylation; deletion mutant; histone acetylation; human; human tissue; liver carcinogenesis; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; oligomerization; priority journal; promoter region; protein acetylation; protein binding; protein degradation; protein processing; protein protein interaction; protein stability; tumor volume; ubiquitination"
"Complex roles of necroptosis in cancer [程序性坏死在癌症中的复?作用]",2019,"Necroptosis is a tightly regulated form of necrosis that requires the activation of receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3, as well as the RIPK3 substrate mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Because of membrane rupture, necroptotic cells release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that evoke immune responses. Necroptosis is emerging as an important cellular response in the modulation of cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Necroptosis of cancer cells is considered to be an immunogenic cell death capable of activating anti-tumor immunity. Necroptosis also participates in the promotion of myeloid cell-induced adaptive immune suppression and thus contributes to oncogenesis. In addition, necroptosis of endothelial cells and tumor cells is conducive to tumor metastasis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the complex role of necroptosis in cancer and discuss the potential of targeting necroptosis components for cancer therapies. ? 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cell protein; damage associated molecular pattern; mixed lineage kinase; mixed lineage kinase domain like protein; protein kinase; receptor interacting protein kinase 1; receptor interacting protein kinase 3; unclassified drug; alarmin; MLKL protein, human; protein kinase; receptor interacting protein serine threonine kinase; RIPK1 protein, human; RIPK3 protein, human; adaptive immunity; apoptosis; bone marrow cell; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; endothelium cell; human; immune response; immunomodulation; macrophage; malignant neoplasm; membrane rupture; metastasis; necroptosis; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; tumor immunity; tumor immunogenicity; animal; apoptosis; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; immune system; immunotherapy; inflammation; metabolism; necrosis; neoplasm; pathology; signal transduction; tumor suppressor gene; Alarmins; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinogenesis; Cell Differentiation; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Endothelial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; Immune System; Immunotherapy; Inflammation; Necrosis; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms; Protein Kinases; Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Signal Transduction"
"Ecological principle meets cancer treatment: Treating children with acute myeloid leukemia with low-dose chemotherapy",2019,"Standard chemotherapy regimens for remission induction of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We performed a cohort study to determine the impact of reducing the intensity of remission induction chemotherapy on the outcomes of selected children with AML treated with a low-dose induction regimen plus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (low-dose chemotherapy (LDC)/G-CSF). Complete response (CR) after two induction courses was attained in 87.0% (40/46) of patients receiving LDC/G-CSF. Post-remission therapy was offered to all patients, and included standard consolidation and/or stem cell transplantation. During the study period, an additional 94 consecutive children with AML treated with standard chemotherapy (SDC) for induction (80/94 (85.1%) of the patients attained CR after induction II, P = 0.953) and post-remission. In this non-randomized study, there were no significant differences in 4-year event-free (67.4 vs. 70.7%; P = 0.99) and overall (70.3 vs. 74.6%, P = 0.69) survival in the LDC/G-CSF and SDC cohorts, respectively. After the first course of induction, recovery of white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were significantly faster in patients receiving LDC/G-CSF than in those receiving SDC (11.5 vs. 18.5 d for WBCs (P < 0.001); 15.5 vs. 22.0 d for platelets (P < 0.001)). To examine the quality of molecular response, targeted deep sequencing was performed. Of 137 mutations detected at diagnosis in 20 children who attained hematological CR after two courses of LDC/G-CSF (n = 9) or SDC (n = 11), all of the mutations were below the reference value (variant allelic frequency <2.5%) after two courses, irrespective of the treatment group. In conclusion, children with AML receiving LDC/G-CSF appear to have similar outcomes and mutation clearance levels, but significantly lower toxicity than those receiving SDC. Thus, LDC/G-CSF should be further evaluated as an effective alternative to remission induction in pediatric AML. ? 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

"Long noncoding RNA MIR155HG facilitates pancreatic cancer progression through negative regulation of miR-802",2019,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) present the key regulatory functions in tumorigenesis. More and more studies have suggested that lncRNA MIR155HG is involved in different human cancers. However, the underlying regulatory role of lncRNA MIR155HG and potential mechanisms in pancreatic cancer (PC) remain illusive. In this research, our group found that lncRNA MIR155HG expression was remarkably increased in PC tumor tissue and cells compared to that in the adjacent normal tissue and cells. In addition, higher MIR155HG expression was positively associated with the poor prognosis of patients. In addition, we exhibited that silence of MIR155HG by short hairpin RNA knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth and promoted cell apoptosis in PC cells. We performed bioinformatics analysis to search for the target of MIR155HG. As demonstrated by Luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-802, a tumor suppressor in various cancer, is a direct target of MIR155HG. We demonstrated that the tumor-promoting effects of MIR155HG were contributed by negative regulation of miR-802 in PC cells. In summary, our results suggest that lncRNA MIR155HG might be applied as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for PC. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","long noncoding RNA mir155hg; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 802; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; adult; apoptosis; Article; binding site; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle S phase; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; down regulation; gene knockdown; gene silencing; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; middle aged; mRNA expression level; pancreas cancer; percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; tumor promotion; tumor suppressor gene; upregulation"
"Co-Effect of Serum Galectin-3 and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol on the Prognosis of Acute Ischemic Stroke",2019,"Goal: The association of combined galectin-3 and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with prognosis of acute ischemic stroke remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the coeffect of galectin-3 and HDL-C on death and vascular events within 1 year after ischemic stroke. Materials and Methods: Based on China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke, a prospective study was conducted among 2970 patients with acute ischemic stroke. The primary outcome was a combination of death and vascular events within 1 year after ischemic stroke. The secondary outcomes were separately those of recurrent stroke, vascular events, and death. Findings: The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of primary outcome, recurrent stroke, and vascular events were 1.54 (1.07-2.20), 1.78 (1.08-2.95), and 1.92 (1.26-2.94), respectively, in patients with both high galectin-3 and low HDL-C compared to those with both low galectin-3 and high HDL-C. The addition of galectin-3 and HDL-C to conventional factors significantly improved predictive value. Net reclassification index was 15.7% for primary outcome, 18.3% for recurrent stroke, and 20.5% for vascular events. Conclusion: Combination of high galectin-3 and low HDL-C was associated with primary outcome, recurrent stroke, and vascular events within 1 year after ischemic stroke, suggesting that the combination of galectin-3 and HDL-C may be used to identify the individuals at risk of poor prognosis after ischemic stroke. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","antihypertensive agent; galectin 3; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; biological marker; galectin 3; galectin-3, human; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; brain ischemia; China; cholesterol blood level; death; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; prognostic assessment; prospective study; protein blood level; recurrent disease; risk assessment; vascular disease; aged; blood; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; controlled study; mortality; multicenter study; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; single blind procedure; time factor; young adult; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Brain Ischemia; China; Cholesterol, HDL; Female; Galectin 3; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Single-Blind Method; Stroke; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Thermal-Responsive Carbon Monoxide (CO) Delivery Expedites Metabolic Exhaustion of Cancer Cells toward Reversal of Chemotherapy Resistance",2019,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main cause of chemotherapy failure, and the mechanism of MDR is largely associated with drug efflux mediated by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters. Herein, an NIR-light-triggered CO release system based on mesoporous Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) was developed to reverse MDR via CO-induced metabolic exhaustion. Pentacarbonyl iron (Fe(CO)5) as the CO producer was coupled to PB NPs via coordination interaction, and doxorubicin (Dox) was encapsulated into the pores of PB NPs. After layer-by-layer (LBL) coating, the NPs showed desired serum stability to enhance tumor accumulation. Upon tumor-site-specific NIR light (808 nm) irradiation, the nonlethal temperature elevation cleaved the Fe-CO bond to release CO. CO then expedited mitochondrial metabolic exhaustion to block ATP synthesis and inhibit ATP-dependent drug efflux, thus reversing MDR of the Dox-resistant MCF-7/ADR tumors to potentiate the anticancer efficacy of Dox. In the meantime, CO-mediated mitochondrial exhaustion could upregulate the proapoptotic protein, caspase 3, thus inducing cellular apoptosis and enabling a synergistic anticancer effect with chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time MDR has been overcome using a CO delivery system. This study provides a promising strategy to realize an effective and safe treatment against MDR tumors and reveals new insights in the use of CO for cancer treatment. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Adenosinetriphosphate; Carbon monoxide; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Infrared devices; Metabolism; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Anticancer effects; Coordination interactions; Layer by layer; Multidrug resistance; Prussian blue nanoparticles; Serum stability; Temperature elevation; Tumor accumulation; Iron compounds"
"Hsa_circ_101555 functions as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-597-5p to promote colorectal cancer progression",2019,"CircRNAs have been reported to exert momentous roles in regulating pathophysiological process and guiding clinical diagnosis and treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there are still a lot of circRNAs that need to be unearthed. In this study, we evaluated the expression profile of circRNAs in 10 CRC tissues and their corresponding normal-appearing tissues (NATs) by microarray, and identified that hsa_circ_101555 (circ101555) was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues and closely related to the prognosis of CRC patients. A specific close loop structure of circ101555 was described, which was generated by back-splicing of the host gene CSNK1G1 and showed greater stability than the linear RNA. The results in vitro and in vivo showed that silencing circ101555 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and impaired the DNA repair capacity of CRC cells, while rescue experiments suggested that down-expression of miR-597-5p could significantly attenuate the biological effects of circ101555 knockdown on CRC cells. Subsequent experiments in vitro, including double fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) analysis, RIP analysis and biotin-coupled probe pull down assay, confirmed that miR-597-5p was effectively enriched by circ101555, and circ101555 might serve as a sponge of miR-597-5p. Moreover, two putative oncogenes (CDK6 and RPA3) were identified as the miR-597-5p potential targets. Taken together, our results proved that circ101555 might function as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-597-5p to up-regulate CDK6 and RPA3 expression in CRC. Circ101555 could be a useful prognostic indicator in patients with CRC, and silence of circ101555 provided a new attractive therapeutic measure for CRC. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Hsa circ 101555 RNA; microRNA; microRNA 597 5p; RNA; unclassified drug; CDK6 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase 6; DNA binding protein; microRNA; RPA3 protein, human; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; CDK6 gene; cell proliferation; clinical article; colorectal cancer; controlled study; CSNK1G1 gene; DNA repair; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene; gene expression regulation; gene function; gene knockdown; gene silencing; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; RNA splicing; RNA stability; RNA structure; RPA3 gene; tumor volume; animal; Bagg albino mouse; binding competition; C57BL mouse; colorectal tumor; disease exacerbation; female; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; HEK293 cell line; HT-29 cell line; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; tumor cell line; Animals; Binding, Competitive; Cell Line, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6; Disease Progression; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HCT116 Cells; HEK293 Cells; HT29 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Nude; Microarray Analysis; MicroRNAs; RNA, Circular"
"MicroRNA-101 targets CXCL12-mediated Akt and Snail signaling pathways to inhibit cellular proliferation and invasion in papillary thyroid carcinoma",2019,"Escalating evidence suggests that microRNA-101 (miR-101) is implicated in the development and progression of various cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, the biological function and molecular mechanisms of miR-101 in PTC are still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-101 expression was significantly decreased in PTC tissues and cell lines. Clinically, a low level of miR-101 was positively associated with advanced histological stages and lymph node and distant metastases. The expression of CXCL12 was negatively correlated with miR-101 level in PTC. CXCL12 was validated as a direct target of miR-101 in PTC cells. Functional experiments proved that miR-101 markedly reduced the proliferation, apoptosis escape, migration, and invasion of PTC cells. Moreover, CXCL12 restoration rescued the suppressive effects of miR-101 on PTC cells by activating Akt- and EMT-associated signaling pathways. Overall, miR-101 exerts oncostatic effects on PTC by downregulating CXCL12 and repressing its downstream Akt and Snail signaling pathways, suggesting that miR-101/CXCL12/Akt or Snail axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target for PTC.

"Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA promotes hypoxia-induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells",2019,"OBJECTIVE: Cell autophagy reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to therapeutic reagents in various types of human cancer. Therefore, the aim of our study was to use human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells to explore whether inhibition of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) is able to enhance hypoxia-induced apoptosis in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HCT116 cells were treated with 3-MA, hypoxia, or 3-MA plus hypoxia, and the autophagy, apoptosis and proliferation of the HCT116 cells were investigated. Western blot analysis was used to detect autophagy specificity protein microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) expression. Effects on apoptosis were evaluated by using flow cytometry (JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential) and annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) staining. RESULTS: The results showed that the treatment of HCT116 cells in vitro with hypoxia alone increased autophagy as well as apoptosis, whereas combination treatment with 3-MA and hypoxia markedly inhibited hypoxia-induced autophagy, but increased hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy might play a role as a self-defense mechanism in hypoxia-treated colon cancer cells, and its inhibition could be a promising strategy for the adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer. ? 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

"SNHG16 promotes osteosarcoma progression and enhances cisplatin resistance by sponging miR-16 to upregulate ATG4B expression",2019,"Background: Human osteosarcoma is the most common primary cancer of the bone. Multiple mechanisms underlying cell growth, apoptosis, bone development, and drug resistance are important in the development of osteosarcoma therapy, which remains to be fully studied. Methods: We collected thirty-paired tumor tissues and the adjacent normal ones from osteosarcoma patients. Two osteosarcoma cell lines (SAOS2, U2OS) were used for in vitro experiments. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used for gene expression detection. We applied starBase to predict the potential binding sites. Then, the luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the potential direct interaction. Besides, we applied CCK-8, EdU assay, and flow cytometric assays to detect cell growth and apoptosis rate. We used wound healing and transwell assays to determine cell migration and invasion abilities. Additionally, we constructed a cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cell line to study the potential impact of the regulatory axis on drug resistance. Results: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) and autophagy-related 4B (ATG4B) were significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues than the normal ones, and the higher expression level of SNHG16 predicted a poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. By contrast, the expression level of miR-16 was markedly lower in tumor tissues and was negatively correlated with SNHG16 (p < 0.001). SNHG16 was shown to promote cell growth, migration, and invasion, while miR-16 reversed this impact. Meanwhile, overexpression of ATG4B significantly promoted the development of osteosarcoma cells attenuated by SNHG16 knockdown or miR-16 mimics. Specifically, overexpression of ATG4B promoted cisplatin-induced autophagy and inhibited cell apoptosis rate, which enhanced the cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma cell lines. Conclusions: Overall, our findings showed the importance of the regulatory axis of SNHG16/miR-16/ATG4B underlying osteosarcoma progression and chemoresistance to cisplatin. This research would benefit the therapy development in the treatment of osteosarcoma. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","cisplatin; microRNA 16; adolescent; adult; apoptosis; Article; ATG4B gene; binding site; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer tissue; cell invasion; cell migration; clinical article; controlled study; flow cytometry; gene; gene expression; gene expression level; gene function; gene interaction; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; gene repression; genetic correlation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; luciferase assay; osteosarcoma; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; SaOS-2 cell line; SNHG16 gene; U2OS cell line; upregulation; Western blotting; wound healing assay"
"Luteolin suppresses tumor proliferation through inducing apoptosis and autophagy via MAPK activation in glioma",2019,"Purpose: Glioma is a malignant tumor that originates in the brain and spine and is difficult to be completely removed. Though glioma patients receive active treatment, the survival rate is still poor. Therefore, it is urgent to discover a new medicine to treat glioma patients in order to improve the survival rate. In this study, we explored the anticancer effect and the potential mechanism of luteolin on glioma in vitro. Materials and methods: Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were used to determine the cellular apoptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to explore the changes in protein expression. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was utilized to evaluate the expression level of the tumor suppressor miR-124-3p. Results: CCK-8 assays indicated that luteolin significantly inhibited glioma cell proliferation in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that luteolin induced glioma cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that luteolin induced cellular apoptosis in glioma cells via MAPK activation (JNK, ERK, and p38). Luteolin stimulated the death receptor (FADD) to regulate the apoptosis proteins (Caspase-8, Caspase-3, and PARP). Luteolin increased the expression levels of LC3B II/I and downregulated the level of p62 that promotes cell autophagy. Finally, qRT-PCR confirmed that luteolin upregulated the expression levels of miR-124-3p. Conclusion: These findings illustrate that luteolin may be a potential drug for glioma treatment. ? 2019 You et al.","autophagy related protein; caspase 3; caspase 8; Fas associated death domain protein; luteolin; microRNA; microRNA 124 3p; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein LC3B I; protein LC3B II; sequestosome 1; stress activated protein kinase; temozolomide; unclassified drug; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; gene expression; GI50; glioma; human; human cell; in vitro study; protein expression; U-251MG cell line; upregulation"
"Ikaros family zinc-finger 1 mutation is an independent factor for the poor prognosis of adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can?improve clinical outcomes",2019,"To investigate the prognosis of patients with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with Ikaros family zinc-finger 1 (IKZF1) mutation and determine the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in improving the clinical outcome, we detected the IKZF1 mutation and BCR-ABL fusion gene at diagnosis in the bone marrow of 164 adult patients with B-ALL, and analyzed the clinical data of these patients retrospectively. Our analysis showed that grade III–IV acute graft-versus-host disease and IKZF1 mutation in the transplantation group and age and IKZF1 mutation in the non-transplantation group were independent factors for poor prognosis by univariate and multivariate analyses.The 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were much lower in the IKZF1+/BCR-ABL+ subgroup than in the IKZF1+/BCR-ABL? and IKZF1?/BCR-ABL? subgroups in both the transplantation and non-transplantation groups. The 3-year OS and LFS rates were significantly higher in the transplantation group than in the non-transplantation group with IKZF1 mutation.The study demonstrated that IKZF1 mutation was an independent factor indicating the poor prognosis of adult B-ALL and much worse prognosis in the BCR-ABL+ subgroup in both non-transplantation and transplantation groups. However, allo-HSCT significantly improved the OS and LFS of patients and also their clinical outcomes. ? 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.","Ikaros family zinc finger 1; transcription factor; unclassified drug; BCR ABL protein; Ikaros transcription factor; IKZF1 protein, human; acute graft versus host disease; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; BCR ABL fusion gene; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease free survival; female; fusion gene; gene; gene mutation; human; IKZF1 gene; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; univariate analysis; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; allotransplantation; genetics; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; mortality; mutation; procedures; prognosis; survival analysis; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Ikaros Transcription Factor; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Transplantation, Homologous; Treatment Outcome"
"Nomogram and Artificial Neural Network for Prognostic Performance on the Albumin-Bilirubin Grade for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Undergoing Transarterial Chemoembolization",2019,"Purpose: To construct the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score based on nomograms, as well as to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) to compare the prognostic performance of the 2 scores for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has undergone transarterial chemoembolization. Materials and Methods: This multicentric retrospective study included patients with HCC who underwent transarterial chemoembolization monotherapy as an initial treatment at 4 institutions between January 2008 and December 2016. In the training cohort, significant risk factors associated with overall survival (OS) were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. The prognostic nomograms and ANN were established and then validated in 2 validation cohorts. Results: A total of 838 patients (548, 115, and 175 in the training cohort and validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively) were included. The median OS was 10.4, 15.7, and 9.2 months in the training cohort and validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. In the training cohort, both ALBI grade and CTP score were identified as significant risk factors. The ALBI grade and CTP score based on nomograms were established separately and showed similar prognostic performance when assessed externally in validation cohorts (C-index in validation cohort 1: 0.823 vs 0.802, P =.417; in validation cohort 2: 0.716 vs 0.729, P =.793). ANN showed that ALBI grade had higher importance on survival prediction than CTP score. Conclusions: ALBI grade performs at least no worse than CTP score regarding survival prediction for HCC receiving transarterial chemoembolization. Considering the easy application, ALBI grade has the potential to be regarded as an alternative to CTP score. ? 2019","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alpha fetoprotein; antineoplastic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; bilirubin; human serum albumin; tumor marker; adult; Article; artificial neural network; aspartate aminotransferase level; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; chemoembolization; Child Pugh score; cohort analysis; female; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; median survival time; middle aged; monotherapy; multicenter study; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; nomogram; overall survival; portal vein thrombosis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; retrospective study; risk factor; survival prediction; tumor number; tumor thrombus; tumor volume; vascular tumor; blood; cancer grading; China; clinical trial; comparative study; decision support system; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; mortality; pathology; reproducibility; time factor; treatment outcome; validation study; Bilirubin; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; China; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neural Networks (Computer); Nomograms; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Serum Albumin, Human; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Glycyrrhizin administration ameliorates Streptococcus aureus-induced acute lung injury",2019,"Streptococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) has a high incidence of mortality clinically. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a traditional Chinese medicine for anti-inflammatory. However, the role of GL in S. aureus-induced ALI has not previously been elucidated. GL (25 mg/kg i.p.) administration exerts potent anti-inflammatory effect in this model. GL administration significantly alleviated inflammation via reduction of multiple cytokines (serum and lung tissue IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β and HMGB1) and immune cells (lung tissue neutrophil and macrophage infiltration). Additionally, we measured the signaling pathways (NF-kB and MARKs) and inflammasome dependent pyroptosis. The results suggest that GL inhibits NF-kB, p38/ERK pathways and pyroptosis. Furthermore, we used different inhibitors to treat infected-A549 cells and found that BMS-582949 (a p38 inhibitor) is the most effective inhibitor for inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β) production, which suggests that p38 signaling pathway might be the main pathway for S. aureus-induced inflammation. Collectively, the data demonstrates that GL could mitigate inflammation after S. aureus infection. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","antiinflammatory agent; bms 582949; glycyrrhizic acid; high mobility group B1 protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; mitogen activated protein kinase p38 inhibitor; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; autacoid; cytokine; glycyrrhizic acid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; A-549 cell line; acute lung injury; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; Chinese medicine; controlled study; cytokine production; female; human; human cell; human cell culture; immunocompetent cell; lung lavage; lung parenchyma; macrophage; MAPK signaling; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; pyroptosis; signal transduction; Streptococcus; Streptococcus aureus; Streptococcus infection; tissue section; acute lung injury; animal; C57BL mouse; Chinese medicine; disease model; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; neutrophil chemotaxis; physiology; Streptococcus; Streptococcus infection; A549 Cells; Acute Lung Injury; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Glycyrrhizic Acid; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Macrophages; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neutrophil Infiltration; NF-kappa B; Pyroptosis; Signal Transduction; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus"

However, earlier stage patient results have been mixed. This novelty of this study was the focus on stage I and II breast cancer patients. The objective of the current study was to conduct a meta-analysis of psychosocial functions in early-stage breast cancer survivors to determine its efficacy. Methods: A search of Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and PubMed yielded 3237 abstracts, which were independently evaluated by research pairs. Meta-analysis was conducted on 8 studies that included a total of 1053 patients. Psychosocial functions were categorized according to 3 domains: (1) anxiety, (2) depression, and (3) quality of life. Results: Improvement in anxiety was observed in patients treated with CBT relative to controls without CBT (P =.04). Depression and quality of life improvement was not observed in the CBT group within or after 4 months of treatment (P >.05). Conclusions: The results indicated that observed improvements in anxiety in patients with early-stage breast cancer were moderate. The effectiveness of CBT for the improvement of patient outcomes could not be determined, given the methodological and clinical shortcomings of the included trials. ?

"Accurate detection of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in clinical gastric cancer tissues using a fluorescent probe",2019,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis of gastric cancer. Therefore, specific and sensitive detection of MMP-2 is of great significance for clinical diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of gastric cancer. Herein, we developed a new approach for accurate detection of MMP-2 activity both in gastric cancer cells and clinical tissues using a fluorescent probe Dab-PLGVRGY-FITC. The capability of the probe for detecting MMP-2 was systematically evaluated in gastric cancer MGC-803 cells and clinical gastric cancer tissues. Around 40-fold fluorescence enhancement at a wavelength of 520 nm was determined for the assays of the probe with recombinant MMP-2. The detection limit of MMP-2 was as low as 42 ng mL-1. Strong fluorescence signals were detected in MGC-803 cells and mouse gastric cancer tissues. Fluorescence signal enhancements of 11 clinical gastric cancer tissue lysates were 5.8 ? 9 times (7.53 ± 0.77 on average) higher than those from gastritis patients. This probe could be potentially used for early diagnosis of gastric cancer in clinics. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Diagnosis; Diseases; Fluorescence; Histology; Probes; Tissue; Clinical diagnosis; Detection limits; Fluorescence enhancement; Fluorescence signals; Fluorescent probes; Gastric cancer cells; Matrix metalloproteinase-2; Sensitive detection; Tissue engineering"
"Electrical conductivity enhancement of hybrid PA6,6 composite containing multiwall carbon nanotube and carbon black for shielding effectiveness application in textiles",2019,"Textiles have been highly considered in applications of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness. This is mainly due to an increasing concern of health issues caused by human exposure to radiation. In the present study, the main objective was to develop a monofilament yarn made of conductive polymer composite (CPC) for electromagnetic shielding application to decline the drawbacks of previous electromagnetic shielding textile products. Thus, CPCs were produced by melt mixing method, using Polyamide 6,6 (PA6,6) as matrix and carbon black (CB) or/and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) as conductive nanofillers and the synergy effects of CB and MWCNT on electrical conductivity was studied. Consequently, 1.7 wt.% of MWCNT and 3.3 wt.% of CB (1MWCNT:2CB) was applied to generate a PA6,6-based composite at the critical percolation threshold while its electrical conductivity was higher than the PA6,6-based composite contained 20 wt.% of CB and the same as the one contained 3 wt.% of MWCNT. The developed monofilament is lightweight, corrosion resistant and the manufacturing process is very well established in comparison with metal yarns. These characteristics make it an alternative to produce electromagnetic shielding clothing for personal protection. Thus, the developed monofilament was woven to fabricate an electromagnetic shield fabric and the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness was evaluated in the frequency range 1–10 GHz. In brief, the electrical conductivity was improved using the synergism between nanofillers while the viscosity was in the standard range for monofilament making process by extrusion. Moreover, the shielding effectiveness (SE) of the woven sample made of the developed composite was promising for personal protection (16 dB). ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon black; Composite materials; Corrosion resistance; Electric conductivity; Magnetic shielding; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanotubes; Solvents; Textiles; Weaving; Yarn; Conductive monofilament; Conductive polymer composites; Electrical conductivity; Electromagnetic shielding effectiveness; Nano-fillers; Synergy effect; Electromagnetic shielding"
"Super-enhancer-associated MEIS1 promotes transcriptional dysregulation in Ewing sarcoma in co-operation with EWS-FLI1",2019,"As the second most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, Ewing sarcoma is initiated and exacerbated by a chimeric oncoprotein, most commonly, EWS-FLI1. In this study, we apply epigenomic analysis to characterize the transcription dysregulation in this cancer, focusing on the investigation of super-enhancer and its associated transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We demonstrate that super-enhancer-associated transcripts are significantly enriched in EWS-FLI1 target genes, contribute to the aberrant transcriptional network of the disease, and mediate the exceptional sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma to transcriptional inhibition. Through integrative analysis, we identify MEIS1 as a super-enhancer-driven oncogene, which co-operates with EWS-FLI1 in transcriptional regulation, and plays a key pro-survival role in Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, APCDD1, another super-enhancer associated gene, acting as a downstream target of both MEIS1 and EWS-FLI1, is also characterized as a novel tumor-promoting factor in this malignancy. These data delineate super-enhancer-mediated transcriptional deregulation in Ewing sarcoma, and uncover numerous candidate oncogenes which can be exploited for further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis for this disease. ?

"Impact of intravascular ultrasound-guided drug-eluting stent implantation on patients with chronic kidney disease: Results from ULTIMATE trial",2019,"Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the impacts of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on the ULTIMATE trial. Background: IVUS-guided DES implantation improves clinical outcomes in complex lesions. However, routine IVUS guidance in patients with CKD remains controversial. Methods: CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL min?1 1.73 m?2. The primary end point was target vessel failure (TVF) at 12 months, including cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization. Results: eGFR was available in 1,443 patients, of whom 723 were in the IVUS guidance group, and 720 were in the angiography guidance group. Finally, CKD was present in 349 (24.2%) patients. At 12 months, TVF in the CKD group was 7.2%, which was significantly higher than 3.2% in the non-CKD group (p =.001). Moreover, there were 25 TVFs in the CKD patients, with 7 (3.9%) TVFs in the IVUS group and 18 (10.7%) TVFs in the angiography group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15–0.84; p =.01), whereas 35 TVFs occurred in patients without CKD, with 14 (2.6%) TVFs in the IVUS group and 21 (3.8%) TVFs in the angiography group (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.34–1.32; p =.25; p for interaction =.24). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that CKD patients undergoing DES implantations were associated with a higher risk of TVF at 12 months. More importantly, the risk of TVF in the CKD patients could be significantly decreased through IVUS guidance.

"Bromodomain and extraterminal proteins foster the core transcriptional regulatory programs and confer vulnerability in liposarcoma",2019,"Liposarcomas (LPSs) are a group of malignant mesenchymal tumors showing adipocytic differentiation. Here, to gain insight into the enhancer dysregulation and transcriptional addiction in this disease, we chart super-enhancer structures in both LPS tissues and cell lines. We identify a bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein-cooperated FUS-DDIT3 function in myxoid LPS and a BET protein-dependent core transcriptional regulatory circuitry consisting of FOSL2, MYC, and RUNX1 in de-differentiated LPS. Additionally, SNAI2 is identified as a crucial downstream target that enforces both proliferative and metastatic potentials to de-differentiated LPS cells. Genetic depletion of BET genes, core transcriptional factors, or SNAI2 mitigates consistently LPS malignancy. We also reveal a compelling susceptibility of LPS cells to BET protein degrader ARV-825. BET protein depletion confers additional advantages to circumvent acquired resistance to Trabectedin, a chemotherapy drug for LPS. Moreover, this study provides a framework for discovering and targeting of core oncogenic transcriptional programs in human cancers. ? 2019, The Author(s).","actin; bromodomain and extraterminal protein; epidermal growth factor; Myc protein; trabectedin; transcription factor; transcription factor RUNX1; transcriptional factor fosl2; unclassified drug; ARV-825; azepine derivative; FUS-DDIT3 fusion protein, human; oncoprotein; thalidomide; tumor protein; cancer; cell; chemotherapy; differentiation; genetic engineering; protein; tumor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioassay; body weight; brdu incorporation assay; cancer cell culture; carcinogenicity; cell cycle analysis; cell lysate; cell viability assay; chromatin immunoprecipitation; colony formation assay; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; gene silencing; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; liposarcoma; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; plasmid; protein depletion; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; signal transduction; tumor volume; analogs and derivatives; animal; carcinogenesis; drug effect; enhancer region; genetic transcription; genetics; human; human genome; liposarcoma; metabolism; nonobese diabetic mouse; nucleotide sequence; pathology; SCID mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Azepines; Base Sequence; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Genome, Human; Humans; Liposarcoma; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Proteins; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Thalidomide; Transcription, Genetic"
"MicroRNAs in the Migration of Mesenchymal Stem Cells",2019,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising source of cell-based therapies for treatment of a wide variety of injuries and diseases. Their tropism and migration to the damaged sites, which are elicited by cytokines secreted from tissues around pathology, are the prerequisite for tissue repair and regeneration. Better understanding of the elicited-migration of MSCs and discovering conditions that elevate their migration ability, will help to increase their homing to pathologies and improve therapeutic efficacy. It is increasingly recognized that microRNAs are important regulators of cell migration.

"Feasibility of Helical I-125 Seed Implant in the Portal Vein",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of helical iodine-125 (I-125) seed portal vein implantation. Materials and Methods: Helical I-125 seed implants were placed into the portal vein of healthy pigs through the transjugular?(n = 3)?or percutaneous transhepatic?(n = 3) route. Six pigs received follow-up at 9?weeks after implantation. Blood tests were performed preimplantation, and at 1 and 9?weeks after implantation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and single-photon emission computed tomography combined with CT (SPECT-CT) were acquired after implantation. Post-implantation CT was imported to the treatment planning system (TPS) for dose verification. At 9?weeks after implantation, another CT was performed before histopathological examination. Results: All implantations were successful, and the helical implants were fixed to the portal vein. CT showed no implant migration or portal vein thrombosis. The average dose to 90% of the target volume calculated from TPS was 68.4?Gy. SPECT-CT revealed an irregular isodose around the implant, in which the hottest spot was near the central portal vein lumen. All pigs were in good condition at the 9-week follow-up. Histopathology studies confirmed no portal vein thrombosis. Pigs showed no signs of bleeding, necrosis, or perforation of the peripheral tissue or organs.?Intimal hyperplasia was observed at the two?ends of the implant. A mild inflammatory response was detected in the?bile duct and adjacent liver tissues, yet there was no apparent inflammation of the hepatic arteries.

"Oncogenic potential of truncated RXRα during colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis by promoting IL-6-STAT3 signaling",2019,"Retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRα) is a potent regulator of inflammatory responses; however, its therapeutic potential for inflammatory cancer remains to be explored. We previously discovered that RXRα is abnormally cleaved in tumor cells and tissues, producing a truncated RXRα (tRXRα). Here, we show that transgenic expression of tRXRα in mice accelerates the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). The tumorigenic effect of tRXRα is primarily dependent on its expression in myeloid cells, which results in interleukin-6 (IL-6) induction and STAT3 activation. Mechanistic studies reveal an extensive interaction between tRXRα and TRAF6 in the cytoplasm of macrophages, leading to TRAF6 ubiquitination and subsequent activation of the NF-κB inflammatory pathway. K-80003, a tRXRα modulator derived from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac, suppresses the growth of tRXRα-mediated colorectal tumor by inhibiting the NF-κB-IL-6-STAT3 signaling cascade. These results provide new insight into tRXRα action and identify a promising tRXRα ligand for treating CAC. ? 2019, The Author(s).","interleukin 6; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; retinoid X receptor alpha; STAT3 protein; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; interleukin-6, mouse; K-80003; retinoid X receptor alpha; STAT3 protein; Stat3 protein, mouse; sulindac; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; cancer; cell; cytoplasm; gene expression; genetic engineering; ligand; tumor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone marrow cell; carcinogenesis; cell invasion assay; colitis; colony formation; colorectal cancer; confocal microscopy; Emtree; gene expression; genetic transfection; histopathology; immune response; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; inflammation; luciferase assay; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; tumor volume; ubiquitination; analogs and derivatives; animal; carcinogenesis; colitis; colon; colorectal tumor; conditioned medium; disease model; drug effect; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; human; immunology; metabolism; signal transduction; ulcerative colitis; Mus; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Colitis; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; Culture Media, Conditioned; Disease Models, Animal; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-6; Macrophages; Mice; NF-kappa B; Retinoid X Receptor alpha; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Sulindac; TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6"

"The Unique Spatial-Temporal Treatment Failure Patterns of Adjuvant Gefitinib Therapy: A Post Hoc Analysis of the ADJUVANT Trial (CTONG 1104)",2019,"Introduction: Adjuvant gefitinib therapy prolonged disease-free survival in patients with resected early-stage EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC in the ADJUVANT study (CTONG 1104). However, treatment failure patterns after gefitinib therapy are less well characterized. Methods: Overall, 222 stage N1–N2, EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients received gefitinib or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (VP) treatment. Tumor recurrences or metastases occurring during follow-up were defined as treatment failure; sites and data of first treatment failure were recorded. A post hoc analysis of treatment failure patterns which was estimated by Kaplan-Meier and hazard rate curves in modified intention-to-treat patients was conducted. Results: There were 114 recurrences and 10 deaths before recurrence across 124 progression events. Spatial distribution analysis showed that the first metastasis site was most frequently the central nervous system in the gefitinib group (29 of 106 [27.4%]), extracranial metastases were most frequent in the VP group (32 of 87 [36.8%]). Temporal distribution analysis showed lower tumor recurrence with gefitinib than with VP 0 to 21 months post-surgery. However, recurrence with gefitinib showed a constant rate of increase 12 months post-surgery. The first peak of extracranial metastasis appeared during 9 to 15 months with VP and 24 to 30 months with gefitinib. The highest peak for central nervous system metastases post-surgery occurred after 12 to 18 months with VP and 24 to 36 months with gefitinib. Conclusions: Adjuvant gefitinib showed advantages over VP chemotherapy in treatment failure patterns especially in extracranial metastasis. Adjuvant tyrosine kinas inhibitors may be considered as a treatment option in resected stage N1–N2 EGFR-mutant NSCLC but longer duration should be explored. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","cisplatin; gefitinib; vasculotropin receptor; vinorelbine tartrate; adjuvant chemotherapy; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; disease free survival; EGFR gene; gene mutation; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; non small cell lung cancer; oncogene; priority journal; tumor recurrence"

"Doxorubicin and siRNA-PD-L1 co-delivery with T7 modified ROS-sensitive nanoparticles for tumor chemoimmunotherapy",2019,"Tumor cells avoid immunosurveillance during the tumorigenesis, metastasis and recurrence periods thanks to the overexpressed immunosuppressive molecules on their surface. For instance, the programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) binds with the T-cells’ programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) impairing the anti-tumor activity of the host T cells. In this study, a new reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive nanoparticle (NP), modified with the HAIYPRH (T7) peptide, was developed for the co-delivery of siRNA-PD-L1 and doxorubicin (Dox). These NPs can block the inhibitory signal responding to T cells and enhance cytotoxicity of Dox against tumor cells. The T7 modification binds to the overexpressed transferrin receptor on tumor cells facilitating its cellular uptake. Dox rapid release is then triggered by the high tumor cells cytoplasmic concentration of ROS, leading to cell apoptosis. Our results demonstrated these NPs exhibited a T7-mediated cellular uptake and an intracellular ROS-triggered payloads release in vitro. They also suggested an improved in vivo 4T1 tumor targeting efficiency and chemoimmunotherapy. Most notably, the co-delivery system exhibited a significantly enhanced antitumor effect over Dox-only loaded NPs following prompting the proliferation of T cells by siRNA-PD-L1. In conclusion, these ROS-responsive NPs provided a promising strategy to combine siRNA-PD-L1 immunotherapy and Dox chemotherapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","copolymer; doxorubicin; haiyprh peptide; nanoparticle; peptide; programmed death 1 ligand 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; small interfering RNA; transferrin receptor; unclassified drug; antineoplastic antibiotic; collagen type 4; doxorubicin; nanoparticle; peptide fragment; programmed death 1 ligand 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; small interfering RNA; tumstatin (74-98); animal cell; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cell proliferation; cell transport; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug distribution; drug release; female; fluorescence imaging; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; neoplasm; nonhuman; nonviral gene delivery system; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rat; T lymphocyte; treatment response; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; zeta potential; animal; Bagg albino mouse; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; B7-H1 Antigen; Cell Line, Tumor; Collagen Type IV; Doxorubicin; Female; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Peptide Fragments; Reactive Oxygen Species; RNA, Small Interfering; Tumor Burden"
"PAR2 inhibition enhanced the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to 5-FU and reduced EMT signaling",2019,"The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms that transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b)-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells contributes to 5-FU resistance. A series of experiments involving cell viability and caspase activity analyses, siRNA transfection, RNA isolation, and quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assay, cell migration analysis, Western blotting analysis of total protein and membrane protein were performed in this study. Mouse xenograft model was used to determine the effect of the PAR2 inhibitor in vivo. In this study, we found that protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) induction in 5-FU therapy is correlated with TGF-b-mediated EMT and apoptosis resistance. PAR2 and TGF-b were both activated in response to 5-FU treatment in vivo and in vitro, and whereas TGF-b inhibition sensitized CRC cells to 5-FU and suppressed cell migration, PAR2 activation eliminated the effect of TGF-b inhibition. Conversely, siRNA-mediated PAR2 depletion or PAR2 inhibition with a specific inhibitor produced a similar phenotype as TGF-b signal inhibition: 5-FU sensitization and cell migration suppression. Moreover, the results of xenograft experiments indicated that the PAR2 inhibitor can enhance cell killing by 5-FU in vivo and suppress EMT signaling. Our results reveal that the TGF-b effects require the coordinating action of PAR2, suggesting that PAR2 inhibition could be a new therapeutic strategy to combat 5-FU resistance in CRC. ? 2019 Cognizant Communication Corporation.

"TRAF6 neddylation drives inflammatory arthritis by increasing NF-κB activation",2019,"Neddylation is a process similar to ubiquitination, and is critical in various inflammatory diseases; however, its importance in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of neddylation in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and its clinical relevance. We showed that neddylation-related genes, including NEDD8 and CULLIN-1, were significantly upregulated in inflamed arthritic synovia. Functionally, neddylation activation was crucial for synovitis of CIA, as the inhibition of neddylation by MLN4924 significantly suppressed synovial cell proliferation and inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, neddylation mediated inflammatory arthritis by regulating NF-κB activation in fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSs). Furthermore, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) neddylation at Lys124 was essential for IL-17A-induced NF-κB activation. Replacing the Lys-124 residue with Arg (K124R) resulted in significantly impaired conjugation of NEDD8 to TRAF6, as well as markedly attenuated IL-17A-induced NF-κB activity. Therefore, the pathogenic role of neddylation in CIA as well as its mechanism of action demonstrated here provides a new insight into understanding the role of post-transcriptional modifications in the arthritis inflammatory response. ? 2019, The Author(s).","arginine; collagen type 2; cullin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 17; NEDD8 protein; pevonedistat; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; NEDD8 protein; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell proliferation; clinical article; collagen-induced arthritis; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; fibroblast; human; human tissue; immune response; innate immunity; intracellular signaling; male; mouse; neddylation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein processing; synovial fluid; synoviocyte; synovitis; upregulation; animal; arthritis; cell culture; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; physiology; Animals; Arthritis; Cells, Cultured; Fibroblasts; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; NEDD8 Protein; NF-kappa B; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6"
"Apolipoprotein M could inhibit growth and metastasis of SMMC7721 cells via vitamin D receptor signaling",2019,"Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high mortality-to-incidence ratios. Apolipoprotein M (ApoM), a member of the apolipoprotein family, is mainly synthesized in the liver, whereas its role in HCC has not been elucidated. Here, we examined the effect of ApoM on the biological behavior of HCC cells and the possible mechanisms. Methods: We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out ApoM in SMMC7721 cells. Differentially expressed genes before and after ApoM knockout (KO) were analyzed by GeneChip microarrays and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Cell assays of proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were performed in SMMC7721 cells, and the expression of epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was performed by western blot. And we performed functional recovery experiments by overexpressing vitamin D receptor (VDR) in SMMC7721. Results: The ApoM-KO SMMC7721 cell line was successfully constructed using the CRISPR/ Cas9 technology. Our results showed that silencing ApoM suppressed apoptosis and promoted proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of SMMC7721 cells. The microarray data revealed that a total of 1,868 differentially expressed genes were identified, includingVDR. The qRT-PCR and western blot verification results demonstrated that knocking out ApoM could significantly reduce the expression of VDR. The functional recovery experiments indicated that VDR overexpression could offset the inhibition of cell apoptosis and the promotion of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT caused by knocking out ApoM in SMMC7721 cells. Conclusion: ApoM could function as a tumor suppressor to inhibit the growth and metastasis of SMMC7721 cells via VDR signaling in HCC. ? 2019, Dove Medical Press Ltd.

"The effect and mechanism of miR-210 in down-regulating the autophagy of lung cancer cells",2019,"This project aims to investigate the roles of miR-210 in autophagy of lung cancer cells and the related mechanism. The expressions of miR-210 and ATG7 in 30 cancer tissues and the adjacent tissues in patients with lung cancer were compared using RT-qPCR methods, Western Blot assay was carried out to test the expression of ATG7 in protein. Moreover, the dual luciferase reporter gene assay system was used to confirm ATG7 is a target gene of miR-210. Furthermore, lung cancer cell line A549 was transfected with either miR-210 mimics or inhibitors and RT-qPCR methods was used to detect the expression of miR-210 and ATG7. Next, MTT assay was used to examine the effect of miR-210 on the growth of the lung cancer cells, and finally, the expression of autophagy related genes, ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 were detected by Western Blot and ICC assay. We observed that miR-210 was significantly increased and ATG7 was markedly decreased in cancer tissue of patients with lung cancer compared with normal tissue. Moreover, results of dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that ATG7 is a direct target of miR-210. Next, transfection of miR-210 mimics in lung cancer cells induced significant increase in cell proliferation, and transfection of miR-210 inhibitors lead to inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-210 induced marked decrease in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1, while transfection of miR-210 inhibitors induced significant increase in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and beclin-1. Our results suggested that miR-210 plays a great role in autophagy of lung cancer cell by targeting ATG7. ? 2018","autophagy related protein 7; beclin 1; membrane protein; microRNA 210; protein LC3 I; protein LC3 II; unclassified drug; Atg7 protein, human; autophagy related protein 7; microRNA; MIRN210 microRNA, human; A-549 cell line; adult; Article; autophagy; cancer patient; cancer tissue; cell growth; cell proliferation; controlled study; gene expression; gene function; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; pathogenesis; protein expression; aged; autophagy; biosynthesis; down regulation; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; Adult; Aged; Autophagy; Autophagy-Related Protein 7; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Down-Regulation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged"
"Two-dimensional metal-organic-framework as a unique theranostic nano-platform for nuclear imaging and chemo-photodynamic cancer therapy",2019,"Nanoscale metal organic frameworks (NMOFs) with porous structure and inherent biodegradability are attractive nanomedicine platforms. In addition to conventional particulate NMOFs, two-dimensional (2D) NMOFs are emerging as a unique type of NMOFs which however have been relatively less explored for nanomedicine applications. Herein, 2D-NMOFs composed of Zn2+ and tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) are fabricated and functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Compared to their particulate counterpart, such 2D-NMOFs show greatly increased drug loading capacity and enhanced light-triggered singlet oxygen production, promising for chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT), respectively. Utilizing the porphyrin structure of TCPP, our 2D-NMOFs could be labeled with a diagnostic radioisotope, 99mTc, for single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging, which reveals efficient tumor homing of those 2D-NMOFs upon intravenous injection. While offering a remarkable synergistic in vivo antitumor effect for the combined chemo-PDT, such 2D-NMOFs show efficient biodegradation and rapid renal clearance. Our work presents the great promise of 2D-NMOFs for nanomedicine applications.

"Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential countermeasure",2019,"Mitochondria not only supply the energy for cell function, but also take part in cell signaling. This review describes the dysfunctions of mitochondria in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and the signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial biogenesis (including PGC-1 family proteins, SIRT1, AMPK) and mitophagy (parkin-Pink1 pathway). Understanding the regulation of these mitochondrial pathways may be beneficial in finding pharmacological approaches or lifestyle changes (caloric restrict or exercise) to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis and/or to activate mitophagy for the removal of damaged mitochondria, thus reducing the onset and/or severity of neurodegenerative diseases. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The role of intestinal microbiota in cardiovascular disease",2019,"Accumulating evidence has indicated that intestinal microbiota is involved in the development of various human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In the recent years, both human and animal experiments have revealed that alterations in the composition and function of intestinal flora, recognized as gut microflora dysbiosis, can accelerate the progression of CVDs. Moreover, intestinal flora metabolizes the diet ingested by the host into a series of metabolites, including trimethylamine N-oxide, short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acid and indoxyl sulfate, which affects the host physiological processes by activation of numerous signalling pathways. The aim of this review was to summarize the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of CVDs, including coronary artery disease, hypertension and heart failure, which may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for CVD that involve interfering with the composition, function and metabolites of the intestinal flora. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in a C9orf72 mouse line expressing poly-PR",2019,"A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Repeat-associated non-ATG translation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) contributes to the neuropathological features of c9FTD/ALS. Among the five DPRs, arginine-rich poly-PR are reported to be the most toxic. Here, we generate a transgenic mouse line that expresses poly-PR (GFP-PR28) specifically in neurons. GFP-PR28 homozygous mice show decreased survival time, while the heterozygous mice show motor imbalance, decreased brain weight, loss of Purkinje cells and lower motor neurons, and inflammation in the cerebellum and spinal cord. Transcriptional analysis shows that in the cerebellum, GFP-PR28 heterozygous mice show differential expression of genes related to synaptic transmission. Our findings show that GFP-PR28 transgenic mice partly model neuropathological features of c9FTD/ALS, and show a role for poly-PR in neurodegeneration. ? 2019, The Author(s).","brain; cell component; chromosome; gene; gene expression; neurology; pathology; protein; Mus; Mus musculus; dipeptide; green fluorescent protein; guanine nucleotide exchange C9orf72; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; female; genetics; human; male; metabolism; motor activity; mouse; pathophysiology; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; C9orf72 Protein; Dipeptides; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Motor Activity"
"Sitagliptin ameliorates advanced glycation end-product (AGE)-induced degradation of extracellular matrix in human primary chondrocytes",2019,"Accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) increases inflammation and triggers processes involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). As a major debilitating age-related disease, it is imperative that novel therapies for OA be sought. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the selective dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin in human primary chondrocytes exposed to insult by AGEs to elucidate the potential role of sitagliptin in the treatment of OA. Our findings show that inhibition of DPP-4 by sitagliptin could reduce oxidative stress, increase cell viability and prevent degradation of type II collagen and aggrecan by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) induced by AGEs in human primary chondrocytes. Mechanistically, we found that sitagliptin inhibited AGEs-induced nuclear translocation of p65 protein and drastically decreased the luciferase activity of NF-κB. These findings indicate that sitagliptin may have potential as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment and prevention of OA. ? 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

"Comprehensive profiling of JMJD3 in gastric cancer and its influence on patient survival",2019,"Histone methylation is thought to control the regulation of genetic program and the dysregulation of it has been found to be closely associated with cancer. JMJD3 has been identified as an H3K27 demethylase and its role in cancer development is context specific. The role of JMJD3 in gastric cancer (GC) has not been examined. In this study, JMJD3 expression was determined. The prognostic significance of JMJD3 and its association with clinical parameters were evaluated. JMJD3 dysregulation mechanism and targets were analyzed. The effect of JMJD3 mutation was determined by functional study. Results showed that JMJD3 was overexpressed in different patient cohorts and also by bioinformatics analysis. High JMJD3 expression was correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with GC and was an independent prognosis predictor. Genetic aberration and DNA methylation might be involved in the deregulation of JMJD3 in GC. Downstream network of JMJD3 was analyzed and several novel potential targets were identified. Furthermore, functional study discovered that both demethylase-dependent and demethylase-independent mechanisms were involved in the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC. Importantly, histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 could reverse the oncogenic effect of JMJD3 overexpression. In conclusion, our study report the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC for the first time. JMJD3 might serve as an important epigenetic therapeutic target and/or prognostic predictor in GC. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"MicroRNA?200a suppresses migration and invasion and enhances the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells by inhibiting the HGF/c?Met signaling pathway",2019,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), an activator of the c-Met signaling pathway, is involved in tumor invasiveness, metastasis and radiotherapy resistance. In the present study, a novel HGF regulatory pathway in lung cancer involving microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is described.

"Association of Restless Legs Syndrome With Risk of Suicide and Self-harm",2019,"Importance: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that has been previously found to be associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation. In the context of the increasing suicide rate in the United States, the evidence regarding the association between RLS and the risk of suicide and self-harm is limited. Objective: To investigate the association between RLS and risk of suicide and self-harm. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was performed using Truven Health MarketScan national claims data from 2006 to 2014; the baseline data were from 2006 to 2008, and the follow-up data covered 6 years (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014). Included were 24?179 nonpregnant participants with RLS and 145?194 age- and sex-matched participants without RLS at baseline (2006-2008), who were free of suicide, self-harm, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at study baseline. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019. Exposure: Diagnosis of RLS, as identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident suicide and self-harm event, identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code. Results: Among 169?373 participants in the current analysis, the mean (SD) age was 49.4 (9.1) years; 53?426 (31.5%) participants were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up duration of 5.2 (2.2) years, 119 incident suicide and self-harm cases were identified. Individuals with RLS had a higher risk of suicide or self-harm compared with those without RLS (adjusted hazard ratio,?2.66; 95% CI, 1.70-4.15), after adjusting for lifestyle factors (eg, alcohol and obesity), presence of chronic diseases (eg, depression, insomnia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, iron-deficiency anemia, and Parkinson disease), and use of medications. Excluding those with depression, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and other common chronic conditions, the significant association between RLS and suicide or self-harm persisted (adjusted hazard ratio,?4.14; 95% CI, 2.17-7.92). Conclusions and Relevance: Restless legs syndrome was associated with a high risk of suicide and self-harm, and the risk was independent of most identified diseases and conditions.",""
"Threats of indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in six molluscs from market to food safety: A case study in Haikou City, China",2019,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) found in marine molluscs could be a serious threat to the health of consumers; however, studies on this subject are limited. To understand this threat, the indicator PCBs (PCB-28, PCB-52, PCB-101, PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153 and PCB-180) found in six different kinds of molluscs were determined, and the associated cancer risk for consumers that intake these indicator PCBs via molluscs was assessed. The total concentrations of PCBs in molluscs ranged from 17.51 to 47.43 ng/g (d.w.). The order of contamination levels for indicator PCBs in molluscs was Perna viridis &gt; Ruditapes philippinarum &gt; Crassostrea gigas &gt; Mimachlamys nobilis &gt; Glossaulax didyma &gt; Anadara antiquata. Tri-, tetra- and penta-PCBs were the dominant congeners in molluscs from Haikou City. Tetra-PCBs are the most common PCB, accounting for 38.49% of total PCBs. Compared with previous global studies on PCBs in molluscs, the pollution level of indicator PCBs in the molluscs from Haikou City was lower than most of reports in Europe and China, but higher than those from France and Korea, suggesting a moderate pollution level. The 50% and 95% cancer risks of indicator PCBs in molluscs for adult consumers were 2.75 × 10?7 and 4.32 × 10?7, indicating that the cancer risk was at an acceptable level. Since the dioxin like-PCBs were not analyzed in this study, the cancer risk of PCBs to human health might be underestimated; therefore, more studies on PCB pollution in molluscs are required. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diseases; Health risks; Marine pollution; Molluscs; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Risk assessment; Cancer risk; Contamination levels; Crassostrea gigas; Dioxin-like PCBs; Occurrence; Pollution level; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Ruditapes philippinarum; Chemical contamination; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; bioaccumulation; bioindicator; food market; food safety; health impact; health risk; marine pollution; mollusc; PCB; Anadara antiquata; animal tissue; Article; cancer risk; case study; China; concentration (parameters); consumer; controlled study; Crassostrea gigas; Europe; food intake; food safety; France; Glossaulax didyma; health hazard; Korea; Mimachlamys nobilis; mollusc; nonhuman; Perna viridis; Ruditapes philippinarum; water pollution; analysis; animal; chemistry; food contamination; human; mollusc; procedures; risk assessment; shellfish; water pollutant; China; Haikou; Hainan; Anadara antiquata; Crassostrea gigas; Mimachlamys nobilis; Mollusca; Perna viridis; Venerupis (Ruditapes) philippinarum; Animals; China; Food Contamination; Humans; Mollusca; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Risk Assessment; Shellfish; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"Rural-urban migration and mental health of Chinese migrant children: Systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Mental health has become a new focus of public health related to migrants in recent years. There are many contradictions in previous studies on the mental health status of migrant children in China. Methods: PubMed, OVID, ERIC, Web of Knowledge, CNKI, Wan Fang and Chongqing VIP were searched on August 16, 2018. The data were analyzed using SMD and random effect model in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results: We included 11 studies involving 4621 migrant children and 5076 urban children. The mental health of migrant children was worse than that of urban children, as evidenced by total score of Mental Health Test (Standardized Mean Difference, SMD = 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.59) and seven out eight sub-scales of Mental Health Test (SMD, ranging from 0.24 to 0.37).

"MiR-150 attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury via targeting AKT3",2019,"Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe manifestation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in human lung are induced by inflammatory cytokines and endogenous factors such as miRNAs. However, the role of miR-150 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI is not clear. Here, we found miR-150 expression was significantly reduced in the serum of patients with ARDS, and negatively associated with the disease severity and 28-day survival of ARDS. In vivo, miR-150 decreased total cell and neutrophil counts, and production of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as well as levels of total protein, albumin and IgM in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in LPS-induced ALI mice. Meanwhile, miR-150 improved the 72 h survival rate of LPS-induced ALI mice. In-vitro assays demonstrated that miR-150 alleviated LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis, autophagy, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Further, AKT3 was a direct target of miR-150. Silencing of AKT3 partially reversed LPS-induced A549 cell injury, and enhanced the protective effects of miR-150. In addition, miR-150 or si-AKT3 effectively inhibited the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (p65 and IκBα). In conclusion, miR-150 alleviated LPS-induced acute lung injury via directly targeting AKT3 expression or regulating JNK and NF-κB pathways, which may be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat ALI/ARDS. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","akt3 protein; albumin; beclin 1; caspase 3; caspase 9; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; microRNA; microRNA 150; protein; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; stress activated protein kinase; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipopolysaccharide; microRNA; MIRN150 microRNA, human; protein kinase B; stress activated protein kinase; A-549 cell line; adult; animal experiment; animal model; APACHE; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme phosphorylation; female; flow cytometry; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury; lung lavage; major clinical study; male; mouse; neutrophil count; nonhuman; priority journal; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; survival; survival rate; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; animal; Bagg albino mouse; blood; gene silencing; genetics; immunology; middle aged; A549 Cells; Acute Lung Injury; Adult; Aged; Animals; Female; Gene Silencing; Humans; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; NF-kappa B; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult"
"Efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided totally implantable venous access ports via the right innominate vein in adult patients with cancer: Single-centre experience and protocol",2019,"Background: Totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAPs) are widely used and are an essential tool in the efficient delivery of chemotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of implantation of ultrasound (US)-guided TIVAPs via the right innominate vein (INV) for adult patients with cancer. Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 283 adult patients with cancer who underwent US-guided INV puncture for TIVAPs between September 2015 and September 2017. It also analysed the technical success rate, operation time, and short-term and long-term surgical complications. Results: Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%). The mean operation time was 28.31 ± 7.31 min (range: 23–39 min), and the puncture success rate for the first attempt was 99.30% (281/283). Minor complications included artery puncture during the operation in one patient, but no pneumothorax was encountered. The mean TIVAP time was 304.16 ± 42.54 days (range: 38–502 days). The rate of postoperative complications was 2.83% (8/283), including poor healing of the incision in one patient, catheter-related infections in three patients, port thrombosis in one patient, and fibrin sheath formation in three patients; no catheter malposition, pinch-off syndrome, catheter fracture, or other serious complications were observed. Conclusions: TIVAPs are widely employed for chemotherapy. The present study found that the novel approach of using US-guided INV puncture to implant TIVAPs in adult patients with cancer is both short-termly feasible and safe for long-term central venous access. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology","antibiotic agent; anticoagulant agent; fibrinolytic agent; adult; antibiotic therapy; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; Article; brachiocephalic vein; breast cancer; catheter infection; catheter removal; catheter thrombosis; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; feasibility study; female; fibrin sheath formation; fibrinolytic therapy; human; implantation; interventional ultrasonography; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medical device complication; medical record review; middle aged; operation duration; patient safety; priority journal; retrospective study; stomach cancer; suture technique; vein puncture; wound healing impairment; aged; brachiocephalic vein; central venous catheterization; indwelling catheter; neoplasm; patient safety; postoperative complication; procedures; surgery; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Brachiocephalic Veins; Catheterization, Central Venous; Catheters, Indwelling; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Operative Time; Patient Safety; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional"

"A genetic variant in miR-100 is a protective factor of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia",2019,"Background: In the past decade, miR-100, miR-146a, and miR-210 were reported to be dysregulated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, effects of genetic variants in these three microRNAs have not been investigated in Chinese population. Methods: In this study, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between genetic variants in miR-100, miR-146a, and miR-210 and the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese population. Subsequently, plasma expression level of miR-100 was also detected. Result: We found that subjects carrying mutant homozygous TT genotype of miR-100 rs543412 had a statistically significantly decreased risk of childhood ALL (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?0.55-0.97, P?=?0.029). This protective effect was also observed among subjects whose parents were ever drinkers (adjusted OR?=?0.53, 95% CI?=?0.29-0.94), or whose living house were ever painted (adjusted OR?=?0.57, 95% CI?=?0.34-0.94). Besides, rs543412 variant homozygous TT had a significantly protective role in patients with childhood B-ALL. Finally, we found that expression level of miR-100 in plasma of childhood ALL cases was significantly higher than that of noncancer controls. Conclusion: Our study suggested that there was significant association between the polymorphisms in miR-100 (rs543412) and decreased susceptibility to childhood ALL. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Incidence, risk factors, and clinical significance of Epstein–Barr virus reactivation in myelodysplastic syndrome after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation",2019,"Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) reactivation is a life-threatening complication after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In this study, we investigated the characteristics of EBV reactivation in 186 consecutive myelodysplastic (MDS) patients who underwent allo-HSCT in our centre. In 35 patients (18.8%) who experienced EBV reactivation after allo-HSCT, the median onset was 53?days (range 4–381?days). The cumulative incidence of EBV reactivation at the first, sixth, and twelfth month after allo-HSCT was 10.7%, 15.1%, and 17.9%, respectively. Twenty-five patients (71.4%) received pre-emptive rituximab therapy, and no patients developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Stem cell source was proven to be a risk factor correlated with EBV reactivation. The cumulative incidence of relapse in the EBV-positive group was 11.4%, 25.2%, and 31.0% at the first, second, and third year after transplantation, respectively, being significantly higher than the corresponding 6.8%, 10.2%, and 10.2%, in the EBV-negative group (P = 0.014). Prognostic analysis showed that EBV reactivation was an independent risk factor for relapse-free survival (RFS). Patients in the EBV-positive group showed obviously shorter RFS than those in the EBV-negative group, with 3-year RFS of 62% and 85%, respectively (P = 0.017). ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","busulfan; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; cytarabine; fludarabine; hydroxyurea; methotrexate; rituximab; semustine; thymocyte antibody; rituximab; adolescent; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; child; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease free survival; Epstein Barr virus; female; graft versus host reaction; human; incidence; lymphoproliferative disease; major clinical study; male; myeloablative conditioning; myelodysplastic syndrome; nonhuman; overall survival; patient monitoring; priority journal; prognosis; recurrence free survival; reduced intensity conditioning; relapse; risk factor; school child; stem cell; treatment duration; univariate analysis; virus reactivation; allograft; clinical trial; Epstein Barr virus infection; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; incidence; middle aged; mortality; myelodysplastic syndrome; risk factor; survival rate; time factor; Adolescent; Adult; Allografts; Child; Disease-Free Survival; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Risk Factors; Rituximab; Survival Rate; Time Factors"
"Carbenoxolone ameliorates insulin sensitivity in obese mice induced by high fat diet via regulating the IκB-α/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome",2019,"The characteristic feature of obesity and insulin resistance is chronic low-grade inflammation. Nod-Like Receptor Pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a central role in obesity-induced insulin resistance. However, how does Carbenoxolone (CBX) play its role in ameliorating insulin resistance in peripheral tissues of obese mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) remains unknown. In our study, we explored the molecular mechanism of CBX in improving insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle in mice induced by the HFD. Our results revealed that in the CBX group, a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR score were observed. CBX could attenuate intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammation aggravation in liver and skeletal muscle. Besides, treatment with CBX could significantly reduce expressions of p-IκB-α, p-NF-κB, p-IRS-1, NLRP3 and inflammatory factors, increase expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT. Therefore, CBX could dramatically improve insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle in mice induced by the high-fat diet. In conclusions, we demonstrate that CBX has a significant protective effect on diet-induced obesity in mice. The potential mechanisms include inhibiting IκB-α/NF-κB pathway, restricting the production of NLRP3 inflammasome and other inflammatory factors, reducing the expression of p-IRS-1, increasing the expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT, thus ameliorating insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle of high-fat diet mice. Therefore CBX is an active agent against diet-induced obesity and is given the opportunity for the treatment of obesity related diseases. ? 2019","carbenoxolone; cryopyrin; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inflammasome; insulin; insulin receptor substrate 1; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoprotein; protein kinase B; carbenoxolone; cryopyrin; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Nlrp3 protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; drug mechanism; glucose blood level; homeostasis model assessment; inflammation; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; liver tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; skeletal muscle; adverse event; animal; C57BL mouse; complication; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; insulin resistance; lipid diet; metabolism; obesity; randomization; Animals; Carbenoxolone; Diet, High-Fat; Gene Expression Regulation; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle, Skeletal; NF-kappa B; NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Obesity; Random Allocation"
"Dual-specificity phosphatase 5 suppresses ovarian cancer progression by inhibiting il-33 signaling",2019,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are proteins that are reported involved in carcinogenesis, but their roles in OC have not be extensively studied. Here, we found that DUSP5 is markedly down-regulated in OC tissues. We reanalyzed DUSP5 expression in OC using published microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and found that patients with low DUSP5 expression have significantly shorter overall survival than those with high expression (P < 0.001). Down-regulation of DUSP5 in OC tissues was immunohistochemically confirmed in tissue microarrays containing 15 normal ovary tissue samples and 60 OC specimens. Functional studies suggest that DUSP5 silence facilitates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells in vitro. DUSP5 over-expression inhibits cell proliferation but has no effect on OC cell migration or invasion. Mechanistically, silencing DUSP5 transcriptionally activates interleukin 33 (IL-33) expression and secretion. Blockage of IL-33 with a neutralizing anti-IL33 antibody attenuates the effect of DUSP5 silencing to promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, recombinant IL-33 protein treatment dramatically promotes OC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion with DUSP5 over-expression. Our study provides proof of principle that DUSP5 down-regulation promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells via activation of IL-33 signaling. ? 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

"The role of Nav1.7 and methylglyoxal-mediated activation of TRPA1 in itch and hypoalgesia in a murine model of type 1 diabetes",2019,"Methylglyoxal (MGO), an endogenous reactive carbonyl compound, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of MGO in diabetic itch and hypoalgesia, two common symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy. Methods: Scratching behavior, mechanical itch (alloknesis), and thermal hypoalgesia were quantified after intradermal (i.d.) injection of MGO in na?ve mice or in diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Behavioral testing, patch-clamp recording, transgenic mice, and gene expression analysis were used to investigate the mechanisms underlying diabetic itch and hypoalgesia in mice. Results: I.d. injection of MGO evoked dose-dependent scratching in normal mice. Addition of MGO directly activated transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) to induce inward currents and calcium influx in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons or in TRPA1-expressing HEK293 cells. Mechanical itch, but not spontaneous itch was developed in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Genetic ablation of Trpa1 (Trpa1-/-), pharmacological blockade of TRPA1 and Nav1.7, antioxidants, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase enzyme (MEK) inhibitor U0126 abrogated itch induced by MGO or in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Thermal hypoalgesia was induced by intrathecal (i.t.) injection of MGO or in STZ-induced diabetic mice, which was abolished by MGO scavengers, intrathecal injection of TRPA1 blockers, and in Trpa1-/- mice. Conclusion: This study revealed that Nav1.7 and MGO-mediated activation of TRPA1 play key roles in itch and hypoalgesia in a murine model of type 1 diabetes. Thereby, we provide a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of itch and hypoalgesia induced by diabetic neuropathy. ?

"Advance care planning improves psychological symptoms but not quality of life and preferred end-of-life care of patients with cancer",2019,"Background: This study was conducted to examine whether a longitudinal advance care planning (ACP) intervention facilitates concordance between the preferred and received life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) of terminally ill patients with cancer and improves quality of life (QoL), anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms during the dying process. Patients and Methods: Of 795 terminally ill patients with cancer from a medical center in Taiwan, 460 were recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to the experimental and control arms. The experimental arm received an interactive ACP intervention tailored to participants' readiness to engage in this process. The control arm received symptom management education. Group allocation was concealed, data collectors were blinded, and treatment fidelity was monitored. Outcome measures included 6 preferred and received LSTs, QoL, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Intervention effectiveness was evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Participants providing data had died through December 2017. The 2 study arms did not differ significantly in concordance between the 6 preferred and received LSTs examined (odds ratios, 0.966 [95% CI, 0.653-1.428] and 1.107 [95% CI, 0.690-1.775]). Participants who received the ACP intervention had significantly fewer anxiety symptoms (b, 20.583; 95% CI, 20.977 to 20.189; P5.004) and depressive symptoms (b, 20.533; 95% CI, 21.036 to 20.030; P5.038) compared with those in the control arm, but QoL did not differ. Conclusions: Our ACP intervention facilitated participants' psychological adjustment to the end-of-life (EoL) care decision-making process, but neither improved QoL nor facilitated EoL care honoring their wishes. The inability of our intervention to improve concordance may have been due to the family power to override patients' wishes in deeply Confucian doctrine-influenced societies such as Taiwan. Nevertheless, our findings reassure healthcare professionals that such an ACP intervention does not harm but improves the psychological well-being of terminally ill patients with cancer, thereby encouraging physicians to discuss EoL care preferences with patients and involve family caregivers in EoL care decision-making to eventually lead to patient value-concordant EoL cancer care. ? 2019 Harborside Press.

"Fluorinated Polyethylenimine to Enable Transmucosal Delivery of Photosensitizer-Conjugated Catalase for Photodynamic Therapy of Orthotopic Bladder Tumors Postintravesical Instillation",2019,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) by insertion of an optical fiber into the bladder cavity has been applied in the clinic for noninvasive treatment of bladder tumors. To avoid systemic phototoxicity, bladder intravesical instillation of a photosensitizer may be an ideal approach for PDT treatment of bladder cancer, in comparison to conventional intravenous injection. However, the instillation-based PDT for bladder cancer treatment remains to be less effective due to the poor urothelial uptake of photosensitizer, as well as the tumor hypoxia-associated PDT resistance. Herein, it is uncovered that fluorinated polyethylenimine (F-PEI) achieved by mixing with Chorin-e6-conjugated catalase (CAT-Ce6) is able to form self-assembled CAT-Ce6/F-PEI nanoparticles, which show greatly improved cross-membrane, transmucosal, and intratumoral penetration capacities compared with CAT-Ce6 alone or nonfluorinated CAT-Ce6/PEI nanoparticles. Owing to the decomposition of tumor endogenous H2O2 by CAT-Ce6/F-PEI nanoparticles penetrating into bladder tumors, the tumor hypoxia would be effectively relieved to further favor PDT. Therefore, bladder intravesical instillation with CAT-Ce6/F-PEI nanoparticles could offer remarkably improved photodynamic therapeutic effect to destruct orthotopic bladder tumors with reduced systemic toxicity compared to hematoporphyrin, the first-line photosensitizer used for bladder cancer PDT in clinic. This work presents a unique photosensitizer nanomedicine formulation, promising for clinical translation in instillation-based PDT to treat bladder tumors. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Light-Triggered Covalent Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles for Photothermal Cancer Therapy",2019,"Manipulating the cross-coupling of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to maximize the photothermal effect is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Here, by taking advantage of the well-known tetrazole/alkene photoclick chemistry, we have demonstrated for the first time that small AuNPs (23 nm) decorated with both 2,5-diphenyltetrazole and methacrylic acid on their surfaces can form covalently crosslinked aggregates upon laser irradiation (λ=405 nm). In vitro studies indicated that the light-triggered assembling shifted the surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs significantly to near-infrared (NIR) regions, which as a consequence effectively enhanced the efficacy of photothermal therapy for 4T1 breast cancer cells. We thus believe that this new light-triggered cross-coupling approach might offer a valuable tool for cancer treatment. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"The anthelmintic agent oxfendazole inhibits cell growth in non?small cell lung cancer by suppressing c?Src activation",2019,"The c-Src protein family of tyrosine kinases are important in the tumorigenesis of many types of tumors, and may be a potential target for antitumor drug discovery. In the present study, immunoblotting was performed to analyze protein expression, CCK-8 assay was carried out to assess cell viability and cell cycle was analyzed using a flow cytometer. The anthelmintic agent oxfendazole was observed to be a novel c-Src inhibitor that blocked the activation of c-Src. Oxfendazole also suppressed the cell growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and overexpression of c-Src decreased the cytotoxicity of oxfendazole against NSCLC cells. In addition, oxfendazole induced cell cycle arrest at the G 0 /G 1 phase, and downregulated the protein levels of Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-4, CDK6, retinoblastoma protein and E2 transcription factor 1, and upregulated the expression levels of p53 and p21 in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, oxfendazole enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin against NSCLC cells. These results demonstrated that oxfendazole exerted its antitumor activity by suppressing c-Src signaling, and it was also indicated that the anthelmintic agent oxfendazole may be effective for anti-NSCLC therapy in the clinic as a single agent or in combination with other antitumor drugs. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Construction of immune-related risk signature for renal papillary cell carcinoma",2019,"The kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) is a relatively rare type of kidney cancer. There has been no investigation to find a robust signature to predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients in the aspect of tumor immunology. In this study, 285 KIRP samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were randomly divided into training and testing set. A total of 1534 immune-related genes from The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) were used as candidates to construct the signature. Using univariate Cox analysis, we evaluated the relationship between overall survival and immune-related genes expression and found 272 immune-related genes with predicting prognostic ability. In order to construct an efficient predictive model, the Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic-net penalty was used and identified 23 groups after 1000 iterations. As a result, 15-genes model showing more stable than other gene groups was chosen to construct our immune-related risk signature. In line with our expectations, the signature can independently predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients. Patients with high-immune risk were found correlated with advanced stage. We also found that the high-immune risk patients with higher PBRM1 and SETD2 mutations, increasing chromosomal instability, together with the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results showing intensive connection of our signature with immune pathways. In conclusion, our study constructs a robust 15-gene signature for predicting KIRP patients’ survival outcome on the basis of tumor immune environment and may provide possible relationship between prognosis and immune-related biological function. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Radiolabeled ultra-small Fe 3 O 4 nanoprobes for tumor-targeted multimodal imaging",2019,"Aim: In the present study, we aimed to characterize the tumor-targeting properties of ultra-small iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as multimodality imaging contrast agent. Methods: The dimeric cRGD peptides [cyclic(Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-dSer-Cys)-Tyr-dSer-Lys-Tyr-cyclic(Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-dSer-Cys)], which specifically targeted integrin-α v β 3 receptor highly overexpressed in tumor vasculature and tumor cells, were covalently conjugated onto the surface of ultra-small IONPs followed by the labeling of nuclide 125 I - through the chloramine-T method to afford the desired 125 I-(cRGD) 2 -IONPs nanoprobe. 125 I-(cRGD) 2 -IONPs were injected into tumor-bearing mice for magnetic resonance (MR) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) multi-modality imaging of tumors. Results: The prepared IONPs demonstrated were very useful for T1/T2 and SPECT imaging of tumors in vivo, exhibiting a high tumor uptake of a clinically useful target-to-background ratio in a short time.

"Tre2 (USP6NL) promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation via Wnt/β-catenin pathway",2019,"Background: Most colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage with poor prognosis. Ubiquitin-specific protease 6 N-terminal-like protein (USP6NL) with high expression in CRC tissues regulates CRC cell proliferation via Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We hypothesized that USP6NL impacts CRC growth and inhibition of USP6NL may be a novel treatment strategy to improve CRC therapy. Methods: USP6NL level in human CRC tissues and its association with tumor growth and metastasis were examined. Its roles and potential mechanisms in regulating tumor growth were studied by genetic and pharmacological manipulation of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: Herein, we found that USP6NL was up-regulated in tumorous tissues of CRC patients. Our data suggested that knockdown of USP6NL in human CRC cell lines (HCT116 and LOVO cells) inhibited cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and prevented the tumorigenicity of HCT116 cells in nude mice, and which was associated with the prevention of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. On the contrary, USP6NL overexpression in human CRC cells (SW480) showed the opposite result. Our data suggested that the promoted cell proliferation, G1/S cell cycle progression, and the enhanced expression of β-catenin Cyclin D1 and C-myc while reduced P27 induced by the overexpression of USP6NL were significantly reversed by additional treatment of XAV939, indicating that activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway was the mechanism, by which USP6NL exerted carcinogenesis in CRC in vitro. Besides, our data suggested that knockdown of USP6NL increased the ubiquitination of β-catenin, indicating that USP6NL may serve as a deubiquitinase that regulated β-catenin accumulation in this process. Furthermore, 10058-F4 down-regulated USP6NL, inhibited CRC cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest. The result demonstrated a possible feedback loop between USP6NL, β-catenin and C-myc in regulating CRC cell growth. Conclusion: USP6NL was an oncogene in CRC, and it may be a potential target for the treatment of CRC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","7,8 dihydro 2 [4 (trifluoromethyl)phenyl] 5h thiopyrano[4,3 d]pyrimidin 4 ol; beta catenin; cyclin D1; deubiquitinase; Myc protein; protein p27; Tre2 protein; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer tissue; carcinogenicity; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; feedback system; flow cytometry; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; growth regulation; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; LoVo cell line; luciferase assay; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; SW480 cell line; tissue level; tumor xenograft; TUNEL assay; ubiquitination; upregulation; Western blotting; Wnt signaling"
"Development and validation of nomogram based on SIRI for predicting the clinical outcome in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas",2019,"The Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI), based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts, was recently investigated as a prognostic marker for several tumors. However, use of the SIRI has not been reported for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We evaluated the prognostic value of the SIRI in primary and validation cohorts. We also established an effective prognostic nomogram for NPC based on clinicopathological parameters and the SIRI. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were determined using the concordance index (C-index) and a calibration curve and were compared with tumor-node-metastasis classifications. Our Kaplan-Meier survival analysis results showed that the SIRI was associated with the overall survival of patients with NPC in the primary and validation cohorts. The SIRI was identified to be an independent prognostic factor for NPC. In addition, we developed and validated a new prognostic nomogram that integrated clinicopathological factors and the SIRI. This nomogram can efficiently predict the prognosis of patients with NPC. The SIRI is a novel, simple and inexpensive prognostic predictor for patients with NPC. The SIRI has important value for predicting the prognosis of patients with NPC and developing individualized treatment plans. ?

"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus-induced macrophage differentiation is regulated by miR-146",2019,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate in humans, which is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family, is tick borne and endemic in Eastern Asia. Previous study found that SFTSV can infect and replicate in macrophages in vivo and in vitro. However, the role of macrophages in virus replication and the potential pathogenic mechanisms of SFTSV in macrophage remain unclear. In this study, we provided evidence that the SFTSV infection drove macrophage differentiation skewed to M2 phenotype, facilitated virus shedding, and resulted in viral spread. We showed evidence that miR-146a and b were significantly upregulated in macrophages during the SFTSV infection, driving the differentiation of macrophages into M2 cells by targeting STAT1. Further analysis revealed that the elevated miR-146b but not miR-146a was responsible for IL-10 stimulation. We also found that SFTSV increased endogenous miR-146b-induced differentiation of macrophages into M2 cells mediated by viral nonstructural protein (NSs). The M2 skewed differentiation of macrophages may have important implication to the pathogenesis of SFTS. ? 2019 Zhang, Fu, Wang, Guan, Zhu, Guo, Zheng and Wu.

"Role of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles in cancer progression and their clinical applications (Review)",2019,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including micro-vesicles and exosomes, are heterogeneous small membranous vesicles shed from the surface of myriad cells and are crucial in mediating intercellular communication. The vertical trafficking of cargo to the plasma membrane and subsequent redistribution of surface lipids may contribute to EV formation. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TD-EVs) can carry complex, bioactive cargo, such as nucleic acids and proteins, during tumor metastasis. Paracrine information gets relayed by TD-EVs to adjacent tumor cells and this allows a crosstalk between malignant cells. These structures may even move to a distant metastatic lesion and modulate the tumor microenvironment to form a premetastatic niche. Thus, TD-EVs might be potential biomarkers for tumor development and metastasis. Additionally, EVs are promising candidates for use as cell-free vaccines or as vehicles for the delivery of specific tumor therapeutic molecules. Genetically modified microvesicles and engineered exosomes have shed light on a novel strategy for tumor-targeted gene therapy. This review focuses on the role of EVs in tumor development and metastasis and their possible applications in the advanced diagnosis and therapy of cancer and personalized medicine. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Inhibition of CTHRC-1 by its specific monoclonal antibody attenuates cervical cancer cell metastasis",2019,"Although combination of surgery and chemo-radiotherapy could cure 80–95% of patients with early cervical cancer, there is still no satisfactory therapeutic strategies for locally advanced and metastatic cervical cancer patients. Our previous study has already investigated that CTHRC-1 is highly expressed not only in the local tissue but also in circulating serum of patients with cervical cancer and played important function on metastasis of cervical cancer cells. In present study, we aimed to see whether circulating specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CTHRC-1could inhibit the metastasis of advanced cervical cancer. Therefore, we innovatively generated one specific and sensitive mAb against CTHRC1 and found the CTHRC1 mAb could attenuate the promoting function of rCTHRC-1 on wound healing and invasion of SiHa cell in vitro. In addition, administration of mAb on the lung metastasis mouse model of cervical cancer strongly inhibited the level of metastasis. Taken together, targeting on CTHRC-1 is greatly beneficial not only for diagnosis but also for treatment of cervical cancer, which providing experimental and theoretical basis for developing a novel precise treatment of cervical cancer and improving patient survival rate. ? 2018 The Authors","antineoplastic agent; cthrc 1 protein; immunoglobulin G; monoclonal antibody; recombinant protein; unclassified drug; CTHRC1 protein, human; monoclonal antibody; scleroprotein; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; female; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; SiHa cell line; uterine cervix cancer; wound healing; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell motion; drug effect; lung tumor; metabolism; physiology; secondary; uterine cervix tumor; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cell Movement; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Female; HeLa Cells; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"
"Ultrasmall Oxygen-Deficient Bimetallic Oxide MnWOX Nanoparticles for Depletion of Endogenous GSH and Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy",2019,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) triggered by ultrasound (US) has attracted increasing attention owing to its abilities to overcome critical limitations including low tissue-penetration depth and phototoxicity in photodynamic therapy. Herein, the design of a new type of sonosensitizer is revealed, namely, ultrasmall oxygen-deficient bimetallic oxide MnWOX nanoparticles, for multimodal imaging-guided enhanced SDT against cancer. As-made MnWOX nanoparticles with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) modification show high physiological stability and biocompatibility. Interestingly, such MnWOX-PEG nanoparticles exhibit highly efficient US-triggered production of 1O2 and ?OH, higher than that of previously reported sonosensitizers (e.g., protoporphyrin IX and titanium dioxide), because the oxygen-deficient structure of MnWOX serves as an electron trap site to prevent electron–hole recombination. The glutathione depletion capability of MnWOX-PEG can also further favor SDT-triggered cancer cell killing. With efficient tumor homing as illustrated by computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, MnWOX-PEG enables effective destruction of mouse tumors under US stimulation. After accomplishing its therapeutic functions, MnWOX-PEG can be metabolized by the mouse body without any long-term toxicity. Herein, a new type of sono-sensitizing agent with high SDT efficacy, multimodal imaging functions, and rapid clearance is presented, an agent which is promising for noninvasive SDT cancer treatment. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Increased HMGB1 expression correlates with higher expression of c-IAP2 and pERK in colorectal cancer",2019,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and colorectal cancer (CRC).In this prospective study, patients with CRC undergoing primary surgery and healthy subjects (control group) were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2014. The serum HMGB1 concentration and HMGB1 mRNA expression were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine HMGB1, pERK, and c-inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2) protein expression levels in the cancer tissues.A total 144 patients with CRC and 50 healthy subjects underwent serum HMGB1 testing. Resected specimens of 50 patients were used for HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression analyses. Mean serum HMGB1 level in the patients with CRC was higher than that of the control group (8.42?μg/L vs 1.79?μg/L, P?<?.05). Mean serum HMGB1 level in the patients with CRC with distant metastasis was significantly higher than that of the controls (13.32?μg/L vs 7.37?μg/L, P?<?.05). The HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression levels in the CRC tissues were significantly higher than those in the adjacent normal mucosa. HMGB1 protein expression positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis. There were positive correlations between HMGB1 and c-IAP2 (r?=?0.457, P?<?.05), HMGB1 and pERK (r?=?0.461, P?<?.05), as well as pERK and c-IAP2 (r?=?0.399, P?<?.05).HMGB1 expression in CRC correlates with distant and lymph node metastasis. It may inhibit apoptosis by inducing activation of pERK and c-IAP2.","baculoviral IAP repeat containing protein 3; high mobility group B1 protein; HMGB1 protein, human; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; tumor marker; apoptosis; blood; colorectal tumor; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; lymph node metastasis; male; metabolism; middle aged; prospective study; Apoptosis; Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein; Biomarkers, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HMGB1 Protein; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; RNA, Messenger"
"Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 protects synaptic plasticity in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease as a mitophagy receptor",2019,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulated damaged mitochondria, which are associated with impaired mitophagy, contribute to neurodegeneration in AD. We show levels of Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC1), which is genetically associated with psychiatric disorders and AD, decrease in the brains of AD patients and transgenic model mice and in Aβ-treated cultured cells. Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 contains a canonical LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif ( 210 FSFI 213 ), through which DISC1 directly binds to LC3-I/II. Overexpression of DISC1 enhances mitophagy through its binding to LC3, whereas knocking-down of DISC1 blocks Aβ-induced mitophagy. We further observe overexpression of DISC1, but not its mutant (muFSFI) which abolishes the interaction of DISC1 with LC3, rescues Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of spines, suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP). Overexpression of DISC1 via adeno-associated virus (serotype 8, AAV8) in the hippocampus of 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice for 4?months rescues cognitive deficits, synaptic loss, and Aβ plaque accumulation, in a way dependent on the interaction of DISC1 with LC3. These results indicate that DISC1 is a novel mitophagy receptor, which protects synaptic plasticity from Aβ accumulation-induced toxicity through promoting mitophagy. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Designing a nanoparticle-containing polymeric substrate for detecting cancer cells by computer simulations",2019,"Efficient and accurate detection of cancer cells (from normal cells) is of great importance in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this work, we design a new type of polymeric substrate containing nanoparticles for detecting cancers by the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation. It is found that the cancer cells and the normal cells can be indeed distinguished since the uptake number of nanoparticles from the substrate is different. The competition between the nanoparticle-cell specific interaction and nanoparticle-polymer non-specific interaction is the main factor for different uptake behaviors. Moreover, the dynamics of the nanoparticle diffusion in the polymer layer also plays an important role in the detection. To improve the detection accuracy, we further investigate the effect of the polymer type and density as well as the ligand type on the detection, and find that there may exist an optimal parameter to maximize the difference between cancer cells and normal cells. The present study may provide useful insights into the design of functionalized substrate-based nanodevices in biomedicine. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Cytology; Diseases; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Polymers; Cancer diagnosis; Detection accuracy; Dissipative particle dynamics; Functionalized substrates; Non-specific interactions; Optimal parameter; Polymeric substrate; Specific interaction; Cells; ligand; nanoparticle; polymer; cell membrane; chemistry; computer simulation; diffusion; human; metabolism; molecular model; neoplasm; pathology; software; transport at the cellular level; Biological Transport; Cell Membrane; Computer Simulation; Diffusion; Humans; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Polymers; Software"
"Amino acid deprivation-induced autophagy requires upregulation of DIRAS3 through reduction of E2F1 and E2F4 transcriptional repression",2019,"Failure to cure ovarian cancer relates to the persistence of dormant, drug-resistant cancer cells following surgery and chemotherapy. “Second look” surgery can detect small, poorly vascularized nodules of persistent ovarian cancer in ~50% of patients, where >80% are undergoing autophagy and express DIRAS3. Autophagy is one mechanism by which dormant cancer cells survive in nutrient poor environments. DIRAS3 is a tumor suppressor gene downregulated in >60% of primary ovarian cancers by genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, that upon re-expression can induce autophagy and dormancy in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. We examined the expression of DIRAS3 and autophagy in ovarian cancer cells following nutrient deprivation and the mechanism by which they are upregulated. We have found that DIRAS3 mediates autophagy induced by amino acid starvation, where nutrient sensing by mTOR plays a central role. Withdrawal of amino acids downregulates mTOR, decreases binding of E2F1/4 to the DIRAS3 promoter, upregulates DIRAS3 and induces autophagy. By contrast, acute amino acid deprivation did not affect epigenetic regulation of DIRAS3 or expression of miRNAs that regulate DIRAS3. Under nutrient poor conditions DIRAS3 can be transcriptionally upregulated, inducing autophagy that could sustain dormant ovarian cancer cells. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"Multivalency-assisted membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery sensitizes photothermal ablation via inhibition of tumor glycolysis metabolism",2019,"The success of photothermal therapy (PTT) is often hampered by the thermo-resistance of tumor cells mediated by over-expressed heat shock proteins (HSPs). Herein, we developed a guanidine-rich, spherical helical polypeptide (DPP) with multivalency-assisted strong membrane penetrating capability, which mediated effective RNAi against tumor glycolysis metabolism to sensitize PTT. ICG was loaded into the internal cavity of DPP, and siRNA against pyruvate kinase M2 (siPKM2) was condensed by DPP to form positively charged nanocomplexes (NCs). The NCs were further coated with human serum albumin to enhance serum stability, prolong blood circulation, and improve tumor targeting. Due to its multivalent topology, DPP exhibited stronger membrane activity yet lower cytotoxicity than its linear analogue (LPP), thus enabling efficient PKM2 silencing in MCF-7 cells in vitro (~75%) and in vivo (~70%). The PKM2 silencing inhibited tumor glycolysis metabolism and further depleted the energy supply for HSPs production, thus overcoming the heat endurance of tumor cells to strengthen ICG-mediated photothermal ablation. Additionally, siPKM2-mediated energy depletion led to tumor cell starvation, which imparted synergistic anti-cancer effect with PTT. This study therefore provides a promising strategy for designing membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery materials, and it renders a unique RNAi-mediated anti-metabolic mechanism in sensitizing PTT and enabling starvation therapy. ? 2019","Ablation; Cardiovascular system; Cells; Cytology; Heat resistance; Membranes; Metabolism; Pathology; Proteins; RNA; Helical polypeptides; Membrane penetration; Photothermal therapy; siRNA delivery; Starvation therapy; Tumors; acid anhydride; dendrimer; guanidine; guanidine derivative; heat shock protein; human serum albumin; indocyanine green; n carboxyanhydride; nanocarrier; polyamidoamine; polypeptide; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase M2; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; binding affinity; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer gene therapy; cancer inhibition; circulation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug half life; drug penetration; drug potentiation; drug targeting; female; gene delivery system; gene silencing; glycolysis; heat tolerance; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; infrared radiation; MCF-7 cell line; membrane permeability; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; photothermal therapy; polymerization; priority journal; ring opening; RNA binding; RNA interference; static electricity"
"Plasma C-type lectin-like receptor 2 as a predictor of death and vascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke",2019,"Background and purpose: C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) has prominent involvement in platelet activation, which is increased in coronary heart disease and acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and is associated with stroke progression and stroke prognosis. Here, the aim was to examine the prognostic value of CLEC-2 in death and vascular event recurrence in AIS patients. Methods: In all, 352 patients with AIS were studied prospectively. All patients were followed up for 1?year. Death for all vascular events and a combination of death and vascular diseases (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalized and treated angina, hospitalized and treated peripheral arterial disease) were recorded. Results: During 1?year of follow-up, 46 patients (14.2%) experienced death or combined end-points (23 death and 46 combined end-points). Plasma CLEC-2 (pCLEC-2) was significantly associated with an increased risk of death and combined events of death and vascular diseases after adjusting for age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores. Each 1 SD higher log-transformed pCLEC-2 was associated with a 4.27-fold (hazard ratio 4.27, 95% confidence interval 1.71–10.65) increased risk for death and a 2.42-fold increased risk for combined end-points (hazard ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.52–3.86). The optimal cut-off point of pCLEC-2 for predicting death was 184.38?pg/ml. Conclusions: Higher pCLEC-2 levels at admission were associated with increased risk of death and combined events of death and vascular diseases in patients with AIS, which indicated that pCLEC-2 is an important prognostic factor for AIS. ?

"Histone methyltransferase SUV39H2 serves oncogenic roles in osteosarcoma",2019,"Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 2 (SUV39H2), a SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase, trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 9 and serves crucial roles in heterochromatin organization and genome stability. SUV39H2 is overexpressed in various types of human cancer, whereas it is almost undetectable in normal adult tissues, except testis. The aim of this study was to investigate a potential role of SUV39H2 in osteosarcoma. In the present study, increased SUV39H2 expression levels were observed in osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone cancer in children and adolescents, and the knockdown of SUV39H2 expression by specific small interfering RNAs in osteosarcoma cells markedly suppressed cancer cell growth and led to a notable reduction in cell viability. Furthermore, overexpression of SUV39H2 promoted cell proliferation, which indicated that SUV39H2 may possess oncogenic activity in human osteosarcoma. Notably, depletion of SUV39H2 expression caused an increase in the population of G 1 phase and induced apoptosis, which implied that SUV39H2 may have biological significance in the process of cell cycle. These results indicated that SUV39H2 may be an ideal target for osteosarcoma therapeutics. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Metformin suppresses gastric cancer progression through calmodulin-like protein 3 secreted from tumor-associated fibroblasts",2019,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor types worldwide, with a high morbidity and associated mortality. The interaction between gastric cancer cells and their microenvironment has a significant role in their maintenance and progression. Gastric tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) are among the major regulators of the gastric cancer microenvironment. Metformin, a classical anti-diabetic drug, is known to prevent cancer progression. However, the effect of metformin on gastric TAFs and TAF-associated cancer progression has remained to be elucidated. In the present study, TAFs were isolated from gastric cancer patients, pre-treated with metformin and then co-cultured with gastric cancer cell lines. It was demonstrated that pre-treatment with 200 μM metformin reduced the stimulatory effect of TAFs on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in co-culture, suggesting that metformin impairs the tumor-promoting role of TAFs. Using tandem mass tags-based quantitative proteomic analysis, it was identified that metformin significantly affected the secretion of 32 proteins (14 upregulated and 18 downregulated) in the culture medium of gastric TAFs. Among these proteins, calmodulin-like protein 3 (Calml3) was 2.88-fold upregulated in the culture medium of gastric TAFs after metformin treatment and a further experiment using recombinant Calml3 indicated its suppressive effect on the clonogenicity of gastric cancer cells. It was concluded that metformin suppresses gastric cancer through stimulating Calml3 secretion from TAFs, which represents a novel anticancer mechanism of metformin. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Tubeimoside-1, a triterpenoid saponin, induces cytoprotective autophagy in human breast cancer cells in vitro via Akt-mediated pathway",2019,"Autophagy, a form of cellular self-digestion by lysosome, is associated with various disease processes including cancers, and modulating autophagy has shown promise in the treatment of various malignancies. A number of natural products display strong antitumor activity, yet their mechanisms of action remain unclear. To gain a better understanding of how traditional Chinese medicine agents exert antitumor effects, we screened 480 natural compounds for their effects on autophagy using a high content screening assay detecting GFP-LC3 puncta in HeLa cells. Tubeimoside-1 (TBMS1), a triterpenoid saponin extracted from Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim) Franquet (Cucurbitaceae), was identified as a potent activator of autophagy. The activation of autophagy by TBMS1 was evidenced by increased LC3-II amount and GFP-LC3 dots, observation of autophagosomes under electron microscopy, and enhanced autophagic flux. To explore the mechanisms underlying TBMS1-activated autophagy, we performed cheminformatic analyses and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay that showed a higher likelihood of the binding between Akt protein and TBMS1. In three human breast cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that Akt–mTOR–eEF-2K pathway was involved in TBMS1-induced activation of autophagy, while Akt-mediated downregulations of Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2 led to the activation of apoptosis of the breast cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy enhanced the cytotoxic effect of TBMS1 via promoting apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the role and mechanism of TBMS1 in activating autophagy, suggesting that inhibition of cytoprotective autophagy may act as a therapeutic strategy to reinforce the activity of TBMS1 against cancers. ? 2018, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, CAS and Chinese Pharmacological Society.

"Mutations of genes including DNMT3A detected by next-generation sequencing in thyroid cancer",2019,"More than 90% of thyroid cancer belongs to the papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas based on pathological subtypes. Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma are generally associated with a good prognosis. In contrast, other pathological subtypes such as poorly-differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (PDTC and ATC) have a poor clinical outcome with a short life expectancy. To identify the genetic variations and biomarkers that may potentially distinguish the aggressive form of thyroid cancer, we performed a retrospective analysis of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 50 patients who mainly displayed aggressive thyroid cancer using next-generation sequencing of 416 solid tumor-related genes. We adopted extensive bioinformatic analysis to vigorously remove germline single-nucleotide polymorphism and systematic sequencing errors, and report here that mutation in DNMT3A gene was significantly enriched in patients with PDTC or ATC. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","antineoplastic agent; DNA methyltransferase 3A; formaldehyde; glutamine; glycine; radioactive iodine; tumor marker; adult; anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; Article; bioinformatics; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; differentiated thyroid cancer; distant metastasis; female; gene frequency; gene mutation; genetic variation; germline mutation; human; indel mutation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; next generation sequencing; overall survival; paraffin embedding; poorly differentiated thyroid cancer; single nucleotide polymorphism; thyroid carcinoma; thyroid follicular carcinoma; thyroid medullary carcinoma; thyroid papillary carcinoma"
"TRIM13 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis by regulating NF-κB pathway in non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells",2019,"Tripartite Motif Containing 13 (TRIM13), a member of TRIM proteins, is deleted in multiple tumor types, especially in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. The present study explored the expression and potential role of TRIM13 in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We found that TRIM13 mRNA and protein expression was reduced in NSCLC tissues and cell lines in comparison to paired non-cancerous tissues and a human normal bronchial epithelial cell line, respectively. Overexpression of TRIM13 in NCI-H1975 and SPC-A-1 cells hampered cell proliferation. Additionally, TRIM13 overexpression increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3. TRIM13-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis was attenuated by a caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, suggesting that TRIM13 induced cell apoptosis partially through a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Moreover, it has been reported that TRIM13 can regulate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) activity. Our data showed that TRIM13 overexpression inactivated NF-κB as indicated by the increased cytosolic NF-κB and decreased nuclear NF-κB. Exposure to an NF-κB inhibitor PDTC significantly blocked the impact of TRIM13 knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis, indicating the functions of TRIM13 in NSCLC cells were mediated by the NF-κB pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that TRIM13 overexpression suppressed tumor growth and induced cell apoptosis in vivo by using a xenograft mouse model. Collectively, our results indicate that TRIM13 behaves as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC through regulating NF-κB pathway. Our findings may offer a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC. ? 2019","caspase 3; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; protein TRIM13; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; tripartite motif protein; unclassified drug; DNA binding protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; TRIM13 protein, human; tumor suppressor protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer tissue; cell culture; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; molecularly targeted therapy; mouse; NCI-H1975 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; RNA isolation; signal transduction; SPC-A1 cell line; tumor growth; Western blotting; A-549 cell line; animal; cancer transplantation; female; genetics; lung tumor; male; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; nude mouse; pathology; xenograft; A549 Cells; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Proliferation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Heterografts; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Transplantation; NF-kappa B; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Complex Traffic Circumstances with Roadside LiDAR",2019,"The problem of traffic safety has become increasingly prominent owing to the increase in the number of cars. Traffic accidents often occur in an instant, which makes it necessary to obtain traffic data with high resolution. High-resolution micro traffic data (HRMTD) indicates that the spatial resolution reaches the centimeter level and that the temporal resolution reaches the millisecond level. The position, direction, speed, and acceleration of objects on the road can be extracted with HRMTD. In this paper, a LiDAR sensor was installed at the roadside for data collection. An adjacent-frame fusion method for vehicle detection and tracking in complex traffic circumstances is presented. Compared with the previous research, objects can be detected and tracked without object model extraction or a bounding box description. In addition, problems caused by occlusion can be improved using adjacent frames fusion in the vehicle detection and tracking algorithms in this paper. The data processing procedure are as follows: selection of area of interest, ground point removal, vehicle clustering, and vehicle tracking. The algorithm has been tested at different sites (in Reno and Suzhou), and the results demonstrate that the algorithm can perform well in both simple and complex application scenarios. ?

Methods: A total of 32 eligible right-handed participants diagnosed by PI according to International classification of sleep disorders (ICD-3) were recruited into this study. Participants received 10 daily sessions of sequential bilateral 1?Hz rTMS over DLPFC. Before and after the whole procedure of rTMS, patients were assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for the severity of sleep disturbance. Meanwhile, serum concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in patients was measured by ELISA and UPLC, respectively. Moreover, the amplitude of MEPs reflecting the right cortical excitability was examined. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation among the change of these variables. Results: After rTMS treatment, the PSQI score was markedly decreased as compared to pre-rTMS; the concentrations of serum BDNF and GABA were significantly higher; the amplitude of MEPs was markedly reduced. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the change of PSQI score was negatively associated with the alteration of serum BDNF level and serum GABA level, and positively associated with the change of MEPs amplitude; the change of MEPs amplitude was negatively associated with fold change in the serum BDNF level and the serum GABA level; the increase in serum GABA level was positively associated with the serum BDNF level. Conclusions: A sequential bilateral low-frequency rTMS over DLPFC significantly improves primary insomnia probably by increasing the level of BDNF and GABA in the brain and reducing cortical excitability. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Multishelled Hollow Structures of Yttrium Oxide for the Highly Selective and Ultrasensitive Detection of Methanol",2019,"Methanol is extremely harmful to human health, since it is oxidized slowly and can accumulate in the human body. Therefore, it is essential to develop a methanol gas sensing technology with high sensitivity and selectivity for use in environmental monitoring and healthcare. In this work, a simple and low-cost sensor based on a Y 2 O 3 multishelled hollow structure (YMSH) to selectively detect methanol with an ultrasensitive limit of detection (71 ppb) is developed. The unique multishelled hollow structure with a large surface area and exposed {222} facets makes an important contribution to the ultrasensitive detection of methanol, which is further confirmed by subsequent theoretical simulations. Moreover, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra verify that CO 2 is the final product, which indicates a high catalytic activity of the YMSHs toward methanol oxidation. Interestingly, the sensor can also be applied to liquor samples that are mixtures of ethanol, methanol, and water, which provides a facile way to detect methanol in wines. This sensor represents a unique and highly sensitive means to detect methanol, which has great promise for potential application in environmental monitoring and food safety inspection. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Nanoscale metal-organ frameworks and coordination polymers as theranostic platforms for cancer treatment",2019,"Both nanoscale metal organic frameworks (NMOFs) with ordered crystalline structure and nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) which instead show non-crystalline structure are formed by coordination interactions between inorganic metal ions or clusters with organic bridging ligands. NMOFs and NCPs have shown great potential in the field of biomedicine in recent years, owning to their unique advantages including inherent biodegradability, the mesoporous structure to enable loading of various therapeutic or imaging molecules, as well as diverse compositions in both metal ions and organic ligands to render them multiple functionalities in a single system. In this review article, the synthesis and modification strategies of NMOFs/NCPs, together with their applications in drug delivery, biomedical imaging and various types of cancer therapies will be summarized. In addition to reviewing the latest advances in this rapid growing direction, the future prospects of applying NMOFs/NCPs for cancer theranostics will also be addressed. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",""
"Investigation of Nonmotor Symptoms in First-Degree Relatives of Patients with Different Clinical Types of Parkinson's Disease",2019,"Background. Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are prodromal characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD). The first-degree relatives (FDR) of PD patients had a higher risk of PD and also had more NMS. Objective. To delineate NMS in FDR of patients with different clinical types of PD. Methods. A total of 98 PD probands were recruited; 256 siblings of them were enrolled in the FDR group. Various scales were used to assess NMS, including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, insomnia, constipation, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and restless legs syndrome (RLS). The incidences of NMS were further compared between the FDR groups of PD with different types. Results. The FDR of early-onset PD (EOP) showed a higher incidence of moderate to severe depression (OR = 4.08; 95% CI: 1.12-14.92; P=0.033), anxiety (OR = 4.22; 95% CI: 1.87-9.52; P=0.001), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR = 3.40; 95% CI: 1.00-11.48; P=0.049) than the FDR of late-onset PD (LOP). It was also found that RBD (OR = 11.65; 95% CI: 3.82-35.54; P<0.001), constipation (OR = 4.94; 95% CI: 1.85-13.21; P=0.001), sleep disorders (OR = 4.51; 95% CI: 1.73-11.78; P=0.002), cognitive impairment (OR = 3.55; 95% CI: 1.62-7.77; P=0.002), and anxiety (OR = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.32-4.71; P=0.005) were more frequent in FDR of tremor-dominant PD (TDP) than in FDR of non-tremor-dominant PD (NTDP). Conclusions. The siblings of patients with EOP and TDP have more NMS, presuming that they have a higher risk in the PD prodromal stage. Whether they have a greater possibility to progress into PD requires further investigation. ? 2019 Jiang-bing Liu et al.","adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; cognitive defect; constipation; controlled study; daytime somnolence; depression; female; first-degree relative; high risk patient; human; incidence; insomnia; major clinical study; male; non tremor dominant parkinson disease; Parkinson disease; prevalence; REM sleep; restless legs syndrome; sibling; symptom; tremor; tremor dominant parkinson disease"
"Analysis of survival-related LncRNA landscape identifies a role for LINC01537 in energy metabolism and lung cancer progression",2019,"Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as good biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for various cancers. We aimed to get a detailed understanding of the lncRNA landscape that is associated with lung cancer survival. A comparative analysis between our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and TCGA datasets was conducted to reveal lncRNAs with significant correlations with lung cancer survival and then the association of the most promising lncRNA was validated in a cohort of 243 lung cancer patients. Comparing RNA-seq data with TCGA ones, 84 dysregulated lncRNAs were identified in lung cancer tissues, among which 10 lncRNAs were significantly associated with lung cancer survival. LINC01537 was the most significant one (p = 2.95 × 10?6). Validation analysis confirmed the downregulation of LINC01537 in lung cancer. LINC01537 was observed to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. It also increased cellular sensitivity to nilotinib. PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A) was further identified to be a target of LINC01537 and it was seen that LINC01537 promoted PDE2A expression via RNA–RNA interaction to stabilize PDE2A mRNA and thus echoed effects of PDE2A on energy metabolism including both Warburg effect and mitochondrial respiration. Other regulators of tumor energy metabolism were also affected by LINC01537. These results elucidate a suppressed role of LINC01537 in lung cancer development involving tumor metabolic reprogramming, and we believe that it might be a biomarker for cancer survival prediction and therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Effects of continuous positive airway pressure on depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: results from the sleep apnoea cardiovascular Endpoint randomised trial and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment can improve depression or anxiety symptoms in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients remains uncertain. Methods: Secondary analysis of the Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) trial, combined with a systematic review of randomised evidence. The SAVE secondary analyses involved 2410 patients with co-existing moderate–severe OSA and established cardiovascular disease randomly allocated to CPAP treatment plus usual care or usual care alone and followed up for 3·7 (SD 1·6) years. We evaluated the effect of CPAP treatment on depression and anxiety caseness (scores ? 8 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression and anxiety subscales [HADS-D and HADS-A]) for OSA patients. Findings: CPAP treatment was associated with reduced odds of depression caseness (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·65–0·98, P = 0·031) compared to usual care in the SAVE trial and the treatment effect was greater in those with pre-existing depression symptoms. A systematic review of 20 randomised trials including 4255 participants confirmed a benefit of CPAP in reducing depression symptoms in OSA patients: the overall effect (standardised mean difference) was ? 0·18 (95% CI ? 0·24 to ? 0·12). No effect of CPAP treatment on anxiety caseness was found both in patients of the SAVE study (adjusted OR 0·98, 95% CI 0·78–1·24, P = 0·89) and the systematic review. Interpretation: CPAP reduces depression symptoms in patients with co-existing OSA and CVD independently of improvements in sleepiness. ? 2019","anxiety disorder; Article; comorbidity; depression; disease severity; follow up; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; meta analysis; meta analysis (topic); odds ratio; positive end expiratory pressure; randomized controlled trial (topic); secondary analysis; sleep disordered breathing; somnolence; systematic review; treatment outcome"
"The effects of a low gi diet on cardiometabolic and inflammatory parameters in patients with type 2 and gestational diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials",2019,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally, and its effect on patients and the healthcare system can be significant. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes are well established risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and strategies for managing these conditions include dietary interventions, such as the use of a low glycemic index (GI) diet. Aims: This review aimed to evaluate the effects of a low GI diet on the cardio-metabolic and inflammatory parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes and women with GDM and assess whether the effects are different in these conditions. Methods: This review was based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Three databases (EMBASE, Pubmed, and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to 20 February 2019 using search terms that included synonyms and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) in line with the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, and studies (PICOS) framework. Studies were evaluated for the quality and risk of bias. Results: 10 randomised controlled studies were included in the systematic review, while 9 were selected for the meta-analysis. Two distinct areas were identified: the effect of a low GI diet on lipid profile and the effect of a low GI diet on inflammatory parameters. The results of the metaanalysis showed that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the low GI and higher GI diets with respect to total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, there was a significant difference (p = 0.027) with respect to triglyceride which increased by a mean of 0.06 mmol/L (0.01, 0.11) in patients with type 2 diabetes on higher GI diet. With respect to the women with GDM, the findings from the systematic review were not consistent in terms of the effect of a low GI diet on the lipid profile. The results of the meta-analysis did not show significant differences (p > 0.05) between low GI and higher GI diets with respect to adiponectin and C-reactive proteins in patients with type 2 diabetes, but a significant difference (p < 0.001) was observed between the two groups in relation to interleukin–6. Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis have demonstrated that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the low GI and higher GI diets in relation to total cholesterol–HDL and LDL cholesterol–in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, a significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed between the two groups with respect to triglyceride in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results of the effect of a low GI diet on the lipid profile in patients with GDM were not consistent. With respect to the inflammatory parameters, the low GI diet significantly decreased interleukin–6 in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to the higher GI diet. More studies are needed in this area of research. ? 2019 by the authors.

"A multicenter, prospective evaluation of the Chinese Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Scoring System for disseminated intravascular coagulation",2019,"Introduction: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe complication of critical conditions. There are several scoring systems used for the diagnosis of DIC, including the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) Overt-DIC criteria, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) criteria and the Chinese Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis scoring system for DIC (CDSS). The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy and predictive value of the CDSS. Materials and methods: 1318 patients, aged 18–70 years old and suspected of DIC were enrolled from 18 hospitals across China. Participants were divided into two groups for analysis (group 1, non-hematological diseases; group 2, hematological diseases). 242 patients were excluded because of incomplete data collection and failure to follow-up. Results and conclusions: The rates of concordance of diagnosis of DIC between the CDSS and two other scoring systems were close to 80%. The area under ROC curves of CDSS had a slight advantage when using the ISTH, JMHW criteria or prognosis as gold standard, respectively. The CDSS DIC was an independent predictor of mortality, and its odds-ratio was superior or comparable to that of the ISTH and JMHW criteria in the two groups. The CDSS DIC score also had a significant correlation with the APACHE II and SOFA score (p < 0.05). In summary, as a quantification standard of the Chinese experts’ consensus, the CDSS is conducive to the standardized diagnosis of DIC because of its favorable diagnostic and prognostic utility. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; APACHE; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; disseminated intravascular clotting; female; follow up; gold standard; human; informed consent; limit of quantitation; major clinical study; male; mortality; practice guideline; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; scoring system; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; standardization; blood; China; clinical trial; disseminated intravascular clotting; hemostasis; medical society; middle aged; multicenter study; odds ratio; Adult; APACHE; China; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Female; Hemostasis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Societies, Medical"
"KCTD: A new gene family involved in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders",2019,"The underlying molecular basis for neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders is not known. In contrast, mechanistic understanding of other brain disorders including neurodegeneration has advanced considerably. Yet, these do not approach the knowledge accrued for many cancers with precision therapeutics acting on well-characterized targets. Although the identification of genes responsible for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders remains a major obstacle, the few causally associated genes are ripe for discovery by focusing efforts to dissect their mechanisms. Here, we make a case for delving into mechanisms of the poorly characterized human KCTD gene family. Varying levels of evidence support their roles in neurocognitive disorders (KCTD3), neurodevelopmental disease (KCTD7), bipolar disorder (KCTD12), autism and schizophrenia (KCTD13), movement disorders (KCTD17), cancer (KCTD11), and obesity (KCTD15). Collective knowledge about these genes adds enhanced value, and critical insights into potential disease mechanisms have come from unexpected sources. Translation of basic research on the KCTD-related yeast protein Whi2 has revealed roles in nutrient signaling to mTORC1 (KCTD11) and an autophagy-lysosome pathway affecting mitochondria (KCTD7). Recent biochemical and structure-based studies (KCTD12, KCTD13, KCTD16) reveal mechanisms of regulating membrane channel activities through modulation of distinct GTPases. We explore how these seemingly varied functions may be disease related. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Meta-analysis of the prognostic value of C-C chemokine receptor type 7 in patients with solid tumors",2019,"Background: Expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) is associated with the prognosis of several cancers. The aim of this study was to conduct the meta-analysis to determine the prognostic value of CCR7 expression in solid tumors. Materials and methods: We searched for relevant literature in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases (last updated on January 15, 2018). The associations of CCR7 expression with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), progress-free survival (PFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were estimated. Results: In total, 30 qualified studies including 3,413 patients were enrolled. The results revealed that higher expression of CCR7 predicted poorer OS (pooled HR =1.79; 95% CI =1.49–2.16; P<0.001) and PFS (pooled HR =2.18; 95% CI =1.49–3.18; P<0.001), but was not associated with DFS (pooled HR =1.69; 95% CI =0.79–3.61; P=0.175), RFS (pooled HR =1.29; 95% CI =0.48–3.44; P=0.618), or DSS (pooled HR =3.06; 95% CI =0.38–24.83; P<0.294). Conclusion: From this meta-analysis, we concluded that high expression of CCR7 in tumor tissue is associated with poor survival in patients with solid tumors, and may be a prognostic biomarker for tumor progression. ? 2019 Zu et al.","chemokine receptor CCR7; disease free survival; disease specific survival; human; outcome assessment; overall survival; prognosis; progression free survival; protein expression; recurrence free survival; Review; solid malignant neoplasm; systematic review"
"Utility of GDF-15 as a diagnostic biomarker in gastric cancer: an investigation combining GEO, TCGA and meta-analysis",2019,"It was recently suggested that growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is associated with gastric cancer (GC) carcinogenesis. However, the diagnostic potential of GDF-15 for GC remains unclear. To address this issue, we obtained RNA sequencing and microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, and searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science for relevant literature. We then used STATA to perform a meta-analysis. In total, reports of 253 GC patients and 112 healthy controls who contributed peripheral blood samples were taken from the four literature sources, while information on 754 GC tumor and 263 gastric normal tissues was drawn from TCGA and seven GEO datasets. The expression level of GDF-15 mRNA was significantly higher in tumor tissues than in normal tissues, with a standard mean difference (SMD) of 0.79% and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.63–0.95. Consistently, the GDF-15 protein in blood was significantly increased in GC patients as compared to controls (SMD?=?3.74, 95% CI?=?1.81–5.68). In addition, based on information from TCGA and GEO datasets, the expression level of GDF-15 mRNA may be of use for the diagnosis of GC, with a combined sensitivity, specificity and odds ratio of 0.69 (95% CI?=?0.58–0.79), 0.90 (95% CI?=?0.84–0.93) and 6.32 (95% CI?=?4.22–9.49), respectively. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that the area under the curve was 0.90 (95% CI?=?0.87–0.93). The results suggest higher levels of GDF-15 may be associated with GC tumorigenesis and may have the potential to be a diagnostic biomarker of GC. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Impedance Control of a Compliant Assistive Robot for Physical Human-Robot Interactions",2019,"Interest in series elastic actuators (SEAs) for assistive robots has recently increased due to the unique properties of SEAs compared to those of rigid actuators, such as high force control accuracy, low output impedance, and tolerance to shocks. In this letter, an SEA with a clutch for an assistive robot is designed for accurate torque delivery to provide effective assistance. The mechanical clutch controls the engagement and disengagement of the power transmission during the gait cycle to ensure transparency and user safety. Precise torque control is the main challenge in the control of SEAs. The addition of a clutch in the SEA will result in a new force control challenge with the frequent release and engagement of the clutch aggravating the mechanical vibration and bringing the risk of unsafety to the assistive robot wearer. A new torque control method based on interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) for SEAs is adopted for the physical human-robot interaction. Experiments are conducted to verify that the IDA-PBC-based SEA torque controller can effectively control actuator timing and allow precise assistive torque control. This letter serves as a stepping stone toward utilizing and designing assistive robots to assist with walking. ? 2016 IEEE.","Actuators; Clutches; Damping; Force control; Human computer interaction; Man machine systems; Torque; Torque control; Vibrations (mechanical); Walking aids; Assistive robots; Control challenges; Impedance control; Interconnection and damping assignment; Low output impedance; Passivity based control; Physical human-robot interactions; Series elastic actuators; Human robot interaction"
"Oncoprotein Inhibitor Rigosertib Loaded in ApoE-Targeted Smart Polymersomes Reveals High Safety and Potency against Human Glioblastoma in Mice",2019,"The unbiased cytotoxicity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeability render common chemotherapeutics nonviable for treating glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Although rigosertib (RGS), a RAS effector protein inhibitor, has shown low toxicity to healthy cells and high efficacy toward various cancer cells by inactivating PI3K-Akt, it hardly overcomes the BBB barricade. Here, we report that RGS loaded in apolipoprotein E derived peptide (ApoE)-targeted chimaeric polymersomes (ApoE-CP) is safe and highly potent against human GBM in vivo. ApoE-CP exhibited stable loading of RGS in its lumen, giving RGS nanoformulations (ApoE-CP-RGS) with a size of 60 nm and reduction-triggered drug release behavior. Notably, ApoE-CP-RGS induction markedly enhanced the G2/M cell cycle arrest and inhibitory effect in U-87 MG glioblastoma cells compared with the nontargeted CP-RGS and free RGS. The therapeutic outcomes in orthotopic U-87 MG GBM models demonstrated that ApoE-CP-RGS brought about effective GBM inhibition, greatly prolonged survival time, and depleted adverse effects. Rigosertib formulated in ApoE-targeted chimaeric polymersomes has emerged as a novel, highly specific, efficacious, and nontoxic treatment for glioblastoma. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","apolipoprotein E; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; polymer; polymersome; protein kinase B; rigosertib; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; blood brain barrier; cancer survival; comparative study; controlled study; cytoskeleton; drug safety; drug targeting; female; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; glioblastoma; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; micelle; mouse; nanofabrication; neuroapoptosis; nonhuman; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; transcytosis; treatment outcome"
"Near-infrared Fluorescence Ocular Imaging (NIRFOI) of Alzheimer’s Disease",2019,"Purpose: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has been widely used in preclinical studies; however, its low tissue penetration represents a daunting problem for translational clinical imaging of neurodegenerative diseases. The retina is known as an extension of the central nerve system (CNS), and it is widely considered as a window to the brain. Therefore, the retina can be considered as an alternative organ for investigating neurodegenerative diseases, and an eye represents an ideal NIRF imaging organ, due to its minimal opacity. Procedures: NIRF ocular imaging (NIRFOI), for the first time, was explored for imaging of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) via utilizing “smart” fluorescent probes CRANAD-X (X = ? 2, ? 3, ? 30, ? 58, and ? 102) for amyloid beta (Aβ), and CRANAD-61 for reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mice were intravenously injected the fluorescence dyes and images from the eyes were captured with an IVIS imaging system at different time points. Results: All of the tested NIRF probes could be used to differentiate transgenic AD mice and WT mice, and NIRFOI could provide much higher sensitivity for imaging Aβs than NIRF brain imaging did. Our data suggested that NIRFOI could capture the imaging signals from both soluble and insoluble Aβ species. Moreover, we demonstrated that NIRFOI with CRANAD-102 could be used to monitor the therapeutic effects of BACE-1 inhibitor LY2811376. Compared to NIRF brain imaging, NIRFOI provided a larger change of Aβ levels before and after LY2811376 treatment. In addition, we demonstrated that CRANAD-61 could be used to image reactive oxygen species in the eyes. Conclusion: The large detection margin by NIRFOI is very important for both diagnosis and therapy response monitoring. Compared to fluorescence microscopic imaging, NIRFOI captures signals with a wide angle (large field of view (FOV)) and can be used to detect soluble Aβs. We believe that NIRFOI has remarkable translational potential for future human studies and can be a potential imaging technology for fast, cheap, accessible, and reliable screening of AD in the future. ? 2018, World Molecular Imaging Society.","amyloid beta protein; fluorescent dye; reactive oxygen metabolite; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; Article; chemical structure; controlled study; degenerative disease; female; fluorescence imaging; mouse; near infrared fluorescence imaging; nonhuman; priority journal"
"Motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in a C9orf72 mouse line expressing poly-PR",2019,"A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Repeat-associated non-ATG translation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) contributes to the neuropathological features of c9FTD/ALS. Among the five DPRs, arginine-rich poly-PR are reported to be the most toxic. Here, we generate a transgenic mouse line that expresses poly-PR (GFP-PR28) specifically in neurons. GFP-PR28 homozygous mice show decreased survival time, while the heterozygous mice show motor imbalance, decreased brain weight, loss of Purkinje cells and lower motor neurons, and inflammation in the cerebellum and spinal cord. Transcriptional analysis shows that in the cerebellum, GFP-PR28 heterozygous mice show differential expression of genes related to synaptic transmission.

Our analysis showed that grade III–IV acute graft-versus-host disease and IKZF1 mutation in the transplantation group and age and IKZF1 mutation in the non-transplantation group were independent factors for poor prognosis by univariate and multivariate analyses.The 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were much lower in the IKZF1+/BCR-ABL+ subgroup than in the IKZF1+/BCR-ABL? and IKZF1?/BCR-ABL? subgroups in both the transplantation and non-transplantation groups. The 3-year OS and LFS rates were significantly higher in the transplantation group than in the non-transplantation group with IKZF1 mutation.The study demonstrated that IKZF1 mutation was an independent factor indicating the poor prognosis of adult B-ALL and much worse prognosis in the BCR-ABL+ subgroup in both non-transplantation and transplantation groups. However, allo-HSCT significantly improved the OS and LFS of patients and also their clinical outcomes. ? 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.","Ikaros family zinc finger 1; transcription factor; unclassified drug; BCR ABL protein; Ikaros transcription factor; IKZF1 protein, human; acute graft versus host disease; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; BCR ABL fusion gene; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease free survival; female; fusion gene; gene; gene mutation; human; IKZF1 gene; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; univariate analysis; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; allotransplantation; genetics; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; mortality; mutation; procedures; prognosis; survival analysis; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Ikaros Transcription Factor; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Transplantation, Homologous; Treatment Outcome"
"Preparation, characterization and application of anti-human OX40 ligand (OX40L) monoclonal antibodies and establishment of a sandwich ELISA for autoimmune diseases detection",2019,"OX40L (CD252, TNFSF4), a type II transmembrane protein which like other tumor necrosis factor ligands, involved in the costimulation and differentiation of T cells, functions as a positive signal in immune response. To investigate the biological function of soluble OX40L (sOX40L), three functional anti-OX40L monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3D2, 3F7 and 2H3 were obtained by hybridoma technology. Besides, specificity of the mAbs was further demonstrated by ELISA, Western blot and Immunofluorescence experiments. We also developed a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on two anti-human OX40L antibodies 3D2 and 3F7 with different epitopes. Using the ELISA system, we found that sOX40L in the sera of healthy donors increases in an age-dependent manner and that enhanced sOX40L expression in some autoimmune diseases especially in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, suggesting the potential diagnostic significance of sOX40L in the autoimmune diseases. Together, these data demonstrate that the existence of circulating sOX40L in human sera might play an important role in immunoregulation. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","3d2 monoclonal antibody; 3f7 monoclonal antibody; CD134 antigen; cytokine; monoclonal antibody; OX40 ligand; unclassified drug; OX40 ligand; TNFSF4 protein, human; animal cell; Article; autoimmune disease; CD4+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; cytokine release; cytokine response; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; human; immunofluorescence; immunoregulation; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic sclerosis; Western blotting; blood; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immunology; metabolism; procedures; Sjoegren syndrome; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; OX40 Ligand; Sjogren's Syndrome"
"Vitamin D attenuates myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury by inhibiting inflammation via suppressing the RhoA/ROCK/NF-?B pathway",2019,"The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of vitamin D (VD) against myocardial ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury in hearts. An I/R injury model was induced by left coronary artery ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats (in vivo) and Langendorff perfusion of isolated hearts (in vitro). The infarction areas were determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Changes in the ST segment, cardiac function, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, creatine kinase (CK) activity, inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) levels and the RhoA/ROCK/NF-?B pathway were tested in rats with I/R injury treated with or without VD. VD notably alleviated myocardial injury with decreased infarction areas and had a restorative effect on cardiac function, which was specifically manifested as a restored ST segment, increased myocardial contractility and increased coronary blood flow in the isolated hearts. The levels of CK and LDH were also suppressed by VD. In addition, VD significantly decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in rat sera and isolated hearts. The RhoA/ROCK/NF-κB pathway in I/R-injured rats was also obviously inhibited with VD treatment. The present study demonstrates that VD plays a protective role against myocardial injury by inhibiting inflammation through repressing the RhoA/ROCK/NF-κB pathway. ? 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","Chlorine compounds; Heart; Pathology; Rats; Cardio-vascular disease; Inflammation; Lactate dehydrogenase activities; Myocardial contractility; Reperfusion; Triphenyltetrazolium chlorides; Tumor necrosis factor alpha; Vitamin-D; Vitamins; creatine kinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; triphenyltetrazolium; tumor necrosis factor; vitamin D; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; vitamin D; adult; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery ligation; creatine kinase blood level; enzyme activity; heart function; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle injury; in vitro study; in vivo study; isolated heart; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; left coronary artery; male; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; nonhuman; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; ST segment; staining; animal; inflammation; metabolism; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; pathology; Animals; Inflammation; Male; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; NF-kappa B; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; rho-Associated Kinases; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Vitamin D"
"Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA promotes hypoxia-induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells",2019,"OBJECTIVE: Cell autophagy reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to therapeutic reagents in various types of human cancer. Therefore, the aim of our study was to use human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells to explore whether inhibition of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) is able to enhance hypoxia-induced apoptosis in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HCT116 cells were treated with 3-MA, hypoxia, or 3-MA plus hypoxia, and the autophagy, apoptosis and proliferation of the HCT116 cells were investigated. Western blot analysis was used to detect autophagy specificity protein microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) expression. Effects on apoptosis were evaluated by using flow cytometry (JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential) and annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) staining. RESULTS: The results showed that the treatment of HCT116 cells in vitro with hypoxia alone increased autophagy as well as apoptosis, whereas combination treatment with 3-MA and hypoxia markedly inhibited hypoxia-induced autophagy, but increased hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy might play a role as a self-defense mechanism in hypoxia-treated colon cancer cells, and its inhibition could be a promising strategy for the adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer. ? 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

"Forensic entomology application in China: Four case reports",2019,"We present four cases that use entomological data to estimate postmortem interval (PMI). In the first case, the body was found in an outdoor environment at 26 °C and was at the fresh stage. However, the PMI min estimated using maggots collected from the corpse was more than 68 h. This was certainly an incorrect estimation because the degree of the body decomposition was light, and it may have been caused by flies invading the corpse before death occurred. In the second case, a corpse of an adult male was found in a semi-closed room, and the body was highly decomposed and mummified. In this case, we used Dermestes maculatus DeGeer (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) to successfully estimate the PMI. The third case involved a female body discovered in her room after she committed suicide by consuming excessive clozapine and alcohol. The PMI min estimated through entomological data did not match the time of death that the other evidence indicated. Thus, we speculated that clozapine and alcohol may have influenced the development of fly larvae. The fourth case occurred in the winter. The murderer killed the victim and burned and dumped the corpse. However, the burned body still attracted necrophagous insects and we successfully calculated the PMI min by using insect evidence. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine","alcohol; clozapine; adult; Article; autolysis; beetle; cadaver; case report; cause of death; climate; clinical article; Dermestes maculatus; female; human; larva; maggot; male; nonhuman; suicide; time of death; winter; zoology; animal; China; drug overdose; feeding behavior; fire; forensic pathology; growth, development and aging; homicide; insect; paleopathology; physiology; postmortem change; temperature; zoology; Adult; Animals; China; Drug Overdose; Entomology; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fires; Forensic Pathology; Homicide; Humans; Insecta; Larva; Male; Mummies; Poisoning; Postmortem Changes; Temperature"
"Spectrographic sensors for uranyl detection in the environment",2019,"More and more severe energy problem triggers extensive application of nuclear energy, and the adverse effects brought by nuclear materials such as uranyl to the environment are becoming the concern, as it has become a threat to human's health. Therefore, the detection of uranyl is increasingly important, which aims to make the application of uranium under surveillance and protection. A lot of detection methods employing varying materials based on different techniques for uranyl have been proposed including those using expensive and complicated instruments such as ICP-MS, ESI-MS, and neutron activation analysis etc. Those methods based on expensive instruments often provide quite low limit of detection (LOD) and excellent validity and repeatability, however, methods that are low-cost, convenient and rapid are in demand because these are satisfied characters for on-site and in-time determination. In the review, we discuss uranyl sensors based on spectrographic techniques, which is facile and promising for rapid assessment of uranium content in practical application. Spectrographic techniques including fluorescence, UV–vis spectrophotometry, resonance light scattering (RLS) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are evaluated. In detail, the core materials that playing extremely important roles in detection performance are stated consisting of small molecule, biomolecule, polymer and nanomaterial. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coremaking; Costs; Health risks; Neutron activation analysis; Raman scattering; Surface scattering; Uranium; Detection performance; Limit of detection; On-site determinations; Resonance light scattering; Spectrographic techniques; Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Time determination; VIS spectrophotometry; Uranium compounds"
"Functional Role of MicroRNAs in Thymocyte Development",2019,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous noncoding single-stranded RNAs widely distributed in eukaryotes, which can modulate target gene expression at posttranscriptional level and participate in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Related studies have shown that miRNAs are instrumental to many aspects of immunity, including various levels of T-cell immunity. In addition, multiple miRNAs have been ascribed key roles in T-cell development, differentiation, and function. In this review, we highlight the current literature regarding the functional role of miRNAs at various stages of thymocyte development. A better understanding of the relationship between miRNAs and thymocyte development is helpful for the exploration of the exact roles of miRNAs in the development and function of the immune system, as well as related clinical diseases. ? 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

"Current status of the combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization and local ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Purpose of review: To review the current status and ideal time interval of the combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and local ablation for patients with HCCs. Recent findings: In recent years, local ablation has been proposed as an alternative curative treatment in the management of HCC. Additionally, many treatment options are available including TACE molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Similar overall survival rates and prognoses have been obtained with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation for patients with HCCs up to 3?cm in diameter. Yet, MWA has shown superiority in treating large HCCs while cryoablation has several advantages compared with RFA or MWA. Furthermore, the treatment strategy of TACE combined with local ablation is widely accepted by many physicians in order to further increase the survival rate and improve the prognosis of patients with HCCs. However, the time interval between the two sessions of combination therapy remains uncertain in the current guidelines. Summary: Combination therapy of TACE and local ablation has advantages on survival and prognosis in patients with HCC compared with monotherapy. Good patient selection for the right modality needs to be carried out to guarantee the most efficacious treatment for HCC patients. Further studies are needed to find the ideal time interval between TACE and local ablation for HCC patients. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chemoembolization; cryoablation; human; intermethod comparison; liver cell carcinoma; microwave thermotherapy; multimodality cancer therapy; overall survival; priority journal; radioembolization; radiofrequency ablation; Review; survival rate; time; tumor ablation"
"Temporal cross-correlations between ambient air pollutants and seasonality of tuberculosis: A time-series analysis",2019,"The associations between ambient air pollutants and tuberculosis seasonality are unclear. We assessed the temporal cross-correlations between ambient air pollutants and tuberculosis seasonality. Monthly tuberculosis incidence data and ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), ozone (O3 ), sulfur dioxide (SO2 )) and air quality index (AQI) from 2013 to 2017 in Shanghai were included. A cross-correlogram and generalized additive model were used. A 4-month delayed effect of PM2.5 (0.55), PM10 (0.52), SO2 (0.47), NO2 (0.40), CO (0.39), and AQI (0.45), and a 6-month delayed effect of O3 (?0.38) on the incidence of tuberculosis were found. The number of tuberculosis cases increased by 8%, 4%, 18%, and 14% for a 10 ?g/m3 increment in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2; 4% for a 10 unit increment in AQI; 8% for a 0.1 mg/m3 increment in CO; and decreased by 4% for a 10 ?g/m3 increment in O3 . PM2.5 concentrations above 50 ?g/m3, 70 ?g/m3 for PM10, 16 ?g/m3 for SO2, 47 ?g/m3 for NO2, 0.85 mg/m3 for CO, and 85 for AQI, and O3 concentrations lower than 95 ?g/m3 were positively associated with the incidence of tuberculosis. Ambient air pollutants were correlated with tuberculosis seasonality. However, this sort of study cannot prove causality. ? 2019 by the authors.

"DRAM1 regulates autophagy and cell proliferation via inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-mTOR-ribosomal protein S6 pathway",2019,"Background: Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a tightly regulated process that delivers cellular components to lysosomes for degradation. Damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1) induces autophagy and is necessary for p53-mediated apoptosis. However, the signalling pathways regulated by DRAM1 are not fully understood. Methods: HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-DRAM1 plasmid. Autophagic proteins (LC3 and p62), phosphorylated p53 and the phosphorylated proteins of the class I PI3K-Akt-mTOR-ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) signalling pathway were detected with Western blot analysis. Cellular distribution of DRAM1 was determined with immunostaining. DRAM1 was knocked down in HEK293T cells using siRNA oligos which is confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Cells were serum starved for 18 h after overexpression or knockdown of DRAM1 to decrease the rpS6 activity to the basal level, and then the cells were stimulated with insulin growth factor, epidermal growth factor or serum. rpS6 phosphorylation and rpS6 were detected with Western blotting. Similarly, after overexpression or knockdown of DRAM1, phosphorylation of IGF-1Rβ and IGF-1R were examined with Western blotting. Cell viability was determined with CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay. Finally, human cancer cells Hela, SW480, and HCT116 were transfected with the FLAG-DRAM1 plasmid and phosphorylated rpS6 and rpS6 were detected with Western blot analysis. Results: DRAM1 induced autophagy and inhibited rpS6 phosphorylation in an mTORC1-dependent manner in HEK293T cells. DRAM1 didn't affect the phosphorylated and total levels of p53. Furthermore, DRAM1 inhibited the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway stimulated with growth factors or serum. DRAM1 was localized at the plasma membrane and regulate the phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor. DRAM1 decreased cell viability and colony numbers upon serum starvation. Additionally, DRAM1 inhibited rpS6 phosphorylation in several human cancer cells. Conclusions: Here we provided evidence that DRAM1 inhibited rpS6 phosphorylation in multiple cell types. DRAM1 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and the activation of Akt-rpS6 pathway stimulated with growth factors and serum. Furthermore, DRAM1 regulated the activation of IGF-1 receptor. Thus, our results identify that the class I PI3K-Akt-rpS6 pathway is regulated by DRAM1 and may provide new insight into the potential role of DRAM1 in human cancers. ? 2019 The Author(s).","autophagy related protein; cell membrane protein; epidermal growth factor; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein DRAM1; protein FLAG; protein IGF 1Rbeta; protein kinase B; protein LC3; protein p63; protein S6; regulator protein; sequestosome 1; small interfering RNA; somatomedin; somatomedin C receptor; unclassified drug; DRAM1 protein, human; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; membrane protein; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein p53; protein S6; somatomedin C receptor; Article; autophagy; cell proliferation; cell stimulation; cell viability; cellular distribution; colony formation; HCT 116 cell line; HEK293T cell line; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; plasmid; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis inhibition; quantitative analysis; regulatory mechanism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; SW480 cell line; Western blotting; apoptosis; autophagy; cell proliferation; cell survival; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; signal transduction; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; HCT116 Cells; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Membrane Proteins; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Ribosomal Protein S6; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"
"Ultrasensitive and quantitative detection of: EGFR mutations in plasma samples from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer using a dual PNA clamping-mediated LNA-PNA PCR clamp",2019,"Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is a potential proxy for tumour tissues. However, the analysis of mutations and mutational abundance using ctDNA remains challenging because ctDNA is present at low levels. In addition, the concordance between plasma and tumour tissues requires further investigation by high-sensitivity techniques. Here, we established an ultrasensitive, quantitative method for detecting rare mutations in plasma samples based on a dual PNA clamping-mediated LNA-PNA PCR clamp (LNA-dPNA PCR clamp). The novelty of our method is the coupling of PNA clamping with one-tube nested PCR to dually block wild-type DNA amplification and efficiently amplify mutant DNA. Then, four hotspot EGFR mutations (EGFR L858R, EGFR Exon 19 deletion, EGFR T790M, and EGFR C797S) were detected by our proposed method. Finally, we evaluated the concordance between plasma and tumour tissues by simultaneously detecting EGFR L858R by ddPCR and LNA-dPNA PCR clamp in 132 tissues and matched plasma samples from patients with NSCLC. For the four EGFR mutations, the amplification sensitivity of the LNA-dPNA PCR clamp was 10 0 copies per reaction, and the linearity was from 10 0 to 10 6 -10 7 copies per reaction. The limit of detection for the LNA-dPNA PCR clamp was 0.01%-0.1%. The LNA-dPNA PCR clamp was similarly consistent with ddPCR in quantifying mutational abundance (R 2 = 0.9568) and exhibited similar limit of detection (0.01%-0.1% vs. 0.01%), sensitivity (19.6 vs. 21.7), specificity (94.2 vs. 91.9), and concordance (68.2 vs. 67.4) to those of ddPCR for ctDNA detection. In conclusion, the LNA-dPNA PCR clamp will provide a labour-saving, cost-saving, ultrasensitive tool for detecting and quantifying plasma EGFR mutations. ?

"Carbon monoxide (CO)-Strengthened cooperative bioreductive anti-tumor therapy via mitochondrial exhaustion and hypoxia induction",2019,"Bioreductive chemodrugs require hypoxic conditions to activate their anti-cancer efficacy. The insufficient and heterogeneous hypoxic condition in tumor tissues hurdles the therapeutic potency of bioreductive chemodrugs. We herein report a NIR light-triggered CO release system based on mesoporous Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs)to enable cancer-selective hypoxia aggravation and hypoxia-responsive activation of bioreductive anti-cancer drug, tirapazamine (TPZ). Pentacarbonyl iron (Fe(CO)5)was coupled to PB NPs via coordination interaction, and TPZ was encapsulated into the pores of PB NPs. To prolong blood circulation and improve tumor accumulation, the PB-CO-TPZ NPs were surface-decorated with PEG-NH2. Upon tumor site-specific light irradiation, the non-lethal photothermal effect of PB NPs released CO, which accelerated mitochondrial oxygen consumption and generated hypoxia to activate TPZ. The CO-induced mitochondrial exhaustion simultaneously led to cancer cell apoptosis, thus realizing synergistic anti-cancer effect with TPZ-mediated bioreductive chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to activate bioreductive chemotherapy using CO. This study thus provides a promising paradigm to realize effective and safe cancer treatment via precise manipulation of drug activities, and may open new insights in the use of CO for biomedical treatment. ? 2019","Carbon monoxide; Cardiovascular system; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Anti-cancer therapies; Bioreductive drugs; Cancer cell apoptosis; Coordination interactions; Hypoxia responsiveness; Mitochondrial metabolism; Mitochondrial oxygen consumption; Prussian blue nanoparticles; Iron compounds; amine; carbon monoxide; carbonyl iron; ferric ferrocyanide; macrogol; nanocarrier; nanoparticle; oxygen; poly(allylamine hydrochloride); polyacrylic acid; polymer; tirapazamine; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; bioaccumulation; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer tissue; cell hypoxia; chemical bond; circulation; concentration (parameter); controlled drug release; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; drug distribution; drug half life; drug potentiation; female; infrared radiation; irradiation; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; photothermal therapy; priority journal"
"How melittin inserts into cell membrane: Conformational changes, inter-peptide cooperation, and disturbance on the membrane",2019,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), as a key component of the immune defense systems of organisms, are a promising solution to the serious threat of drug-resistant bacteria to public health. As one of the most representative and extensively studied AMPs, melittin has exceptional broad-spectrum activities against microorganisms, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Unfortunately, the action mechanism of melittin with bacterial membranes, especially the underlying physics of peptide-induced membrane poration behaviors, is still poorly understood, which hampers efforts to develop melittin-based drugs or agents for clinical applications. In this mini-review, we focus on recent advances with respect to the membrane insertion behavior of melittin mostly from a computational aspect. Membrane insertion is a prerequisite and key step for forming transmembrane pores and bacterial killing by melittin, whose occurrence is based on overcoming a high free-energy barrier during the transition of melittin molecules from a membrane surface-binding state to a transmembrane-inserting state. Here, intriguing simulation results on such transition are highlighted from both kinetic and thermodynamic aspects. The conformational changes and inter-peptide cooperation of melittin molecules, as well as melittin-induced disturbances to membrane structure, such as deformation and lipid extraction, are regarded as key factors influencing the insertion of peptides into membranes. The associated intermediate states in peptide conformations, lipid arrangements, membrane structure, and mechanical properties during this process are specifically discussed. Finally, potential strategies for enhancing the poration ability and improving the antimicrobial performance of AMPs are included as well. ? 2019 by the Authors.","antimicrobial cationic peptide; melittin; membrane lipid; biology; cell membrane; chemistry; genetics; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; kinetics; pathogenicity; protein conformation; thermodynamics; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Cell Membrane; Computational Biology; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Kinetics; Melitten; Membrane Lipids; Protein Conformation; Thermodynamics"
"NSD2 circular RNA promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer by targeting miR-199b-5p-mediated DDR1 and JAG1 signalling",2019,"Liver metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we searched for CRC metastasis-associated circular RNA in a mouse model of liver metastasis of CRC by using RNA (transcriptome)-sequencing. We identified a novel and conserved circular RNA, circ-NSD2, functioning as a promoter of CRC metastasis. Circ-NSD2 expression was elevated in CRC tissues and was markedly increased in advanced stages or metastatic tumours of CRC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that circ-NSD2 promoted migration and metastasis of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-NSD2 acted as a sponge for the tumour suppressor miR-199b-5p and activated DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1) and JAG1 (Jagged 1) genes, which synergistically helped with cell–matrix interaction, migration and metastasis of CRC cells. Taken together, our findings highlight a novel oncogenic function of circ-NSD2 and uncover a key mechanism for the circ-NSD2/miR-199b-5p/DDR1/JAG1 axis in CRC metastasis, which may serve as a prognostic factor and therapeutic target for antimetastatic therapy in CRC patients.

"The analysis of cell-free DNA concentrations and integrity in serum of initial and treated of lymphoma patients",2019,"Objective: To evaluate cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma as a promising biomarker for lymphoma, altered levels of cfDNA and its association with clinical parameters are investigated in patients suffered from lymphomas. Methods: Peripheral blood specimens were collected from 60 patients with lymphoma during initial diagnosis and those of another 107 patients with lymphoma during treated stage were also collected, 93 healthy volunteers were selected as control group. Quantitative PCR was used to detect cfDNA level in each group, cfDNA level in different groups was analyzed to understand its relationship with lymphoma patients’ clinical features. After correlation analysis between cfDNA and clinical characteristics, Receiver operator characteristic curve was performed to analyze sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA and LDH. Results: cfDNA concentration and integrity in initial stage of lymphoma patients were significantly higher than those in treated stage, and cfDNA concentration in treated phase was significantly higher than cfDNA concentration in control group. There was no significant difference in cfDNA integrity at treated stage compared with control group. There was no significant correlation between patient's age, gender, extranodal invasion and lymphoma pathological type and cfDNA concentration and integrity; In contrast, there was a significant correlation between ECOG score, LDH content, Ann Arbor stage, IPI, B-symptoms, Ki-67 expression and radiotherapy and cfDNA concentration and integrity, both at the time of initial diagnosis and treated stage. cfDNA concentration detection is an optimal diagnostic indicator, followed by cfDNA integrity detection, the sensitivity and specificity of both are superior to the traditional LDH detection. Conclusion: cfDNA level is significantly increased in lymphomas patient plasma and may help lymphoma screening. cfDNA level may serve as a potential indicator of lymphomas treatment efficacy. ? 2018","cell free DNA; DNA; Ki 67 antigen; lactate dehydrogenase; unclassified drug; circulating tumor DNA; tumor marker; adult; Article; cancer radiotherapy; clinical feature; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; DNA determination; female; human; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; adolescent; aged; blood; clinical trial; lymphoma; real time polymerase chain reaction; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Circulating Tumor DNA; Female; Humans; Lymphoma; Male; Middle Aged; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"
"Does Prior Bariatric Surgery Improve Outcomes Following Total Joint Arthroplasty in the Morbidly Obese? A Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background: There remains a controversy regarding the risks in subsequent total joint arthroplasty (TJA) with and without previous bariatric surgery (BS). We performed a meta-analysis based on the current evidence-based study to determine the influences of prior BS on the short-term and long-term outcomes following TJA. Methods: From the inception to July 2018, the EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched for all relevant English language trials. The primary outcome measures were complications and revision, whereas the secondary outcomes included length of stay and operative time. Short-term follow-up was defined as that from hospital discharge to 90 days, and long-term follow-up was defined as more than 1 year. Results: A total of 9 studies with 38,728 patients were included. Overall, medical comorbidities were higher in the BS group compared with the control morbid obesity group before TJA. Our meta-analysis revealed that BS prior to TJA was associated with reduced short-term medical complications, length of stay, and operative time. However, BS did not reduce the short-term risks for superficial wound infection or venous thromboembolism, and the long-term risks for dislocation, periprosthetic infection, periprosthetic fracture, and revision. Subgroup analysis identified a significant reduction in the risk of short-term periprosthetic infection in the BS group after total knee arthroplasty, but not after total hip arthroplasty. Conclusion: BS prior to TJA was associated with partially improved short-term outcomes after TJA. However, BS did not improve the risks for long-term outcomes. Limited by relatively higher comorbidities burden, the short-term benefits of BS should be further revealed by high-quality, controlled study in the future. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","arthroplasty; bariatric surgery; clinical outcome; comorbidity; hospital discharge; human; joint dislocation; length of stay; meta analysis; morbid obesity; operation duration; periprosthetic fracture; periprosthetic joint infection; postoperative complication; reoperation; Review; risk reduction; total hip replacement; total joint arthroplasty; total knee arthroplasty; venous thromboembolism; wound infection; complication; hip replacement; knee replacement; morbid obesity; postoperative complication; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Bariatric Surgery; Comorbidity; Humans; Obesity, Morbid; Periprosthetic Fractures; Postoperative Complications"
"Serum calcium levels at admission is associated with the outcomes in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage",2019,"Background/Objective: Hypertensive spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) cause significant morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between calcium level at admission and outcome in hypertensive ICH patients. Methods: 658 hypertensive ICH patients were enrolled from January 2012 to January 2016 in this retrospective study, and demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and outcome data were collected. The associations between serum calcium level and initial hematoma volume, hematoma enlargement and functional outcome were assessed. Results: Lower calcium level at admission was associated with larger initial hematoma volumes, baseline NIHSS and mRSscore (p <.05), but not with platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio on admission (p >.05). For outcome assessment, 30 days mortality and 6 months mRS were adjusted for age, gender and time from onset to admission, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, history of hypertension, baseline NIHSS score, Baseline mRS score and hematoma position, lower calcium level at admission was associated with worse outcomes. Conclusion: Low calcium level at admission is associated with worse outcome and might be a prognostic factor for acute ICH. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Neurosurgical Foundation.","calcium; calcium; adult; aged; Article; brain hematoma; brain hemorrhage; calcium blood level; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease association; female; hospital admission; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; outcome assessment; priority journal; Rankin scale; retrospective study; age; blood; brain hemorrhage; diagnostic imaging; drinking behavior; hematoma; hospital admission; international normalized ratio; mortality; partial thromboplastin time; platelet count; predictive value; prognosis; sex factor; smoking; treatment outcome; Age Factors; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Calcium; Female; Hematoma; Humans; International Normalized Ratio; Intracranial Hemorrhage, Hypertensive; Male; Middle Aged; Partial Thromboplastin Time; Patient Admission; Platelet Count; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Smoking; Treatment Outcome"
"Evaluation of the association between urinary cadmium levels below threshold limits and the risk of diabetes mellitus: a dose-response meta-analysis",2019,"As cadmium levels are increasing in the environment, the adverse effects of cadmium exposure specifically associated with chronic diseases are receiving increasing attention. Several population–based studies have been conducted on the association between cadmium and diabetes mellitus (DM) but have reported controversial results. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association between cadmium exposure and DM. In this meta-analysis, a random effects model was used because there was evidence of heterogeneity among studies. A dose-response relationship was assessed through a restricted cubic spline model with three knots. The results showed a positive association between cadmium levels in the body and DM (OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07–1.52). The cadmium levels in the body were defined on the basis of combined urinary and blood cadmium. Subgroup analysis further indicated a positive association between urinary cadmium levels and DM (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02–1.69). The dose-response analysis results showed a positive association between levels of urinary cadmium above 2.43?μg/g creatinine and DM, and the risk of DM increased by 16% for each l?μg/g creatinine increase in urinary cadmium levels. The results from our meta-analysis indicate that cadmium levels in the body are positively associated with DM, and urinary cadmium levels above 2.43?μg/g creatinine are associated with an increased risk of DM. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","blood; cell component; diabetes; dose-response relationship; meta-analysis; threshold; urine; cadmium; creatinine; analysis; chemically induced; diabetes mellitus; dose response; environmental exposure; female; human; male; meta analysis; pollutant; toxicity; urine; Cadmium; Creatinine; Diabetes Mellitus; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Male"
"Relationship between alcohol use, blood pressure and hypertension: An association study and a Mendelian randomisation study",2019,"Background Past studies have found a strong relationship between alcohol drinking and human health. Methods In this study, we first tested the association of rs671 with alcohol use in 2349 participants in southeast China. We then evaluated the causal impact between alcohol use and cardiovascular traits through a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis. Results We found strong evidence for the association of rs671 in the ALDH2 gene with alcohol drinking (p=6.08×10 -47; OR adj G=4.50, 95% CI 3.67 to 5.52). We found that female G carriers of rs671 had a higher proportion of non-drinkers than male G carriers (88.01% vs 38.70%). In non-drinkers, the female G allele frequency was higher than the male G allele frequency (71.1% vs 55.2%). MR analysis suggested that alcohol use had a causal effect on blood pressure (increasing 9.46 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (p=9.67×10 -4) and 7.50 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (p=9.62×10 -5)), and on hypertension in men (p=0.011; OR =1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.36) and in pooled samples (p=0.013; OR =1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.39), but not in women. We did not observe a causal effect of alcohol use on body mass index and lipid levels; further studies are needed to clarify the non-causal relationship. Conclusions Compared to never-drinkers, current and previous alcohol use had a causal effect on blood pressure and hypertension in pooled samples and in men. These results reflect Chinese culture which does not encourage women to drink. ?

"Exploration of MST1-Mediated Secondary Brain Injury Induced by Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Rats via Hippo Signaling Pathway",2019,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a serious public health problem which causes high rates of disability and mortality in adults. Cell apoptosis is a sign of secondary brain injury (SBI) following ICH. Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-1 (MST1), an apoptosis-promoting kinase, is a part of the Hippo signaling pathway and involved in cell death, oxidative stress, and inflammation. However, the role and underlying mechanism of MST1 in SBI induced by ICH have not yet been fully explained. The main purpose of present research was to explore the role of MST1 and its potential mechanism in SBI after ICH. An ICH model was established by injecting autologous blood into the right basal ganglia in male SD rats. We found that MST1 phosphorylation was significantly increased in brain tissues of rats after ICH. Additionally, inhibition of MST1 phosphorylation by a chemical inhibitor (Xmu-mp-1) and genetic knockdown could effectively reduce the activation of P-LATS1 and P-YAP which are downstream proteins of MST1 and decrease neuronal cell death and inflammation reaction in ICH rats. Furthermore, the decreased of MST1 phosphorylation reduced brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, and neurobehavioral impairment during ICH. Over-expression of MST1 resulted in opposite effects. Finally, deletion of MST1 significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis in vitro. In summary, our study revealed that MST1 played an important role in the SBI following ICH, and inhibition of MST1 could alleviate ICH-induced SBI. Therefore, MST1 may be considered as a potential therapeutic target for SBI following ICH. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","mammalian sterile 20 like kinase 1 protein; phosphotransferase; phosphotransferase inhibitor; unclassified drug; xmu mp 1 inhibitor; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; basal ganglion; behavior disorder; blood brain barrier; brain edema; brain hemorrhage; brain injury; cognitive defect; controlled study; downstream processing; fetus; gene deletion; gene knockdown; hippo signaling; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; male; nerve cell degeneration; neuroapoptosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; protein phosphorylation; rat"
"KLF2 regulates osteoblast differentiation by targeting of Runx2",2019,"Osteoblast differentiation plays a critical role in bone formation and maintaining balance in bone remodeling. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) is a central transcription factor regulating osteoblast differentiation and promoting bone mineralization. Until now, the molecular regulatory basis and especially the gene regulatory network of osteogenic differentiation have been unclear. Kr?ppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a zinc finger structure and DNA-binding transcription factor. The current study aimed to investigate the physiological function of KLF2 in osteoblast differentiation. Our results indicate that KLF2 is expressed in pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts. Interestingly, KLF2 expression is increased in osteoblasts during the osteoblastic differentiation process. Overexpression of KLF2 in MC3T3-E1 cells promoted the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation marker genes Alp, Osx, and Ocn, and stimulated mineralization by increasing Runx2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, knockdown of KLF2 produced the opposite effects. Importantly, we found that KLF2 could physically interact with Runx2. KLF2 promoted osteoblast differentiation by regulating Runx2 and physically interacting with Runx2. Taken together, the findings of this study identify KLF2 as a novel regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Our findings suggest that KLF2 might be a new therapeutic target for bone disease. ? 2018, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","kruppel like factor 2; transcription factor RUNX2; Klf2 protein, mouse; kruppel like factor; Runx2 protein, mouse; transcription factor RUNX2; Article; cell differentiation; marker gene; MC3T3-E1 cell line; mineralization; osteoblast; physiological process; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; animal; cell line; cytology; gene knockdown; genetics; human; metabolism; mouse; physiology; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Mice; Osteoblasts"
"GLI1 overexpression promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration and induces drug resistance by combining with the AKT-mTOR pathway",2019,"Hedgehog (HH) pathway significantly affected the pathogenesis of Gastric cancer (GC), but the multiple uncanonical HH pathways that are mediated by Zinc Finger protein GLI1 (GLI1) are still unclear. In the present work, we evaluated GLI1 and p-AKT expression in GC using immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. GLI1 and AKT specific shRNA was transfected into GC cell lines to investigate the cross-regulation between HH pathway and AKT-mTOR pathway. The effect of GLI1 and p-AKT on proliferation, migration, and drug resistance were examined. Moreover, a mouse xenograft model of GC was established to verify the role of GLI1 and p-AKT in promoting drug sensitivity in vivo. Our results suggested the clinicopathological factors and prognosis by the differential expression of GLI1 and p-AKT in GC patients. GLI1 was activated by the AKT-mTOR pathway. Co-expression of GLI1 and p-AKT was associated with cell viability, migration, and drug resistance and indicated a poor prognosis in GC patients. Agents targeted against both GLI1 and p-AKT may reverse drug-resistance and achieve better inhibition than agents targeted against a single molecule. There was a significant correlation between the high expression of GLI1 and p-AKT in GC. Additionally, our study confirmed the activity of the AKT-mTOR-GLI1 axis, which provided a new viable field for GC treatment. ? 2019","cisplatin; short hairpin RNA; transcription factor Gli1; GLI1 protein, human; MTOR protein, human; protein kinase B; target of rapamycin kinase; transcription factor Gli1; adult; Akt/mTOR signaling; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer therapy; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; correlational study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene overexpression; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; MKN45 cell line; primary tumor; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; stomach cancer; tumor invasion; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; wedge resection; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; prognosis; signal transduction; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Resistance; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Stomach Neoplasms; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Zinc Finger Protein GLI1"
"Iron deposition in Parkinson's disease by quantitative susceptibility mapping",2019,"Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have elevated levels of brain iron, especially in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the iron deposition in the substantia nigra (SN) and other deep gray matter nuclei of PD patients using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and its clinical relationship, and to explore whether there is a gradient of iron deposition pattern in globus pallidus (GP)-fascicula nigrale (FN)-SN pathway. Methods: Thirty-three PD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) were included in this study. Subjects underwent brain MRI and constructed QSM data. The differences in iron accumulation in the deep gray matter nuclei of the subjects were compared, including the PD group and the control group, the early-stage PD (EPD) group and the late-stage PD (LPD) group. The iron deposition pattern of the GP-FN-SN pathway was analyzed. Results: The PD group showed increased susceptibility values in the FN, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), internal globus pallidus (GPi), red nucleus (RN), putamen and caudate nucleus compared with the HV group (P < 0.05). In both PD and HV group, iron deposition along the GP-FN-SN pathway did not show an increasing gradient pattern. The SNc, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and RN showed significantly increased susceptibility values in the LPD patients compared with the EPD patients. Conclusion: PD is closely related to iron deposition in the SNc. The condition of PD patients is related to the SNc and the SNr. There is not an increasing iron deposition gradient along the GP-FN-SN pathway. The source and mechanism of iron deposition in the SN need to be further explored, as does the relationship between the iron deposition in the RN and PD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","iron; iron; adult; Article; caudate nucleus; clinical article; controlled study; female; globus pallidus; gray matter; human; iron storage; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; putamen; quantitative susceptibility mapping; red nucleus; substantia nigra; substantia nigra pars compacta; substantia nigra pars reticulata; brain mapping; case control study; metabolism; nerve tract; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; procedures; severity of illness index; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Female; Globus Pallidus; Gray Matter; Humans; Iron; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Neuroimaging; Parkinson Disease; Severity of Illness Index; Substantia Nigra"
"Upregulation of IL-6 in CUL4B-deficient myeloid-derived suppressive cells increases the aggressiveness of cancer cells",2019,"Cancer progression depends on a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) represent key cellular components in tumor microenvironment and have been demonstrated to facilitate tumor progression by restricting host immune responses and by sustaining the malignancy of cancer cells. CUL4B, which assembles the CUL4B-RING E3 ligase complex (CRL4B), possesses a potent oncogenic property in cancer cells by epigenetically inactivating many tumor suppressors. However, CUL4B in hematopoietic cells exerts tumor-suppressive effect by restricting the accumulation and function of MDSCs. How CUL4B regulates the function of MDSCs is not fully characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that the enhanced growth and metastasis of transplanted tumor cells in hematopoietic or myeloid cell-specific Cul4b knockout recipient mice is mediated by increased production of IL-6 in MDSCs. CUL4B complex epigenetically represses IL-6 transcription in myeloid cells. The IL-6 produced by MDSCs renders cancer cells stem cell-like properties by activating IL-6/STAT3 signaling. This crosstalk was effectively blocked either by blocking IL-6 in MDSCs or by inhibition of STAT3 activation in tumor cells. These findings provide a new mechanistic insight into the cancer-promoting property of MDSCs. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","cullin; cullin 4B; interleukin 6; octamer transcription factor 4; STAT3 protein; transcription factor NANOG; transcription factor Sox2; unclassified drug; Cul4B protein, mouse; cullin; interleukin 6; interleukin-6, mouse; STAT3 protein; Stat3 protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; B16-F0 cell line; cancer cell; cancer stem cell; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; histone acetylation; histone methylation; histone ubiquitination; lung metastasis; mouse; mRNA expression level; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; nonhuman; priority journal; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; experimental melanoma; genetics; knockout mouse; metabolism; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor microenvironment; upregulation; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cullin Proteins; Interleukin-6; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Tumor Microenvironment; Up-Regulation"

"Hyaluronidase with pH-responsive Dextran Modification as an Adjuvant Nanomedicine for Enhanced Photodynamic-Immunotherapy of Cancer",2019,"The condensed tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) consisting of cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) is one of key factors that results in the aberrant tumor microenvironment (TME) and the resistance to various types of therapies. Herein, hyaluronidase (HAase) is modified by a biocompatible polymer, dextran (DEX), via a pH-responsive traceless linker. The formulated DEX-HAase nanoparticles show enhanced enzyme stability, reduced immunogenicity, and prolonged blood half-life after intravenous injection. With efficient tumor passive accumulation, DEX-HAase within the acidic TME would be dissociated to release native HAase, which afterward triggers the breakdown of HA to loosen the ECM structure, subsequently leading to enhanced penetration of oxygen and other therapeutic agents. The largely relieved tumor hypoxia would promote the therapeutic effect of nanoparticle-based photodynamic therapy (PDT), accompanied by the reverse of the immunosuppressive TME to boost cancer immunotherapy. Interestingly, the therapeutic responses achieved by the combination of PDT and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) checkpoint blockade therapy could be significantly enhanced by pretreatment with DEX-HAase. In addition to destructing tumors with direct light exposure, a robust abscopal effect is achieved after such treatment, which is promising for tumor metastasis inhibition. The work presents a new type of adjuvant nanomedicine to assist photodynamic-immunotherapy of cancer, by effective modulation of TME. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Fatty acid synthase enhances colorectal cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via regulating AMPK/mTOR pathway",2019,"Objective: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Materials and methods: FASN levels were analyzed in human CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues by Western blots and immunohistochemistry. Potential roles of FASN in regulating CRC cell proliferation and migration were examined by genetic manipulation in vitro. The molecular signaling was determined to understand the mechanisms of observed FASN effects. Results: FASN level was upregulated in CRC tissues and high expression of FASN was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastases) stage and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Knockdown of FASN attenuated CRC cell proliferation and migration in vitro while FASN overexpression possessed the opposite effects. FASN regulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in CRC cells. Conclusion: FASN enhanced CRC cell proliferation and metastasis potentially through AMPK/mTOR pathway, indicating that FASN/AMPK/mTOR signaling axis may serve as a potential target for the treatment of CRC. ? 2019 Lu et al.","fatty acid synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; cell migration; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; colorectal cancer cell line; controlled study; female; gene knockdown; human; human tissue; in vitro study; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; metastasis; protein expression; signal transduction; upregulation"
"Whole genome sequencing of pairwise human subjects reveals DNA mutations specific to developmental dysplasia of the hip",2019,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)is a common congenital malformation characterized by mismatch in shape between the femoral head and acetabulum, and leads to hip dysplasia. To date, the pathogenesis of DDH is poorly understood and may involve multiple factors, including genetic predisposition. However, comprehensive genetic analysis has not been applied to investigate a genetic component of DDH. In the present study, 10 pairs of healthy fathers and DDH daughters were enrolled to identify genetic hallmarks of DDH using high throughput whole genome sequencing. The DDH-specific DNA mutations were found in each patient. Overall 1344 genes contained DDH-specific mutations. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes played important roles in the cytoskeleton, microtubule cytoskeleton, sarcoplasm and microtubule associated complex. These functions affected osteoblast and osteoclast development. Therefore, we proposed that the DDH-specific mutations might affect bone development, and caused DDH. Our pairwise high throughput sequencing results comprehensively delineated genetic hallmarks of DDH. Further research into the biological impact of these mutations may inform the development of DDH diagnostic tools and allow neonatal gene screening. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","DNA; Article; bone development; cell function; cell maturation; cell structure; child; clinical article; controlled study; cytoskeleton; female; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic predisposition; genetic screening; genetic variation; high throughput sequencing; hip dysplasia; human; infant; male; microtubule; pathogenesis; priority journal; sarcoplasm; whole genome sequencing; adult; congenital hip dislocation; genetics; mutation; pathology; pedigree; preschool child; whole genome sequencing; Adult; Child, Preschool; Female; Hip Dislocation, Congenital; Humans; Infant; Male; Mutation; Osteogenesis; Pedigree; Whole Genome Sequencing"

"Evaluating the Ability of the New Subclassification to Prognosticate Outcomes Following Hepatectomy for Patients with HBV-Related HCC",2019,"Background: Recently, experts proposed subclassification for BCLC B patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficient of subclassification of patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. Methods: Seven hundred twenty-nine consecutive hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients with BCLC stage B classification who underwent hepatectomy in the period 2006–2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were reclassified based on the new proposed subclassification of the BCLC B stage from B1 to B4. The prognosis of subclassification was tested using Kaplan-Meier statistics analysis. Results: There were 145 (19.9%), 480 (65.8%), 62 (8.5%), and 42 (5.8%) patients in B1, B2, B3, and B4, respectively. The result suggested that overall and tumor-free survival rates among the B1, B2, and B3 subclassification in the Bolondi system had significant difference (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between B3 and B4 subclassifications. Cox regression showed that BCLC B subclassification, largest/smallest diameter, and anatomic liver resection were independent predictors of tumor-free survival. BCLC B subclassification and anatomic liver resection were independent predictors of overall survival. Conclusions: The subclassification of BCLC stage B can be used in patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative intent hepatectomy. Patients in BCLC B1 and B2 subgroups should be treated more aggressively than patients in B3 and B4 subgroups. B3 and B4 groups should be merged for patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative intent hepatectomy. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; evaluation study; female; hepatitis B; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overall survival; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; survival rate; survival time; tumor volume; adolescent; aged; China; complication; follow up; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; incidence; isolation and purification; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; liver tumor; middle aged; mortality; pathology; prognosis; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; China; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatectomy; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Incidence; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Young Adult"

Method: Brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 59 patients with unmedicated first episode current MDD (cMDD), 48 patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) and 60 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs). Using graph theory, we systematically studied the topological organization of their whole-brain functional networks at the global and nodal level. Results: At a global level, both patient groups showed decreased normalized clustering coefficient in relative to HCs. On a nodal level, both patient groups showed decreased nodal centrality, predominantly in cortex-mood-regulation brain regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. By comparison to cMDD patients, rMDD group had a higher nodal centrality in right parahippocampal gyrus.

"Adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of stroke and stroke subtypes",2019,"Several meta-analyses including a small number of cohorts showed inverse associations between the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) and risk of stroke. However, it remains unclear whether such a relation varies by region of the study population or by major subtypes of stroke. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for relevant studies and we further included unpublished results from the Singapore Chinese Health Study (N = 57,078) and the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) study (N = 12,670). We used a random-effects model to calculate summary relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of stroke for each 4-point increment of the MedDiet score, roughly corresponding to the difference between extreme quintiles of the MedDiet score among participants of the included studies. The final analyses included 20 prospective cohort studies involving 682,149 participants and 16,739 stroke cases. The summary RRs for each 4-point increment of the MedDiet score were 0.84 (95% CI 0.81–0.88; I 2 = 11.5%) for all combined, 0.76 (95% CI 0.65–0.89) for studies in Mediterranean populations and 0.86 (95% CI 0.83–0.89) for those in non-Mediterranean populations. Lower risk of stroke associated with higher MedDiet score also was observed in the analyses stratified by study population and methodological characteristics including study risk of bias, version of the MedDiet index, and definition of moderate alcohol consumption. The MedDiet was similarly associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81–0.91; nine studies) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.93; eight studies). Our meta-analysis suggests that adhering to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower risk of stroke in both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean populations, and for both ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke risk. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","alcohol consumption; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; dietary compliance; human; Mediterranean diet; risk factor; risk reduction; scoring system; stroke patient; systematic review; transient ischemic attack; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; Mediterranean diet; meta analysis; risk assessment; Brain Ischemia; Diet, Mediterranean; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Risk Assessment; Stroke"
"Comprehensive analysis of dysregulated lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs with associated ceRNA network in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Mounting evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in tumor biology. To date, some lncRNAs have been found to be involved in competitive binding of miRNAs, a major group of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), through participation in a regulatory network of protein-coding gene expression. However, the functional roles of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have rarely been reported. Here, we construct a hypothetical ceRNA network by analyzing differential expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs obtained from 96 ESCC tissues and 13 normal tissues in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Ultimately, 95 lncRNAs, 9 miRNAs, and 40 mRNAs were identified (fold change >1.5, P < .05) and included in the ceRNA network for ESCC. Moreover, three lncRNAs (IGF2-AS, MUC2 and SOX2-OT) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (log-rank test, P < .05), and further experiments revealed that lncRNA DLX6-AS1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and invasion of esophageal cancer cells by enhancing the endogenous function of mTOR. We believe that the identified ceRNA network can facilitate a better understanding of lncRNA-related mechanisms in ESCC. ? 2019","competitive endogenous RNA; long untranslated RNA; mammalian target of rapamycin; messenger RNA; microRNA; RNA; unclassified drug; complementary RNA; long non-coding RNA IGF2-AS, human; long non-coding RNA Sox2ot, human; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; MTOR protein, human; MUC2 protein, human; mucin 2; target of rapamycin kinase; adult; apoptosis; Article; AS1 gene; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; diagnostic value; DLX6 gene; enzyme activity; esophageal cancer cell line; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; gene expression; gene regulatory network; gene silencing; human; human tissue; in vitro study; major clinical study; male; oncogene; overall survival; priority journal; RNA analysis; survival analysis; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus; esophagus tumor; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; gene regulatory network; genetics; HEK293 cell line; information processing; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; pathology; prognosis; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Cell Line, Tumor; Datasets as Topic; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Esophagus; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Gene Regulatory Networks; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Mucin-2; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Prognosis; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"
"Altered resting-state dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder",2019,"Objective: The brain functional alterations at regional and network levels in post-traumatic stress disorder patients are still unclear. This study explored brain functional alterations at regional and network levels in post-traumatic stress disorder patients with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and evaluated the relationship between brain function and clinical indices in post-traumatic stress disorder. Methods: Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were conducted among typhoon survivors with (n = 27) and without post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 30) to assess the spontaneous brain activity and network-level brain function. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to examine the association of brain function with clinical symptom and social support. Results: Both the post-traumatic stress disorder group and the trauma-exposed control group showed decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex relative to the healthy control group. The post-traumatic stress disorder group showed increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right paracentral lobule and bilateral precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus relative to both control groups. Both traumatized groups exhibited decreased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right hippocampus and left cerebellum relative to the healthy control group. More decreased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right hippocampus was found in the post-traumatic stress disorder group. The Checklist-Civilian Version score positively correlated with functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the right paracentral lobule as well as between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the right precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus. The social support was associated with functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus as well as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the left middle frontal gyrus. Conclusion: Trauma exposure may result in aberrant local and network-level functional connectivity in individuals with or without post-traumatic stress disorder. Altered amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may be a predisposing risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder development following trauma exposure. More prominent decreased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right hippocampus might be specific in the post-traumatic stress disorder group. Improvement of social support might possibly be significant for post-traumatic stress disorder patients. ?

"MicroRNA-335/ID4 dysregulation predicts clinical outcome and facilitates leukemogenesis by activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"MircoRNA-335 (miR-335) has been reported as a significant cancer-associated microRNA, which was often epigenetically silenced and acted as a tumor suppressor gene in diverse human solid tumors. Conversely, recent studies show that miR-335 overexpression was identified in both adult and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that it might play an oncogenic role of miR-335 in AML. However, the role of miR-335 during leukemogenesis remains to be elucidated. MiR-335/ID4 expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR and/or western blot. Survival analysis was performed to explore the association between miR-335/ID4 expression and the prognosis, and further validated by public databases. Gain-of-function experiments determined by cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation were conducted to investigate the biological functions of miR-335/ID4. Herein, we found that miR-335 expression, independent of its methylation, was significantly increased and negatively correlated with reduced ID4 expression in AML. Moreover, aberrant miR-335/ID4 expression independently affected chemotherapy response and leukemia-free/overall survival in patients with AML. Gain-of-function experiments in vitro showed the oncogenic role of miR-335 by affecting cell apoptosis and proliferation in AML, and could be rescued by ID4 restoration. Mechanistically, we identified and verified that miR-335/ID4 contributed to leukemogenesis through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, aberrant miR-335/ID4 expression was an independent prognostic biomarker in AML. MiR-335/ID4 dysregulation facilitated leukemogenesis through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. ? Zhou et al.",""
"Hydrogen sulfide: a gaseous signaling molecule modulates tissue homeostasis: implications in ophthalmic diseases",2019,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) serves as a gasotransmitter in the regulation of organ development and maintenance of homeostasis in tissues. Its abnormal levels are associated with multiple human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, myocardial injury, and ophthalmic diseases. Excessive exposure to H2S could lead to cellular toxicity, orchestrate pathological process, and increase the risk of various diseases. Interestingly, under physiological status, H2S plays a critical role in maintaining cellular physiology and limiting damages to tissues. In mammalian species, the generation of H2S is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), 3-mercapto-methylthio pyruvate aminotransferase (3MST) and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). These enzymes are found inside the mammalian eyeballs at different locations. Their aberrant expression and the accumulation of substrates and intermediates can change the level of H2S by orders of magnitude, causing abnormal structures or functions in the eyes. Detailed investigations have demonstrated that H2S donors’ administration could regulate intraocular pressure, protect retinal cells, inhibit oxidative stress and alleviate inflammation by modulating the function of intra or extracellular proteins in ocular tissues. Thus, several slow-releasing H2S donors have been shown to be promising drugs for treating multiple diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological function of H2S metabolism and its application in ophthalmic diseases. ? 2019, The Author(s).","3 mercapto methylthio pyruvate aminotransferase; advanced glycation end product; cystathionine beta synthase; cystathionine gamma lyase; cysteine aminotransferase; enzyme; gasotransmitter; hydrogen sulfide; unclassified drug; antithrombotic activity; cell protection; diabetic retinopathy; eye disease; eye tissue; glaucoma; homeostasis; inflammation; intraocular pressure; ischemia; mammal cell; metal metabolism; oxidative stress; priority journal; retina blood vessel; retina cell; retina degeneration; retina nerve cell; Review; stem cell transplantation"
"Development and validation of serum exosomal microRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. China accounts for over half of the new cases and deaths. Diagnostic imprecision and a lack of complimentary molecular biomarkers are partially responsible for this lack of progress. Herein, serum-derived exosomal microRNA (miRNA) profiling was performed on 80 patients which histologically confirmed HCC and 30 normal controls. A classification of 8 exosomal miRNAs had biologically and statistically significant differences between HCC and normal serum samples, including miR-122, miR-125b, miR-145, miR-192, miR-194, miR-29a, miR-17-5p, and miR-106a. Online algorithm showed strong independent classification accuracy (area under the curve) reached 0.535 to 0.850, separately. The significant correlation between serum exosomal miRNAs and tumor size was observed. In addition, the survival difference of HCC patients with high or low exosomal miR-106a was statistically significant using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Besides, we also measured the proliferation and invasion ability of HCC cells following exosomal miR-106a mimics or inhibitor treatment. After prediction with algorithms, mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways were identified associated with miR-106a’s function. In summary, differentially expressed serum exosomal miRNAs can be helpful for diagnostic and prognostic of HCC. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biological marker; microRNA; microRNA 106a; microRNA 122; microRNA 125b; microRNA 145; microRNA 17 5p; microRNA 192; microRNA 194; microRNA 29a; mitogen activated protein kinase; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIRN106 microRNA, human; mitogen activated protein kinase; transcriptome; tumor marker; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; cancer classification; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; exosome; female; gene expression; gene function; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; Kaplan Meier method; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; overall survival; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; serum; SMMC-7721 cell line; statistical significance; tumor volume; upregulation; validation study; area under the curve; blood; carcinogenesis; China; exosome; genetic transfection; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; MAPK signaling; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; China; Exosomes; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms; Male; MAP Kinase Signaling System; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Transcriptome; Transfection; Tumor Burden"
"Cluster-transition determining sites underlying the antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses",2019,"Seasonal influenza viruses undergo frequent mutations on their surface hemagglutinin (HA) proteins to escape the host immune response. In these mutations, a few key amino acid sites are associated with significant antigenic cluster transitions. To recognize the cluster-transition determining sites of seasonal influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses systematically and quickly, we developed a computational model named RECDS (recognition of cluster-transition determining sites) to evaluate the contribution of a specific amino acid site on the HA protein in the whole history of antigenic evolution. In RECDS, we ranked all of the HA sites by calculating the contribution scores derived from the forest of gradient boosting classifiers trained by various sequence- and structure-based features. With the RECDS model, we found out that the sites determining influenza antigenicity were mostly around the receptor-binding domain both for the influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses. Specifically, half of the cluster-transition determining sites of the influenza A/ H1N1 virus were located in the vestigial esterase domain and basic path area on the HA, which indicated that the differential driving force of the antigenic evolution of the A/H1N1 virus refers to the A/H3N2 virus. Beyond that, the footprints of substitutions responsible for antigenic evolution were inferred according to the phylogenetic trees for the cluster-transition determining sites. The monitoring of genetic variation occurring at these cluster-transition determining sites in circulating influenza viruses on a large scale will potentially reduce current assay workloads in influenza surveillance and the selection of new influenza vaccine strains. ?

"Epigenetic silencing of ZNF132 mediated by methylation-sensitive Sp1 binding promotes cancer progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Epigenetic alteration of tumor suppression gene is one of the most significant indicators in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, we identified a novel ESCC hypermethylation biomarker ZNF132 by integrative computational analysis to comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation microarray dataset. We validated the hypermethylation status of ZNF132 in 91 Chinese Han ESCC patients and adjacent normal tissues with methylation target bisulfite sequencing (MTBS) assay. Meanwhile, ZNF132 gene silencing mediated by hypermethylation was confirmed in both solid tissues and cancer cell lines. What is more, we found that in vitro overexpression of ZNF132 in ESCC cells could significantly reduce the abilities of the cell in growth, migration and invasion, and tumorigenicity of cells in a nude mouse model. We validated the Sp1-binding site in the ZNF132 promoter region with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and demonstrated that the hypermethylation status could reduce the Sp1 transcript factor activity. Our results suggest that ZNF132 plays an important role in the development of ESCC as a tumor suppressor gene and support the underlying mechanism caused by the DNA hypermethylation-mediated Sp1-binding decay and gene silencing. ? 2018, The Author(s).","biological marker; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; znf132 protein; DNA binding protein; transcription factor; transcription factor Sp1; tumor suppressor protein; zinc finger protein 132 protein, human; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; binding site; cancer cell line; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cell migration; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; DNA methylation; epigenetics; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; gene silencing; Han Chinese; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; reporter gene; RNA extraction; tumor suppressor gene; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; wound healing assay; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; DNA methylation; DNA responsive element; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Methylation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Response Elements; Sp1 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factors; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"Increased CX3CL1 mRNA expression level is a positive prognostic factor in patients with lung adenocarcinoma",2019,"Chemokines are a family of small cytokines, which are signalling proteins secreted by cells. The principal role of chemokines is to serve as chemoattractants to guide the migration of their target cells. Chemokine C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1) is a protein-coding gene of fractalkine, which serves as a ligand for chemokine C-X3-C motif receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and integrins. However, the roles of CX3CL1 in different pathological types of lung cancer remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the potential clinical and biological function of CX3CL1 mRNA expression in patients with lung cancer. In the present study, lung cancer data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and The Cancer Genome Atlas were downloaded and analysed, and the results demonstrated that an increased CX3CL1 mRNA expression in tumour tissues from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) was associated with improved overall survival. However, no significant association was identified between CX3CL1 expression and the prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Furthermore, the genes whose expression levels were correlated with CX3CL1 expression were subjected to enrichment analysis, and the results for the LUAD data demonstrated that the most significant biological processes included ‘positive regulation of cell adhesion’, ‘leukocyte cell-cell adhesion’, ‘leukocyte migration’ and ‘T cell activation’, whereas, the important highly ranked pathways included ‘cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)’, ‘leukocyte transendothelial migration’ and ‘natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity’. However, in the patients with LUSC, the genes that were highly correlated with CX3CL1 were not enriched for any biological processes or signalling pathways. Based on the data of the present study, it was hypothesised that CX3CL1 may serve as a prognostic marker for LUAD. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Altered expression of the CSMD1 gene in the peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients",2019,"Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heritable, refractory, and devastating psychiatric disorder. Previous studies have shown that the variants of CUB and sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) demonstrate significant genome-wide association with SCZ. However, few studies have been conducted on the effect of antipsychotics on the expression levels of CSMD1. This study explored whether a change occurs in the expression of the CSMD1 gene before and after antipsychotic treatment in SCZ patients. Methods: The study population comprised Han Chinese patients from eastern China, including 32 SCZ patients and 48 healthy controls. The expression of CSMD1 before and after treatment in the SCZ group and between the two groups was analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: The expression levels of the CSMD1 gene in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SCZ patients were lower than those in the healthy controls. The expression levels of the CSMD1 gene in the PBMCs of the SCZ patients after antipsychotic treatment were higher than those in the baseline SCZ patients (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results showed that the expression levels of CSMD1 are correlated with the development and treatment of SCZ, providing further evidence for the involvement of CSMD1 in SCZ. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amisulpride; aripiprazole; olanzapine; quetiapine; risperidone; ziprasidone; biological marker; CSMD1 protein, human; membrane protein; neuroleptic agent; tumor suppressor protein; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; CSMD1 gene; disease course; female; gene; gene expression; gene expression level; genetic association; genetic correlation; Han Chinese; human; human cell; male; molecular pathology; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; schizophrenia; treatment duration; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; China; drug effect; epidemiology; gene expression; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; middle aged; mononuclear cell; physiology; procedures; risk factor; schizophrenia; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers; China; Female; Gene Expression; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Membrane Proteins; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"TIGAR knockdown enhanced the anticancer effect of aescin via regulating autophagy and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells",2019,"Our previous study showed that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) regulated ROS, autophagy, and apoptosis in response to hypoxia and chemotherapeutic drugs. Aescin, a triterpene saponin, exerts anticancer effects and increases ROS levels. The ROS is a key upstream signaling to activate autophagy. Whether there is a crosstalk between TIGAR and aescin in regulating ROS, autophagy, and apoptosis is unknown. In this study, we found that aescin inhibited cell viability and colony formation, and induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in cancer cell lines HCT-116 and HCT-8 cells. Concurrently, aescin increased the expression of TIGAR, ROS levels, and autophagy activation. Knockdown of TIGAR enhanced the anticancer effects of aescin in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of TIGAR or replenishing TIGAR downstream products, NADPH and ribose, attenuated aescin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, aescin-induced ROS elevation and autophagy activation were further strengthened by TIGAR knockdown in HCT-116 cells. However, autophagy inhibition by knockdown of autophagy-related gene ATG5 or 3-methyladenine (3-MA) exaggerated aescin-induced apoptosis when TIGAR was knocked down. In conclusion, TIGAR plays a dual role in determining cancer cell fate via inhibiting both apoptosis and autophagy in response to aescin, which indicated that inhibition of TIGAR and/or autophagy may be a junctional therapeutic target in treatment of cancers with aescin. ? 2018, CPS and SIMM.","3 methyladenine; autophagy related protein 5; epirubicin; escin; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; regulator protein; tp53 induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; C12orf5 protein, human; escin; signal peptide; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; cell proliferation; cell viability; colony formation; colorectal cancer; concentration response; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; female; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; HCT 116 cell line; HCT 8 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; NCM460 cell line; nonhuman; protein function; regulatory mechanism; tumor volume; tumor weight; upregulation; animal; apoptosis; autophagy; drug effect; gene knockdown; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Escin; Female; G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Mice, Nude; Up-Regulation"
"Development of a prognostic score for recommended TACE candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicentre observational study",2019,"Background & Aims: Previous prognostic scores for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) were mainly derived from real-world settings, which are beyond guideline recommendations. A robust model for outcome prediction and risk stratification of recommended TACE candidates is lacking. We aimed to develop an easy-to-use tool specifically for these patients. Methods: Between January 2010 and May 2016, 1,604 treatment-na?ve patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Child-Pugh A5-B7 and performance status 0 undergoing TACE were included from 24 tertiary centres. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 807) and validation (n = 797) cohorts. A prognostic model was developed and subsequently validated. Predictive performance and discrimination were further evaluated and compared with other prognostic models. Results: The final presentation of the model was “linear predictor = largest tumour diameter (cm) + tumour number” which consistently outperformed other currently available models in both training and validation datasets as well as in different subgroups. The thirtieth percentile and the third quartile of the linear predictor, namely 6 and 12, were further selected as cut-off values, leading to the “six-and-twelve” score which could divide patients into 3 strata with the sum of tumour size and number ?6, >6 but ?12, and >12 presenting significantly different median survival of 49.1 (95% CI 43.7–59.4) months, 32.0 (95% CI 29.9–37.5) months, and 15.8 (95% CI 14.1–17.7) months, respectively. Conclusions: The six-and-twelve score may prove an easy-to-use tool to stratify recommended TACE candidates (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage-A/B) and predict individual survival with favourable performance and discrimination. Moreover, the score could stratify these patients in clinical practice as well as help design clinical trials with comparable criteria involving these patients. Further external validation of the score is required. Lay summary: There is currently no prognostic model specifically developed for recommended or ideal transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma, despite these patients being frequently identified as the best target population in pivotal randomized controlled trials. The six-and-twelve score provides patient survival prediction, especially in ideal candidates of TACE, outperforming other currently available models in both training and validation sets, as well as different subgroups. With cut-off values of 6 and 12, the score can stratify ideal TACE candidates into 3 strata with significantly different outcomes and may shed light on risk stratification of these patients in clinical practice as well as in clinical trials. ? 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver","alpha fetoprotein; cisplatin; doxorubicin; epirubicin; gelatin sponge; iodinated poppyseed oil; oxaliplatin; polyvinyl alcohol; virus DNA; virus RNA; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer survival; chemoembolization; Child Pugh score; clinical practice; controlled study; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observational study; overall survival; patient risk; priority journal; quantitative analysis; survival prediction; tertiary care center; tumor number; tumor volume"
"Doxorubicin and siRNA-PD-L1 co-delivery with T7 modified ROS-sensitive nanoparticles for tumor chemoimmunotherapy",2019,"Tumor cells avoid immunosurveillance during the tumorigenesis, metastasis and recurrence periods thanks to the overexpressed immunosuppressive molecules on their surface. For instance, the programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) binds with the T-cells’ programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) impairing the anti-tumor activity of the host T cells. In this study, a new reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive nanoparticle (NP), modified with the HAIYPRH (T7) peptide, was developed for the co-delivery of siRNA-PD-L1 and doxorubicin (Dox). These NPs can block the inhibitory signal responding to T cells and enhance cytotoxicity of Dox against tumor cells. The T7 modification binds to the overexpressed transferrin receptor on tumor cells facilitating its cellular uptake. Dox rapid release is then triggered by the high tumor cells cytoplasmic concentration of ROS, leading to cell apoptosis. Our results demonstrated these NPs exhibited a T7-mediated cellular uptake and an intracellular ROS-triggered payloads release in vitro. They also suggested an improved in vivo 4T1 tumor targeting efficiency and chemoimmunotherapy. Most notably, the co-delivery system exhibited a significantly enhanced antitumor effect over Dox-only loaded NPs following prompting the proliferation of T cells by siRNA-PD-L1. In conclusion, these ROS-responsive NPs provided a promising strategy to combine siRNA-PD-L1 immunotherapy and Dox chemotherapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","copolymer; doxorubicin; haiyprh peptide; nanoparticle; peptide; programmed death 1 ligand 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; small interfering RNA; transferrin receptor; unclassified drug; antineoplastic antibiotic; collagen type 4; doxorubicin; nanoparticle; peptide fragment; programmed death 1 ligand 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; small interfering RNA; tumstatin (74-98); animal cell; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cell proliferation; cell transport; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug distribution; drug release; female; fluorescence imaging; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; neoplasm; nonhuman; nonviral gene delivery system; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rat; T lymphocyte; treatment response; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; zeta potential; animal; Bagg albino mouse; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; B7-H1 Antigen; Cell Line, Tumor; Collagen Type IV; Doxorubicin; Female; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Peptide Fragments; Reactive Oxygen Species; RNA, Small Interfering; Tumor Burden"

Here, the development of selective cell penetrating peptide (CPP33)-functionalized chimeric lipopepsomes (CPP33-CLP) for efficient encapsulation and selective delivery of polo-like kinase 1 specific siRNA (siPLK1) to orthotopic A549 human lung tumor in vivo is reported. Interestingly, siRNA is tightly encapsulated into CPP33-CLP with a superb encapsulation efficiency of over 95% owing to the thick strong electrostatic interactions. Notably, siPLK1-loaded CPP33-CLP (siPLK1-CPP33-CLP) is selectively internalized by A549 human lung cancer cells, efficiently escapes from endosomes, and swiftly releases siRNA into the cytoplasm, affording a significant sequence-specific gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, siPLK1-CPP33-CLP exhibits prolonged blood circulation, enhanced tumor accumulation, effective suppression of tumor growth, and considerably elevated survival time of orthotopic A549 human lung tumor-bearing nude mice. These chimeric lipopepsomes appear as an attractive and potent nanoplatform for safe and targeted siRNA delivery. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Chromogranin-a expression as a novel biomarker for early diagnosis of colon cancer patients",2019,"Colon cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death worldwide. The five-year survival rate for the early-stage patients is more than 90%, and only around 10% for the later stages. Moreover, half of the colon cancer patients have been clinically diagnosed at the later stages. It is; therefore, of importance to enhance the ability for the early diagnosis of colon cancer. Taking advantages from our previous studies, there are several potential biomarkers which have been associated with the early diagnosis of the colon cancer. In order to investigate these early diagnostic biomarkers for colon cancer, human chromogranin-A (CHGA) was further analyzed among the most powerful diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, we used a logistic regression-based meta-analysis to clarify associations of CHGA expression with colon cancer diagnosis. Both healthy populations and the normal mucosa from the colon cancer patients were selected as the double normal controls. The results showed decreased expression of CHGA in the early stages of colon cancer as compared to the normal controls. The decline of CHGA expression in the early stages of colon cancer is probably a new diagnostic biomarker for colon cancer diagnosis with high predicting possibility and verification performance. We have also compared the diagnostic powers of CHGA expression with the typical oncogene KRAS, classic tumor suppressor TP53, and well-known cellular proliferation index MKI67, and the CHGA showed stronger ability to predict early diagnosis for colon cancer than these other cancer biomarkers. In the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, CHGA was revealed to share some common pathways with KRAS and TP53. CHGA might be considered as a novel, promising, and powerful biomarker for early diagnosis of colon cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Sex differences in clinical characteristics and 1-year outcomes of young ischemic stroke patients in east China",2019,"Background: Data concerning sex differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of young ischemic stroke (IS) patients in Eastern China are scarce. Understanding sex differences in clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of young IS patients might provide valuable evidence for designing preventative measures and therapeutic interventions. Methods: The study included 228 acute IS patients aged up to 50 years recruited in the prospective Nanjing First Hospital Stroke Registry over a 5-year period. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether there were sex differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of young IS patients. Results: Admission systolic blood pressure (130.12±24.3 vs 137.96±24.3 mmHg, P=0.005) of women was significantly lower than that of men. Logistic regression showed that young women had poorer outcomes defined as having modified Rankin Scale score of 3–6 at 12 months after the adjustment for history of prior stroke, NIHSS score, and complication of pneumonia (adjusted OR: 3.45; 95% CI: 1.43–8.32). Conclusion: Our study indicates that there may be significant differences in clinical characteristics between young women and men with acute IS in East China. Young women were more likely to be dead or dependent at 12 months after stroke onset. More attention should be paid to young women’s IS prevention and management in East China. ? 2019 Geng et al.","adult; Article; brain ischemia; China; clinical feature; female; human; major clinical study; male; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; predictive value; prospective study; Rankin scale; risk factor; self report; sex difference; systolic blood pressure"
"Development of transferrin-modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles for glioma therapy",2019,"Glioma is a primary intracranial malignant tumor with poor prognosis. In this study, we aimed to develop transferrin (Tf)-modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles to deliver temozolomide (TMZ) to glioma and evaluate their efficacy to kill glioma. TMZ-loaded nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation technique and targeted by Tf. Tf-PLGA-TMZ and PLGA-TMZ were characterized for average particle sizes and zeta potentials, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity as well as in-vitro drug release of these nanoparticles were evaluated in human glioma U87MG cells. In-vivo antiglioma efficacy of Tf-PLGA-TMZ was evaluated in nude mice. Polydispersity ratio increased from 0.132 to 0.150, while encapsulation efficiency decreased from 69.4 to 55.8% after Tf modification of PLGA-TMZ. High performance liquid chromatography test showed that Tf-targeted nanoparticles were better internalized into U87MG cells than nontargeted nanoparticles. Moreover, Tf-PLGA-TMZ significantly decreased the viability of U87MG cells compared with nontargeted nanoparticles (P<0.05). In addition, Tf-PLGA-TMZ significantly decreased tumor volume and improved the survival of nude mice injected with U87MG cells. Tf-modified PLGA nanoparticles could be used for effective delivery of TMZ and have promise for the treatment of glioma. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"HucMSCs-Derived miR-206-Knockdown Exosomes Contribute to Neuroprotection in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Induced Early Brain Injury by Targeting BDNF",2019,"Early brain injury (EBI) is the most important potentially treatable cause of mortality and morbidity following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Apoptosis is one of the main pathologies of SAH-induced EBI. Numerous studies suggest that human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) may exert neuroprotective effect through exosomes instead of transdifferentiation. In addition, microRNA-206 (miR-206) targets BDNF and plays a critical role in brain injury diseases. However, the therapy effect of miR-206 modified exosomes on EBI after SAH and its regulatory mechanism have not been elucidated. Here, to identify whether hucMSCs-derived miR-206-knockdown exosomes have a better neuroprotective effect, we established SAH rat model and treated it with the exosomes to research the mechanism of miR-206 in EBI after SAH. We found that treatment with hucMSCs-derived miR-206-knockdown exosomes has a greater neuroprotective effect on SAH-induced EBI compared to treatment with simple exosomes. The miR-206-knockdown exosomes could significantly improve neurological deficit and brain edema and suppress neuronal apoptosis by targeting BDNF. Moreover, the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway was activated following treatment with miR-206 modified exosomes in vivo. In summary, these findings indicate that the hucMSCs-derived miR-206-knockdown exosomes prevent early brain injury by inhibiting apoptosis via BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling. This may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treatment of SAH-induced EBI. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","binding protein; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cAMP response element binding protein; microRNA; microRNA 206; tropomyosin; tropomyosin related receptor kinase B; unclassified drug; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain edema; brain injury; cell function; controlled study; enzyme activation; exosome; gene function; gene knockdown; genetic association; human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cell; in vivo study; male; mesenchymal stem cell; neuroapoptosis; neurologic disease; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; subarachnoid hemorrhage; umbilical cord cell line"
"A novel circular RNA, circFAT1(e2), inhibits gastric cancer progression by targeting miR-548g in the cytoplasm and interacting with YBX1 in the nucleus",2019,"In the present study, two circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles in paired gastric cancer (GC) tissues from the GEO database were examined. We identified a novel circRNA, has_circ_0001461, which we termed circFAT1(e2). We verified that circFAT1(e2) was significantly downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines and was correlated with overall survival of GC patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that circFAT1(e2) was distributed in the cytoplasm of GC cells, as well as in the nucleus. Functional assays indicated that overexpression of circFAT1(e2) inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Then, we investigated whether circFAT1(e2) acts as a sponge of microRNA-549g(miR-548g) and regulates the expression of tumor suppressor RUNX1 in GC cells. Moreover, we found that nucleus-located circFAT1(e2) could directly interact with Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1) and inhibit its function. In conclusion, circFAT1(e2) may play a role as a tumor suppressor in GC cells by regulating the miR-548g/RUNX1 axis in the cytoplasm and targeting YBX1 in the nucleus. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","circular DNA; microRNA; microRNA 548g; transcription factor RUNX1; unclassified drug; Y box binding protein 1; microRNA; MIRN548 microRNA, human; RNA; RNA, circular; RUNX1 protein, human; transcription factor RUNX1; Y box binding protein 1; YBX1 protein, human; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer tissue; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; circFAT1(e2) gene; clinical article; controlled study; correlational study; cytoplasm; down regulation; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gastric cancer cell line; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene overexpression; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; overall survival; priority journal; protein function; protein RNA binding; protein targeting; RUNX1 gene; stomach cancer; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; cell nucleus; cytoplasm; disease exacerbation; gene expression regulation; genetic database; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; signal transduction; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; tumor volume; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; Cytoplasm; Databases, Genetic; Disease Progression; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; RNA; Signal Transduction; Stomach Neoplasms; Tumor Burden; Y-Box-Binding Protein 1"
"Magnetofluorescent nanohybrid comprising polyglycerol grafted carbon dots and iron oxides: Colloidal synthesis and applications in cellular imaging and magnetically enhanced drug delivery",2019,"Multifunctional nanohybrids are attracting increasing attention for potential biomedical applications such as bioimaging and drug delivery due to their combined advantages of individual components. However, challenges in the improvement of their synthesis and colloidal stability to facilitate practical biomedical applications still remain. In this work, we report an efficient synthetic approach to fabricate magnetofluorescent nanohybrid (IO-PG-CD) comprising fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) through polyglycerol (PG) mediated covalent linkage in aqueous media. CDs and IOs are first grafted with PG layer, and then functionalized with carboxyl and amino groups, respectively. The resulting CD-PG-COOH and IO-PG-NH 2 handled as simple chemical compounds are integrated through EDC/NHS crosslinking to obtain the desired IO-PG-CD nanohybrid. The unprecedented hydrophilicity of PG layer endows IO-PG-CD nanohybrid with excellent colloidal stability in various physiological media, facilitating biomedical applications in vitro and in vivo. IO-PG-CD nanohybrid exhibits low cytotoxicity and its uptake by cells can be obviously enhanced by external magnetic attraction. The internalized IO-PG-CD nanohybrid emits multicolor fluorescence as observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating much better photostability than the nanoparticle labeled with organic dye. Taking advantage of enormous chelating carboxyl groups on the surface of IO-PG-CD nanohybrid, platinum-based anticancer drug was loaded on the surface (IO-PG-CD/Pt) through complexation and delivered into cancer cells in a magnetically enhanced manner, killing the cancer cells efficiently in vitro. Moreover, in vivo cancer therapy indicates that the external magnetic attraction also obviously improves the anticancer efficacy of IO-PG-CD/Pt in HeLa subcutaneous xenografts. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cells; Colloids; Controlled drug delivery; Crosslinking; Diseases; Drug delivery; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Grafting (chemical); Hydrophilicity; Iron oxides; Lanthanum compounds; Medical applications; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Platinum compounds; Targeted drug delivery; Bio-imaging; Biomedical applications; Colloidal synthesis; Confocal fluorescence microscopy; Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles; Multicolor fluorescence; Nano hybrids; Polyglycerols; Nanostructured materials; amine; antineoplastic metal complex; carbon dot; carboxyl group; magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; magnetofluorescent nanohybrid; nanoparticle; polyglycerol; polymer; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; carbon; carbon nanotube; ferric ion; ferric oxide; fluorescent dye; glycerol; nanoparticle; quantum dot; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; colloid; complex formation; confocal microscopy; controlled study; covalent bond; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug labeling; female; fluorescence microscopy; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; internalization; mouse; nanofabrication; nonhuman; priority journal; synthesis; transport at the cellular level; uterine cervix carcinoma; animal; cell survival; chemistry; drug screening; HeLa cell line; hydrodynamics; infrared spectroscopy; magnetic field; magnetism; microwave radiation; nanomedicine; neoplasm; nude mouse; particle size; pathology; powder; surface property; temperature; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carbon; Cell Survival; Colloids; Drug Delivery Systems; Ferric Compounds; Fluorescent Dyes; Glycerol; HeLa Cells; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hydrodynamics; Magnetic Fields; Magnetics; Mice, Nude; Microwaves; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticles; Nanotubes, Carbon; Neoplasms; Particle Size; Polymers; Powders; Quantum Dots; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Surface Properties; Temperature; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Stem cell-derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction through a novel exosome/lncRNA MALAT1/NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway",2019,"Aging is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and there is no effective therapeutic approach to alleviate this condition. NF-κB and TNF-α have been implicated in the activation of the aging process, but the signaling molecules responsible for the inactivation of NF-κB and TNF-α remain unknown. Exosomes have been reported to improve heart functions by releasing miRNA. Recent studies suggest that lncRNAs are more tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific compared to miRNA. However, the role of lncRNA in exosome-mediated cardiac repair has not been explored. In the present study, we focused on metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), which is an lncRNA associated with cell senescence. We discovered that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell- (UMSC-) derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction. Silencer RNA against lncRNA MALAT1 blocked the beneficial effects of exosomes. In summary, we discovered that UMSC-derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction by releasing novel lncRNA MALAT1, which in turn inhibits the NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway. These findings will lead to the development of therapies that delay aging and progression of age-related diseases. Copyright ? 2019 Bao Zhu et al.

"Multifunctional nanotheranostic gold nanocages for photoacoustic imaging guided radio/photodynamic/photothermal synergistic therapy",2019,"In this work, we developed a novel multifunctional nanoplatform based on hyaluronic acid modified Au nanocages (AuNCs-HA). The rational design of AuNCs-HA renders the nanoplatform three functionalities: (1) AuNCs-HA with excellent LSPR peak in the NIR region act as contrast agent for enhanced photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT); (2) the nanoplatform with high-energy rays (X-ray) absorption and auger electrons generation acts as a radiosensitizer for radiotherapy; (3) good photocatalytic property and large surface area make AuNCs-HA a photosensitive agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT). In vivo results demonstrated that AuNCs-HA presented excellent PA imaging performance after intravenous injection, which provided contour, size, and location information of the tumor. Moreover, because AuNCs-HA could combine radiotherapy and phototherapy together, the tumors treated with AuNCs-HA showed complete growth inhibition, comparing to that with each therapy alone. Taken together, our present study demonstrates that AuNCs-HA is of great potential as a multifunctional nanoplatform for PA imaging-guided radio- and photo-therapy of tumor. Statement of Significance: In this study, a commendable theranostic nanoplatform based on hyaluronic acid modified AuNCs (AuNCs-HA) was developed. In our approach, the dilute solution of Gold(III) chloride is slowly dripped into Ag nanocubes solution, then the Au nanocages were obtained by redox reaction, and followed by HA modification. We explored them, simultaneously, as radiosensitizers for RT, photosensitizers for PDT, and therapeutic agents for PTT. Compared to that of each therapies alone, the combination of radio-therapy and photo-therapy results in a considerably improved tumor eliminating effect and efficiently inhibited tumor growth. In addition, AuNCs-HA exhibited remarkably strong PA signals for precise identification of the location, size, and boundary of the tumor, thereby facilitating imaging-guided therapy. In brief, our design of AuNCs-HA represents a general and versatile strategy for building up cancer-targeted nanotheranostics with desired synergistic imaging and therapy functionalities. ? 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.","antineoplastic agent; contrast medium; gold nanoparticle; hyaluronic acid; nanocage; photosensitizing agent; radiosensitizing agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; gold; metal nanoparticle; 4T1 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; aqueous solution; Article; Auger electron spectroscopy; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; cancer radiotherapy; cell survival; cell viability; contrast enhancement; controlled study; DNA damage; drug cytotoxicity; drug distribution; drug synthesis; drug targeting; female; hydrodynamics; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; particle size; PEGylation; photoacoustics; photocatalysis; photodynamic therapy; phototherapy; photothermal therapy; priority journal; refraction index; surface area; surface property; theranostic nanomedicine; tumor volume; tumor weight; X ray absorption spectroscopy; zeta potential; animal; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; experimental mammary neoplasm; metabolism; photochemotherapy; theranostic nanomedicine; thermotherapy; Animals; Female; Gold; Hyperthermia, Induced; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Photoacoustic Techniques; Photochemotherapy; Theranostic Nanomedicine"
"Therapeutic effects of ethanolic extract from the green cocoon shell of silkworm: Bombyx mori on type 2 diabetic mice and its hypoglycaemic mechanism",2019,"Diabetes mellitus is a clinically complex disease characterized by hyperglycaemia with disturbances in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of ethanolic extract (EE) from the green cocoon sericin layer of silkworm Bombyx mori on mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its hypoglycaemic mechanisms. The results showed that oral EE for 7 weeks had significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied in vivo. The levels of oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were significantly improved. The hypoglycaemic rate in the 350 mg kg-1 high dosage group was 39.38%. The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote glycolysis. The results clearly indicated that oral EE, especially at a high dose, could improve the glucose metabolism of T2DM by reducing inflammatory reactions, enhancing the antioxidant capacity and insulin sensitivity, and regulating the balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, which means that EE has potential ameliorative effects on T2DM mice. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; glucokinase; glucose; glucose 6 phosphatase; glucose transporter 4; glutathione peroxidase; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insulin; insulin receptor; insulin receptor substrate; interleukin 6; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; malonaldehyde; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); protein kinase B; sericin; superoxide dismutase; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; blood biochemistry; body weight; Bombyx mori; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; down regulation; drug mechanism; drug megadose; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; glycolysis; hemoglobin blood level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; homeostasis model assessment; in vivo study; inflammation; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; insulin tolerance test; lipid storage; liver function; liver histology; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; oxidative stress; pancreas islet beta cell; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; protein expression level; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation"
"Eosinopenia is a predictive factor for the severity of acute ischemic stroke",2019,"Previous data have revealed an association between eosinopenia and mortality of acute ischemic stroke. However, the relationship of eosinopenia with infarct volume, infection rate, and poor outcome of acute ischemic stroke is still unknown. The retrospective study included 421 patients (273 males, 65%; mean age, 68.0 ± 13.0 years) with first acute ischemic stroke who were hospitalized in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China, from January 2017 to February 2018. Laboratory data, neuroimaging results, and modified Rankin Scale scores were collected. Patients were divided into four groups according to their eosinophil percentage level (&lt; 0.4%, 0.4-1.1%, 1.1-2.3%, ? 2.3%). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the percentage of eosinophils was negatively correlated with infarct volume (rs = -0.514, P &lt; 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that eosinopenia predicted a large infarct volume more accurately than neutrophilia; the area under curve was 0.906 and 0.876, respectively; a large infarct was considered as that with a diameter larger than 3 cm and involving more than two major arterial blood supply areas. Logistic regression analysis revealed that eosinophil percentage was an independent risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (P = 0.002). Moreover, eosinophil percentage was significantly associated with large infarct volume, high infection rate (pulmonary and urinary tract infections), and poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt; 3) after adjusting for potential confounding factors (P-trend &lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that eosinopenia has the potential to predict the severity of acute ischemic stroke.

"Long noncoding RNA FGD5-AS1 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through upregulating CDCA7 via sponging miR-302e",2019,"The biologic function as well as the mechanism of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) still remain largely unknown. Long noncoding RNA FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) has been reported to have a promotive effect on other human cancers, but its function in CRC still remains unknown. The expression levels of long noncoding RNA FGD5-AS1, CDCA7 mRNA, and miR-302e were assessed by RT-qPCR. The protein levels of CDCA7 were assessed by Western blot. The function of FGD5-AS1 was detected using cell viability assay, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, transwell, and caspase-3 activity assay. Additionally, the microRNAs (miRNAs) sponge potential of FGD5-AS1 was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation assay, RNA pull-down assay, and luciferase reporter assay. FGD5-AS1 was increased in colorectal cancer cell lines compared to normal cell lines. Inhibition of FGD5-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and accelerated cell apoptosis in CRC. FGD5-AS1 competitively bound with miR-302e to modulate CDCA7. The inhibiting effects of FGD5-AS1 knockdown on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the promoting effects on CRC cell apoptosis could be revived by miR-302e suppression or CDCA7 upregulation. LncRNA FGD5-AS1 could promote CRC progression through sponging miR-302e and upregulating CDCA7.

After gastric mucosa damage, the level of H2S in the stomach decreases. Administration of H2S can protect and repair the damaged gastric mucosa. Therefore, H2S is a new target for the repair and treatment of gastric mucosa damage. In this review, we introduce the roles of H2S in the treatment of gastric mucosa damage and provide the potential strategies for further clinical treatment. ? 2019 Medical Gas Research | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","carbon monoxide; hydrogen sulfide; nitric oxide; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; drug identification; drug mechanism; drug solubility; human; intestine blood flow; oxidative stress; priority journal; Review; stomach mucosa; stomach mucosa lesion"
"Level of serum soluble Tim-3 expression in early-phase acute pancreatitis",2019,"Background/Aims: T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) assumedly play a crucial immunomodulatory role in inflammatory response. Data on the potential role of soluble Tim-3 (sTim-3) in acute pancreatitis (AP) are scarce. We conducted a prospective clinical study to characterize its role in the early-phase AP. Methods: In total, 44 patients with AP (16 mild and 28 none-mild) who presented within 24 hours on admission and 20 healthy volunteers (NC) were included in our study. Serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and sTim-3 levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the none-mild and mild groups were significantly elevated compared with those of the NC group. The sTim-3 levels of the none-mild and mild group were significantly increased compared with the NC. The sTim-3 level positively correlated with the IL-6 and TNF-α but showed no obvious correlations with the IL-10 level. The sTim-3 level positively correlated with the APACHE II score. Conclusion: The results indicate that sTim-3 participates in the early progression of AP by positively regulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines and that the measurement of serum sTim-3 is an early marker for predicting AP. ?

"Single cell transcriptomic analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells reveals limited heterogeneity",2019,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a population of multipotent cells with a superior ability to promote tissue repair by regulating regeneration and inflammation. Effective application of MSCs in disease treatment relies on the production of relatively homogeneous cell population. However, the cellular heterogeneity and the differentiation trajectories of in vitro expanded MSCs remain largely unclear. We profiled the transcriptomes of 361 single MSCs derived from two umbilical cords (UC-MSCs). These UC-MSCs were harvested at different passages and stimulated with or without inflammatory cytokines. Weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed that UC-MSCs surprisingly possess only limited heterogeneity, regardless of donors, and passages. We also found that upon pretreatment with inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ and TNFα), a classical strategy that can improve the efficiency of MSC-based therapy, MSCs exhibited uniformed changes in gene expression. Cell cycle-based principal component analysis showed that the limited heterogeneity identified in these UC-MSCs was strongly associated with their entrance into the G2/M phase. This was further proven by the observation that one featured gene, CD168, was expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. When CD168 high UC-MSCs were sorted and cultured in vitro, they again showed similar CD168 expression patterns. Our results demonstrated that in vitro expanded UC-MSCs are a well-organized population with limited heterogeneity dominated by cell cycle status. Thus, our studies provided information for standardization of MSCs for disease treatment. ? 2019, The Author(s).","alpha interferon; transcriptome; tumor necrosis factor; Article; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell heterogeneity; cell selection; gene expression; genetic correlation; human; in vitro study; mesenchymal stem cell; next generation sequencing; priority journal; single cell analysis; transcriptomics; umbilical cord"
"Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion versus posterior laminoplasty for cervical oppressive myelopathy secondary to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: A Meta-analysis",2019,"The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical effect of anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion vs laminoplasty for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. The outcome measures included the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, neurological recovery rate, and complication rate. Subgroup A represented studies with the mean preoperative canal occupying ratio being less than 50%, whereas subgroup B represented studies with the mean canal occupying ratio being 50% or greater. In subgroup A, no difference was found between the 2 groups in the postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and neurological recovery rate. In subgroup B, the anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion group had a higher postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and neurological recovery rate.

"IGF-2 Preprograms Maturing Macrophages to Acquire Oxidative Phosphorylation-Dependent Anti-inflammatory Properties",2019,"Recent investigations revealed that macrophages could be trained with an altered responsiveness, raising the possibility of combating autoimmune diseases by imparting anti-inflammatory capabilities to these cells. While investigating the effect of mesenchymal stem cells on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we found a critical role of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) in training macrophages to become anti-inflammatory during their maturation. IGF-2 exerts its effects by preprogramming maturing macrophages to commit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). IGF-2-preprogrammed macrophages maintained the mitochondrial complex V activities even upon pro-inflammation stimulation, thus enabling an elevated programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. PD-L1 neutralization abolished the beneficial effect of IGF-2 on EAE. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of IGF-2-preprogrammed macrophages to EAE mice increased Tregs and alleviated the diseases. Our results demonstrate that shaping macrophage responsiveness by IGF-2 is effective in managing inflammatory diseases, and the OXPHOS commitment can be preset to determine the anti-inflammatory fate of macrophages. Du and Lin et al. show that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) modulates the innate immune memory of macrophages during their maturation and enables macrophages to have persistent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Such metabolic commitment allows macrophages to highly express PD-L1 even upon pro-inflammation stimulation and determines their anti-inflammatory phenotype. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","mitochondrial complex V; mitochondrial protein; programmed death 1 ligand 1; somatomedin B; unclassified drug; adoptive transfer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell maturation; controlled study; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; female; human; human cell; immunological memory; immunomodulation; inflammation; inflammatory disease; macrophage; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; regulatory T lymphocyte; upregulation"
"The Effects of Long-term CPAP on Weight Change in Patients With Comorbid OSA and Cardiovascular Disease: Data From the SAVE Trial",2019,"Background: Although recent evidence suggests that OSA treatment may cause weight gain, the long-term effects of CPAP on weight are not well established. Methods: This study was a post hoc analysis of the Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) study, a multicenter, randomized trial of CPAP plus standard care vs standard care alone in adults with a history of cardiac or cerebrovascular events and moderate to severe OSA. Participants with weight, BMI, and neck and waist circumferences measured at baseline and during follow-up were included. Linear mixed models were used to examine sex-specific temporal differences, and a sensitivity analysis compared high CPAP adherers (? 4 h per night) with propensity-matched control participants. Results: A total of 2,483 adults (1,248 in the CPAP group and 1,235 in the control group) were included (mean 6.1 ± 1.5 measures of weight available). After a mean follow-up of 3.78 years, there was no difference in weight change between the CPAP and control groups, for male subjects (mean [95% CI] between-group difference, 0.07 kg [–0.40 to 0.54]; P =.773) or female subjects (mean [95% CI] between-group difference, –0.14 kg [–0.37 to 0.09]; P =.233). Similarly, there were no significant differences in BMI or other anthropometric measures. Although male participants who used CPAP ? 4 h per night gained slightly more weight than matched male control subjects without CPAP (mean difference, 0.38 kg [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.73]; P =.031), there were no between-group differences in other anthropometric variables, nor were there any differences between female high CPAP adherers and matched control subjects. Conclusions: Long-term CPAP use in patients with comorbid OSA and cardiovascular disease does not result in clinically significant weight change.

"Translation of bone wax and its substitutes: History, clinical status and future directions",2019,"Bone wax, primarily composed of beeswax and softening agent, is a century-old material used to control bleeding of disrupted bone surfaces by acting as a mechanical barrier to seal the wound. The current bone wax products are commonly packed in easy-to-open foil in the form of sterile sticks or plates, with excellent malleability and smooth consistency, enabling cost-effective and easy handling approach for bleeding control. It has also been reported that the inert nature of bone wax causes complications including foreign body reaction, infection promotion and bone healing inhibition. With the advances in biomaterials and the market boost of bone haemostatic materials, the arena of bone wax substitute research has expanded to a wide spectrum of material formulations and forms. However, the development of substitutes of bone wax for translation is a pivotal yet challenging topic because currently a potential candidate is recommended to be just as simple to use, effective and inexpensive to produce as traditional bone wax but also be absorbable and osteogenic. This review provides an overview of bone wax including its history, clinical applications and associated complication. In addition, emerging substitutes of bone wax and outlooks of future directions including the standardised evaluation methods are also discussed as an effort to catalyse the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future. The translational potential of this article: Occurrence of osseous haemorrhage is common in surgically incised or traumatically fractured bone. It is essential to stop bone bleeding to avoid further pathologic consequences such as tissue necrosis and eventually mortalities due to blood loss. Medical sterile bone wax is a classical material for haemostasis of bone during orthopaedic surgeries, thoracic surgeries, neurological surgeries and so on. Along with its widespread use, complications such as foreign body reaction, bone healing inhibition and infection promotion associated with bone wax are observed. With the growing knowledge in biomaterials and the boost of market of bone haemostatic materials, bone wax substitute research is thriving. An overview of bone and its substitutes together with evolution of their design criteria is carried out in this work, providing information for the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future. ? 2019 The Authors","bioceramics; bone wax; calcium phosphate; chitosan; hydroxyapatite; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; microcrystalline collagen; molecular scaffold; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; angiogenesis; biological activity; bleeding; bone development; bone regeneration; cauterization; cell proliferation; compressive strength; coronary artery bypass graft; cost effectiveness analysis; discectomy; drug delivery system; drug formulation; foreign body reaction; human; hydrogel; immune response; microenvironment; ossification; osteomyelitis; postoperative complication; Review; tissue engineering; tissue necrosis; total knee arthroplasty"
"Does Prior Bariatric Surgery Improve Outcomes Following Total Joint Arthroplasty in the Morbidly Obese? A Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background: There remains a controversy regarding the risks in subsequent total joint arthroplasty (TJA) with and without previous bariatric surgery (BS). We performed a meta-analysis based on the current evidence-based study to determine the influences of prior BS on the short-term and long-term outcomes following TJA. Methods: From the inception to July 2018, the EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched for all relevant English language trials. The primary outcome measures were complications and revision, whereas the secondary outcomes included length of stay and operative time. Short-term follow-up was defined as that from hospital discharge to 90 days, and long-term follow-up was defined as more than 1 year. Results: A total of 9 studies with 38,728 patients were included. Overall, medical comorbidities were higher in the BS group compared with the control morbid obesity group before TJA. Our meta-analysis revealed that BS prior to TJA was associated with reduced short-term medical complications, length of stay, and operative time. However, BS did not reduce the short-term risks for superficial wound infection or venous thromboembolism, and the long-term risks for dislocation, periprosthetic infection, periprosthetic fracture, and revision. Subgroup analysis identified a significant reduction in the risk of short-term periprosthetic infection in the BS group after total knee arthroplasty, but not after total hip arthroplasty. Conclusion: BS prior to TJA was associated with partially improved short-term outcomes after TJA. However, BS did not improve the risks for long-term outcomes. Limited by relatively higher comorbidities burden, the short-term benefits of BS should be further revealed by high-quality, controlled study in the future. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","arthroplasty; bariatric surgery; clinical outcome; comorbidity; hospital discharge; human; joint dislocation; length of stay; meta analysis; morbid obesity; operation duration; periprosthetic fracture; periprosthetic joint infection; postoperative complication; reoperation; Review; risk reduction; total hip replacement; total joint arthroplasty; total knee arthroplasty; venous thromboembolism; wound infection; complication; hip replacement; knee replacement; morbid obesity; postoperative complication; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Bariatric Surgery; Comorbidity; Humans; Obesity, Morbid; Periprosthetic Fractures; Postoperative Complications"
"Clinical Features and Endolymphatic Hydrops in Patients With MRI Evidence of Hydrops",2019,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between grades of endolymphatic hydrops (ELH) and clinical characteristics and determine the detailed clinical characteristics of M?ni?re’s disease (MD) patients with evidence of hydrops based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: One hundred ninety-eight MD patients (396 ears) with MRI evidence of hydrops were included. ELH grades were evaluated using the Nakashima grading standard. Correlations between the extent of ELH and clinical features were evaluated. Detailed clinical characteristics were analyzed to assess the clinical diagnostic criteria. Results: Of 198 patients, ELH was observed in 100% of cases on the clinically affected side and 8.6% of cases on the asymptomatic side. In addition, 98.5% of ELH was classified as moderate or significant grade. Low-frequency hearing loss was significantly correlated with the extent of both vestibular and cochlear hydrops, whereas the vertigo attack frequency showed no significant correlation with ELH grades. The disease duration of MD with bilateral ELH was longer than that with unilateral ELH. The clinical characteristics were variant and did not completely fit the proposed diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: MRI findings have relevance to the clinical severity, to a certain extent, but not vestibular symptoms. The proposed diagnostic criteria based on clinical characteristics may be partially effective; analysis of the detailed clinical characteristics of MD was meaningful. Diagnosis of MD based on both MRI and clinical symptoms could facilitate an early diagnosis. ?

"Advance care planning improves psychological symptoms but not quality of life and preferred end-of-life care of patients with cancer",2019,"Background: This study was conducted to examine whether a longitudinal advance care planning (ACP) intervention facilitates concordance between the preferred and received life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) of terminally ill patients with cancer and improves quality of life (QoL), anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms during the dying process. Patients and Methods: Of 795 terminally ill patients with cancer from a medical center in Taiwan, 460 were recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to the experimental and control arms. The experimental arm received an interactive ACP intervention tailored to participants' readiness to engage in this process. The control arm received symptom management education. Group allocation was concealed, data collectors were blinded, and treatment fidelity was monitored. Outcome measures included 6 preferred and received LSTs, QoL, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Intervention effectiveness was evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Participants providing data had died through December 2017. The 2 study arms did not differ significantly in concordance between the 6 preferred and received LSTs examined (odds ratios, 0.966 [95% CI, 0.653-1.428] and 1.107 [95% CI, 0.690-1.775]). Participants who received the ACP intervention had significantly fewer anxiety symptoms (b, 20.583; 95% CI, 20.977 to 20.189; P5.004) and depressive symptoms (b, 20.533; 95% CI, 21.036 to 20.030; P5.038) compared with those in the control arm, but QoL did not differ. Conclusions: Our ACP intervention facilitated participants' psychological adjustment to the end-of-life (EoL) care decision-making process, but neither improved QoL nor facilitated EoL care honoring their wishes. The inability of our intervention to improve concordance may have been due to the family power to override patients' wishes in deeply Confucian doctrine-influenced societies such as Taiwan. Nevertheless, our findings reassure healthcare professionals that such an ACP intervention does not harm but improves the psychological well-being of terminally ill patients with cancer, thereby encouraging physicians to discuss EoL care preferences with patients and involve family caregivers in EoL care decision-making to eventually lead to patient value-concordant EoL cancer care. ? 2019 Harborside Press.

"Bacteria-instructed click chemistry between functionalized gold nanoparticles for point-of-care microbial detection",2019,"Bacterial infections pose mounting public health concerns and cause an enormous medical and financial burden today. Rapid and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria at the point of care (POC) remains a paramount challenge. Here, we report a novel concept of bacteriainstructed click chemistry and employ it for POC microbial sensing. In this concept of bacteria-instructed click chemistry, we demonstrate for the first time that pathogenic bacteria can capture and reduce exogenous Cu2+ to Cu+ by leveraging their unique metabolic processes. The produced Cu+ subsequently acts as a catalyst to trigger the click reaction between gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with azide and alkyne functional molecules, resulting in the aggregation of nanoparticles with a color change of the solution from red to blue. In this process, signal amplification from click chemistry is complied with the aggregation of functionalized AuNPs, thus presenting a robust colorimetric strategy for sensitive POC sensing of pathogenic bacteria. Notably, this colorimetric strategy is easily integrated in a smartphone app as a portable platform to achieve one-click detection in a mobile way. Moreover, with the help of the magnetic preseparation process, this smartphone app-assisted platform enables rapid (within 1 h) detection of Escherichia coli with high sensitivity (40 colony-forming units/mL) in the complex artificial sepsis blood samples, showing great potential for clinical early diagnosis of bacterial infections. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Agglomeration; Color; Colorimetry; Diagnosis; Escherichia coli; Fiber optic sensors; Gold nanoparticles; Metal nanoparticles; mHealth; Nanofibers; Smartphones; Synthesis (chemical); Bacterial infections; Chronic wounds; Colony forming units; Functional molecules; Functionalized gold nanoparticles; Pathogenic bacterium; Signal amplifications; Switchable; Drug delivery; copper; gold; metal nanoparticle; chemistry; click chemistry; colorimetry; Escherichia coli; genetic procedures; human; isolation and purification; limit of detection; point of care system; Biosensing Techniques; Click Chemistry; Colorimetry; Copper; Escherichia coli; Gold; Humans; Limit of Detection; Metal Nanoparticles; Point-of-Care Systems"
"DNA polymerase iota (Pol I) promotes the migration and invasion of breast cancer cell via EGFR-ERK-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition",2019,"Dysregulation of DNA polymerase iota (Pol I) in breast cancer might contribute to the accumulation of genomic mutations and promotes breast cancer progression. In this study we explored the clinical relevance and biological function of Pol I in breast cancer. METHODS: qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of Pol I in 31 breast cancer tissues. Then the stable overexpression of Pol I and knockdown of Pol I breast cancer cell lines were constructed. Wound-healing assay and transwell assay were performed to evaluate cell migratory and invasiveness, respectively. Signaling pathway was analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: The expression levels of Pol I is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and significantly higher in breast cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis compared to those without lymph node metastasis. Elevated Pol I expression promoted migratory and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Signaling pathway analysis indicated EGFR-ERK cascade works as a mediator of Pol I -induced EMT of breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the underlying mechanism by which Pol I promotes breast cancer progression, suggesting that Pol I may be a potential therapeutic target against breast cancer. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Cathepsin L activated by mutant p53 and Egr-1 promotes ionizing radiation-induced EMT in human NSCLC",2019,"Background: Ionizing radiation (IR) is one of the major clinical therapies of cancer, although it increases the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), unexpectedly. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this role are not completely understood. Methods: We used NSCLC cell lines as well as tumor specimens from 78 patients with NSCLC to evaluate p53, Cathepsin L (CTSL) and EMT phenotypic changes. Xenograft models was also utilized to examine the roles of mutant p53 (mut-p53) and CTSL in regulating IR-induced EMT of NSCLC. Results: Expression of CTSL was markedly increased in human NSCLC tissues with mutant p53 (mut-p53), and p53 mutation positively correlated with metastasis of NSCLC patients. In human non-small cell lung cancer cell line, H1299 cells transfected with various p53 lentivirus vectors, mut-p53 could promote the invasion and motility of cells under IR, mainly through the EMT. This EMT process was induced by elevating intranuclear CTSL which was regulated by mut-p53 depending on Early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1) activation. In the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model, IR promoted the EMT of the cancer cells in the presence of mut-p53, owing to increase expression and nuclear transition of its downstream protein CTSL. Conclusion: Taken together, these data reveal the role of the mut-p53/Egr-1/CTSL axis in regulating the signaling pathway responsible for IR-induced EMT. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cathepsin L; early growth response factor 1; protein p53; cathepsin L; early growth response factor 1; EGR1 protein, human; protein p53; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer survival; cell motility; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlational study; down regulation; enzyme activation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gain of function mutation; gene control; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; ionizing radiation; lung metastasis; major clinical study; male; mouse; NCI-H1299 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; oncogene; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression level; signal transduction; survival time; transcription initiation; tumor classification; tumor invasion; tumor suppressor gene; tumor xenograft; animal; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetic transfection; genetics; ionizing radiation; lung tumor; metabolism; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cathepsin L; Cell Line, Tumor; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Middle Aged; Radiation, Ionizing; Transfection; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"
"Prognostic nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines for overall survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",2019,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the association of pre-treatment inflammatory status with survival time and to develop a prognostic nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Methods: A total of 228 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) received R-CHOP-based regimens from a prospective randomized study (NCT01852435) were included as a training cohort. Other cohorts of 886 lymphoma patients were served as validation cohorts. Lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), serum levels of soluble interleukin s(IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were assessed before treatment. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables for nomogram of overall survival (OS). The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was determined by concordance index (C-index). Findings: The nomogram included lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sIL-2R, TNF-α and decreased LMR. The C-index of the nomogram for OS prediction were range from 0.61 to 0.86 for training cohort of DLBCL and validation cohorts of DLBCL, PTCL, NKTCL and ASCT, which were superior to the predictive power of International Prognostic Index (IPI, 0.67 to 0.84) or NCCN-IPI (0.59 to 0.78), but not in those of indolent lymphoma like FL and MALT. Interpretations: The nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines provides a useful tool for risk stratification in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

"Tumor Spread Through Air Spaces in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background: A series of studies have assessed the clinicopathological features and prognostic impact of spread through air spaces (STAS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) bringing conflicting findings so far. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the available evidence regarding to the prognostic value of STAS in NSCLCs. Methods: Studies were identified by searching databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to August 2018 without language restrictions. Results of these searches were filtered according to a set of eligibility criteria and analyzed in line with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: A total of 3,754 patients from 14 studies were selected for the present study. The pooled results suggested that presence of STAS was associated with worse recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.975; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.691 to 2.307; p &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.375 to 2.227; p &lt; 0.001) in NSCLCs. Subgroup analysis by histology type indicated the presence of STAS was significantly associated with inferior recurrence-free survival in resected lung adenocarcinoma (n = 7; HR, 2.288; 95% CI, 1.843 to 2.840; I2 = 7.80%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3; HR, 1.622; 95% CI, 1.279 to 2.056; I2 = 0%), and lung pleomorphic carcinoma (n = 1; HR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.168 to 19.398). Additionally, a number of clinicopathological characteristics indicating STAS in NSCLCs are summarized. Conclusions: Our study indicates that tumor STAS was a potentially significant prognostic predictor for surgical patients with NSCLCs. The prognostic impact of STAS present in the resection margin remains undetermined. Further large-scale prospective studies are warranted to confirm the prognostic significance of STAS in patients with NSCLCs. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","cancer survival; clinical outcome; human; lung adenocarcinoma; meta analysis (topic); metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; recurrence free survival; Review; squamous cell lung carcinoma; systematic review; tumor spread through air spaces; aged; cancer staging; disease exacerbation; disease free survival; female; lung tumor; male; meta analysis; metastasis; middle aged; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; pathophysiology; prognosis; risk assessment; survival analysis; tumor invasion; tumor recurrence; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease Progression; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis"
"Prognostic analysis of gastric mucosal dysplasia after endoscopic resection: A single-center retrospective study",2019,"Purpose: To analyze the prognostic factors of gastric mucosal dysplasia after endoscopic resection. Methods: 362 patients with gastric mucosal dysplasia diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy and undergoing endoscopic resection from March 2012 to March 2016 were enrolled. Follow-up was longer than 30 months. Basic characteristics of enrolled patients were recorded, including age, gender, surgical procedures, lesion location, pathological type, lesion size, Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, operation time and wound area. The relationship between the above factors and postoperative residual lesions and recurrence after endoscopic resection of gastric mucosal dysplasia was analyzed. Results: Included were 200 males and 162 females, aged 28-78 years, (mean 59.3±11.5). Operation time and wound area were not correlated with postoperative recurrence of gastric mucosal dysplasia resected by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (p>0.05). Operation time in patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was longer compared with those of controls (p=0.032). Additionally, wound area was smaller in patients with postoperative residual disease (p=0.003) and postoperative recurrence (p=0.048) after ESD compared with controls. Intestinal metaplasia was a common risk factor for postoperative residual disease and postoperative recurrence of gastric mucosal dysplasia. Lesion location and complete resection were independent risk factors for postoperative recurrence of gastric mucosal dysplasia. Also, pathological findings and HP infection were independent risk factors for recurrence of gastric mucosal dysplasia after endoscopic resection. Conclusions: In patients undergoing ESD of gastric mucosal dysplasia, prolonged operation time may increase the possibility of postoperative residual disease. Complete resection may reduce the possibility for recurrence. Intestinal metaplasia may serve as a common independent risk factor for postoperative residual disease and recurrence of gastric mucosal dysplasia after endoscopic resection. ? 2019 Zerbinis Publications.

"Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 enhances STAT3 signaling and promotes cell growth in non-small-cell lung cancer",2019,"Background and objectives: Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 (USP28) has been reported to play significant roles in several tumors, but its roles in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biological function and molecular mechanisms of USP28 in NSCLC. Materials and methods: Immunoblotting analysis was used to detect relative proteins’ expression. Luciferase assay was performed to explore the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Immunoprecipitation was performed to assess whether USP28 interacted with STAT3 or deubiquitinated STAT3. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the relative mRNA levels of STAT3 and USP28. Cycloheximide chase assay was carried out to examine whether USP28 affected the half-life of STAT3 protein. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and xenograft model were used to assess whether USP28 regulated NSCLC cell growth. Results: In this study, the deubiquitinating enzyme USP28 was found to mediate STAT3 signaling in NSCLC cells. USP28 interacted with STAT3, and increased the stability of STAT3 by inducing its deubiquitination. Further studies showed that USP28 was upregulated in both the primary tissues and cell lines of NSCLC. The Kaplan–Meier plotter also indicated that USP28 predicted a poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Moreover, knockdown of USP28 inhibited cell growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and delayed NSCLC tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that USP28 was functional in NSCLC cells, and promoted NSCLC cell growth by inducing STAT3 signaling. This suggests that USP28 could be a novel target for NSCLC therapy. ? 2019 Li et al.","cycloheximide; deubiquitinase; messenger RNA; STAT3 protein; ubiquitin specific peptidase 28; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cell growth; controlled study; deubiquitination; female; gene knockdown; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; Kaplan Meier method; luciferase assay; lung carcinogenesis; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein stability; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transcription initiation; tumor xenograft; upregulation"
"Threats of indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in six molluscs from market to food safety: A case study in Haikou City, China",2019,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) found in marine molluscs could be a serious threat to the health of consumers; however, studies on this subject are limited. To understand this threat, the indicator PCBs (PCB-28, PCB-52, PCB-101, PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153 and PCB-180) found in six different kinds of molluscs were determined, and the associated cancer risk for consumers that intake these indicator PCBs via molluscs was assessed. The total concentrations of PCBs in molluscs ranged from 17.51 to 47.43 ng/g (d.w.). The order of contamination levels for indicator PCBs in molluscs was Perna viridis &gt; Ruditapes philippinarum &gt; Crassostrea gigas &gt; Mimachlamys nobilis &gt; Glossaulax didyma &gt; Anadara antiquata. Tri-, tetra- and penta-PCBs were the dominant congeners in molluscs from Haikou City. Tetra-PCBs are the most common PCB, accounting for 38.49% of total PCBs. Compared with previous global studies on PCBs in molluscs, the pollution level of indicator PCBs in the molluscs from Haikou City was lower than most of reports in Europe and China, but higher than those from France and Korea, suggesting a moderate pollution level. The 50% and 95% cancer risks of indicator PCBs in molluscs for adult consumers were 2.75 × 10?7 and 4.32 × 10?7, indicating that the cancer risk was at an acceptable level. Since the dioxin like-PCBs were not analyzed in this study, the cancer risk of PCBs to human health might be underestimated; therefore, more studies on PCB pollution in molluscs are required. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diseases; Health risks; Marine pollution; Molluscs; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Risk assessment; Cancer risk; Contamination levels; Crassostrea gigas; Dioxin-like PCBs; Occurrence; Pollution level; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Ruditapes philippinarum; Chemical contamination; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; bioaccumulation; bioindicator; food market; food safety; health impact; health risk; marine pollution; mollusc; PCB; Anadara antiquata; animal tissue; Article; cancer risk; case study; China; concentration (parameters); consumer; controlled study; Crassostrea gigas; Europe; food intake; food safety; France; Glossaulax didyma; health hazard; Korea; Mimachlamys nobilis; mollusc; nonhuman; Perna viridis; Ruditapes philippinarum; water pollution; analysis; animal; chemistry; food contamination; human; mollusc; procedures; risk assessment; shellfish; water pollutant; China; Haikou; Hainan; Anadara antiquata; Crassostrea gigas; Mimachlamys nobilis; Mollusca; Perna viridis; Venerupis (Ruditapes) philippinarum; Animals; China; Food Contamination; Humans; Mollusca; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Risk Assessment; Shellfish; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"Correlations among Diabetic Microvascular Complications: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",2019,"Early detection of diabetic microvascular complications is of great significance for disease prognosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the correlation among diabetic microvascular complications which may indicate the importance of screening for other complications in the presence of one disorder. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched and a total of 26 cross-sectional studies met our inclusion criteria. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) had a proven risk association with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) [odds ratio (OR): 4.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.47–8.75, p < 0.01], while DKD also related to DR (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.79–3.15, p < 0.01). In addition, DR was associated with diabetic neuropathy (DN) (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.70–2.90, p < 0.01), and DN was related to DR (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19–2.51, p < 0.01). However, the risk correlation between DKD and DN was not definite. Therefore, regular screening for the other two microvascular complications in the case of one complication makes sense, especially for patients with DR. The secondary results presented some physical conditions and comorbidities which were correlated with these three complications and thus should be paid more attention. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Cluster-transition determining sites underlying the antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses",2019,"Seasonal influenza viruses undergo frequent mutations on their surface hemagglutinin (HA) proteins to escape the host immune response. In these mutations, a few key amino acid sites are associated with significant antigenic cluster transitions. To recognize the cluster-transition determining sites of seasonal influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses systematically and quickly, we developed a computational model named RECDS (recognition of cluster-transition determining sites) to evaluate the contribution of a specific amino acid site on the HA protein in the whole history of antigenic evolution. In RECDS, we ranked all of the HA sites by calculating the contribution scores derived from the forest of gradient boosting classifiers trained by various sequence- and structure-based features. With the RECDS model, we found out that the sites determining influenza antigenicity were mostly around the receptor-binding domain both for the influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses. Specifically, half of the cluster-transition determining sites of the influenza A/ H1N1 virus were located in the vestigial esterase domain and basic path area on the HA, which indicated that the differential driving force of the antigenic evolution of the A/H1N1 virus refers to the A/H3N2 virus. Beyond that, the footprints of substitutions responsible for antigenic evolution were inferred according to the phylogenetic trees for the cluster-transition determining sites. The monitoring of genetic variation occurring at these cluster-transition determining sites in circulating influenza viruses on a large scale will potentially reduce current assay workloads in influenza surveillance and the selection of new influenza vaccine strains. ?

"Clinical Features and Endolymphatic Hydrops in Patients With MRI Evidence of Hydrops",2019,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between grades of endolymphatic hydrops (ELH) and clinical characteristics and determine the detailed clinical characteristics of M?ni?re’s disease (MD) patients with evidence of hydrops based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: One hundred ninety-eight MD patients (396 ears) with MRI evidence of hydrops were included. ELH grades were evaluated using the Nakashima grading standard. Correlations between the extent of ELH and clinical features were evaluated. Detailed clinical characteristics were analyzed to assess the clinical diagnostic criteria. Results: Of 198 patients, ELH was observed in 100% of cases on the clinically affected side and 8.6% of cases on the asymptomatic side. In addition, 98.5% of ELH was classified as moderate or significant grade. Low-frequency hearing loss was significantly correlated with the extent of both vestibular and cochlear hydrops, whereas the vertigo attack frequency showed no significant correlation with ELH grades. The disease duration of MD with bilateral ELH was longer than that with unilateral ELH. The clinical characteristics were variant and did not completely fit the proposed diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: MRI findings have relevance to the clinical severity, to a certain extent, but not vestibular symptoms. The proposed diagnostic criteria based on clinical characteristics may be partially effective; analysis of the detailed clinical characteristics of MD was meaningful. Diagnosis of MD based on both MRI and clinical symptoms could facilitate an early diagnosis. ?

"Boosting the Radiosensitizing and Photothermal Performance of Cu2-xSe Nanocrystals for Synergetic Radiophotothermal Therapy of Orthotopic Breast Cancer",2019,"The small difference between tumor and normal tissues in their responses to ionizing radiation has been a significant issue for radiotherapy of tumors. Herein, we report that dumbbell-shaped heterogeneous copper selenide-gold nanocrystals can serve as an efficient radiosensitizer for enhanced radiotherapy. The mean lethal dose of X-rays to 4T1 tumor cells can be drastically decreased about 40%, that is, decreasing from 1.81 to 1.10 Gy after culture with heterostructures. Due to the synergetic effect of heterostructures, the dose of X-rays is also much lower than those obtained from mixture of Cu2-xSe + Au nanoparticles (1.78 Gy), Cu2-xSe nanoparticles (1.72 Gy) and Au nanoparticles (1.50 Gy), respectively. We demonstrate that the sensitivity enhancement ratio of Cu2-xSe nanoparticles was significantly improved 45% (i.e., from 1.1 to 1.6) after the formation of heterostructures with gold. We also show that the heteronanocrystals exhibit an enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency, due to the synergetic interactions of localized surface plasmon resonance. These properties highly feature them as a multimodal imaging contrast agent (particularly for photoacoustic imaging, computed tomography imaging, and single photon emission computed tomography after labeled with radioisotopes) and as a radiosensitizer for imaging guided synergetic radiophotothermal treatment of cancer. The research provides insights for engineering low-Z nanomaterials with high-Z elements to form heteronanostructures with enhanced synergetic performance for tumor theranostics. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Diseases; Gold nanoparticles; Ionizing radiation; Nanocrystals; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Particle beams; Radiotherapy; Selenium compounds; Single photon emission computed tomography; Surface plasmon resonance; Tumors; X rays; Heterogeneous nanoparticles; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Multi-modal imaging; Photothermal conversion efficiencies; Photothermal therapy; Radiosensitizers; Sensitivity enhancements; Synergetic interactions; Copper compounds"
"Temporal cross-correlations between ambient air pollutants and seasonality of tuberculosis: A time-series analysis",2019,"The associations between ambient air pollutants and tuberculosis seasonality are unclear. We assessed the temporal cross-correlations between ambient air pollutants and tuberculosis seasonality. Monthly tuberculosis incidence data and ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), ozone (O3 ), sulfur dioxide (SO2 )) and air quality index (AQI) from 2013 to 2017 in Shanghai were included. A cross-correlogram and generalized additive model were used. A 4-month delayed effect of PM2.5 (0.55), PM10 (0.52), SO2 (0.47), NO2 (0.40), CO (0.39), and AQI (0.45), and a 6-month delayed effect of O3 (?0.38) on the incidence of tuberculosis were found. The number of tuberculosis cases increased by 8%, 4%, 18%, and 14% for a 10 ?g/m3 increment in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2; 4% for a 10 unit increment in AQI; 8% for a 0.1 mg/m3 increment in CO; and decreased by 4% for a 10 ?g/m3 increment in O3 . PM2.5 concentrations above 50 ?g/m3, 70 ?g/m3 for PM10, 16 ?g/m3 for SO2, 47 ?g/m3 for NO2, 0.85 mg/m3 for CO, and 85 for AQI, and O3 concentrations lower than 95 ?g/m3 were positively associated with the incidence of tuberculosis. Ambient air pollutants were correlated with tuberculosis seasonality. However, this sort of study cannot prove causality. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Utility of CT assessment in hematology patients with invasive aspergillosis: A post-hoc analysis of phase 3 data",2019,"Background: Pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used as part of the clinical criteria in diagnostic workup of invasive fungal diseases like invasive aspergillosis, and may identify radiographic abnormalities, such as halo signs or air-crescent signs. We assessed the diagnostic utility of CT assessment in patients with hematologic malignancies or those who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in whom invasive aspergillosis was suspected. Methods: This post-hoc analysis assessed data from a prospective, multicenter, international trial of voriconazole (with and without anidulafungin) in patients with suspected invasive aspergillosis (IA; proven, probable, or possible, using 2008 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria) [NCT00531479]. Eligible patients received at least one baseline lung CT scan. Results: Of 395 patients included in this post-hoc analysis, 240 patients (60.8%) had 'confirmed' proven (9/240, 3.8%) or probable (231/240, 96.3%) invasive aspergillosis (cIA) and 155 patients (39.2%) had 'non-confirmed' invasive aspergillosis (all nIA; all possible IA (de Pauw et al., Clin Infect Dis 46:1813-21, 2008)). Mean age was 52.3 and 50.5 years, 56.3 and 60.0% of patients were male, and most patients were white (71.7 and 71.0%) in the cIA and nIA populations, respectively. Median baseline galactomannan was 1.4 (cIA) and 0.2 (nIA), mean Karnofsky score was 65.3 (cIA) and 66.8 (nIA), and mean baseline platelet count was 48.0 (cIA) and 314.1 (nIA). Pulmonary nodules (46.8% of all patients), bilateral lung lesions (37.5%), unilateral lung lesions (28.4%), and consolidation (24.8%) were the most common radiographic abnormalities. Ground-glass attenuation (cIA: 24.2%; nIA: 11.6%; P < 0.01) and pulmonary nodules (cIA: 52.5%; nIA: 38.1%; P < 0.01) were associated with cIA. Other chest CT scan abnormalities (including halo signs and air-crescent signs) at baseline in patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and suspected IA, were not associated with cIA. Conclusions: These findings highlight the limitations in the sensitivity of chest CT scans for the diagnosis of IA, and reinforce the importance of incorporating other available clinical data to guide management decisions on individual patients, including whether empirical treatment is reasonable, pending full evaluation. ? 2019 The Author(s).","anidulafungin; galactomannan; voriconazole; anidulafungin; galactomannan; mannan; voriconazole; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; Caucasian; clinical effectiveness; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic value; double blind procedure; female; gender; hematologic malignancy; human; invasive aspergillosis; Karnofsky Performance Status; lung lesion; lung nodule; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; phase 3 clinical trial; platelet count; post hoc analysis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; blood; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; hematologic disease; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; invasive aspergillosis; lung; microbiology; mortality; pathology; procedures; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Anidulafungin; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis; Karnofsky Performance Status; Lung; Male; Mannans; Middle Aged; Platelet Count; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Voriconazole"
"The application of induced pluripotent stem cells in pathogenesis study and gene therapy for vascular disorders: Current progress and future challenges",2019,"Vascular disorders are complex diseases with high morbidity and mortality. Among them, the dilated macrovascular diseases (MVD), such as aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, have presented a huge threat to human health. The pathogenesis of vascular diseases is mostly associated with property alteration of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Studies have confirmed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be proliferated and differentiated into other somatic cells, such as VECs and VSMCs. And patient-specific cells could provide detailed human-associated information in regard to pathogenesis or drug responses. In addition, differentiated ECs from iPSC have been widely used in disease modeling as a cell therapy. In this review, we mainly discussed the application of hiPSCs in investigating the pathological mechanism of different inherited vascular diseases and provide a comprehensive understanding of hiPSCs in the field of clinical diagnosis and gene therapy.

"Fabrication of H2O2-driven nanoreactors for innovative cancer treatments",2019,"The increased production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a typical feature of cancerous cells. This feature is closely associated with elevated oxidative stress inside solid tumour microenvironments, which thus impairs either the growth of cancer cells or their sensitivity to many cancer therapeutics. To date, numerous innovative strategies that target tumour H2O2 have been designed for effective cancer treatment. More recently, with the rapid advancement of nanomedicine, several nanoreactors, which are highly efficient in converting endogenous H2O2 to more toxic reactive oxygen species, promoting in situ H2O2, or decomposing endogenous H2O2 to molecular oxygen for tumour hypoxia attenuation, have been designed and attempted for effective cancer treatment. This review focuses on the latest progress of such innovative H2O2-driven nanoreactor-mediated cancer treatments. Afterwards, future perspectives on the development of tumour H2O2-driven nanoreactor-mediated cancer treatments and their potential clinical translations will be discussed. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Hydrogen production; Medical nanotechnology; Molecular oxygen; Nanoreactors; Tumors; Cancer therapeutics; Cancerous cells; Clinical translation; Future perspectives; Innovative strategies; Microenvironments; Production of hydrogen; Reactive oxygen species; Diseases; hydrogen peroxide; nanomaterial; animal; art; human; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; Animals; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Nanostructures; Neoplasms; Portraits as Topic"
"Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib versus TACE alone for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A propensity score matching study",2019,"Objective: To compare the outcomes of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib versus TACE alone for treating patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This retrospective analysis included all patients receiving either TACE plus sorafenib therapy or TACE alone for unresectable HCC between February 2008 and August 2015 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China. Propensity score matching (PSM) was carried out to reduce bias due to confounding variables. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), calculated from the date of the first TACE treatment until the date of death of any cause. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted to examine determinants of OS. Results: A total of 308 patients were included in the study: 61 receiving TACE plus sorafenib treatment and 247 receiving TACE monotherapy. The PSM cohort included 61 subjects receiving TACE plus sorafenib and 122 subjects receiving TACE alone. In the overall analysis that included all patients, the median OS in the combination group was significantly longer than that in the monotherapy group (29.0 ± 7.2 vs. 14.9 ± 1.1 months; P = 0.008). In the PCM cohort, the median OS was also significantly longer in the combination group (29.0 ± 7.2 vs. 14.9 ± 1.5 months; P = 0.018). Subgroup analysis revealed longer OS in patients receiving combination treatment in both the BCLC-B and BCLC-C subgroups (P < 0.05 for both). Multivariate analyses in the PSM cohort revealed that treatment methods (P = 0.003), number of nodules (P = 0.010), tumor size (P = 0.012), vascular invasion (P = 0.005), and number of TACE (P = 0.029) were independent prognostic factors of OS. The most common adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (75.4%) and diarrhea (47.5%) in the combination group, and fatigue (19.0%) and liver dysfunction (18.2%) in the monotherapy group. There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. Conclusion: The combined use of TACE and sorafenib is generally well tolerated and could significantly increase OS of patients with unresectable HCC. ? Ivyspring International Publisher.

"Low-toxicity transferrin-guided polymersomal doxorubicin for potent chemotherapy of orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies. The current chemotherapy with typically low tumor uptake and high toxicity reveals a poor anti-HCC efficacy. Here, we report transferrin-guided polycarbonate-based polymersomal doxorubicin (Tf-Ps-Dox) as a low-toxic and potent nanotherapeutic agent for effective treatment of liver tumor using a transferrin receptor (TfR)-positive human liver tumor SMMC-7721 model. Tf-Ps-Dox was facilely fabricated with small size of ca. 75 nm and varying Tf densities from 2.2% to 7.0%, by postmodification of maleimide-functionalized Ps-Dox (Dox loading content of 10.6 wt%) with thiolated transferrin. MTT assays showed that Tf-Ps-Dox had an optimal Tf surface density of 3.9%. The cellular uptake, intracellular Dox level, and anticancer efficacy of Tf-Ps-Dox to SMMC-7721 cells were inhibited by supplementing free transferrin, which supports that Tf-Ps-Dox is endocytosed through TfR. Interestingly, Tf-Ps-Dox exhibited a high accumulation of 8.5%ID/g (percent injected dose per gram of tissue) in subcutaneous SMMC-7721 tumors, which was 2- and 3-fold higher than that of nontargeted Ps-Dox and clinically used liposomal Dox formulation (Lipo-Dox), respectively. The median survival times of mice bearing orthotopic SMMC-7721 tumors increased from 82, 88 to 96 days when treated with Tf-Ps-Dox at Dox doses from 8, 12 to 16 mg/kg, which was significantly longer than that of Ps-Dox at 8 mg/kg (58 days) and Lipo-Dox at 4 mg/kg (48 days) or PBS (36 days). Notably, unlike Lipo-Dox, no body weight loss and damage to major organs could be discerned for all Tf-Ps-Dox groups, indicating that Tf-Ps-Dox caused low systemic toxicity. This transferrin-dressed polymersomal doxorubicin provides a potent and low-toxic treatment modality for human hepatocellular carcinoma. Statement of Significance: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Vast work has focused on developing HCC-targeted nanotherapeutics. However, none of the nanotherapeutics has advanced to clinics, partly because the ligands used have not been validated in patients. Transferrin (Tf) is a natural ligand for transferrin receptor (TfR) that is overexpressed on cancerous cells, and it is currently under clinical trials (MBP-426 and CALAA-01) for the treatment of solid tumors. We designed Tf-functionalized polymersomal doxorubicin (Tf-Ps-Dox) for targeted therapy of orthotopic SMMC-7721 tumor in nude mice. Tf-Ps-Dox showed potent anti-HCC efficacy and significantly improved survival time with low toxicity as compared with nontargeted Ps-Dox and clinical liposomal Dox (Lipo-Dox). Hence, Tf-Ps-Dox is very appealing for targeted treatment of HCC. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","doxorubicin; polycarbonate; transferrin; animal experiment; animal model; Article; drug distribution; drug efficacy; drug uptake; female; human; human cell; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; SMMC-7721 cell line"
"Identification of a Novel Bcl-2 Inhibitor by Ligand-Based Screening and Investigation of Its Anti-cancer Effect on Human Breast Cancer Cells",2019,"Bcl-2 family protein is an important factor in regulating apoptosis and is associated with cancer. The anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2, are overexpression in numerous tumors, and contribute to cancer formation, development, and therapy resistance. Therefore, Bcl-2 is a promising target for drug development, and several Bcl-2 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials. In this study, we carried out a QSAR-based virtual screening approach to develop potential Bcl-2 inhibitors from the SPECS database. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay was performed to examine the interaction between Bcl-2 protein and the screened inhibitors. After that, we measured the anti-tumor activities of the 8 candidate compounds, and found that compound M1 has significant cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cells. We further proved that compound M1 downregulated Bcl-2 expression and activated apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, we identified a novel Bcl-2 inhibitor by QSAR screening, which exerted significant cytotoxic activity in breast cancer cells through inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. ? 2019 Wen, Deng, Jiang, Guan, Wu, Wang, Xiao, Zhang, Yang, Cao and Cheng.

"Risk of fracture with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in real-world use: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies",2019,"Summary: In the present meta-analysis based on real-world data, the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1ra), or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) was not associated with the risk of fracture. Introduction: Cumulative evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) with limited fracture events showed that the use of DPP-4i, GLP-1ra, or SGLT2i may not affect the risk of fracture. However, additional insights from large population-based studies with routinely collected data on fracture events and an adequate amount of fracture events are necessary to draw firm conclusions. To refine and complement the results from RCTs, a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies were performed to investigate the association between the use of DPP-4i, GLP-1ra, or SGLT2i and the risk of fracture in real-world settings. Methods: The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant observational studies. A random-effect model was used to estimate the summary relative risks (RRs). Results: The use of DPP-4i (RR 0.83, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.60, 1.14; n = 11), GLP-1ra (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.24, 1.74; n = 4), or SGLT2i (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91, 1.16; n = 4) was not associated with the risk of fracture. In general, there was a consistent lack of association between the use of DPP-4i or GLP-1ra and the risk of fracture across nearly all subgroups, except for a significantly reduced risk of hip fracture with the use of GLP-1ra (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04, 0.98). Conclusions: Cumulative real-world evidence does not support an association between the use of DPP-4i, GLP-1ra, or SGLT2i and the risk of fracture. Our findings, together with the cumulative evidence from RCTs, should reassure policy makers and medical practitioners that the use of these medications is unlikely to increase the risk of fracture among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in general. Further studies need to investigate the long-term impact of these drugs on the fracture risk, particularly in high-risk populations. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","albiglutide; alkaline phosphatase; alogliptin; anagliptin; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; ertugliflozin; exendin 4; gliclazide; glimepiride; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin glargine; insulin lispro; linagliptin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; metformin; phosphate; saxagliptin; semaglutide; sitagliptin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; vildagliptin; adverse drug reaction; alkaline phosphatase blood level; calcium blood level; drug use; forearm fracture; fracture; fragility fracture; high risk population; hip fracture; human; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phosphate blood level; priority journal; radius fracture; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk reduction; side effect; spine fracture; systematic review; ulna fracture"
"Effects of miR-106b-3p on cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and targeting of ZNRF3 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRs) is frequently associated with cancer progression. Deregulation of miR-106b-3p has been observed in various types of human cancer. However, the biological function of miR-106b-3p in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC ) remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-106b-3p in ESCC. In the current study, the results indicated that miR-106b-3p was upregulated in ESCC cell lines and tissues. An increase in miR-106b-3p using miR mimics significantly promoted the proliferation of ESCC cells in vitro. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that miR-106b-3p overexpression promoted migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ESCC cells. In addition, zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) was identified as a target of miR-106b-3p in ESCC cells, and the ZNRF3 expression level was inversely associated with miR-106b-3p. It was also demonstrated that miR-106b-3p has a role in EMT by regulating Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway in ESCC. In conclusion, these data suggested that miR-106b-3p promotes cell proliferation and invasion, partially by downregulating ZNRF3 and inducing EMT via Wnt/?-catenin signaling in ESCC cells. Thus, miR-106b-3p and ZNRF3 may be novel molecular targets for the future treatment of ESCC . ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Dual PI3K-BRD4 inhibitor SF1126 inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo",2019,"Background/Aims: Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are key oncogenic cascades in colorectal cancer (CRC). SF1126 is a novel and potent PI3K-BRD4 dual inhibitor. Methods: CRC cells and human colon epithelial cells were treated with SF1126. Cell survival was tested by MTT and soft agar colony formation assays. Cell proliferation was tested by BrdU ELISA method. Cell apoptosis was tested by a TUNEL staining method and Histone DNA ELISA. Western blotting was utilized to test the signaling proteins. A HT-29 xenograft mice model was established to study the anti-tumor activity of SF1126 in vivo. Results: SF1126 potently inhibited the survival, proliferation, and progression of the cell cycle in an established CRC cell line (HT-29) and primary human colon cancer cells. Significant activation of apoptosis was detected in SF1126-treated CRC cells. In CRC cells, SF1126 blocked Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex1/2 signaling and downregulated BRD4 target proteins (Myc and cyclin D1). Further studies showed that SF1126 activated p38 signaling in CRC cells. In contrast, the p38 inhibitors or p38 short hairpin RNA inhibited SF1126-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in CRC cells. In vivo, subcutaneous administration of SF1126 significantly inhibited HT-29 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Conclusion: SF1126 inhibits CRC cell growth possibly by targeting PI3K-Akt-mTOR, BRD4, and p38 signaling. ? 2019 The Author(s).","bromodomain containing protein 4; cyclin D1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; Myc protein; protein kinase B; transcription factor; unclassified drug; [1 (4 oxo 8 phenyl 4h 1 benzopyran 2 yl)morpholinio]methoxysuccinylarginylglycylaspartylserine acetate; BRD4 protein, human; chromone derivative; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; mitogen activated protein kinase 14; nuclear protein; oligopeptide; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; small interfering RNA; transcription factor; [1 (4 oxo 8 phenyl 4h 1 benzopyran 2 yl)morpholinio]methoxysuccinylarginylglycylaspartylserine acetate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; cell survival; colon epithelium; colorectal cancer; controlled study; down regulation; drug cytotoxicity; drug potency; drug targeting; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; tumor xenograft; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell cycle checkpoint; colorectal tumor; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; RNA interference; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chromones; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2; Mice; Mice, Nude; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14; Nuclear Proteins; Oligopeptides; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Transplantation, Heterologous"
"Long noncoding RNA MIR155HG facilitates pancreatic cancer progression through negative regulation of miR-802",2019,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) present the key regulatory functions in tumorigenesis. More and more studies have suggested that lncRNA MIR155HG is involved in different human cancers. However, the underlying regulatory role of lncRNA MIR155HG and potential mechanisms in pancreatic cancer (PC) remain illusive. In this research, our group found that lncRNA MIR155HG expression was remarkably increased in PC tumor tissue and cells compared to that in the adjacent normal tissue and cells. In addition, higher MIR155HG expression was positively associated with the poor prognosis of patients. In addition, we exhibited that silence of MIR155HG by short hairpin RNA knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth and promoted cell apoptosis in PC cells. We performed bioinformatics analysis to search for the target of MIR155HG. As demonstrated by Luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-802, a tumor suppressor in various cancer, is a direct target of MIR155HG. We demonstrated that the tumor-promoting effects of MIR155HG were contributed by negative regulation of miR-802 in PC cells. In summary, our results suggest that lncRNA MIR155HG might be applied as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for PC. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","long noncoding RNA mir155hg; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 802; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; adult; apoptosis; Article; binding site; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle S phase; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; down regulation; gene knockdown; gene silencing; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; middle aged; mRNA expression level; pancreas cancer; percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; tumor promotion; tumor suppressor gene; upregulation"
"Surrogate-assisted retinal OCT image classification based on convolutional neural networks",2019,"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is beco-ming one of the most important modalities for the noninvasive assessment of retinal eye diseases. As the number of acquired OCT volumes increases, automating the OCT image analysis is becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, we propose a surrogate-assisted classification method to classify retinal OCT images automatically based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Image denoising is first performed to reduce the noise. Thresholding and morphological dilation are applied to extract the masks. The denoised images and the masks are then employed to generate a lot of surrogate images, which are used to train the CNN model. Finally, the prediction for a test image is determined by the average of the outputs from the trained CNN model on the surrogate images. The proposed method has been evaluated on different databases. The results (AUC of 0.9783 in the local database and AUC of 0.9856 in the Duke database) show that the proposed method is a very promising tool for classifying the retinal OCT images automatically. ? 2013 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Convolution; Database systems; Diseases; Image classification; Learning systems; Neural networks; Noninvasive medical procedures; Ophthalmology; Optical tomography; Convolutional neural network; ensemble; Informatics; Retina; surrogateassisted; Image denoising; accuracy; algorithm; Article; data analysis; data base; image analysis; information processing; nerve cell network; noise reduction; optical coherence tomography; performance; predictive value; retina disease; sensitivity and specificity; subretinal neovascularization; artificial neural network; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; human; optical coherence tomography; procedures; retina; retina disease; Algorithms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks (Computer); Retina; Retinal Diseases; Tomography, Optical Coherence"
"Radon induced mitochondrial dysfunction in human bronchial epithelial cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition with long-term exposure",2019,"Radon is a naturally occurring radionuclide, which has a wide environmental distributed. It emits multiple high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha particles during radiative decay, and has been regarded as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Currently, residential radon exposure is considered as the second highest cause of lung cancer and the leading cause among nonsmokers. Radon exposure leads to genomic instability, which causes the accumulation of multiple genetic changes and leads to cancer development. However, the molecular basis underlying carcinogenesis, especially the radon-induced changes to mitochondria, has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the dynamic changes in mitochondria along with the cell transformations induced by long-term radon exposure. A malignant transformation model of BEAS-2B cells was established with upto 40 times the usual radon exposure (20000 Bq m -3 , 30 min each time every 3 days). Long-term radon exposure induced EMT-like transformation of epithelial cells in our study, evidenced by decrease in epithelial markers and increase in mesenchymal markers, as well as the loss of cell-cell adhesion and alterations to the morphology of cells from compact shape to a spindle shaped, fibroblast-like morphology. Additionally, the proliferation and migration of cells were increased and apoptosis was decreased with long-term radon exposure. Furthermore, mitochondrial function was up-regulated and the levels of oxidative stress were repressed with long-term radon exposure. Our work explored the dynamic changes of mitochondrial in radon induced malignant transformation of lung bronchial epithelial cells, which could partially elucidate the role of mitochondria in radon induced cell malignancy. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","cytochrome c; nerve cell adhesion molecule; radon; RNA 12S; RNA 18S; uvomorulin; vimentin; apoptosis; Article; BEAS-2B cell line; carcinogenesis; cell adhesion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; environmental exposure; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelium cell; fibroblast; flow cytometry; genomic instability; human; human cell; long term exposure; lung epithelium; mitochondrion; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation"
"Mutations of genes including DNMT3A detected by next-generation sequencing in thyroid cancer",2019,"More than 90% of thyroid cancer belongs to the papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas based on pathological subtypes. Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma are generally associated with a good prognosis. In contrast, other pathological subtypes such as poorly-differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (PDTC and ATC) have a poor clinical outcome with a short life expectancy. To identify the genetic variations and biomarkers that may potentially distinguish the aggressive form of thyroid cancer, we performed a retrospective analysis of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 50 patients who mainly displayed aggressive thyroid cancer using next-generation sequencing of 416 solid tumor-related genes. We adopted extensive bioinformatic analysis to vigorously remove germline single-nucleotide polymorphism and systematic sequencing errors, and report here that mutation in DNMT3A gene was significantly enriched in patients with PDTC or ATC. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","antineoplastic agent; DNA methyltransferase 3A; formaldehyde; glutamine; glycine; radioactive iodine; tumor marker; adult; anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; Article; bioinformatics; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; differentiated thyroid cancer; distant metastasis; female; gene frequency; gene mutation; genetic variation; germline mutation; human; indel mutation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; next generation sequencing; overall survival; paraffin embedding; poorly differentiated thyroid cancer; single nucleotide polymorphism; thyroid carcinoma; thyroid follicular carcinoma; thyroid medullary carcinoma; thyroid papillary carcinoma"
"Detection of NO2 Down to One ppb Using Ion-in-Conjugation-Inspired Polymer",2019,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emission has severe impact on human health and the ecological environment and effective monitoring of NO2 requires the detection limit (limit of detection) of several parts-per-billion (ppb). All organic semiconductor-based NO2 sensors fail to reach such a level. In this work, using an ion-in-conjugation inspired-polymer (poly(3,3′-diaminobenzidine-squarine, noted as PDBS) as the sensory material, NO2 can be detected as low as 1 ppb, which is the lowest among all reported organic NO2 sensors. In addition, the sensor has high sensitivity, good reversibility, and long-time stability with a period longer than 120 d. Theoretical calculations reveal that PDBS offers unreacted amine and zwitterionic groups, which can offer both the H-bonding and ion-dipole interaction to NO2. The moderate binding energies (?0.6 eV) offer high sensitivity, selectivity as well as good reversibility. The results demonstrate that the ion-in-conjugation can be employed to greatly improve sensitivity and selectivity in organic gas sensors by inducing both H-bonding and ion-dipole attraction. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"The effect of overexpression of the enhancer zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) gene on aristolochic acid-induced injury in HK-2 human kidney proximal tubule cells in vitro",2019,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) involves the renal tubular epithelium. The enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) gene has a role in cell development and differentiation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of overexpression of the EZH1 gene on aristolochic acid-induced injury in HK-2 human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells in vitro. The HK-2 cells were cultured and treated with aristolochic acid and the effects of aristolochic acid-injury were evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Overexpression of EZH1 used gene plasmid transfection into HK-2 cells. The cell apoptosis rate and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to determine the expressions of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), apoptosis-related genes, and the downstream target genes of NF-kB signaling pathway, including NFKBIA, CXCL8, and cyclin D1. Aristolochic acid inhibited HK-2 cell viability, induced cell apoptosis, increased the levels of ROS and inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and activated the NF-kB pathway. Overexpression the EZH1 gene inhibited HK-2 cell apoptosis, reduced ROS levels, and down-regulated the expressions of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, Bax and Cyt C mRNA and protein, and increased the expressions of Bcl-2 and NFKBIA, CXCL8 and cyclin D1, indicating that overexpression of EZH1 suppressed NF-kB signaling in aristolochic acid-injured HK-2 cells.

"Prevalence of amblyopia and strabismus in Hani school children in rural southwest China: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Purpose To determine the prevalence rate of amblyopia and strabismus in Chinese Hani ethnic school-aged children. Methods All grade 1 and grade 7 students in Mojiang Hani Autonomous County, located in southwest China, were invited for comprehensive eye examinations performed by experienced ophthalmologists and optometrists, including visual acuity, ocular alignment and movements, cycloplegic autorefraction, anterior segment and fundus examinations. Standard definitions of amblyopia and strabismus were applied to calculate their prevalence rate. Results A total of 1656 (91.0% response rate) grade 1 Hani students and 1394 (92.8% response rate) grade 7 Hani students participated in the study. Amblyopia was present in 25 Hani students (0.82%, 95% CI 0.55% to 1.20%), with no significant differences in grade (p=0.42) and gender (p=0.69). Among these 25 amblyopic children, 17 had unilateral amblyopia and eight had bilateral amblyopia, including 16 anisometropic, eight binocular refractive and one strabismic. Strabismus was found in 59 Hani students (1.93%, 95% CI 1.50% to 2.48%), including 47 with intermittent exotropia, six with constant exotropia, five with constant esotropia and one with unilateral superior oblique palsy. The prevalence rate of strabismus was higher in grade 7 students than grade 1 students with borderline significance (2.44%vs1.50%, p=0.07), but was similar by gender (2.16% in boys vs 1.68% in girls, p=0.36). Conclusion The prevalence of amblyopia and strabismus in Chinese Hani school children are both lower than that previously reported for Chinese Han children in China and for many other racial/ethnic populations from non-China studies. Refractive error is the major cause for amblyopia and intermittent exotropia is the primary strabismus type. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"A liver-chip-based alcoholic liver disease model featuring multi-non-parenchymal cells",2019,"Non-parenchymal cells play a key role in the occurrence and development of alcoholic liver disease. However, this cellular behaviour has not been fully characterized, and it is inconvenient to observe in traditional in vitro alcoholic liver disease (ALD) models and animal models. Herein we developed a demountable liver-on-chip device for investigation of pathophysiological process of individual non-parenchymal cells in alcohol induced ALD. This liver-device comprised of HepG2, LX-2, EAhy926 and U937 cells, which were ordered in a physiological distribution under perfuse. This device allows improved HepG2 cells activities and maintained high liver functions which including albumin synthesis and urea secretion. This novel liver-device is able to recreate the damage process of hepatic non-parenchymal cell lines induced by alcohol, and to understand the intercellular communication between different types of hepatic cells during ALD by measuring multiple biomarkers of each types of hepatic non-parenchymal cell lines, including Ve-cadherin, eNOS, VEGF and α-SMA. The proposed liver-device is able to further studies of pathological analysis and drug- and toxicity-screening. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cell culture; Urea; Intercellular communications; Liver disease; Liver functions; Multiple biomarkers; On-chip devices; Parenchymal cells; Pathological analysis; Pathophysiological; Diagnosis; albumin; alcohol; alpha smooth muscle actin; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; reactive oxygen metabolite; urea; vascular endothelial cadherin; vasculotropin; biological marker; alcohol liver disease; Article; cell communication; cell damage; cell structure; cell survival; EA.hy 926 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; immunofluorescence microscopy; in vitro study; liver function; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; surface property; tight junction; U-937 cell line; alcohol liver disease; cell line; devices; liver; metabolism; pathology; tissue microarray; Biomarkers; Cell Line; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Tissue Array Analysis"
"Cannabinoid Receptor 2 Agonist Prevents Local and Systemic Inflammatory Bone Destruction in Rheumatoid Arthritis",2019,"Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) has been implicated as an important clinical regulator of inflammation and malignant osteolysis. Here, we observed that CB2 expression was markedly higher in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice synovium and bone tissues than in the noninflamed synovium and bone tissues. The CB2 selective agonist (JWH133) but not antagonist (SR144528) suppressed CIA in mice without toxic effects, as demonstrated by the decreased synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory responses, cartilage damage, and periarticular and systemic bone destruction. JWH133 treatment decreased the infiltration of pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages and repolarized macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. Similarly, activation of CB2 increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-6. In addition, JWH133 treatment attenuated osteoclast formation and osteoclastic bone resorption, and reduced the expression of receptor activators of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), and nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFAT-1) in CIA mice and osteoclast precursors, which were obviously blocked by pretreatment with SR144528. Mechanistically, JWH133 inhibited RANKL-induced NF-κB activation in the osteoclast precursors. We found that JWH133 ameliorates pathologic bone destruction in CIA mice via the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and modulation of inflammatory responses, thereby highlighting its potential as a treatment for human rheumatoid arthritis. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research","1 deoxy 3 (1,1 dimethylbutyl) delta8 tetrahydrocannabinol; 5 (4 chloro 3 methylphenyl) 1 (4 methylbenzyl) n (1,3,3 trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan 2 yl) 3 pyrazolecarboxamide; acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; antirheumatic agent; cathepsin K; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; osteocalcin; osteoclast differentiation factor; transcription factor NFAT; transcription factor NFAT1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone density; bone marrow cell; bone mass; collagen-induced arthritis; comparative study; connectivity density; controlled study; disease severity; drug safety; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; joint destruction; macrophage; macrophage activation; male; micro-computed tomography; mouse; nonhuman; osteoclast; osteoclastogenesis; osteolysis; phenotype; polarization; prophylaxis; real time polymerase chain reaction; rheumatoid arthritis; trabecular bone"

"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) plays an important role in neonatal infection",2019,"Objective: To explore the expression and function of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins NOD1 and NOD2 and provide guidance for prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal infection. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from preterm infants, term infants and, healthy adult volunteers. A portion of collected blood was used to examine the expression of NOD1 and NOD2 by real-time PCR. The remaining blood was stimulated in vitro with NOD2 agonist L-Ala-D-Glu-meso (Tri-DAP) or NOD1 agonist muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGln; MDP) for 4 h. Consequently, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: NOD1 expression was found to be decreased in preterm and term newborns compared with adults. NOD2 was significantly lower in preterm infants alone in comparison with adults. After treated by Tri-DAP or MDP, the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in peripheral blood were significantly lower in preterm and term newborns when comparing to adults. Conclusion: NOD1 and NOD2 expression and induced release of pro-inflammatory mediators were impaired in infants, contributing to the high susceptibility of infants to infection. Our results insisted on developing a new immunological approach for prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal infection. ? 2018","caspase recruitment domain protein 15; caspase recruitment domain protein 4; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; tumor necrosis factor; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; caspase recruitment domain protein 4; interleukin 6; lymphotoxin; messenger RNA; NOD1 protein, human; NOD2 protein, human; Article; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine release; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; in vitro study; male; mRNA expression level; newborn; newborn infection; prematurity; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; adult; blood; disease predisposition; gene expression regulation; genetics; infection; metabolism; Adult; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infection; Interleukin-6; Lymphotoxin-alpha; Male; Nod1 Signaling Adaptor Protein; Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein; RNA, Messenger"
"Oncogenic functions of protein kinase D2 and D3 in regulating multiple cancer-related pathways in breast cancer",2019,"Protein Kinase D (PKD) family contains PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 in human. Compared to consistent tumor-suppressive functions of PKD1 in breast cancer, how PKD2/3 functions in breast cancer are not fully understood. In the current study, we found that PKD2 and PKD3 but not PKD1 were preferentially overexpressed in breast cancer and involved in regulating cell proliferation and metastasis. Integrated phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and interactome showed that PKD2 was associated with multiple cancer-related pathways, including adherent junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and cell cycle-related pathways. ELAVL1 was identified as a common hub-node in networks of PKD2/3-regulated phosphoproteins and genes. Silencing ELAVL1 inhibited breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Direct interaction between ELAVL1 and PKD2 or PKD3 was demonstrated. Suppression of PKD2 led to ELAVL1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus without significant affecting ELAVL1 expression. Taken together, we characterized the oncogenic functions of PKD2/3 in breast cancer and their association with cancer-related pathways, which shed lights on the oncogenic roles and mechanisms of PKDs in breast cancer. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Exposure to Chinese famine in early life modifies the association between hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease",2019,"Background and aims: The Great Leap Forward Famine during 1959–1961 was the world's largest famine, and its adverse long-term effects might be more apparent in the coming decade with ageing of the exposed populations. The aim of this study was to examine whether the Chinese Famine modified the effect of hyperglycaemia on cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods and results: We used data of 4337 adults born between 1952 and 1964 collected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) between hyperglycaemia and CVD. The prevalence of CVD showed significant difference among different famine exposure cohorts (P = 0.0156). After multivariable adjustment, the ORs (95% CIs) were as follows: 1.46 (0.94, 2.26) for late childhood, 1.76 (1.06, 2.90) for mid childhood, 1.40 (0.86, 2.27) for early childhood, 2.55 (1.30, 5.02) for the foetal cohort and 1.10 (0.63, 1.95) for the non-exposed cohort. There was a significant interaction between hyperglycaemia and famine exposure for CVD (P = 0.0374). In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that the effect of hyperglycaemia on CVD in the foetal exposure cohort was significantly higher than those in any of the other famine-exposed cohorts, especially in those who lived in rural areas (OR: 4.67, 95% CI: 1.70–12.84), those who lived in severe famine areas (OR: 5.01, 95% CI: 1.22–20.66) and those who were men (OR: 3.66, 95% CI: 1.01–13.33). Conclusion: Exposure to the Chinese Famine, especially during the foetal stage of life, aggravated the association between hyperglycaemia and CVD. ? 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; childhood; Chinese; disease association; female; human; hunger; hyperglycemia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; rural area; age; blood; cardiovascular disease; child; child development; China; comparative study; gestational age; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; life event; longitudinal study; malnutrition; maternal nutrition; metabolism; nutritional disorder; pathophysiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; prevalence; prognosis; risk assessment; risk factor; sex factor; time factor; biological marker; Age Factors; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child Development; Child Nutrition Disorders; Child, Preschool; China; Famine; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Life Change Events; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Malnutrition; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prevalence; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Time Factors"
"Modeling and Control of Single-Cell Migration Induced by a Chemoattractant-Loaded Microbead",2019,"Cell migration plays an essential role in cancer cell study. Investigation of a novel method for controlling cell migration movement can help develop new therapeutic strategies. In this paper, a chemoattractant-loaded microbead, which is controlled by optical tweezers, is used to stimulate a target cell to accomplish automated migration along a desired path while avoiding obstacles. Models of both tweezers-bead and bead-cell interactions are investigated. A dual closed-loop control strategy is proposed, which includes an inner tweezers-bead control loop and an outer bead-cell control loop. A proportional-integral feedback plus feedforward controller is used to control the inner loop, and an active disturbance rejection controller is used for the outer loop, which can address the cell migration modeling errors and unknown external disturbances. A traffic rule based on interference-clearing mechanism is also proposed to reduce external disturbances on the system by preventing other particles from interfering with the migration process. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is verified by simulations and experiments on migrating leukemia cancer cells. ? 2013 IEEE.","Bioassay; Cells; Closed loop control systems; Controllers; Cytology; Diseases; Disturbance rejection; Holography; Motion control; Optical image storage; Optical tweezers; Two term control systems; Wave interference; Active disturbance rejection controls; Biomedical optical imaging; Cancer; Cascade systems; Cell migration; Charge carrier process; Holographic optical components; Optical imaging; Process control; chemotactic factor; microsphere; biological model; cell motion; devices; human; metabolism; optical tweezers; physiology; single cell analysis; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Chemotactic Factors; Humans; Microspheres; Models, Biological; Optical Tweezers; Single-Cell Analysis"
"Reductively cleavable polymer-drug conjugates based on dendritic polyglycerol sulfate and monomethyl auristatin E as anticancer drugs",2019,"Stimuli-responsive polymer-drug conjugates (PDCs) provide promising approaches in anticancer treatment. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of PDCs made of the highly potent antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E conjugated to dendritic polyglycerol and dendritic polyglycerol sulfate via a reductively cleavable, self-immolative disulfide linker. Cell viability assays with the human cancer cell lines A549 (lung carcinoma) and HeLa (cervix carcinoma) revealed that the drug's cytotoxicity was reduced by conjugation to the polymers, with the sulfated conjugates being more effective than the non-sulfated ones. Kinetic studies using real-time cell analysis indicated a retarded drug release from the polymers, with a much later cytotoxic response after treatment with the non-sulfated conjugates due to less cellular uptake, as confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In contrast, the non-cleavable dPGS-MMAE conjugate that was synthesized for comparison was not cytotoxic under the same conditions. Overall, reductively cleavable dPGS-SS-MMAE conjugates showed promising results in vitro and good tolerability in vivo. Further in vivo studies are planned. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cell culture; Drug delivery; Drug products; Functional polymers; Lanthanum compounds; Sulfur compounds; Anticancer; Biological evaluation; Cell viability assays; Confocal laser scanning microscopy; Polyglycerols; Polymer drugs; Stimuli-responsive; Stimuli-responsive polymer; Dendrimers; dendritic polyglycerol sulfate; nanocarrier; polymer; sulfate; unclassified drug; vedotin; acute toxicity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; body weight loss; cell proliferation; cell viability; cellular distribution; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; cycloaddition; delayed drug release; drug conjugation; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug stability; drug tolerability; female; flow cytometry; freeze drying; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung carcinoma; maximum tolerated dose; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; uterine cervix carcinoma"
"Low-toxicity transferrin-guided polymersomal doxorubicin for potent chemotherapy of orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies. The current chemotherapy with typically low tumor uptake and high toxicity reveals a poor anti-HCC efficacy. Here, we report transferrin-guided polycarbonate-based polymersomal doxorubicin (Tf-Ps-Dox) as a low-toxic and potent nanotherapeutic agent for effective treatment of liver tumor using a transferrin receptor (TfR)-positive human liver tumor SMMC-7721 model. Tf-Ps-Dox was facilely fabricated with small size of ca. 75 nm and varying Tf densities from 2.2% to 7.0%, by postmodification of maleimide-functionalized Ps-Dox (Dox loading content of 10.6 wt%) with thiolated transferrin. MTT assays showed that Tf-Ps-Dox had an optimal Tf surface density of 3.9%. The cellular uptake, intracellular Dox level, and anticancer efficacy of Tf-Ps-Dox to SMMC-7721 cells were inhibited by supplementing free transferrin, which supports that Tf-Ps-Dox is endocytosed through TfR. Interestingly, Tf-Ps-Dox exhibited a high accumulation of 8.5%ID/g (percent injected dose per gram of tissue) in subcutaneous SMMC-7721 tumors, which was 2- and 3-fold higher than that of nontargeted Ps-Dox and clinically used liposomal Dox formulation (Lipo-Dox), respectively. The median survival times of mice bearing orthotopic SMMC-7721 tumors increased from 82, 88 to 96 days when treated with Tf-Ps-Dox at Dox doses from 8, 12 to 16 mg/kg, which was significantly longer than that of Ps-Dox at 8 mg/kg (58 days) and Lipo-Dox at 4 mg/kg (48 days) or PBS (36 days). Notably, unlike Lipo-Dox, no body weight loss and damage to major organs could be discerned for all Tf-Ps-Dox groups, indicating that Tf-Ps-Dox caused low systemic toxicity. This transferrin-dressed polymersomal doxorubicin provides a potent and low-toxic treatment modality for human hepatocellular carcinoma. Statement of Significance: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Vast work has focused on developing HCC-targeted nanotherapeutics. However, none of the nanotherapeutics has advanced to clinics, partly because the ligands used have not been validated in patients. Transferrin (Tf) is a natural ligand for transferrin receptor (TfR) that is overexpressed on cancerous cells, and it is currently under clinical trials (MBP-426 and CALAA-01) for the treatment of solid tumors. We designed Tf-functionalized polymersomal doxorubicin (Tf-Ps-Dox) for targeted therapy of orthotopic SMMC-7721 tumor in nude mice. Tf-Ps-Dox showed potent anti-HCC efficacy and significantly improved survival time with low toxicity as compared with nontargeted Ps-Dox and clinical liposomal Dox (Lipo-Dox). Hence, Tf-Ps-Dox is very appealing for targeted treatment of HCC. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","doxorubicin; polycarbonate; transferrin; animal experiment; animal model; Article; drug distribution; drug efficacy; drug uptake; female; human; human cell; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; SMMC-7721 cell line"
"Regional biomechanical imaging of liver cancer cells",2019,"Liver cancer is one of the leading cancers, especially in developing countries. Understanding the biomechanical properties of the liver cancer cells can not only help to elucidate the mechanisms behind the cancer progression, but also provide important information for diagnosis and treatment. At the cellular level, we used well-established atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to characterize the heterogeneity of mechanical properties of two different types of human liver cancer cells and a normal liver cell line. Stiffness maps with a resolution of 128x128 were acquired for each cell. The distributions of the indentation moduli of the cells showed significant differences between cancerous cells and healthy controls. Significantly, the variability was even greater amongst different types of cancerous cells. Fitting of the histogram of the effective moduli using a normal distribution function showed the Bel7402 cells were stiffer than the normal cells while HepG2 cells were softer. Morphological analysis of the cell structures also showed a higher cytoskeleton content among the cancerous cells. Results provided a foundation for applying knowledge of cell stiffness heterogeneity to search for tissue-level, early-stage indicators of liver cancer. ?

"MiR-454-3p is an exosomal biomarker and functions as a tumor suppressor in glioma",2019,"Glioma is the most common type of primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Our previous work discovered that plasma miR-454-3p may have some advantages in glioma prognosis, but the clinical significance and the regulatory mechanism of miR-454-3p in glioma have not been systematically investigated, especially regarding the relationship between circulating and tissue miR-454-3p. The expression level of miR-454-3p in glioma serum and tissues was analyzed through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Cell-Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8), wound healing, transwell invasion, apoptosis, and immunofluorescence assays were used to assess the role of miR-454-3p in glioma cancer cells. ATG12 was selected as the target gene of miR-454-3p by bioinformatic analysis. The relationship between ATG12 and miR-454-3p was further validated by luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis. miR-454-3p was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues, while it was remarkably upregulated in exosomes from the same patients with glioma. The area under curve (AUC) of exosomal miR-454-3p for glioma diagnosis was 0.8663. The exosomal miR-454-3p was prominently lower in the postoperative serums than that in the preoperative serums. High miR-454-3p expression in exosomes or low miR-454-3p expression in tissue was associated with poor prognosis. Restored expression of miR-454-3p suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy in glioma. ATG12 was validated as a direct target of miR-454-3p. The overexpression of ATG12 could partially reverse the effects induced by miR-454-3p suppression. Our data indicate that miR-454-3p may serve as an exosomal biomarker and may be developed into a novel treatment for glioma. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","autophagy related protein 12; microRNA; microRNA 454 3p; tumor marker; unclassified drug; ATG12 protein, human; autophagy related protein 12; microRNA; MIRN454 microRNA, human; tumor marker; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; blood sampling; cancer tissue; cell invasion; cell invasion assay; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell viability; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic value; down regulation; exosome; flow cytometry; gene expression; gene function; gene targeting; genetic transfection; glioma; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence; LN-229 cell line; luciferase assay; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; U-251MG cell line; Western blotting; wound healing; wound healing assay; 3' untranslated region; brain tumor; cancer grading; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; glioma; prognosis; survival analysis; tumor cell line; upregulation; 3' Untranslated Regions; Autophagy-Related Protein 12; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Exosomes; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glioma; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Grading; Prognosis; Survival Analysis; Up-Regulation"
"Inhibition of the deubiquitinase USP9x induces pre-B cell homeobox 1 (PBX1) degradation and thereby stimulates prostate cancer cell apoptosis",2019,"Chemoresistance is a leading obstacle in effective management of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in PCa chemoresistance could improve treatment of patients with PCa. In the present study, using immune histochemical, chemistry, and precipitation assays with cells from individuals with benign or malignant prostate cancer or established PCa cell lines, we found that the oncogenic transcription factor pre-B cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) promotes PCa cell proliferation and confers to resistance against common anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin. We observed that genetic PBX1 knockdown abrogates this resistance, and further experiments revealed that PBX1 stability was modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. To directly probe the impact of this pathway on PBX1 activity, we screened for PBX1-specific deubiquitinases (Dubs) and found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9x) interacted with and stabilized the PBX1 protein by attenuating its Lys-48 –linked polyubiquitination. Moreover, the USP9x inhibitor WP1130 markedly induced PBX1 degradation and promoted PCa cell apoptosis. The results in this study indicate that PBX1 confers to PCa chemoresistance and identify USP9x as a Dub of PBX1. We concluded that targeting the USP9x/ PBX1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for managing advanced prostate cancer. ? 2019 Liu et al.

"Gut Microbiota Alteration After Long-Term Consumption of Probiotics in the Elderly",2019,"Gut microbiota has been proven to be of crucial importance in maintaining human health. However, the microbiota profile changes with aging, while the loss of microbiota diversity and the alterations in the optimal composition and quantity of beneficial microbes are believed to increase the risk of many diseases. Although the short-term modulatory impact of probiotics on gut microbiota has been revealed in various studies, no studies focused on longer time consumption of probiotics have been demonstrated. In this study, we found that microbial diversity in the probiotic group was similar to that in the control. We identified a panel of microbiota changes, such as Blautia (10.24 vs. 3.76%, P = 0.006), Streptococcus (7.38 vs. 1.16%, P = 0.004), and Enterococcus (0.13 vs. 0.00%, P = 0.030) were more abundant in the probiotic group. Faecalibacterium, a genus containing anti-inflammatory property, also had a higher abundance in the probiotic group in the gut. The microbiota architecture in the different probiotic dose groups was also revealed. No statistical difference was observed in regard to the short-chain fatty acid concentration between the groups. High-dose intake of probiotics resulted in lower microbial richness. The profile of inflammatory factors indicated that only the level of IL-1β was higher in the probiotic population. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the long-time intake of probiotics caused significant changes in the gut microbiota structure, including an increase in the composition of beneficial microorganisms, which might contribute to the maintenance of host health and homeostasis of microenvironment. More prospective cohorts were needed to illustrate the influences of probiotics on the gut microbiota. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","alpha fetoprotein; CA 19-9 antigen; carbohydrate antigen; carcinoembryonic antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; probiotic agent; short chain fatty acid; tumor necrosis factor; Actinobacteria; adult; age; aged; antiinflammatory activity; Article; Bacteroidetes; Blautia; case control study; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug dose comparison; dysbiosis; Enterococcus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Faecalibacterium; feces analysis; female; Firmicutes; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; homeostasis; human; human experiment; inflammation; intestine flora; long term care; male; microbial diversity; Mollicutes; normal human; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; prospective study; Proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; questionnaire; risk factor; species richness; Streptococcus"
"OTUB2 Promotes Cancer Metastasis via Hippo-Independent Activation of YAP and TAZ",2019,"Zhang et al. identified OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ independent of the Hippo signaling. OTUB2 was induced by EGF/KRAS to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ through a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.The transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ play important roles in development, physiology, and tumorigenesis and are negatively controlled by the Hippo pathway. It is yet unknown why the YAP/ TAZ proteins are frequently activated in human malignancies in which the Hippo pathway is still active. Here, by a gain-of-function cancer metastasis screen, we discovered OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ. We found OTUB2 to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ. We also identified a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in YAP and TAZ required for their association with SUMOylated OTUB2. Importantly, EGF and oncogenic KRAS induce OTUB2 poly-SUMOylation and thereby activate YAP/TAZ.

"REV7 confers radioresistance of esophagus squamous cell carcinoma by recruiting PRDX2",2019,"Radiotherapy has been widely used for the clinical management of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, radioresistance remains a serious concern that prevents the efficacy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) radiotherapy. REV7, the structural subunit of eukaryotic DNA polymerase ζ, has multiple functions in bypassing DNA damage and modulating mitotic arrest in human cell lines. However, the expression and molecular function of REV7 in ESCC progression remains unclear. In this study, we first examined the expression of REV7 in clinical ESCC samples, and we found higher expression of REV7 in ESCC tissues compared to matched adjacent or normal tissues. Knockdown of REV7 resulted in decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis in irradiated Eca-109 and TE-1 cells coupled with decreased tumor weight in a xenograft nude mouse model postirradiation. Conversely, overexpression of REV7 resulted in radioresistance in?vitro and in vivo. Moreover, silencing of REV7 induced increased reactive oxygen species levels postirradiation. Proteomic analysis of REV7-interacting proteins revealed that REV7 interacted with peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), a well-known antioxidant protein. Existence of REV7-PRDX2 complex and its augmentation postirradiation were further validated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. REV7 knockdown significantly disrupted the presence of nuclear PRDX2 postirradiation, which resulted in oxidative stress. REV7-PRDX2 complex also assembled onto DNA double-strand breaks, whereas REV7 knockdown evidently increased double-strand breaks that were unmerged by PRDX2. Taken together, the present study sheds light on REV7-modulated radiosensitivity through interacting with PRDX2, which provides a novel target for ESCC radiotherapy. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Effects of mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke patients with etiology of large artery atherosclerosis",2019,"Aims: Atherosclerosis is more prevalent in Asian population. This distinct etiology of stroke might disadvantage Asian patients when applying. mechanical thrombectomy (MT). The purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MT in a cohort of Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke. due to large artery atherosclerosis (LAA). Methods and results: A total of 649 patients treated with MT were included. Patients were classified according to etiology of stroke as LAA and cardioembolism ones. Successful revascularization was defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade ? 2b. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ? 2 at 90 days. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for functional outcomes. The patients with stroke of LAA etiology had significantly higher rate of favorable functional outcome (50.2% vs 36.5%, p <.001) and good collateral (grade of ASITN/SIRI: 2–3) (58.8% versus 43.2%, p <.001), and lower median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) (15.6 versus 18.2, p <.001), compared to patients with stroke of cardioembolism etiology. There was no significant difference in the rate of successful postprocedural mTICI between groups (84.5% versus 83.2%, p =.671). Rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (20.0% versus 11.7%, p =.004) and mortality (31.8% versus 18.8%, p <.001) within 3 months were notably higher in the cardioembolism group than that in the LAA group. Conclusion: Mechanical thrombectomy may be more efficacious in treating acute ischemic stroke of LAA etiology than that of cardioembolism etiology. ? 2018","alteplase; tirofiban; adult; aged; Article; blood clot lysis; brain atherosclerosis; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cardioembolic stroke; Chinese; cohort analysis; collateral circulation; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; mechanical thrombectomy; middle aged; mortality; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; patient safety; priority journal; Rankin scale; revascularization; scoring system; stroke patient; thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade; treatment outcome; atherosclerosis; blood pressure; cerebrovascular accident; complication; follow up; middle cerebral artery; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; procedures; statistical model; thrombectomy; Aged; Atherosclerosis; Blood Pressure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Cerebral Artery; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Stroke; Thrombectomy"
"Efficacy and safety of sonothombolysis versus non-sonothombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2019,"Recent studies have shown that inconsistent results of safety and efficacy between sonothombolysis vs. non-sonothombolysis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We implemented a meta-analysis to explore the value of sonothrombolysis in AIS treatment. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which had evaluated sonothrombolysis or ultrasound thrombolysis in AIS. One hundred five studies were retrieved and analyzed, among them, 7 RCTs were included in the current meta-analysis. In comparison with the non-sonothombolysis, sonothrombolysis significantly improved complete recanalization (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.08, P < 0.001), complete or partial recanalization (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.88, P = 0.002), there is also a tendency to improvement of 4 points in NIHSS score (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.07, P = 0.057). However, sonothrombolysis and non-sonothrombolysis had insignificant differences in neurological recovery and adverse events. In subgroup analysis, we found that “With t-PA”, “NIHSS > 15”, “Treatment time 150min”, and “Age 65 years” are potential favorable factors for efficacy outcomes of sonothombolysis. Sonothrombolysis can significantly increase the rate of recanalization in patients with AIS compared with non-sonothrombolysis, but there is no significant effect on improving neurological functional recovery and avoiding complications.

"Sensitivity improved with Parylene-C passivized on Lamb wave sensor for aPTT measurement through monitoring whole blood reaction",2019,"Blood clotting time monitoring is of great importance in predicting the risk of haemorrhage and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, a new P-Lamb wave sensor was developed to measure activated partial thromboplastic time (aPTT) with enhanced sensitivity. The sensor utilizes a piezoelectric and hydrophobic material, Parylene-C, as a waveguide for the P-Lamb wave sensor in order to monitor the aPTT in whole blood samples. With a smooth surface, the P-Lamb wave sensor reduced energy loss and prevented leaky modes, with a decrease of 33% ± 1.25% in the surface roughness and an increase of 2.75% ± 0.15% in the signal. The experimental results demonstrated that, compared to a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), a P-Lamb sensor with high sensitivity (the frequency shift of a P-Lamb sensor is approximately 200 times greater than that of a QCM) improved stability and enhanced repeatability. Parylene-C worked as a phonon coupling layer, which improved the stability and sensitivity of the Lamb sensor. The relative standards deviation (RSD) of the aPTT measurement was 2.11%, which was 1.22 times lower than reported values. The P-Lamb wave sensor was also tested for its sensitivity to different concentrations of heparin and was found to exhibit an increase in coagulation time with an increasing heparin concentration. Compared to the SYSMEX CS 5100 haematology analyser, the clinical coefficient index (R2) was 0.99467. Considering its compact size, low cost, and mass production of the chip unit, the developed P-Lamb wave sensor is a promising device for point-of-care diagnosis of haemostasis and personal health monitoring. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blood; Diagnosis; Energy dissipation; Polysaccharides; Quartz crystal microbalances; Surface roughness; Surface waves; A0 mode; aPTT; High sensitivity; Lamb-wave sensors; Linearity; Ultrasonic waves"
"IL-17A contributes to HSV1 infection-induced acute lung injury in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis",2019,"Background: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) often experience acute exacerbation (AE) after an episode of common cold. Aims: To establish a mouse model of virus infection-induced AE-IPF and investigate the mechanism underlying the AE-IPF. Methods: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) was inoculated intranasally to wild-type (WT) and IL-17A gene knockout (IL-17A -/- ) mice 21?days after intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM). Results: HSV1 infection caused acute exacerbation in mice with BLM-induced fibrosis. Compared with the BLM+Saline mice, the mice with BLM+HSV1 showed significantly higher acute lung injury (ALI) score (P?&lt;?0.0001), lower survival rate (100% vs 21.4%, P?&lt;?0.0001), poorer lung function and higher inflammatory response representing by increased total inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P?=?0.0323), increased proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood (P?=?0.0004) and higher inflammatory factors in BALF. In addition, HSV1 infection increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins in mice with BLM-induced fibrosis. The inhibition of ERS by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, an ERS inhibitor) significantly reduced the IL-17A levels in BALF (P?=?0.0140) and TH17 cells in the peripheral blood (P?=?0.0084) of mice with BLM+HSV1, suggesting that suppression of ERS may reduce TH17 response in mice with AE-IPF. Compared with WT mice with BLM+HSV1, IL-17A -/- mice with BLM+HSV1 had lower ALI score (P?=?0.0119), higher survival rate (78.6% vs 21.4%, P?=?0.004), improved lung function, and milder inflammatory response. Conclusions: HSV1 infection in addition to BLM-induced IPF can successfully establish AE-IPF in mice. IL-17A and ERS promote lung inflammation in AE-IPF development. ? 2018 The Authors.

"A Hypoxia-Responsive Albumin-Based Nanosystem for Deep Tumor Penetration and Excellent Therapeutic Efficacy",2019,"Uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation, insufficient blood flow, and inadequate endogenous oxygen lead to hypoxia in tumor tissues. Herein, a unique type of hypoxia-responsive human serum albumin (HSA)-based nanosystem (HCHOA) is reported, prepared by cross-linking the hypoxia-sensitive azobenzene group between photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)-conjugated HSA (HC) and oxaliplatin prodrug-conjugated HSA (HO). The HCHOA nanosystem is stable under normal oxygen partial pressure with a size of 100–150 nm. When exposed to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the nanosystem can quickly dissociate into ultrasmall HC and HO therapeutic nanoparticles with a diameter smaller than 10 nm, significantly enabling their enhanced intratumoral penetration. After the dissociation, the quenched fluorescence of Ce6 in the produced HC nanoparticles can be recovered for bioimaging. At the same time, the production of singlet oxygen is increased because of the enhancement in the photoactivity of the photosensitizer. On account of these improvements, combined photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy is realized to display superior antitumor efficacy in vivo. Based on this simple strategy, it is possible to achieve the dissociation of hypoxic-responsive nanosystem to enhance the tumor penetration and therapeutic effect. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Multishelled Hollow Structures of Yttrium Oxide for the Highly Selective and Ultrasensitive Detection of Methanol",2019,"Methanol is extremely harmful to human health, since it is oxidized slowly and can accumulate in the human body. Therefore, it is essential to develop a methanol gas sensing technology with high sensitivity and selectivity for use in environmental monitoring and healthcare. In this work, a simple and low-cost sensor based on a Y 2 O 3 multishelled hollow structure (YMSH) to selectively detect methanol with an ultrasensitive limit of detection (71 ppb) is developed. The unique multishelled hollow structure with a large surface area and exposed {222} facets makes an important contribution to the ultrasensitive detection of methanol, which is further confirmed by subsequent theoretical simulations. Moreover, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra verify that CO 2 is the final product, which indicates a high catalytic activity of the YMSHs toward methanol oxidation. Interestingly, the sensor can also be applied to liquor samples that are mixtures of ethanol, methanol, and water, which provides a facile way to detect methanol in wines. This sensor represents a unique and highly sensitive means to detect methanol, which has great promise for potential application in environmental monitoring and food safety inspection. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Targeting Keap1 by miR-626 protects retinal pigment epithelium cells from oxidative injury by activating Nrf2 signaling",2019,"Activation of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) cascade can offer significant protection against oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Here, we identified a novel kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-targeting microRNA, microRNA-626 (miR-626) that activates Nrf2 signaling. In ARPE-19 cells and primary human RPE cells, ectopic overexpression of miR-626 targeting the 3′-UTR (3′-untranslated region) of Keap1 downregulated its expression, promoting Nrf2 protein stabilization and nuclear translocation, leading to expression of ARE-dependent genes (HO1, NOQ1 and GCLC). Functional studies showed that miR-626 protected RPE cells from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative injury. Conversely, miR-626 inhibition induced Keap1 upregulation and Nrf2 cascade inhibition, exacerbating oxidative injury in RPE cells. Further studies demonstrated that miR-626 was ineffective in Keap1-knockout or Nrf2-knockout RPE cells. Importantly, miR-626 also activated Keap1-Nrf2 signaling cascade in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) and primary human retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), providing protection from H2O2. At last, we show that plasma miR-626 levels are significantly downregulated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients than those in the healthy donors. We conclude that targeting Keap1 by miR-626 protects RPE cells and other ophthalmic cells from oxidative injury via activation of Nrf2 signaling cascade. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","hydrogen peroxide; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; microRNA; transcription factor Nrf2; visual pigment; 3' untranslated region; age related macular degeneration; ARPE-19 cell line; Article; cell protection; controlled study; donor; down regulation; epithelium cell; GCLC gene; gene; gene knockout; gene overexpression; gene targeting; gene translocation; HO1 gene; human; human cell; NOQ1 gene; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein analysis; protein stability; protein targeting; retina ganglion cell; retinal pigment epithelium; signal transduction; upregulation"
"A novel mutation in INS gene linked to permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus",2019,"Purpose: Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is caused by mutations in the genes responsible for pancreatic β cell mass or function. This study aimed to screen the mutations in the KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS genes in a Chinese patient with clinical features of NDM. Methods: The entire coding sequence and exon/intron boundaries of KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS genes were detected by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of the mutation was determined by using online prediction programs SIFT and Mutation Taser. The conformational alterations which contribute to the change of protein function were analyzed at the structural level. Results: A novel mutation L35Q (B11) of the INS gene was discovered in the patient. As L35 residue contributes to its hydrophobic core of the protein, the L35Q substitution is predicated to affect B19-A20 disulfide bond and therefore disrupt the folding of the proinsulin, which ultimately results in beta cell apoptosis by inducing ER stress. Conclusions: This case could help us understand the role of the INS mutation in the development of diabetes. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"High expression of PQBP1 and low expression of PCK2 are associated with metastasis and recurrence of osteosarcoma and unfavorable survival outcomes of the patients",2019,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy, predominately affecting children and adolescents. Due to the introduction of chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate of OS patients has dramatically improved to 60–70%. Unfortunately, OS patients with recurrence or metastatic disease have less than a 20% chance of long-term survival, despite aggressive therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify gene expression patterns associated with metastasis and recurrence in order to identify potential biomarkers with prognostic power. We found that high expression of polyglutamine tract-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) and low expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) were related to a high probability of recurrence and metastasis in OS patients and also predicted shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) after adjustment for other clinical variables. Prediction models based on the combination of PQBP1 and PCK2 expression had good and robust predictive power for recurrence and metastasis. A PQBP1 and PCK2-centered protein interaction network was built, and the hypothetical regulatory path between them was identified and termed the PQBP1-SF3A2-UBA52-PCK2 axis. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that aberrations of metabolism might play an important role in recurrence and metastasis in OS patients. Accordingly, PQBP1 and PCK2 are crucial for recurrence and metastasis in OS, and these findings provide a molecular basis for the exploitation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for overcoming recurrence and metastasis in OS. ?

"Genome-wide identification of lncRNAs and mRNAs differentially expressed in non-functioning pituitary adenoma and construction of an lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network",2019,"The involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during tumorigenesis is a recent emerging theme. Yet no systematic evaluation of lncRNAs has been previously reported for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA), a fairly common type of intracranial tumor. Here, we report the first genome-wide expression profile for lncRNAs and mRNAs in NFPA, using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. Using microarray analyses, we identified 113 lncRNAs and 80 mRNAs differentially expressed in NFPA; this list includes lncRNAs previously implicated in a variety of cancers. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) we further confirmed differential expression in NFPA for ten of the 113 lncRNAs. Using these ten doubly confirmed lncRNAs, we constructed an lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network comprising of 130 specific lncRNA-mRNA co-expression relationships. In addition, we conducted GO and KEGG analyses for the 80 mRNAs differentially expressed in NFPA. Our microarray and qRT-PCR analyses provided a working list of lncRNAs that may be functionally relevant to NFPA tumorigenesis. Our co-expression network in turn connected these largely uncharacterized lncRNAs to specific mRNAs, whose roles we further elucidated via GO and KEGG analyses, thus providing specific, testable hypotheses for the functions of these lncRNAs. Together, our study laid the foundation for future investigation of the specific function and mechanism by which lncRNAs are involved in NFPA tumorigenesis. ? 2019.

"Detection of circular RNA expression and related quantitative trait loci in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex",2019,"Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in various biological processes. As a layer of the gene regulatory network, circRNA expression is also an intermediate phenotype bridging genetic variation and phenotypic changes. Thus, analyzing circRNA expression variation will shed light on molecular fundamentals of complex traits and diseases. Results: We systematically characterize 10,559 high-quality circRNAs in 589 human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples. We identify biological and technical factors contributing to expression heterogeneity associated with the expression levels of many circRNAs, including the well-known circRNA CDR1as. Combining the expression levels of circRNAs with genetic cis-acting SNPs, we detect 196,255 circRNA quantitative trait loci (circQTLs). By characterizing circQTL SNPs, we find that partial circQTL SNPs might influence circRNA formation by altering the canonical splicing site or the reverse complementary sequence match. Additionally, we find that a subset of these circQTL SNPs is highly linked to genome-wide association study signals of complex diseases, especially schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. Conclusions: Our results reveal technical, biological, and genetic factors affecting circRNA expression variation among individuals, which lead to further understanding of circRNA regulation and thus of the genetic architecture of complex traits or diseases. ? 2019 The Author(s).","circular RNA; circular RNA CDR1as; RNA; unclassified drug; RNA; RNA, circular; adult; aged; Article; CDR1 gene; cell culture; controlled study; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; female; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene identification; genetic association; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; glioma; heredity; human; human cell; human tissue; inflammatory bowel disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; quantitative trait locus; RNA sequence; RNA splicing; schizophrenia; single nucleotide polymorphism; metabolism; prefrontal cortex; Humans; Prefrontal Cortex; Quantitative Trait Loci; RNA"
"LNC CRYBG3 inhibits tumor growth by inducing M phase arrest",2019,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are usually associated with tumor development and progression and some of them are dysregulated in various human cancers. The mechanisms underlying their dysregulation are worth further study. Here, we demonstrate that the expression level of LNC CRYBG3 is correlated with 1501 aberrantly expressed proteins in A549 cells (non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells). LNC CRYBG3 overexpression results in M phase arrest and promoted cell death, whereas LNC CRYBG3 knockdown did not elicit the opposite effects. The overexpression of LNC CRYBG3 inhibits cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, it upregulates the expression of cyclin B1 and the phosphorylation of H3, whereas it inhibited the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 and cyclin D1. Taken together, these findings suggest that LNC CRYBG3 regulates the cell cycle process of A549 cells, suggesting its potential application for the treatment of this disease. ?

"Doxorubicin-polyglycerol-nanodiamond composites stimulate glioblastoma cell immunogenicity through activation of autophagy",2019,"Immunosuppression is a salient feature of GBM associated with the disease's grim prognosis and the limited success of anti-GBM immunotherapy. Stimulating immunogenicity of the GBM cells (GC) is a promising approach to subverting the GBM-associated immunosuppression. We had previously devised a drug composite based on polyglycerol-functionalized nanodiamonds bearing doxorubicin (Nano-DOX) and demonstrated that Nano-DOX effectively modulated GBM's immunosuppressive microenvironment through stimulating the immunogenicity of GC and initiated anti-GBM immune responses. The present study now explored the mechanism of Nano-DOX's immunostimulatory action. Nano-DOX was found to induce autophagy rather than apoptosis in GC and stimulated GC to emit antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are potent adjuvants, which resulted in enhanced activation of dendritic cells (DC). Heightened autophagosome release was observed in Nano-DOX-treated GC but was shown not to be a major channel of antigen donation. Blocking autophagy in GC not only reduced Nano-DOX-stimulated GC antigen donation and DAMPs emission, but also efficiently attenuated DC activation stimulated by Nano-DOX-treated GC. Taken together, these findings suggest that activation of autophagy is a central mechanism whereby Nano-DOX stimulates GC's immunogenicity. Our work provides new insight on how nanotechnology can be applied to therapeutically modulate the GBM immune microenvironment by harnessing autophagy in the cancer cells. Statement of Significance: Immunosuppression is a salient feature of GBM associated with the grim prognosis of the disease and the limited success of anti-GBM immunotherapy. We demonstrated that Doxorubicin-polyglycerol-nanodiamond composites could activate autophagy in GBM cells and thereby stimulate the immunogenecity of GBM cells. This discovery 1, sheds new light on how nanotechnology could be applied to therapeutically modulate the tumor immune microenvironment, and 2, provides a powerful tool for subverting the GBM's immunosuppressive microenvironment, which has great therapeutic potential for the treatment of GBM. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","beclin 1; caspase 3; doxorubicin; messenger RNA; nanodiamond; polyglycerol; polymer; sequestosome 1; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antigenicity; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; cell surface; controlled study; dendritic cell; down regulation; female; glioblastoma; human; human cell; immunofluorescence test; immunogenicity; immunostimulation; macrophage; monocyte; monocytic leukemia cell line; nonhuman; priority journal; protein content; upregulation"
"Reductively cleavable polymer-drug conjugates based on dendritic polyglycerol sulfate and monomethyl auristatin E as anticancer drugs",2019,"Stimuli-responsive polymer-drug conjugates (PDCs) provide promising approaches in anticancer treatment. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of PDCs made of the highly potent antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E conjugated to dendritic polyglycerol and dendritic polyglycerol sulfate via a reductively cleavable, self-immolative disulfide linker. Cell viability assays with the human cancer cell lines A549 (lung carcinoma) and HeLa (cervix carcinoma) revealed that the drug's cytotoxicity was reduced by conjugation to the polymers, with the sulfated conjugates being more effective than the non-sulfated ones. Kinetic studies using real-time cell analysis indicated a retarded drug release from the polymers, with a much later cytotoxic response after treatment with the non-sulfated conjugates due to less cellular uptake, as confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In contrast, the non-cleavable dPGS-MMAE conjugate that was synthesized for comparison was not cytotoxic under the same conditions. Overall, reductively cleavable dPGS-SS-MMAE conjugates showed promising results in vitro and good tolerability in vivo.

"Association of CTLA-4 tagging polymorphisms and haplotypes with hepatocellular carcinoma risk: A case-control study",2019,"It has been proposed that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) may attenuate the T-cell activation threshold, thereby decreasing the antitumor response and conferring susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).In the present study, we selected CTLA-4 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and explored the relationship between these polymorphisms and susceptibility to HCC. A hospital-based case-control study, comprising 584 cases with HCC and 923 controls, was performed in an eastern Chinese Han population. CTLA-4 SNPs were genotyped using a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan Kit.We found that the CTLA-4 rs3087243 G>A polymorphism might be associated with increased risk of HCC (GA vs GG: adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.85; P?=?.028 and AA/GA vs GG: adjusted OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08-1.89; P?=?.012). After using Bonferroni correction, this association remained (P?=?.012 for the AA/GA vs GG genetic model). In addition, the power value was 0.904 in the AA/GA versus GG genetic model. Haplotype analysis showed that CTLA4 Crs16840252Ars231775Ars3087243Trs733618, Crs16840252Grs231775Ars3087243Trs733618, and other haplotypes might increase the risk of HCC risk (P?=?.018, <.001, and .017, respectively). However, we found that CTLA4 Trs16840252A rs231775Grs3087243Trs733618 decreased the risk of HCC (P?=?.020).Our results suggest that the CTLA-4 rs3087243 G>A polymorphism increases susceptibility to HCC in an eastern Chinese Han population. CTLA-4 haplotypes may influence the development of HCC. In the future, a population-based fine-mapping study with functional assessment should be performed to further determine these potential correlations.","CTLA4 protein, human; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; adult; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; case control study; female; gene frequency; genetic predisposition; genetics; haplotype; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; middle aged; pathology; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Case-Control Studies; CTLA-4 Antigen; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Haplotypes; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"
"Assessment of chronic renal injury in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors",2019,"We aimed to evaluate the incidence of chronic renal injury in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to identify the associated factors. Data for CML-CP patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and receiving TKI therapy ? 3?months were retrospectively reviewed. The CRAE (chronic renal adverse event, defined as a 30% eGFR reduction from baseline or eGFR &lt; 60?ml/min/1.73?m2 ? 90?days whichever occurred first)-free survival rates at 3?years in the imatinib cohort (n = 360) were significantly lower than those in the nilotinib cohort (n = 100) (55% versus 77%, P = 0.001) as a first-line TKI therapy. In multivariate analyses, imatinib, male sex, increasing age, and previous non-TKI treatment were associated with poor CRAE-free survival. In newly diagnosed patients who received imatinib treatment (n = 40), 24-h urine protein levels significantly increased after 6?months, and urinary β2-microglobulin values significantly increased compared to those in the nilotinib cohort (n?=15)?at 36?months (P = 0.042) and 42?months (P = 0.039). There was no significant difference in CRAE-free survival rates at 3?years between the nilotinib (n = 65) and dasatinib (n = 74) cohorts (67% versus 83%, P = 0.832) as second- or third-line TKI therapies. In multivariate analyses, previous non-TKI treatment was associated with poor CRAE-free survival. We concluded that imatinib was significantly correlated to chronic renal injury, possibly associated with glomerulus and renal tubular injury, compared with nilotinib as a first-line TKI therapy in CML-CP patients.

To achieve this, effective and accurate delivery of FeIII to cancerous sites is critical, requiring a balance of release kinetics of Fe3+ in tumorous and normal tissues. A nanoprobe is described consisting of upconversion luminescence (UCL) nanoparticles as a core and a coordinatively unsaturated FeIII-containing Fe3+/gallic acid complex as a shell. Owing to the introduction of an unsaturated coordination structure, FeIII in the nanoprobe can be released only in the tumor microenvironment in response to the lightly acidic pH. The multiple UCLs are used for quantitatively visualizing the release of Fe3+ in vivo, whilst the release resultant serves as a photothermal agent. This nanoprobe exhibited ligand-free tumor targeting ability, activatable MR imaging performance, and efficacious therapeutic effects against tumors in vivo. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Upregulation of circular RNA CircNFIB attenuates cardiac fibrosis by sponging miR-433",2019,"Cardiac fibrosis is the pathological consequence of fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. As a new class of endogenous non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified in many cardiovascular diseases including fibrosis, generally acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges. Here, we report that the expression of circRNA-circNFIB was decreased in mice post-myocardial infarction heart samples, as well as in primary adult cardiac fibroblasts treated with TGF-β. Forced expression of circNFIB decreased cell proliferation in both NIH/3T3 cells and primary adult fibroblasts as evidenced by EdU incorporation. Conversely, inhibition of circNFIB promoted adult fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, circNFIB was identified as a miR-433 endogenous sponge. Overexpression of circNFIB could attenuate pro-proliferative effects induced by the miR-433 mimic while inhibition of circNFIB exhibited opposite results. Finally, upregulation of circNFIB also reversed the expression levels of target genes and downstream signaling pathways of miR-433. In conclusion, circNFIB is critical for protection against cardiac fibrosis. The circNFIB-miR-433 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of fibrotic diseases. ? 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Increased growth differentiation factor 15 is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke",2019,"BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a stress-responsive biomarker, is known to be independently associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in different disease settings, but data on the prognostic value of GDF-15 after stroke are limited. METHODS: Baseline serum GDF-15 was measured in 3066 acute ischemic stroke patients from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke (CATIS). The primary outcome was a composite of death and major disability within 3 months. Secondary outcomes included death, major disability, vascular events, and stroke recurrence. The associations between GDF-15 and clinical outcomes after stroke were assessed by multivariate logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: At 3 months’ follow-up, 676 (22.05%), 86 (2.80%), 81 (2.64%), and 51 (1.66%) patients had experienced major disability, death, vascular events, or stroke recurrence, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, current smoking, alcohol consumption, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, the odds ratio/hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1 SD higher of base-10 log-transformed GDF-15 was 1.26 (1.15–1.39) for primary outcome, 1.13 (1.02–1.25) for major disability, 1.79 (1.48 –2.16) for death, and 1.26 (1.00 –1.58) for vascular events. The addition of GDF-15 to established risk factors improved risk prediction of the composite outcome of death and major disability (c-statistic, net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement, all P 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High GDF-15 concentrations are independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke, suggesting that baseline serum GDF-15 could provide additional information to identify ischemic stroke patients at high risk of poor prognosis. ? 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.","growth differentiation factor 15; GDF15 protein, human; growth differentiation factor 15; tumor marker; adult; Article; brain ischemia; clinical outcome; disability; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; outcome assessment; prognosis; prospective study; protein blood level; risk assessment; risk factor; aged; blood; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; mortality; multivariate analysis; proportional hazards model; statistical model; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Ischemia; Female; Growth Differentiation Factor 15; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Stroke"
"Potential applications of DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers in diagnosis, therapy and prognosis for colorectal cancer: A study from databases to AI-assisted verification",2019,"In order to find out the most valuable biomarkers and pathways for diagnosis, therapy and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) we have collected the published CRC biomarkers and established a CRC biomarker database (CBD: http://sysbio.suda.edu.cn/CBD/index.html). In this study, we analysed the single and multiple DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers as well as their positions in cancer related pathways and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to describe their potential applications in diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. CRC biomarkers were collected from the CBD. The RNA and protein biomarkers were matched to their corresponding DNAs by the miRDB database and the PubMed Gene database, respectively. The PPI networks were used to investigate the relationships between protein biomarkers and further detect the multiple biomarkers. The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation were used to analyse biological functions of the biomarkers. AI classification techniques were utilized to further verify the significances of the multiple biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis for CRC. We showed that a large number of the DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers were associated with the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis in various degrees in the CRC biomarker networks. The CRC biomarkers were closely related to the CRC initiation and progression. Moreover, the biomarkers played critical roles in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis and they were involved in Ras, p53 and PI3K pathways. There were overlaps among the DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers. AI classification verifications showed that the combined multiple protein biomarkers played important roles to accurate early diagnosis and predict outcome for CRC. There were several single and multiple CRC protein biomarkers which were associated with diagnosis, therapy and prognosis in CRC. Further, AI-assisted analysis revealed that multiple biomarkers had potential applications for diagnosis and prognosis in CRC. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Ultrasensitive and quantitative detection of: EGFR mutations in plasma samples from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer using a dual PNA clamping-mediated LNA-PNA PCR clamp",2019,"Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is a potential proxy for tumour tissues. However, the analysis of mutations and mutational abundance using ctDNA remains challenging because ctDNA is present at low levels. In addition, the concordance between plasma and tumour tissues requires further investigation by high-sensitivity techniques. Here, we established an ultrasensitive, quantitative method for detecting rare mutations in plasma samples based on a dual PNA clamping-mediated LNA-PNA PCR clamp (LNA-dPNA PCR clamp). The novelty of our method is the coupling of PNA clamping with one-tube nested PCR to dually block wild-type DNA amplification and efficiently amplify mutant DNA. Then, four hotspot EGFR mutations (EGFR L858R, EGFR Exon 19 deletion, EGFR T790M, and EGFR C797S) were detected by our proposed method. Finally, we evaluated the concordance between plasma and tumour tissues by simultaneously detecting EGFR L858R by ddPCR and LNA-dPNA PCR clamp in 132 tissues and matched plasma samples from patients with NSCLC. For the four EGFR mutations, the amplification sensitivity of the LNA-dPNA PCR clamp was 10 0 copies per reaction, and the linearity was from 10 0 to 10 6 -10 7 copies per reaction. The limit of detection for the LNA-dPNA PCR clamp was 0.01%-0.1%. The LNA-dPNA PCR clamp was similarly consistent with ddPCR in quantifying mutational abundance (R 2 = 0.9568) and exhibited similar limit of detection (0.01%-0.1% vs. 0.01%), sensitivity (19.6 vs. 21.7), specificity (94.2 vs. 91.9), and concordance (68.2 vs. 67.4) to those of ddPCR for ctDNA detection. In conclusion, the LNA-dPNA PCR clamp will provide a labour-saving, cost-saving, ultrasensitive tool for detecting and quantifying plasma EGFR mutations. ?

"Genome-wide analysis of lung adenocarcinoma identifies novel prognostic factors and a prognostic score",2019,"Background and Objective: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological type of all lung cancers and is associated with genetic and epigenetic aberrations. The tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage is the most authoritative indicator of the clinical outcome in LUAD patients in current clinical practice. In this study, we attempted to identify novel genetic and epigenetic modifications and integrate them as a predictor of the prognosis for LUAD, to supplement the TNM stage with additional information. Methods: A dataset of 445 patients with LUAD was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Both genetic and epigenetic aberrations were screened for their prognostic impact on overall survival (OS). A prognostic score (PS) integrating all the candidate prognostic factors was then developed and its prognostic value validated. Results: A total of two micro-RNAs, two mRNAs and two DNA methylation sites were identified as prognostic factors associated with OS. The low- and high-risk patient groups, divided by their PS level, showed significantly different OS (p < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS; p = 0.005). Patients in the early stages (stages I/II) and advanced stages (stages III/IV) of LUAD could be further subdivided by PS into four subgroups. PS remained efficient in stratifying patients into different OS (p < 0.001) and RFS (p = 0.005) when the low- and high-risk subgroups were in the early stages of the disease. However, there was only a significant difference in OS (p = 0.04) but not RFS (p = 0.2), between the low-risk and high-risk subgroups when both were in advanced stages. Conclusion: PS, in combination with the TNM stage, provides additional precision in stratifying patients with significantly different OS and RFS prognoses. Further studies are warranted to assess the efficiency of PS and to explain the effects of the genetic and epigenetic aberrations observed in LUAD. ? 2019 Chen, Song, Zhang, Wang, Zhu, Zhang, Jiang, Li, Chen and Chen.

"Anemoside B4 attenuates nephrotoxicity of cisplatin without reducing anti-tumor activity of cisplatin",2019,"Background: Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. However, its clinical usage is severely limited by its serious side effects, especially nephrotoxicity. Anemoside B4, is a major saponins, rich in root of Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge), has anti-inflammation in vitro. However, the antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects of anemoside B4 in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity have not been clearly demonstrated. Purpose: In this study, we investigated whether anemoside B4 exhibits protective effects against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity involving antioxidant or anti-apoptosis effects. Method: To clarify it, the effects of anemoside B4 on HEK 293 cell viability was measured by CCK8 kits, intracellular antioxidant capacity including glutathione reduced (GSH), catalase (CAT) were estimated using chemical kits, apoptosis rate and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was analyzed by flow cytometry, apoptosis protein was measured by western blotting. In vivo model of cisplatin-induced mice acute renal failure was performed to evaluate the properties of anemoside B4. Besides, to evaluate the effect of anemoside B4 on the anti-tumor activity of cisplatin, S 180 xenograft models were used. Results: Anemoside B4 potently increased cisplatin-treated HEK 293T cells viability on the concentration and time manners and inhibited cells apoptosis, as demonstrated by the decreased cleaved PARP protein expressions. Anemoside B4 decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and improved superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In vivo experiment showed that pretreatment with anemoside B4 effectively adjusted body weight and kidney index, and reduced cisplatin-elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CREA) levels, as well as ameliorated the histopathological damage. Further studies showed that anemoside B4 did not reduce antitumor activity of cisplatin in murine S 180 cancer xenograft tumor models. In addition, anemoside B4 per set showed low toxicity in mice. Conclusion: The strong antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects of anemoside B4 may provide therapeutic potential for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity without compromising its therapeutic efficiency. ? 2018","anemoside b4; antioxidant; catalase; cisplatin; glutathione; reactive oxygen metabolite; saponin derivative; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; anemoside B4; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; catalase; cisplatin; glutathione; reactive oxygen metabolite; saponin; acute kidney failure; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; apoptosis rate; Article; cell viability; controlled study; embryo; flow cytometry; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; acute kidney failure; animal; apoptosis; chemically induced; drug effect; drug screening; inflammation; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; kidney function test; male; metabolism; oxidative stress; Acute Kidney Injury; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Catalase; Cisplatin; Glutathione; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Kidney Function Tests; Male; Mice, Inbred ICR; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Saponins; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Increased risk of Toxoplasma gondii infection in cancer patients: A meta-analysis of current evidence based on case-control study",2019,"Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an intracellular protozoan parasite that often infects warm-blooded animals or causes opportunistic infections if exists a suppressed immunity. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of T. gondii and its odds ratio (OR) in patients with cancer in compared with healthy individuals, and to find the possible factors. Related literatures reported the seroprevalence of T. gondii in cancer/tumor patients and controls (health individuals) were retrieved from electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Web of Knowledge and The Cochrane Library from inception until Aug 31 2018. The non-weighted prevalence of T. gondii, pooled estimates of OR and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated through random-effect model. Between-study heterogeneity was tested with Cochrane Q, and statistic I 2 was to quantify the results. Funnel plot depiction and Egger's linear regression test were combined to evaluate the potential of publication bias. The literature identified a total of 2216 potential studies; the final 18 studies were incorporated, with 6001 cancer/tumor patients and 6067 controls. Our results demonstrated that, the cancer/tumor patients had an elevated seroprevalence of T. gondii (18.43% vs 8.19%), and an increased risk of T. gondii infection (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.65–3.82) when compared with the controls. Subgroup analyses suggested that publication year, study sample size and diagnostic options are closely associated with the seroprevalence of T. gondii. Overall, our study indicates that there is an increased risk of T. gondii infection in cancer/tumor patients, suggesting a precautionary monitoring of T. gondii and related risk factors in patients with cancer/tumor. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","immunoglobulin G; cancer; confidence interval; disease prevalence; health risk; heterogeneity; meta-analysis; parasitic disease; protozoan; risk factor; tumor; Article; cancer patient; clinical assessment; electronic medical record; evidence based practice; human; infection risk; nonhuman; risk factor; seroprevalence; Toxoplasma gondii; toxoplasmosis; case control study; meta analysis; neoplasm; odds ratio; prevalence; seroepidemiology; toxoplasmosis; Animalia; Protozoa; Toxoplasma gondii; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Neoplasms; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Toxoplasmosis"
"Lycorine inhibits melanoma cell migration and metastasis mainly through reducing intracellular levels of β-catenin and matrix metallopeptidase 9",2019,"Metastatic melanoma accounts for 60% of death for skin cancer. Although great efforts have been made to treat the disease, effective drugs against metastatic melanoma still lack at the clinical setting. In the current study, we found that lycorine, a small molecule of isoquinoline alkaloid, significantly suppressed melanoma cell migration and invasion in vitro, and decreased the metastasis of melanoma cells to lung tissues in tumor-bearing mice, resulting in significant prolongation of the survival of the mice without obvious toxicity. Molecular mechanistic studies revealed that lycorine significantly reduced intracellular levels of β-catenin protein through degradation of the protein via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, and decreased the expression of β-catenin downstream prometastatic matrix metallopeptidase 9 and Axin2 genes. Collectively, our findings support the notion that targeting the oncogenic β-catenin by lycorine is a new option to inhibit melanoma cell metastasis, providing a good drug candidate potential for development novel therapeutics against metastatic melanoma. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","axin2 protein; beta catenin; gelatinase B; lycorine; proteasome; protein; ubiquitin; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; C8161 cell line; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; female; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung metastasis; melanoma; metastasis inhibition; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; survival time"
"Association of Restless Legs Syndrome With Risk of Suicide and Self-harm",2019,"Importance: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that has been previously found to be associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation. In the context of the increasing suicide rate in the United States, the evidence regarding the association between RLS and the risk of suicide and self-harm is limited. Objective: To investigate the association between RLS and risk of suicide and self-harm. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was performed using Truven Health MarketScan national claims data from 2006 to 2014; the baseline data were from 2006 to 2008, and the follow-up data covered 6 years (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014). Included were 24?179 nonpregnant participants with RLS and 145?194 age- and sex-matched participants without RLS at baseline (2006-2008), who were free of suicide, self-harm, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at study baseline. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019. Exposure: Diagnosis of RLS, as identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident suicide and self-harm event, identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code. Results: Among 169?373 participants in the current analysis, the mean (SD) age was 49.4 (9.1) years; 53?426 (31.5%) participants were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up duration of 5.2 (2.2) years, 119 incident suicide and self-harm cases were identified. Individuals with RLS had a higher risk of suicide or self-harm compared with those without RLS (adjusted hazard ratio,?2.66; 95% CI, 1.70-4.15), after adjusting for lifestyle factors (eg, alcohol and obesity), presence of chronic diseases (eg, depression, insomnia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, iron-deficiency anemia, and Parkinson disease), and use of medications. Excluding those with depression, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and other common chronic conditions, the significant association between RLS and suicide or self-harm persisted (adjusted hazard ratio,?4.14; 95% CI, 2.17-7.92). Conclusions and Relevance: Restless legs syndrome was associated with a high risk of suicide and self-harm, and the risk was independent of most identified diseases and conditions.",""
"Serum-plasma matched metabolomics for comprehensive characterization of benign thyroid nodule and papillary thyroid carcinoma",2019,"Metabolomics offers a noninvasive methodology to identify metabolic markers for pathogenesis and diagnosis of diseases. This work aimed to characterize circulating metabolic signatures of benign thyroid nodule (BTN) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) via serum-plasma matched metabolomics. A cohort of 1,540 serum-plasma matched samples and 114 tissues were obtained from healthy volunteers, BTN and PTC patients enrolled from 6 independent centers. Untargeted metabolomics was determined by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric and multivariate statistical analyses. The use of serum-plasma matched samples afforded a broad-scope detection of 1,570 metabolic features. Metabolic phenotypes revealed significant pattern differences for healthy versus BTN and healthy versus PTC. Perturbed metabolic pathways related mainly to amino acid and lipid metabolism. It is worth noting that, BTN and PTC showed no significant differences but rather overlap in circulating metabolic signatures, and this observation was replicated in all study centers. For differential diagnosis of healthy versus thyroid nodules (BTN + PTC), a panel of 6 metabolic markers, namely myo-inositol, α-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine, proline betaine, L-glutamic acid, LysoPC(18:0) and LysoPC(18:1) provided area under the curve of 97.68% in the discovery phase and predictive accuracies of 84.78–98.18% in the 4 validation centers. Taken together, serum-plasma matched metabolomics showed significant differences in circulating metabolites for healthy versus nodules but not for BTN versus PTC. Our results highlight the true metabolic nature of thyroid nodules, and potentially decrease overtreatment that exposes patients to unnecessary risks. ? 2018 UICC","alanine; alpha n phenylacetyl levo glutamine; amino acid derivative; aminoacyl transfer RNA; arachidonic acid; aspartic acid; cysteine; glutamic acid; glutamine; glycerophospholipid; hypotaurine; inositol; linoleic acid; lysophosphatidylcholine; methionine; proline betaine; taurine; unclassified drug; tumor marker; adolescent; adult; aged; amino acid metabolism; Article; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; human; human tissue; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography; major clinical study; male; metabolite; metabolomics; phenotype; predictive value; priority journal; quadrupole mass spectrometry; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; thyroid nodule; thyroid papillary carcinoma; time of flight mass spectrometry; blood; clinical trial; differential diagnosis; metabolism; metabolomics; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; thyroid nodule; thyroid tumor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Child; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Male; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary; Thyroid Neoplasms; Thyroid Nodule; Young Adult"
"Alcohol Drinking and the Risk of Chronic Kidney Damage: A Meta-Analysis of 15 Prospective Cohort Studies",2019,"The relationship between alcohol drinking and chronic kidney damage, mainly including declined glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria, and end-stage renal disease, was conflicting. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate their potential associations. PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify prospective studies assessing the associations between alcohol drinking and chronic kidney damage published up to March 2019. Random-effects model was employed to pool the relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup meta-analyses stratified by the basic characteristics of subjects were performed. A total of 15 cohort studies were included in the present study, with 268,723 participants and 31,766 incident cases. Participants with low (<13?g/d), moderate (13 to 26?g/d), and high (26 to 60?g/d) dose of alcohol drinking had 12% (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.93), 24% (RR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.83), and 21% (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.88) lower risk of chronic kidney damage compared with the reference group (non- or occasional drinkers), respectively. The lower risk for chronic kidney damage remained significant for the declined GFR, or in men, or for participants aged less than 55?yrs, or studies with longer than 8?yrs of follow-up, while severe alcohol drinking (?60?g/d) insignificantly increased 7% risk of chronic kidney damage (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.15). No obvious heterogeneity and no publication bias were observed. Based on our meta-analysis, participants with alcohol drinking less than 60?g/d were at lower risk of declined GFR, especially in men or participants aged less than 55?yrs. Much more prospective cohort studies are required to confirm our present findings. ? 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism","alcohol consumption; chronic kidney failure; drinking behavior; end stage renal disease; glomerulus filtration rate; human; meta analysis; practice guideline; priority journal; proteinuria; Review"
"Mutant and wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 share enhancing mechanisms involving distinct tyrosine kinase cascades in cancer",2019,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is important for reductive carboxylation in cancer cells, and the IDH1 R132H mutation plays a pathogenic role in cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the regulatory mechanisms modulating mutant and/ or wild-type (WT) IDH1 function remain unknown. Here, we show that two groups of tyrosine kinases (TK) enhance the activation of mutant and WT IDH1 through preferential Y42 or Y391 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Y42 phosphorylation occurs in IDH1 monomers, which promotes dimer formation with enhanced substrate (isocitrate or α-ketoglutarate) binding, whereas Y42-phosphorylated dimers show attenuated disruption to monomers. Y391 phosphorylation occurs in both monomeric and dimeric IDH1, which enhances cofactor (NADP+ or NADPH) binding. Diverse oncogenic TKs phosphorylate IDH1 WT at Y42 and activate Src to phosphorylate IDH1 at Y391, which contributes to reductive carboxylation and tumor growth, whereas FLT3 or the FLT3-ITD mutation activates JAK2 to enhance mutant IDH1 activity through phosphorylation of Y391 and Y42, respectively, in AML cells. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated an intrinsic connection between oncogenic TKs and activation of WT and mutant IDH1, which involves distinct TK cascades in related cancers. In particular, these results provide an additional rationale supporting the combination of FLT3 and mutant IDH1 inhibitors as a promising clinical treatment of mutant IDH1-positive AML. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","2 oxoglutaric acid; CD135 antigen; dimer; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; isocitric acid; Janus kinase 2; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; peptides and proteins; platelet derived growth factor receptor; protein kinase p60; protein tyrosine kinase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; tyrosine protein kinase abl 1; unclassified drug; acute myeloid leukemia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; binding assay; binding site; carboxylation; cell counting; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; density gradient centrifugation; dimerization; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetic assay; enzyme substrate complex; flow cytometry; gene mutation; genetic transfection; genetic variability; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; lipogenesis; lung cancer; malignant neoplasm; mouse; nonhuman; protein binding; protein phosphorylation; spectrophotometry; tumor growth; Western blotting"

This study evaluated miR-23b expression and assessed its potential as a biomarker of disease activity for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Differential expression of microRNAs was determined by miRNA microarray analysis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from four trauma patients as healthy controls (HCs) and eight RA patients. The microarray results showed elevated expression of miR-23b in FLSs from RA patients and this finding was corroborated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization using synovial tissues (STs). Furthermore, we found miR-23b levels in plasma of RA patients were significantly higher than in HCs, and plasma miR-23b levels positively correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), C-reactive protein (CRP), DAS28, and platelet (PLT) count (P < 0.05). MiR-23b levels in plasma inversely correlated with the levels of hemoglobin (Hb), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P < 0.05), but not with rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) (P > 0.05). Moreover, patients with anorexia showed higher levels of miR-23b in plasma than those without anorexia. Similar results were observed with fatigue. Appropriate treatment for RA not only ameliorated the disease condition but also reversed the elevated plasma miR-23b level remarkably. These results suggest that circulating miR-23b may be a promising biomarker for RA disease activity. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","bilirubin; biological marker; C reactive protein; cholesterol; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; hemoglobin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; microRNA; microRNA 23b; rheumatoid factor; unclassified drug; bilirubin; biological marker; C reactive protein; cholesterol; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; hemoglobin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; microRNA; MIRN23 microRNA, human; rheumatoid factor; adult; aged; anorexia; Article; bilirubin blood level; blood analysis; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; DAS28; disease activity; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; fatigue; female; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; hemoglobin blood level; human; in situ hybridization; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; platelet count; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; rheumatoid arthritis; RNA analysis; synoviocyte; synovium; upregulation; blood; chemistry; cytology; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; rheumatoid arthritis; Adult; Aged; Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Bilirubin; Biomarkers; Blood Sedimentation; C-Reactive Protein; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Platelet Count; Rheumatoid Factor; Synovial Membrane"
"Peripheral blood platelet to lymphocyte ratio as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers of acute cerebral infarction and its clinical significance",2019,"Background: The aim of the present study is to explore the diagnostic and prognostic value of peripheral blood platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in acute cerebral infarction (ACI). Methods: We enrolled 121 patients with ACI and 35 healthy volunteers in the present study. The lymphocyte and platelet counts and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios of the candidates were calculated, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to examine whether PLR was a sensitive biomarker for distinguishing ACI patients from the healthy volunteers; moreover, the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) results of the patients were recorded to evaluate the short-term prognosis of the patients, and the relationship between PLR and GOS were investigated. Results: We observed that the platelet counts were decreased in patients with ACI compared to the healthy volunteers, but no significant differences were observed (p > 0.05). On the other hand, lymphocyte counts were significantly decreased in patients with ACI, and PLR was significantly increased in patients with ACI compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.001). Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) of platelet counts, lymphocyte counts, and PLR were 0.5365 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4373 to 0.6357), 0.7526 (95% CI, 0.6630 to 0.8421), and 0.8320 (95% CI, 0.7586 to 0.9054), respectively, suggesting that PLR was a sensitive biomarker for distinguishing ACI patients from the healthy controls. Finally, the PLR of the patients were negatively correlated with the GOS score of the patients. Conclusions: We reported that PLR was significantly increased in the peripheral blood of patients with ACI, suggesting that PLR might be a potential early diagnostic and prognostic marker for ACI. ? 2019 Verlag Klinisches Labor GmbH.

"Multispectral optoacoustic imaging of dynamic redox correlation and pathophysiological progression utilizing upconversion nanoprobes",2019,"Precise and differential profiling of the dynamic correlations and pathophysiological implications of multiplex biological mediators with deep penetration and highly programmed precision remain critical challenges in clinics. Here we present an innovative strategy by tailoring a?powerful multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) technique with a photon-upconverting nanoprobe (UCN) for simultaneous visualization of diversely endogenous redox biomarkers with excellent spatiotemporal resolution in living conditions. Upon incorporating two specific radicals-sensitive NIR cyanine fluorophores onto UCNs surface, such nanoprobes can orthogonally respond to disparate oxidative and nitrosative stimulation, and generate spectrally opposite optoacoustic signal variations, which thus achieves compelling superiorities for reversed ratiometric tracking of multiple radicals under dual independent wavelength channels, and significantly, for precise validating?of their complex dynamics and correlations with redox-mediated pathophysiological procession in vivo. ? 2019, The Author(s).","acetylcysteine; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; erbium; macrogol; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; phosphate buffered saline; polyethyleneimine; biological marker; fluorescent dye; nanoparticle; biomarker; correlation; detection method; imaging method; pathology; physiology; probe; tomography; tracking; visualization; wavelength; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell stimulation; cell viability; chronic disease; controlled study; degradation; energy transfer; glucuronidation; immune response; in vitro study; inflammation; liver toxicity; luminescence; macrophage; mouse; nitrosative stress; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; photoacoustic tomography; photoacoustics; photon; photon correlation spectroscopy; surface property; transmission electron microscopy; zeta potential; administration and dosage; animal; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; disease model; female; heart; human; immunology; kidney; liver; lung; molecular probe; near infrared spectroscopy; nude mouse; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; photoacoustics; photon; procedures; RAW 264.7 cell line; spleen; theranostic nanomedicine; x-ray computed tomography; Animals; Biomarkers; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Fluorescent Dyes; Heart; Humans; Inflammation; Kidney; Liver; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Molecular Probes; Nanoparticles; Oxidation-Reduction; Photoacoustic Techniques; Photons; RAW 264.7 Cells; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Spleen; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"Is the interaction between graphene oxide and minerals reversible?",2019,"The increased applications and production of graphene oxide (GO) make the necessity to study information on the interaction of GO with minerals. In this work, adsorption and desorption were used to study the reversibility of interaction between GO and goethite/kaolinite. Result showed that the pH value, ionic strength, and temperature had significant effects on the adsorption and desorption behavior of GO. Interaction force was stronger between GO and goethite than that of kaolinite. The interaction may be attributed to the electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and Lewis acid base interactions. The irreversible interaction between GO and minerals may be a main mechanism for the observed desorption hysteresis. These results are important for evaluating the fate and health risk of GO in the environment. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Desorption; Graphene oxide; Health risks; Hydrogen bonds; Ionic strength; Kaolinite; Adsorption and desorptions; Desorption hysteresis; Goethite; Interaction; Interaction forces; Lewis acid-base interaction; pH value; Graphene; aluminum silicate; ferric hydroxide; graphene oxide; Lewis acid; ferric hydroxide; graphene oxide; graphite; iron derivative; kaolin; mineral; adsorption; desorption; environmental fate; goethite; health risk; ion; kaolinite; pH; temperature effect; adsorption; Article; chemical interaction; controlled study; desorption; hydrogen bond; hysteresis; ionic strength; pH; temperature; chemistry; osmolarity; Adsorption; Graphite; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron Compounds; Kaolin; Minerals; Osmolar Concentration; Temperature"
"LINC01585 functions as a regulator of gene expression by the CAMP/CREB signaling pathway in breast cancer",2019,"Objective: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women. Nowadays, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified and emerged as critical bio-markers in breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression. However, only a handful of lncRNAs which are implicated in BC have been characterized. The underlying molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. Methods: In this study, we explored 12 nominated lncRNAs at breast cancer susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies to contribute to the risk and effects of breast cancer. We then analyzed these lncRNAs in a total of 132 pairs of breast cancer tissues and surrounding non-tumor tissues from southern China population. Results: Here, we report a novel lncRNA, LINC01585, is aberrantly down regulated during breast cancer (BC). Next, to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of LINC01585, we identified LINC01585 binding protein by RNA pull-down experiments. Functionally, we found that LINC01585 overexpression inhibited breast cancer proliferation and growth by prototypical experiments. Mechanistically, LINC01585 was located in nuclear and binding with NONO protein. Interestingly, when LINC01585 was down-expressed, NONO separated from LINC01585 and then interacted with CRTC. The complex promotes CAMP/CREB target gene transcription and thus promotes the growth of breast cancer. Conclusions: A series of discoveries suggest to us that LINC01585 has a potential value in anti-carcinoma therapy and deserves further investigation. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","cell protein; CREB regulated transcription captivator protein; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; long untranslated RNA; non POU domain containing octamer binding protein; RNA binding protein; unclassified drug; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; long untranslated RNA; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; cell proliferation; cellular distribution; China; clinical article; controlled study; down regulation; ectopic expression; female; gene; gene expression regulation; gene function; gene location; gene locus; gene overexpression; genetic transcription; genome-wide association study; human; human cell; human tissue; LINC01585 gene; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein protein interaction; protein RNA binding; signal transduction; breast tumor; gene expression; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; tumor cell line; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; China; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction"
"Peroxisomal regulation of redox homeostasis and adipocyte metabolism",2019,"Peroxisomes are ubiquitous cellular organelles required for specific pathways of fatty acid oxidation and lipid synthesis, and until recently their functions in adipocytes have not been well appreciated. Importantly, peroxisomes host many oxygen-consumption reactions and play a major role in generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), influencing whole cell redox status. Here, we review recent progress in peroxisomal functions in lipid metabolism as related to ROS/RNS metabolism and discuss the roles of peroxisomal redox homeostasis in adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism. We provide a framework for understanding redox regulation of peroxisomal functions in adipocytes together with testable hypotheses for developing therapies for obesity and the related metabolic diseases. ? 2019 The Authors","lipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; adipocyte; adipogenesis; cell differentiation; cell function; cell metabolism; diabetic obesity; human; insulin signaling; lipid metabolism; metabolic disorder; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; peroxisome; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; Review; signal transduction; white adipose tissue"
"Receptor for advanced glycation end products reveals a mechanism regulating thyroid hormone secretion through the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway",2019,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play a causative role in the complications involved with diabetes mellitus (DM). Nowadays, DM with hypothyroidism (DM-hypothyroidism) is indicative of an ascended tendency in the combined morbidity. In this study, we examine the role of the receptor (RAGE) played for AGEs in thyroid hormone (TH) secretion via the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)/nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Blood samples were collected from patients with type 2 DM (T2DM)-hypothyroidism and from patients with T2DM, followed by detection of serum AGEs level. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of RAGE were analyzed in association with the treatment of high glucose, siRNA against RAGE, AGE, SIRT1, or Nrf2 vector in normal immortalized thyroid Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. Serum of patients with T2DM-hypothyroidism indicated promoted levels of AGEs vs those with just T2DM. Both AGEs and high glucose triggered cellular damage, increased oxidative stress, as well as displayed a decreased survival rate along with TH secretion in the Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. Moreover, AGEs and high glucose also led to RAGE upregulation, both SIRT1 and NRF2 downregulation, and the decreased expression of TH secretion–related proteins in Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. Notably, these alternations induced by the AGEs can be reserved by silencing RAGE or upregulating either SIRT1 or Nrf2, indicating a mechanism of regulating TH secretion through the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway. Collectively, our data proposed that AGEs and high glucose exerted a potent effect on cellular damage and TH deficiency in Nthy-ori 3-1 cells through the RAGE upregulation as well as SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway inactivation. This mechanism may underlie the occurrence of DM-hypothyroidism. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","advanced glycation end product receptor; glucose; sirtuin 1; small interfering RNA; thyroid hormone; transcription factor Nrf2; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; blood sampling; body mass; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell damage; cell survival; comparative study; controlled study; disease duration; down regulation; female; glucose blood level; heterochromatin; human; hypothyroidism; male; middle aged; MTT assay; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oxidative stress; percentage of cells in G2/M phase; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rough endoplasmic reticulum; survival rate; thyroid hormone release; upregulation"
"MicroRNA-4286 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via PTEN regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"It is well-known that phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor which negatively regulates PI3K/AKT signaling and is activated widely in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). However, genetic alterations in PTEN genes are rare, suggesting an undefined mechanism(s) for their suppression. Notably, growing evidence indicates that PTEN can be regulated by microRNAs involved in cancer progression. In this study, we discover that the miR-4286 is overexpressed in NSCLC and negatively regulates the expression of PTEN. Furthermore, we found that miR-4286 reduces PTEN expression by directly binding to PTEN 3′-untranslated region (UTR), thereby inhibiting NSCLC cell proliferation and mobility. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-4286 overexpression was a result of PTEN-mediated activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, our findings elucidate that miR-4286 promotes the tumorigenesis of NSCLC by interacting with PTEN. This miR-4286-mediated upregulation of PTEN might lead to new therapeutic strategies for NSCLC. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Eosinopenia is a predictive factor for the severity of acute ischemic stroke",2019,"Previous data have revealed an association between eosinopenia and mortality of acute ischemic stroke. However, the relationship of eosinopenia with infarct volume, infection rate, and poor outcome of acute ischemic stroke is still unknown. The retrospective study included 421 patients (273 males, 65%; mean age, 68.0 ± 13.0 years) with first acute ischemic stroke who were hospitalized in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China, from January 2017 to February 2018. Laboratory data, neuroimaging results, and modified Rankin Scale scores were collected. Patients were divided into four groups according to their eosinophil percentage level (&lt; 0.4%, 0.4-1.1%, 1.1-2.3%, ? 2.3%). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the percentage of eosinophils was negatively correlated with infarct volume (rs = -0.514, P &lt; 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that eosinopenia predicted a large infarct volume more accurately than neutrophilia; the area under curve was 0.906 and 0.876, respectively; a large infarct was considered as that with a diameter larger than 3 cm and involving more than two major arterial blood supply areas. Logistic regression analysis revealed that eosinophil percentage was an independent risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (P = 0.002). Moreover, eosinophil percentage was significantly associated with large infarct volume, high infection rate (pulmonary and urinary tract infections), and poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt; 3) after adjusting for potential confounding factors (P-trend &lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that eosinopenia has the potential to predict the severity of acute ischemic stroke.

"Dihydrotanshinone exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo through blocking TLR4 dimerization",2019,"Dihydrotanshinone (DHT), one of the major ingredients of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen), displays many bioactivities. However, the activity and underlying mechanism of DHT in anti-inflammation have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activity and molecular mechanism of action of DHT both in vitro and in vivo. Our data showed that DHT significantly decreased the release of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, THP-1 cells, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and altered the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In addition, flow cytometry results indicated that DHT reduced the calcium influx, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO) generation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, DHT suppressed the transcription of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), the expressions of NF-κB proteins, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65, thereby suggesting that the NF-κB pathway played a role in the anti-inflammatory action of DHT. In addition, DHT attenuated LPS-challenged activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity, resulting from interference of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The molecular docking simulation of DHT to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) suggested that DHT binds to the active sites of TLR4 to block TLR4 dimerization, which was further corroborated by cellular thermal shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. Furthermore, the recruitment of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and the expression of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b)-activated kinase 1 (p-TAK1) were disturbed by the inhibition of TLR4 dimerization. Thus, investigating the molecular mechanism of DHT indicated that TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB/MAPK signaling cascades were involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of DHT in vitro. In in vivo mouse models, DHT significantly ameliorated LPS-challenged acute kidney injury, inhibited dimethylbenzene-induced mouse ear oedema, and rescued LPS-induced sepsis in mice. Taken together, our results indicated that DHT exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that DHT may be a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases. ? 2019 The Authors","calcium; cyclooxygenase 2; dexamethasone; dihydrotanshinone; Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; myeloid differentiation factor 88; nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; terpenoid; toll like receptor 4; transcription factor AP 1; transcription factor RelA; transforming growth factor beta activated kinase 1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; 15,16-dihydrotanshinone I; antiinflammatory agent; cytokine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipopolysaccharide; mitogen activated protein kinase; phenanthrene derivative; toll like receptor 4; xylene; acute kidney failure; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; bone marrow derived macrophage; calcium transport; controlled study; cytokine release; dimerization; drug mechanism; drug receptor binding; ear edema; embryo; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nonhuman; nucleocytoplasmic transport; priority journal; protein expression; sepsis; signal transduction; transcription regulation; animal; Bagg albino mouse; edema; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; RAW 264.7 cell line; THP-1 cell line; Acute Kidney Injury; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cytokines; Dimerization; Edema; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; NF-kappa B; Phenanthrenes; RAW 264.7 Cells; Sepsis; THP-1 Cells; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Xylenes"

"Inhibition of the deubiquitinase USP9x induces pre-B cell homeobox 1 (PBX1) degradation and thereby stimulates prostate cancer cell apoptosis",2019,"Chemoresistance is a leading obstacle in effective management of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in PCa chemoresistance could improve treatment of patients with PCa. In the present study, using immune histochemical, chemistry, and precipitation assays with cells from individuals with benign or malignant prostate cancer or established PCa cell lines, we found that the oncogenic transcription factor pre-B cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) promotes PCa cell proliferation and confers to resistance against common anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin. We observed that genetic PBX1 knockdown abrogates this resistance, and further experiments revealed that PBX1 stability was modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. To directly probe the impact of this pathway on PBX1 activity, we screened for PBX1-specific deubiquitinases (Dubs) and found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9x) interacted with and stabilized the PBX1 protein by attenuating its Lys-48 –linked polyubiquitination. Moreover, the USP9x inhibitor WP1130 markedly induced PBX1 degradation and promoted PCa cell apoptosis. The results in this study indicate that PBX1 confers to PCa chemoresistance and identify USP9x as a Dub of PBX1. We concluded that targeting the USP9x/ PBX1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for managing advanced prostate cancer. ? 2019 Liu et al.

"Selective Cell Penetrating Peptide-Functionalized Envelope-Type Chimeric Lipopepsomes Boost Systemic RNAi Therapy for Lung Tumors",2019,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is considered a highly specific and potent biotherapeutic that holds tremendous potential for the treatment of various diseases. The clinical translation of siRNA is, however, greatly impeded by the lack of safe and efficient delivery vehicles in vivo. Here, the development of selective cell penetrating peptide (CPP33)-functionalized chimeric lipopepsomes (CPP33-CLP) for efficient encapsulation and selective delivery of polo-like kinase 1 specific siRNA (siPLK1) to orthotopic A549 human lung tumor in vivo is reported. Interestingly, siRNA is tightly encapsulated into CPP33-CLP with a superb encapsulation efficiency of over 95% owing to the thick strong electrostatic interactions. Notably, siPLK1-loaded CPP33-CLP (siPLK1-CPP33-CLP) is selectively internalized by A549 human lung cancer cells, efficiently escapes from endosomes, and swiftly releases siRNA into the cytoplasm, affording a significant sequence-specific gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, siPLK1-CPP33-CLP exhibits prolonged blood circulation, enhanced tumor accumulation, effective suppression of tumor growth, and considerably elevated survival time of orthotopic A549 human lung tumor-bearing nude mice. These chimeric lipopepsomes appear as an attractive and potent nanoplatform for safe and targeted siRNA delivery. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Molecular Programming of Biodegradable Nanoworms via Ionically Induced Morphology Switch toward Asymmetric Therapeutic Carriers",2019,"Engineering biodegradable nanostructures with precise morphological characteristics is a key objective in nanomedicine. In particular, asymmetric (i.e., nonspherical) nanoparticles are desirable due to the advantageous effects of shape in a biomedical context. Using molecular engineering, it is possible to program unique morphological features into the self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs). However, the criteria of biocompatibility and scalability limit progress due to the prevalence of nondegradable components and the use of toxic solvents during fabrication. To address this shortfall, a robust strategy for the fabrication of morphologically asymmetric nanoworms, comprising biodegradable BCPs, has been developed. Modular BCPs comprising poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly(caprolactone-gradient-trimethylene carbonate) (PEG?PCLgTMC), with a terminal chain of quaternary ammonium-TMC (PTMC-Q), undergo self-assembly via direct hydration into well-defined nanostructures. By controlling the solution ionic strength during hydration, particle morphology switches from spherical micelles to nanoworms (of varying aspect ratio). This ionically-induced switch is driven by modulation of chain packing with salts screening interchain repulsions, leading to micelle elongation.

"Co-delivery of VEGF siRNA and etoposide for enhanced anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferation effect via multi-functional nanoparticles for orthotopic Non-Small cell lung cancer treatment",2019,"Targeting tumor angiogenesis pathway via VEGF siRNA (siVEGF) has shown great potential in treating highly malignant and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, anti-angiogenic monotherapy lacked sufficient antitumor efficacy which suffered from malignant tumor proliferation. Therefore, the combined application of siVEGF and chemotherapeutic agents for simultaneous targeting of tumor proliferation and angiogenesis has been a research hotspot to explore a promising NSCLC therapy regimen. Methods: We designed, for the first time, a rational therapy strategy via intelligently co-delivering siVEGF and chemotherapeutics etoposide (ETO) by multi-functional nanoparticles (NPs) directed against the orthotopic NSCLC. These NPs consisted of cationic liposomes loaded with siVEGF and ETO and then coated with versatile polymer PEGylated histidine-grafted chitosan-lipoic acid (PHCL). We then comprehensively evaluated the anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferation efficiency in the in vitro tumor cell model and in bioluminescent orthotopic lung tumor bearing mice model. Results: The NPs co-delivering siVEGF and ETO exhibited tailor-made surface charge reversal features in mimicking tumor extracellular environment with improved internal tumor penetration capacity and higher cellular internalization. Furthermore, these NPs with flexible particles size triggered by intracellular acidic environment and redox environment showed pinpointed and sharp intracellular cargo release guaranteeing adequate active drug concentration in tumor cells. Enhanced VEGF gene expression silencing efficacy and improved tumor cell anti-proliferation effect were demonstrated in vitro. In addition, the PHCL layer improved the stability of these NPs in neutral environment allowing enhanced orthotopic lung tumor targeting efficiency in vivo. The combined therapy by siVEGF and ETO co-delivered NPs for orthotopic NSCLC simultaneously inhibited tumor proliferation and tumor angiogenesis resulting in more significant suppression of tumor growth and metastasis than monotherapy. Conclusion: Combined application of siVEGF and ETO by the multi-functional NPs with excellent and on-demand properties exhibited the desired antitumor effect on the orthotopic lung tumor. Our work has significant potential in promoting combined anti-angiogenesis therapy and chemotherapy regimen for clinical NSCLC treatment. ?

"Prognostic value of lymphovascular invasion in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis following surgery",2019,"Background: To evaluate the prognostic value of Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (SCCP) following surgery. Patients and methods: This retrospective study analyzed the data of 891 eligible patients with SCCP who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2014, obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The patients were categorized by LVI, age, grade, T stage, lymph nodes status, distant metastasis, regional lymph nodes removed, and surgery. Overall survival (OS) and penile carcinoma-specific survival (PCSS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: The presence of LVI was significantly associated with increased risk of advanced T stage, high grade, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (P < 0.001 for all). In Kaplan-Meier analyses, patients with the presence of LVI had significantly lower OS and PCSS than those with the absence of LVI (P < 0.001 for both,). The presence of LVI was also significantly associated with poorer OS and worse PCSS in patients with Tx + Ta + T1 stage (P = 0.007, P < 0.001), N0 stage (P < 0.001, P = 0.040), grade 1 (P = 0.001, P < 0.001), grade 2 (P = 0.001, P = 0.014), no distant metastasis (P < 0.001 for both), no regional lymph nodes removed (P < 0.001 for both), Non-radical surgery (P < 0.001 for both) and radical surgery(P = 0.037, P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses, the presence of LVI in patients with SCCP following surgery was found to be a significant independent predictor of decreased OS (hazard ratio 1.403, P = 0.039). Conclusions: The LVI status might be a crucial prognostic indicator for overall survival in patients with SCCP. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; advanced cancer; Article; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; clinical feature; controlled study; disease association; distant metastasis; high risk patient; human; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; overall survival; penile carcinoma specific survival; penis carcinoma; prediction; retrospective study; squamous cell carcinoma; cancer registry; female; Kaplan Meier method; pathology; penis tumor; prognosis; squamous cell carcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Penile Neoplasms; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program"
"Ultrasound-guided totally implantable venous access device through the right innominate vein in older patients is safe and reliable",2019,"Aim: Ultrasound guidance has become the routine method for catheterization, dramatically reducing failure and complication rates for totally implantable venous access devices (TIVAD) placement. The aim of the present study was to report the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided right innominate vein TIVAD placement in older patients. Methods: Between September 2015 and September 2017, 55 older patients underwent right innominate vein TIVAD placement under ultrasound guidance. Intraoperative fluoroscopy was always carried out. The technical success rate and complications were recorded and retrospectively analyzed. Results: The technical success rate was 100%. The success rate of the first puncture was 96.36% (53/55).

"Therapeutic effects of ethanolic extract from the green cocoon shell of silkworm: Bombyx mori on type 2 diabetic mice and its hypoglycaemic mechanism",2019,"Diabetes mellitus is a clinically complex disease characterized by hyperglycaemia with disturbances in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of ethanolic extract (EE) from the green cocoon sericin layer of silkworm Bombyx mori on mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its hypoglycaemic mechanisms. The results showed that oral EE for 7 weeks had significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied in vivo. The levels of oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were significantly improved. The hypoglycaemic rate in the 350 mg kg-1 high dosage group was 39.38%. The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote glycolysis. The results clearly indicated that oral EE, especially at a high dose, could improve the glucose metabolism of T2DM by reducing inflammatory reactions, enhancing the antioxidant capacity and insulin sensitivity, and regulating the balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, which means that EE has potential ameliorative effects on T2DM mice. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; glucokinase; glucose; glucose 6 phosphatase; glucose transporter 4; glutathione peroxidase; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insulin; insulin receptor; insulin receptor substrate; interleukin 6; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; malonaldehyde; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); protein kinase B; sericin; superoxide dismutase; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; blood biochemistry; body weight; Bombyx mori; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; down regulation; drug mechanism; drug megadose; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; glycolysis; hemoglobin blood level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; homeostasis model assessment; in vivo study; inflammation; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; insulin tolerance test; lipid storage; liver function; liver histology; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; oxidative stress; pancreas islet beta cell; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; protein expression level; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation"
"Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Drug Response in Dynamic Bioengineered Lung Cancer Microenvironment",2019,"Tumor microenvironment and the interplay of physical and mechanical forces are key determinants of cancer initiation, progression, and response to drug treatment. However, the impact of tumor microenvironment on cancer progression is poorly understood, in large due to the lack of in vitro models that recapitulate the physical aspects of tumor microenvironment. Herein, a simple, dynamic 3D nonsmall cell lung carcinoma culture using a multichannel microfluidic model platform is developed for evaluating the contribution of flow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is found that flow induces changes in cellular morphology and EMT in 2D and 3D when lung cancer A549 cells are cultured on a microfluidic chip under laminar flow for 4–5 days compared to traditional static cultures. The role of dynamic cell culture on chemotherapeutic effects is monitored. Drug response with an existing anti-cancer drug, e.g., erlotinib and an investigational drug (NSC-750212), shows distinct cytotoxic effects in flow compared to static cultures, suggesting a potential influence of flow on drug efficacy in 2D and 3D models. The platform demonstrates the ability to create a dynamic microscale tumor model, which could be explored as a tool for early drug screening and treatment monitoring in cancer and other diseases. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib versus TACE alone for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A propensity score matching study",2019,"Objective: To compare the outcomes of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib versus TACE alone for treating patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This retrospective analysis included all patients receiving either TACE plus sorafenib therapy or TACE alone for unresectable HCC between February 2008 and August 2015 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China. Propensity score matching (PSM) was carried out to reduce bias due to confounding variables. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), calculated from the date of the first TACE treatment until the date of death of any cause. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted to examine determinants of OS. Results: A total of 308 patients were included in the study: 61 receiving TACE plus sorafenib treatment and 247 receiving TACE monotherapy. The PSM cohort included 61 subjects receiving TACE plus sorafenib and 122 subjects receiving TACE alone. In the overall analysis that included all patients, the median OS in the combination group was significantly longer than that in the monotherapy group (29.0 ± 7.2 vs. 14.9 ± 1.1 months; P = 0.008). In the PCM cohort, the median OS was also significantly longer in the combination group (29.0 ± 7.2 vs. 14.9 ± 1.5 months; P = 0.018). Subgroup analysis revealed longer OS in patients receiving combination treatment in both the BCLC-B and BCLC-C subgroups (P < 0.05 for both). Multivariate analyses in the PSM cohort revealed that treatment methods (P = 0.003), number of nodules (P = 0.010), tumor size (P = 0.012), vascular invasion (P = 0.005), and number of TACE (P = 0.029) were independent prognostic factors of OS. The most common adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (75.4%) and diarrhea (47.5%) in the combination group, and fatigue (19.0%) and liver dysfunction (18.2%) in the monotherapy group. There were no treatment-related deaths in either group. Conclusion: The combined use of TACE and sorafenib is generally well tolerated and could significantly increase OS of patients with unresectable HCC. ? Ivyspring International Publisher.

"Plasma C-type lectin-like receptor 2 as a predictor of death and vascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke",2019,"Background and purpose: C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) has prominent involvement in platelet activation, which is increased in coronary heart disease and acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and is associated with stroke progression and stroke prognosis. Here, the aim was to examine the prognostic value of CLEC-2 in death and vascular event recurrence in AIS patients. Methods: In all, 352 patients with AIS were studied prospectively. All patients were followed up for 1?year. Death for all vascular events and a combination of death and vascular diseases (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalized and treated angina, hospitalized and treated peripheral arterial disease) were recorded. Results: During 1?year of follow-up, 46 patients (14.2%) experienced death or combined end-points (23 death and 46 combined end-points). Plasma CLEC-2 (pCLEC-2) was significantly associated with an increased risk of death and combined events of death and vascular diseases after adjusting for age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores. Each 1 SD higher log-transformed pCLEC-2 was associated with a 4.27-fold (hazard ratio 4.27, 95% confidence interval 1.71–10.65) increased risk for death and a 2.42-fold increased risk for combined end-points (hazard ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.52–3.86). The optimal cut-off point of pCLEC-2 for predicting death was 184.38?pg/ml. Conclusions: Higher pCLEC-2 levels at admission were associated with increased risk of death and combined events of death and vascular diseases in patients with AIS, which indicated that pCLEC-2 is an important prognostic factor for AIS. ?

"Substrate stiffness- and topography-dependent differentiation of annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells is regulated by Yes-associated protein",2019,"Annulus fibrosus (AF) tissue engineering has attracted increasing attention as a promising therapy for degenerative disc disease (DDD). However, regeneration of AF still faces many challenges due to the tremendous complexity of this tissue and lack of in-depth understanding of the structure-function relationship at cellular level within AF is highly required. In light of the fact that AF is composed of various types of cells and has gradient mechanical, topographical and biochemical features along the radial direction. In this study, we aimed to achieve directed differentiation of AF-derived stem cells (AFSCs) by mimicking the mechanical and topographical features of native AF tissue. AFSCs were cultured on four types of electrospun poly(ether carbonate urethane)urea (PECUU) scaffolds with various stiffness and fiber size (soft, small size; stiff, small size; soft, large size and stiff, large size). The results show that with constant fiber size, the expression level of the outer AF (oAF) phenotypic marker genes in AFSCs increased with the scaffold stiffness, while that of inner AF (iAF) phenotypic marker genes showed an opposite trend. When scaffold stiffness was fixed, the expression of oAF phenotypic marker genes in AFSCs increased with fiber size. While the expression of iAF phenotypic marker genes decreased. Such substrate stiffness- and topography-dependent changes of AFSCs was in accordance with the genetic and biochemical distribution of AF tissue from the inner to outer regions. Further, we found that the Yes-associated protein (YAP) was translocated to the nucleus in AFSCs cultured with increasing stiffness and fiber size of scaffolds, yet it remained mostly phosphorylated and cytosolic in cells on soft scaffolds with small fiber size. Inhibition of YAP down-regulated the expression of tendon/ligament-related genes, whereas expression of the cartilage-related genes was upregulated. The results illustrate that matrix stiffness is a potent regulator of AFSC differentiation. Moreover, we reveal that fiber size of scaffolds induced changes in cell adhesions and determined cell shape, spreading area, and extracellular matrix expression. In all, both mechanical property and topography features of scaffolds regulate AFSC differentiation, possibly through a YAP-dependent mechanotransduction mechanism. Statement of Significance: Physical cues such as mechanical properties, topographical and geometrical features were shown to profoundly impact the growth and differentiation of cultured stem cells. Previously, we have found that the differentiation of annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs) could be regulated by the stiffness of scaffold. In this study, we fabricated four types of poly(ether carbonate urethane)urea (PECUU) scaffolds with controlled stiffness and fiber size to explore the potential of induced differentiation of AFSCs. We found that AFSCs are able to present different gene expression patterns simply as a result of the stiffness and fiber size of scaffold material. This work has, for the first time, demonstrated that larger-sized and higher-stiffness substrates increase the amount of vinculin assembly and activate YAP signaling in pre-differentiated AFSCs. The present study affords an in-depth comprehension of materiobiology, and be helpful for explain the mechanism of YAP mechanosensing in AF in response to biophysical effects of materials. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","protein; unclassified drug; yes associated protein; annulus fibrosus; annulus fibrosus derived stem cell; Article; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell isolation; cell proliferation; cell shape; cell spreading; cell structure; electrospinning; extracellular matrix; gene expression; human; image analysis; immunohistochemistry; Leporidae; mechanotransduction; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; rigidity; Western blotting"
"The caspase-3/PKCd/Akt/VEGF-A signaling pathway mediates tumor repopulation during radiotherapy",2019,"Purpose: Tumor repopulation is known as a major cause of treatment failure and/or tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. The underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that irradiated apoptotic cells mediated tumor repopulation, in which caspase-3 played an important role. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of caspase- 3 involved in this process. Experimental Design: A dominant-negative protein kinase Cδ (DN-PKCδ) mutant that could not be cleaved by caspase-3 and therefore could not be activated by irradiation-induced apoptosis was constructed. DN-PKCδ stably transduced tumor cells were compared with wild-type tumor cells for their growth stimulation effects in in vitro and in vivo tumor repopulation models. Downstream effectors of caspase-3 and PKCδ were investigated. The role of PKCδ was further verified in human colorectal tumor specimens. Results: Inactivation of caspase-3 or caspase-7 attenuated tumor repopulation and weakened PKCδ cleavage. Both DN-PKCδ and PKCδ inhibitors restrained tumor repopulation both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated Akt was attenuated in caspase-3-, caspase-7-, or PKCδ-inactivated tumor cells. Furthermore, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A but not hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a) was decreased in PKCδ- or Akt-inactivated tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of p-Akt, HIF1a, VEGF-A, or VEGF-A receptor reduced tumor repopulation significantly. Finally, increased nuclear translocation of PKCδ in colorectal tumor specimens was associated with worse patient prognosis. Conclusions: The caspase-3/PKCδ/Akt/VEGF-A axis is involved in tumor repopulation and could be exploited as a potential target to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","caspase 3; caspase 7; protein kinase B; protein kinase C delta; vasculotropin A; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; clinical effectiveness; colorectal tumor; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; enzyme phosphorylation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein transport; signal transduction; treatment failure; tumor cell; tumor growth; tumor recurrence; tumor repopulation"
"Relationship between trait neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women in China: Testing a mediation model",2019,"Background: Suicidal ideation is a common phenomenon among postpartum women around the world. However, evidence of the relationship between neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women is still lacking. Methods: From March 2017 to December 2018, a total of 1027 postpartum women (assessed no later than one month post-birth) were recruited to complete questionnaires assessing neuroticism, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Results: Anxiety and depression fully mediated the association between neuroticism and suicidal ideation (Total indirect effects = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.15). The indirect effect of the pathway of EPQ (Neuroticism)-Anxiety-Suicidal ideation was more significant than other pathways (Indirect effects=0.04, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.07).

"MicroRNA-621 Acts as a Tumor Radiosensitizer by Directly Targeting SETDB1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma",2019,"Radiotherapy is one of the most important treatment methods of tumors. However, the application of radiotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited due to the low tolerance of normal liver cells for radiation and inherent radiation resistance in HCC. With the in-depth study of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor therapy, the regulation of tumor radiosensitivity by miRNAs has been a research hotspot in recent years. In the present study, the expression of miR-621 was lower in HCC tissues and cells, and such low expression of miR-621 was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In addition, in vivo and in vitro assays confirmed that the high expression of miR-621 could significantly enhance the radiosensitivity of HCC. Moreover, the expressions of miR-621 and SETDB1 in HCC tissues were negatively correlated. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-621 could directly target the 3′ UTR of SETDB1. In addition, miR-621 enhanced the radiosensitivity of HCC cells via directly inhibiting SETDB1. Besides, the miR-621 and/or SETDB1 axis improved the radiosensitivity of HCC cells via activating the p53-signaling pathway. Taken together, miR-621 and/or SETDB1 might be used as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. ? 2018 The Author(s)The application of radiotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited due to the low tolerance of normal liver cells for radiation and inherent radiation resistance in HCC.

"Textile-Based Wireless Pressure Sensor Array for Human-Interactive Sensing",2019,"A textile-based wireless pressure sensor array (WiPSA) is proposed for flexible remote tactile sensing applications. The WiPSA device is composed of a fabric spacer sandwiched by two separate layers of passive antennas and ferrite film units. Under the external pressure, the mechanical compression of the flexible fabric spacer leads to an inductance change, which can further be transduced to a detectable shift of the resonant frequency. Importantly, WiPSA integrates the ferrite film featuring an ultrahigh permeability, which effectively improves the device sensitivity and avoids the interference of conductive materials simultaneously. The device performance with a high quality factor (&gt;35) and sensitivity (?0.19 MHz kPa?1) within a pressure range of 0–20 kPa is demonstrated. In addition, WiPSA achieves excellent reproducibility under periodical pressures (&gt;20 000 cycles), temperature fluctuations (15–103 °C), and humidity variations (40–99%). As a proof of concept for human-interactive sensing, WiPSA is successfully 1) integrated with a flexible wrist band for fingertip pressure-guided direction choices, 2) developed into a smart wireless insole to map the plantar stress distributions, and 3) embedded into a waist-supporting belt to resolve the contact pressure between the belt and human abdomen in a remote transmitting scheme. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Zwitterionic shielded polymeric prodrug with folate-targeting and pH responsiveness for drug delivery",2019,"Zwitterionic polymers are a class of polymers that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid in solution. These polymers not only have excellent properties of hydration, anti-bacterial adhesion, charge reversal and easy chemical modification, but also have characteristics of long-term circulation and suppress nonspecific protein adsorption in vivo. Here, we describe a novel folate-targeted and acid-labile polymeric prodrug under the microenvironment of tumor cells, abbreviated as FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX, which was synthesized via a combination of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization, Schiff-base reaction, Click chemistry, and a reaction between the amine group of doxorubicin (DOX) and aldehyde functionalities of P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ) pendants, wherein MPC and PEGMA-BZ represent 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine and polyethylene glycol methacrylate ester benzaldehyde, respectively. The polymeric prodrug could self-assemble into nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. The average particle size and morphologies of the prodrug nanoparticles were observed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. We also investigated the in vitro drug release behavior and observed rapid prodrug nanoparticle dissociation and drug release under a mildly acidic microenvironment. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay verified that the P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ) copolymer possessed good biocompatibility and the FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX prodrug nanoparticles showed higher cellular uptake than those prodrug nanoparticles without the FA moiety. The results of cytotoxicity and the intracellular uptake of non-folate/folate targeted prodrug nanoparticles further confirmed that FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX could be efficiently accumulated and rapidly internalized by HeLa cells due to the strong interaction between multivalent phosphorylcholine (PC) groups and cell membranes. This kind of multifunctional FA-P(MPC-co-PEGMA-BZ)-g-DOX prodrug nanoparticle with combined target-ability and pH responsiveness demonstrates promising potential for cancer chemotherapy. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Biocompatibility; Chemical modification; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Dynamic light scattering; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lanthanum compounds; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Polymers; Acidic microenvironment; Average particle size; Intracellular uptake; Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays; Non-specific protein adsorption; Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer; Schiff base reaction; Zwitterionic polymers; Targeted drug delivery"
"Prostate Cancer Differentiation and Aggressiveness: Assessment With a Radiomic-Based Model vs. PI-RADS v2",2019,"Background: Multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) combined with machine-aided approaches have shown high accuracy and sensitivity in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. However, radiomics-based analysis has not been thoroughly compared with Prostate Imaging and Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) scores. Purpose: To develop and validate a radiomics-based model for differentiating PCa and assessing its aggressiveness compared with PI-RADS v2 scores. Study Type: Retrospective. Population: In all, 182 patients with biopsy-proven PCa and 199 patients with a biopsy-proven absence of cancer were enrolled in our study. Field Strength/Sequence: Conventional and diffusion-weighted MR images (b values = 0, 1000 sec/mm 2 ) were acquired on a 3.0T MR scanner. Assessment: A total of 396 features and 385 features were extracted from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images and T 2 WI, respectively. A predictive model was constructed for differentiating PCa from non-PCa and high-grade from low-grade PCa. The diagnostic performance of each radiomics-based model was compared with that of the PI-RADS v2 scores. Statistical Tests: A radiomics-based predictive model was constructed by logistic regression analysis. 70% of the patients were assigned to the training group, and the remaining were assigned to the validation group. The diagnostic efficacy was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in both the training and validation groups. Results: For PCa versus non-PCa, the validation model had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.985, 0.982, and 0.999 with T 2 WI, ADC, and T 2 WI&amp;ADC features, respectively. For low-grade versus high-grade PCa, the validation model had an AUC of 0.865, 0.888, and 0.93 with T 2 WI, ADC, and T 2 WI&amp;ADC features, respectively. PI-RADS v2 had an AUC of 0.867 in differentiating PCa from non-PCa and an AUC of 0.763 in differentiating high-grade from low-grade PCa. Data Conclusion: Both the T 2 WI- and ADC-based radiomics models showed high diagnostic efficacy and outperformed the PI-RADS v2 scores in distinguishing cancerous vs. noncancerous prostate tissue and high-grade vs. low-grade PCa.

"Elevated SUV39H2 attributes to the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma via regulation of NRIP1",2019,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent tumor in southern China and southeast Asia. Recent studies have demonstrated that viral infection, somatic genetic changes, and epigenetic changes synergistically contribute to NPC pathogenesis. Genome-wide studies show that epigenetic aberrations likely drive nasopharyngeal carcinoma development and progression. This work is aimed at investigating the effect of histone methyltransferase SUV39H2 in NPC. The elevated expression of SUV39H2 in NPC is observed by analyzing GSE53819 and GSE12452 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. SUV39H2 knockdown inhibits NPC proliferation and induces the apoptosis of cancer cells. At last, RNaseq analysis identifies a variety of SUV39H2 downstream genes related with cancer, in which, NRIP1 is identified as a critical downstream target of SUV39H2 in NPC. Taken together, these findings provide a theoretical basis for understating the biological roles of SUV39H2 in NPC. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","histone methyltransferase; histone methyltransferase SUV39H2; receptor interacting protein 140; unclassified drug; histone lysine methyltransferase; NRIP1 protein, human; receptor interacting protein 140; SUV39H2 protein, human; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; carcinoma cell; cell proliferation; controlled study; downstream processing; gene; gene expression; gene knockdown; genetic database; human; human cell; human tissue; nasopharynx carcinoma; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein depletion; protein expression; protein targeting; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; cell survival; disease exacerbation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genome-wide association study; metabolism; nasopharynx carcinoma; nasopharynx tumor; tumor cell line; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Databases, Genetic; Disease Progression; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1; Sequence Analysis, RNA"
"BCL2 overexpression: Clinical implication and biological insights in acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"Background: BCL2 protein inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199) has been authorized by Food and Drug Administration for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphoid leukemia with 17p deletion. Although venetoclax/ABT-199 also caused cell death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whether it could be applied to clinical treatment needs further studies. Here, we revealed clinical implication of BCL2 overexpression in de novo adult AML, and may provide theoretical basis for targeted therapy using venetoclax. Methods: BCL2 expression was analyzed in adult AML patients from public datasets The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and confirmed by another independent cohort from our own data. Results: BCL2 expression showed up-regulated in AML patients among TCGA data and confirmed by our own data. BCL2 overexpression was correlated with FAB-M0/M1, whereas BCL2 under-expression was related to FAB-M5. However, BCL2 expression has no effect on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of AML patients (determined in BCL2 low and BCL2 high groups). Interestingly, in the BCL2 low group, patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto/allo-HSCT) had significantly better OS and LFS compared with patients only received chemotherapy, whereas, no significant difference was found in OS and LFS between chemotherapy and auto/allo-HSCT patients in the BCL2 high group. BCL2 expression was found positively correlated with HOX family gene, and negatively correlated with tumor suppressor microRNA such as miR-195, miR-497, and miR-193b. Conclusions: BCL2 overexpression identified specific FAB subtypes of AML, but it did not affect prognosis. Patients with BCL2 overexpression did not benefit from auto/allo-HSCT among whole-cohort-AML and cytogenetically normal AML. ? 2019 The Author(s).",""
"High glucose–induced ubiquitination of G6PD leads to the injury of podocytes",2019,"Oxidative stress contributes substantially to podocyte injury, which plays an important role in the development of diabetic kidney disease. The mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in podocytes is not fully understood. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is critical in maintaining NADPH, which is an important cofactor for the antioxidant system. Here, we hypothesized that high glucose induced ubiquitination and degradation of G6PD, which injured podocytes by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. We found that G6PD protein expression was decreased in kidneys of both diabetic patients and diabetic rodents. G6PD activity was also reduced in diabetic mice. Overexpressing G6PD reversed redox imbalance and podocyte apoptosis induced by high glucose and palmitate. Inhibition of G6PD with small interfering RNA induced podocyte apoptosis. In kidneys of G6PD-deficient mice, podocyte apoptosis was significantly increased. Interestingly, high glucose had no effect on G6PD mRNA expression. Decreased G6PD protein expression was mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. We found that the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit, directly bound to G6PD and degraded G6PD through ubiquitylating G6PD on K366 and K403. In summary, our data suggest that high glucose induces ubiquitination of G6PD by VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, which leads to ROS accumulation and podocyte injury.—Wang, M., Hu, J., Yan, L., Yang, Y., He, M., Wu, M., Li, Q., Gong, W., Yang, Y., Wang, Y., Handy, D.

"Up-regulation of long noncoding RNA MINCR promotes non-small cell of lung cancer growth by negatively regulating miR-126/SLC7A5 axis",2019,"A growing body of evidence suggests that MYC induced long noncoding RNA (MINCR) is involved in the initiation and progression of various tumors. However, little is known about the biological function and clinical value of MINCR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, results found that MINCR over expression in NSCLC tissue and cell lines was closely related to poor survival in NSCLC. Functional experiments found that decreased MINCR expression inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and migration and promotes cells apoptosis. Tumor formation assay found that knockdown of MINCR significantly inhibited tumor growth. Results also found that MINCR functions as an oncogene in the metastasis of NSCLC, in part, by acting as a competing endogenous RNA to modulate the miR-126/SLC7A5 axis. Dysfunction of MINCR, miR-126 and SLC7A5 predicted poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC. In conclusion, results suggest that the MINCR-miR-126-SLC7A5 axis plays an important role in the progression of NSCLC and may serve as a potential target for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","amino acid transporter; long untranslated RNA; microRNA 126; MINCR; SLC7A5 protein; unclassified drug; amino acid transporter; long non-coding RNA MINCR, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN126 microRNA, human; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; male; metastasis; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; upregulation; 3' untranslated region; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell motion; down regulation; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; nucleotide sequence; nude mouse; pathology; prognosis; signal transduction; tumor cell line; 3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Apoptosis; Base Sequence; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Prognosis; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction; Up-Regulation"
"Alpha-enolase promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via regulating AKT signaling pathway",2019,"Increased aerobic glycolysis is considered as a hallmark of cancer and targeting key glycolytic enzymes will be a promising therapeutic approach in cancer treatment. Alpha-enolase (ENO1), as a prominent glycolytic enzyme, is upregulated in multiple cancers and its overexpression is involved in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of ENO1 in the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). Here, we found that ENO1 expression was upregulated in human GC and was associated with Lauren type, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TNM stage. Knockdown of ENO1 attenuated GC cell proliferation and metastasis and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress in vitro while ENO1 overexpression did the opposite. ENO1 could modulate AKT signaling pathway in GC cells and the enhanced proliferation and migration ability induced by ENO1 overexpression was impaired after incubation with PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 in SGC7901 cells. Our data demonstrated that ENO1 enhances GC cell proliferation and metastasis through the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, indicating that ENO1/AKT signaling axis may serve as a potential target for treatment of GC. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; alpha enolase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; DNA binding protein; ENO1 protein, human; enolase; protein kinase B; tumor marker; tumor suppressor protein; adult; aged; Akt signaling; Article; cancer cell; cancer growth; cancer staging; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme induction; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene knockdown; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; SGC-7901 cell line; stomach cancer; cell proliferation; gene expression regulation; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycolysis; Humans; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Phosphopyruvate Hydratase; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Stomach Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"HLA-mismatched stem cell microtransplantation compared to matched-sibling donor transplantation for intermediate/high-risk acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"HLA-mismatched stem cell microtransplantation is a new form of transplantation reported in recent years. We compared 59 patients undergoing microtransplantation to 66 patients undergoing HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) transplantation at the same period from April 2012 to December 2016, who all suffered from intermediate/high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1).

The estimated leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2?years was 73.3% ± 6.1% in the MSD group and 31.6% ± 7.6% in the microtransplantation group (P = 0.000). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 17.6% and 62.3% in the MSD and microtransplantation groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). The 2-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 10.9% in MSD group and 4.2% in the microtransplantation group (P = 0.251). Hematopoietic recovery time was shorter in the microtransplantation group than in the MSD group (P < 0.05). The infection rate was higher in the MSD group than in the microtransplantation group (P = 0.012).

"The Effects of Long-term CPAP on Weight Change in Patients With Comorbid OSA and Cardiovascular Disease: Data From the SAVE Trial",2019,"Background: Although recent evidence suggests that OSA treatment may cause weight gain, the long-term effects of CPAP on weight are not well established. Methods: This study was a post hoc analysis of the Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) study, a multicenter, randomized trial of CPAP plus standard care vs standard care alone in adults with a history of cardiac or cerebrovascular events and moderate to severe OSA. Participants with weight, BMI, and neck and waist circumferences measured at baseline and during follow-up were included. Linear mixed models were used to examine sex-specific temporal differences, and a sensitivity analysis compared high CPAP adherers (? 4 h per night) with propensity-matched control participants. Results: A total of 2,483 adults (1,248 in the CPAP group and 1,235 in the control group) were included (mean 6.1 ± 1.5 measures of weight available). After a mean follow-up of 3.78 years, there was no difference in weight change between the CPAP and control groups, for male subjects (mean [95% CI] between-group difference, 0.07 kg [–0.40 to 0.54]; P =.773) or female subjects (mean [95% CI] between-group difference, –0.14 kg [–0.37 to 0.09]; P =.233). Similarly, there were no significant differences in BMI or other anthropometric measures. Although male participants who used CPAP ? 4 h per night gained slightly more weight than matched male control subjects without CPAP (mean difference, 0.38 kg [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.73]; P =.031), there were no between-group differences in other anthropometric variables, nor were there any differences between female high CPAP adherers and matched control subjects. Conclusions: Long-term CPAP use in patients with comorbid OSA and cardiovascular disease does not result in clinically significant weight change.

"Emerging predictors of the response to the blockade of immune checkpoints in cancer therapy",2019,"Checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy offers new options and powerful weapons for the treatment of cancer, but its efficacy varies greatly among different types of cancer and across individual patients. Thus, the development of the right tools that can be used to identify patients who could benefit from this therapy is of utmost importance in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit, minimize risk of toxicities, and guide combination approaches. Multiple predictors have emerged that are based on checkpoint receptor ligand expression, tumor mutational burden, neoantigen and microsatellite instability, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and peripheral blood biomarkers.

"Beyond energy harvesting - multi-functional triboelectric nanosensors on a textile",2019,"To accurately evaluate the wellbeing condition of a person, sensing systems with versatile functions are needed. Apart from directly monitoring vital signs, an indirect monitoring approach by measuring human activities with wearable devices has emerged. Herein, a smart textile fabricated with a simple dip coating method is developed with multiple functionalities, such as energy harvesting, physical sensing, and even gas sensing. A maximum output power density of 2 W m?2 is achieved with a layer of PEDOT: PSS coated textile and PTFE under foot stepping at 2 Hz, and the matched impedance is as low as 14 MΩ. A height-varying multi-arch strain sensor with a large strain sensing range from 10% to 160% is developed. Furthermore, the arch-shaped strain sensors mounted on the human fingers are demonstrated to monitor hand gestures for American Sign Language interpretation and robotic hand control. Additionally, four textile-based sensors located at different body parts are employed to track human activities. Beyond that, the smart textile is also demonstrated to be a building block of a wearable CO2 sensor. Looking forward, this smart textile could be incorporated into real clothes as both energy harvesters and various functional self-powered sensors to enable smart clothes for healthcare monitoring applications. ? 2018","Arches; Conducting polymers; Energy harvesting; Sensors; Smart textiles; Textiles; Triboelectricity; American sign language; Healthcare monitoring; Large strain sensing; Maximum output power densities; Monitoring approach; PEDOT:PSS; Self-powered; Triboelectric; Wearable sensors"
"Overexpression of zeb2-as1 lncrna is associated with poor clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a fatal hematopoietic malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. To determine whether the expression of the long non-coding (lnc)RNA zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) antisense RNA 1 (ZEB2-AS1) is associated with clinical outcomes, its expression was analyzed in a retrospective cohort of 62 AML and 10 non-malignant cases. The results revealed that the expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA was notably high and closely associated with adverse clinical outcomes in AML cases compared with the non-malignant cases, based on either modified Medical Research Council or European Leukemia Net risk stratification systems. Univariate analyses indicated that patients with a higher expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (P=0.036) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates (P=0.039) compared with patients with a lower expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA. In addition, patients with a higher expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA had a significant lower complete remission rate in response to induction by chemotherapy compared with patients with a lower expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA (P=0.031). In cases with low levels of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA, patients treated with allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had significantly longer OS and DFS rates compared with that of chemotherapy-treated patients (P=0.037 and P=0.049 respectively). Furthermore, the knockdown of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA effectively inhibited AML cell invasion and migration, which was closely associated with the downregulation of ZEB2 and upregulation of E-cadherin expression. Collectively, although its independent prognostic value for survival was not rigorously determined, ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA may function as a candidate marker to improve conventional risk stratification systems and the evaluation of therapeutic responses for AML. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"First-line continual EGFR-TKI plus local ablative therapy demonstrated survival benefit in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease",2019,"Introduction: The effect of local ablative therapy (LAT) for oligoprogressive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains undetermined. This study aimed to investigate the survival benefit of addition of LAT to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogression during TKI therapy. Materials and Methods: Patients with stage IIIB/IV EGFR mutant NSCLC who had oligoprogressive disease during the first-line EGFR-TKI therapy from March 2011 to February 2016 were identified. The primary research point were progression-free survival1 (PFS1), defined as time of initiation of TKI therapy to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 defined progress disease (PD) or death and PFS2, defined as time of initiation of TKI therapy to off-TKI PD. The second research piont inclued overal survival (OS) and safety. Results: A total of 206 patients were included. The median follow-up time was 42 months (20.0-69.6 months). The median PFS1, median PFS2 and median OS for the related cohort were 10.7 months (95% CI, 10.1-13.3 months), 18.3 months (95% CI, 17.4-19.2 months) and 37.4 months (95% CI, 35.9-38.9 months) respectively. Survival rates of 1 year, 2 years and 3 years were 94.1%, 78.9%, and 54.7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that female, EGFR exon 19 mutation, one metastatic lesion, partial or complete response to prior EGFR TKIs therapy were the independent prognostic factors. No unexpected toxicities were observed.

"Circulating spexin decreased and negatively correlated with systemic insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β cell function in obese children",2019,"Objectives: Spexin (SPX) is a novel peptide that has recently emerged as an important regulatory adipokine of obesity and related metabolic disease. Little is known about its role in children. The aim of the current study was to determine the potential role of SPX in obese children and explore its relationships with obesity-related markers, insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β cell function. Method: We studied the levels of serum SPX in 40 obese and 32 normal weight pre-puberty children (mean age was 8.59 ± 1.82 and 8.15 ± 2.03 years in obesity and control groups respectively). We investigated the levels of body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, glucose, insulin, Homeostasis model assessment for insulin-resistant (HOMA-IR, HOMA for β-cell function [HOMA-β]), insulinogenic index and C-peptide index and analyzed their correlations with SPX levels. Results: SPX levels were significantly decreased in obese children compared to controls. Moreover, serum SPX levels were lower in IR obese subjects in contrast with the non-IR obese subjects. Serum SPX concentrations correlated negatively and significantly with triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin level, HOMA-IR, insulinogenic index, and HOMA-β levels in obese children. Conclusions: In summary, serum SPX levels significantly decreased in obese children and negatively correlated with insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell function indicators. Therefore, SPX may play a protective role in the process of glucose homeostasis and is closely related to β cell function in obese children. ? 2019 S.

"Comparison of Ivor-Lewis versus Sweet procedure for middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A STROBE compliant study",2019,"Our study compared the Ivor-Lewis and Sweet procedures used for treating middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and assessed the associated perioperative complications and long-term survival rates of the patients.This retrospective study involved 624 middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous carcinoma patients who received either Ivor-Lewis (n=325) or Sweet (n=299) procedures at our hospital. Further, the perioperative conditions and long-term survival rates were analyzed for both groups.Relative to the Sweet group, the Ivor-Lewis group showed lower volume of drainage within 24hours after operation (400 (300-500) ml vs 550 (400-658) ml, P=.031). Although we found no significant differences in major postoperative complications between the groups (72 (22.2) vs 65 (21.7), P=.90), there were significant differences observed in minor postoperative complications between the Ivor-Lewis and Sweet groups (59 (18.2) vs 32 (10.7), P=.008). Perioperative death rates remained comparable for the 2 groups (2 (0.6) vs 2 (0.7), P>.99). Further, comparison of the 2 groups revealed that the Ivor-Lewis group had increased number of dissected lymph nodes, (20 (4-42) vs 16 (3-31), P<.001), especially in the upper mediastinum (4 (0-5) vs 2 (0-2), P<.001). The long-term survival rates did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (Kaplan-Meier method, P=.95; Cox regression, P=.20).These findings suggest that perioperative complications and long-term survival rates were comparable for both patients groups. Patients receiving the Sweet procedure had reduced minor postoperative complications compared to those receiving the Ivor-Lewis procedure. Due to improved quality of lymph node dissection in the upper mediastinum, the Ivor-Lewis procedure may have advantages over the Sweet procedure for treating patients with esophageal cancer with enlarged lymph nodes in the upper mediastinum. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Over-expression of Nectin-4 promotes progression of esophageal cancer and correlates with poor prognosis of the patients",2019,"Background: Nectin-4, also known as PVRL4 (poliovirus-receptor-like 4), is specifically expressed in the embryo and placenta. Recent studies have reported that the Nectin-4 is over-expressed in multiple human cancers, and such abnormal expression is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis of the patients. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the expression pattern of Nectin-4 in human esophageal cancer (EC) tissues, and to investigate its clinical implications, prognostic value and regulatory effects on cellular functions of EC cells. Methods: In the present study, we first examined Nectin-4 expression in human EC tissues by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay and analyzed the clinical associations. Then the cellular studies in vitro and the nude mice tumor model in vivo were used to examine the regulatory role of Nectin-4 in the progression of EC. Results: Our results demonstrated that over-expression of Nectin-4 in human EC tissues was significantly associated with tumor size, depth of tumor invasion, and poor prognosis of the patients. The intervention of Nectin-4 expression in EC cell lines showed that the increased Nectin-4 expression could significantly promote the cell viability, migration, invasion and tumor formation. Conclusions: Our present data unveiled that Nectin-4 played an important role in tumor biology and could serve as a useful prognostic predictor of human EC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","messenger RNA; nectin; nectin 4; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cell function; cell migration; cell viability; controlled study; esophageal cancer cell line; esophagus cancer; female; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; major clinical study; male; mouse; nonhuman; prediction; protein expression; protein function; tumor invasion; tumor volume; upregulation"
"The role of Nav1.7 and methylglyoxal-mediated activation of TRPA1 in itch and hypoalgesia in a murine model of type 1 diabetes",2019,"Methylglyoxal (MGO), an endogenous reactive carbonyl compound, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of MGO in diabetic itch and hypoalgesia, two common symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy. Methods: Scratching behavior, mechanical itch (alloknesis), and thermal hypoalgesia were quantified after intradermal (i.d.) injection of MGO in na?ve mice or in diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Behavioral testing, patch-clamp recording, transgenic mice, and gene expression analysis were used to investigate the mechanisms underlying diabetic itch and hypoalgesia in mice. Results: I.d. injection of MGO evoked dose-dependent scratching in normal mice. Addition of MGO directly activated transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) to induce inward currents and calcium influx in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons or in TRPA1-expressing HEK293 cells. Mechanical itch, but not spontaneous itch was developed in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Genetic ablation of Trpa1 (Trpa1-/-), pharmacological blockade of TRPA1 and Nav1.7, antioxidants, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase enzyme (MEK) inhibitor U0126 abrogated itch induced by MGO or in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Thermal hypoalgesia was induced by intrathecal (i.t.) injection of MGO or in STZ-induced diabetic mice, which was abolished by MGO scavengers, intrathecal injection of TRPA1 blockers, and in Trpa1-/- mice. Conclusion: This study revealed that Nav1.7 and MGO-mediated activation of TRPA1 play key roles in itch and hypoalgesia in a murine model of type 1 diabetes. Thereby, we provide a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of itch and hypoalgesia induced by diabetic neuropathy. ?

"MicroRNA-335/ID4 dysregulation predicts clinical outcome and facilitates leukemogenesis by activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"MircoRNA-335 (miR-335) has been reported as a significant cancer-associated microRNA, which was often epigenetically silenced and acted as a tumor suppressor gene in diverse human solid tumors. Conversely, recent studies show that miR-335 overexpression was identified in both adult and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that it might play an oncogenic role of miR-335 in AML. However, the role of miR-335 during leukemogenesis remains to be elucidated. MiR-335/ID4 expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR and/or western blot. Survival analysis was performed to explore the association between miR-335/ID4 expression and the prognosis, and further validated by public databases. Gain-of-function experiments determined by cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation were conducted to investigate the biological functions of miR-335/ID4. Herein, we found that miR-335 expression, independent of its methylation, was significantly increased and negatively correlated with reduced ID4 expression in AML. Moreover, aberrant miR-335/ID4 expression independently affected chemotherapy response and leukemia-free/overall survival in patients with AML. Gain-of-function experiments in vitro showed the oncogenic role of miR-335 by affecting cell apoptosis and proliferation in AML, and could be rescued by ID4 restoration. Mechanistically, we identified and verified that miR-335/ID4 contributed to leukemogenesis through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, aberrant miR-335/ID4 expression was an independent prognostic biomarker in AML. MiR-335/ID4 dysregulation facilitated leukemogenesis through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. ? Zhou et al.",""
"Insulin-Loaded Silk Fibroin Microneedles as Sustained Release System",2019,"Silk fibroin has widely been used in biomedical applications for its excellent biocompatibility, degradability, and mechanical properties. Microneedles are a suitable method for transdermal drug delivery. In this work, we have prepared microneedles using silk fibroin as the main material and have added proline to change its crystal structure. The fabricated microneedles are nontoxic and degradable and show relatively slow drug release. Our results indicate that the fibroin/proline microneedles can act as carriers of insulin. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) observations show that the structure of proline-treated fibroin is transformed from random coils to β-sheets. A more regular arrangement is formed between the molecular segments. X-ray diffraction patterns show that proline has good compatibility with fibroin and induces the secondary conformation of the microneedles to a Silk I type structure. The needles have enough strength to pierce the stratum corneum of the skin. In vitro release experiments with insulin indicate that the release time from the microneedles is maintained up to 60 h. This system of delivery may provide a painless and effective route of insulin intake for the treatment of diabetic patients.

"Bufalin suppresses the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through HOTAIR, the sponge of miR-520b",2019,"Bufalin, the major active component of the traditional Chinese medicine ChanSu obtained from the skin and parotid venom glands of toads, has long been known as an anticancer agent. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the anticancer activities of bufalin, while long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to interact with miRNAs to regulate various biological functions. In this paper, we investigated the possible network related to the antimetastatic effect of bufalin in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We demonstrated that bufalin (0.05?10 ?M) dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells with IC50 values of 0.89 and 1.28 ?M, respectively. Furthermore, bufalin treatment significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion. To explore the role of lncRNAs in the antimetastatic activity of bufalin, we used an lncRNA microarray and found that HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was the most markedly downregulated lncRNA in bufalin-treated PCa cells. Overexpression of HOTAIR counteracted the suppressing effects of bufalin on DU145 and PC3 cells. We then predicted and verified that HOTAIR upregulated FGFR1 expression by sponging miR-520b in PCa cells. In 40 patients with PCa bone metastasis, we used in situ hybridization or immunohistochemical assay to assess the HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression, which revealed that both HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression were significantly higher in bone metastasis tissues than in the primary PCa tissues. In addition, the level of serum HOTAIR was positively associated with the levels of serum bone metabolic markers (CTx, OST, B-ALP and PINP) and may serve as a reasonable biomarker for PCa bone metastasis. Taken together, this is the first study revealing that HOTAIR promotes PCa bone metastasis, and bufalin may be a promising candidate for the treatment of this disease. ? 2019, CPS and SIMM.","alkaline phosphatase bone isoenzyme; bufalin; carboxy terminal telopeptide; complementary RNA; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; Hox protein; HOX transcript antisense RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; microRNA 520b; osteocalcin; procollagen; procollagen type i n terminal propeptide; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; bufadienolide derivative; bufalin; FGFR1 protein, human; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; HOTAIR long untranslated RNA, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN520 microRNA, human; 3' untranslated region; Article; bone metastasis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; DU145 cell line; gene overexpression; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; male; metastasis inhibition; mRNA expression level; prostate cancer; protein blood level; protein expression level; tumor invasion; upregulation; wound healing assay; cell motion; drug effect; gene expression regulation; metabolism; prostate tumor; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Bufanolides; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1; RNA, Long Noncoding; Up-Regulation"
"Circulating microRNA-1 in the diagnosis and predicting prognosis of patients with chest pain: A prospective cohort study",2019,"Background: To investigate the early diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNA-1 in patients with acute chest pain. Methods: This study enrolled 341 patients attacked by chest pain within 3 h, and another 100 volunteers as control group. Circulating microRNA-1 was collected and determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The clinical follow-up period was 720 days. Results: There were 174 patients in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group, 167 in non-AMI group. The relative expression of microRNA-1 was significantly increased within 3 h in AMI group, and it continued rising within 12 h, lower at 24 h than that 12 h in AMI group without reperfusion therapy. Otherwise, microRNA-1 concentration was markedly low at 12 h after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in AMI group. The 95% reference range of circulating microRNA-1 was 0.171-0.653. It was significantly available for microRNA-1 to early diagnose AMI with an optimal cutoff value of 2.215 and diagnostic accuracy could be improved when combined with cardiac troponin I. It was not statistically significant for microRNA-1 to forecast future AMI but might prognose mortality of 720 days in chest pain patients. In patients with chest pain, microRNA-1 concentration was high with major adverse cardiac events within 30 days, low with high overall survival within 720 days. Conclusions: Circulating microRNA-1 might diagnose early AMI and predict the prognosis of patients with chest pain. ? 2019 The Author(s).","microRNA 1; troponin I; circulating microRNA; microRNA; MIRN1 microRNA, human; troponin I; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; overall survival; percutaneous coronary intervention; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; protein determination; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thorax pain; angina pectoris; blood; case control study; early diagnosis; genetic marker; genetics; heart infarction; mortality; predictive value; prognosis; risk factor; time factor; Aged; Angina Pectoris; Case-Control Studies; Circulating MicroRNA; Early Diagnosis; Female; Genetic Markers; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Troponin I"
"Vitamin D protects against particles-caused lung injury through induction of autophagy in an Nrf2-dependent manner",2019,"Fine particulate matter is a well-known air pollutant threatening public health. Studies have confirmed long-term exposure to the particles could decrease the pulmonary function, induce asthma exacerbation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as increase the incidence and mortality of lung cancer. A clinical study has explored that the prevalence and risks of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in various chronic disease and toxins induced tissue damage. Our current study aimed to explore the mechanism and further therapeutic potential of VD administration to ameliorate fine particles exposure induced pulmonary damage in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the effects and mechanisms of VD in particles-induced pulmonary damage, a murine model was established with fine particles intratracheal instillation along with VD intramuscular injection. Our study demonstrated that treatment with VD attenuated particles-induced pulmonary damage and promoted tissue repair by repressing of TGFβ1 signaling pathway and upregulation of MMP9 expression. VD treatment could also regulate the autophagy-related signals along with activation of Nrf2 transcription factor. Furthermore, the results from the in vitro study demonstrated that VD protected against particles-induced cells' damage through the induction of autophagy in an Nrf2-dependent manner. VD treatment caused the degradation of P62 and its bound Keap1, which decreased the Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing its protein stability. Our work explored a novel potential mechanism in the protection of VD in particles-induced pulmonary injury and tissue repair, and could further bring insights into exploring antifine particles exposure caused inflammation among other natural products and contributes to inflammation disease medical therapies. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Biological organs; Pathology; Pulmonary diseases; Repair; Tissue; Vitamins; Autophagy; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Fine particulate matter; Intramuscular injections; Intratracheal instillation; Potential mechanism; Therapeutic potentials; Vitamin-D; Disease control; calcitriol; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; lc3 protein; protein; sequestosome 1; silicon dioxide; synaptotagmin I; transcription factor Nrf2; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; gelatinase B; NFE2L2 protein, human; Nfe2l2 protein, mouse; transcription factor Nrf2; transforming growth factor beta1; vitamin D; asthma; atmospheric pollution; cancer; disease incidence; disease prevalence; gene expression; health risk; induced response; injury; mortality; particulate matter; protein; public health; vitamin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autophagy; cell infiltration; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytokine release; drug mechanism; human; human cell; lung epithelium; lung injury; lung parenchyma; lymphocyte; macrophage; male; mouse; mRNA expression level; neutrophil; nonhuman; particulate matter; pneumonia; priority journal; protein degradation; protein stability; signal transduction; THP-1 cell line; tissue repair; ubiquitination; upregulation; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin supplementation; air pollutant; animal; autophagy; chemically induced; drug effect; genetics; lung injury; metabolism; particulate matter; pathology; toxicity; Murinae; Air Pollutants; Animals; Autophagy; Humans; Lung Injury; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Mice; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Particulate Matter; Signal Transduction; THP-1 Cells; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Ubiquitination; Up-Regulation; Vitamin D"
"Long noncoding RNA HOTTIP promotes nasopharyngeal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting miR-4301",2019,"Background: The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HOTTIP is involved in gastric cancer tumorigenesis, papillary thyroid carcinoma, colorectal cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, but it is unclear how HOTTIP exerts roles in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study investigated HOTTIP function during NPC development. Material/Methods: HOTTIP levels in cancer specimens and cell lines were analyzed using qRT-PCR. HOTTIP function in NPC was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and Transwell assay. Results: HOTTIP expression was increased in NPC tissues. Higher levels of HOTTIP are correlated with lower survival in NPC patients. HOTTIP silencing suppressed the proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion of NPC cells. HOTTIP served as a sponge for miR-4301. miR-4301 expression was significantly inhibited by HOTTIP in NPC cells. miR-4301 overexpression dramatically inhibited NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusions: This study showed that HOTTIP acts as an oncogene in NPC by sponging miR-4301. ?

"NEAT1 induces osteosarcoma development by modulating the miR-339-5p/TGF-β1 pathway",2019,"The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been recognized as a tumor oncogene involved in the development of multiple cancers. However, the function of NEAT1 and its molecular mechanism in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. First, we detected the NEAT1 expression in OS cell lines by performing quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Next, the effects of NEAT1 on OS cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were tested by lentivirus-mediated downregulation. We observed that inhibition of NEAT1 restrained OS cell progression greatly. Interestingly, in the last few years, increasing studies have shown that some lncRNAs can act as miRNA sponges and reduce the amount of the same. Here, we found that NEAT1 can modulate OS development via sponging miR-339-5p. MiR-339-5p was significantly decreased in OS cells, and its overexpression can remarkably repress the OS proliferation. These results indicated that NEAT1 could function as a tumor oncogene in OS by inhibiting miR-339-5p in vitro. Then, the following assays validated that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) can act as a functional target of miR-339-5p in OS cells. Finally, we indicated that NEAT1 could mediate TGF-β1 expression by competitively sponging miR-339-5p. NEAT1 induced OS cell proliferation and cell mobility by binding to miR-339-5p and increasing TGF-β1 in OS. It was demonstrated in our study that lncRNA NEAT1 could impede miR-339-5p expression to maintain the expression of TGF-β1, which led to the development of OS. Our findings implied that the novel identified NEAT1/miR-339-5p/TGF-β1 axis might be a new molecular pathway or therapeutic target for OS diagnosis and treatment. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","long noncoding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; microRNA 339 5p; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; 143B cell line; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; cell growth; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; embryo; gene expression; gene overexpression; HEK293T cell line; hFOB 1.19 cell line; human; human cell; KHOS/NP cell line; MG-63 cell line; osteosarcoma; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SaOS-2 cell line"
"REV7 confers radioresistance of esophagus squamous cell carcinoma by recruiting PRDX2",2019,"Radiotherapy has been widely used for the clinical management of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, radioresistance remains a serious concern that prevents the efficacy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) radiotherapy. REV7, the structural subunit of eukaryotic DNA polymerase ζ, has multiple functions in bypassing DNA damage and modulating mitotic arrest in human cell lines. However, the expression and molecular function of REV7 in ESCC progression remains unclear. In this study, we first examined the expression of REV7 in clinical ESCC samples, and we found higher expression of REV7 in ESCC tissues compared to matched adjacent or normal tissues. Knockdown of REV7 resulted in decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis in irradiated Eca-109 and TE-1 cells coupled with decreased tumor weight in a xenograft nude mouse model postirradiation. Conversely, overexpression of REV7 resulted in radioresistance in?vitro and in vivo. Moreover, silencing of REV7 induced increased reactive oxygen species levels postirradiation. Proteomic analysis of REV7-interacting proteins revealed that REV7 interacted with peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), a well-known antioxidant protein. Existence of REV7-PRDX2 complex and its augmentation postirradiation were further validated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. REV7 knockdown significantly disrupted the presence of nuclear PRDX2 postirradiation, which resulted in oxidative stress. REV7-PRDX2 complex also assembled onto DNA double-strand breaks, whereas REV7 knockdown evidently increased double-strand breaks that were unmerged by PRDX2. Taken together, the present study sheds light on REV7-modulated radiosensitivity through interacting with PRDX2, which provides a novel target for ESCC radiotherapy. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Sequencing of short cfDNA fragments in NIPT improves fetal fraction with higher maternal BMI and early gestational age",2019,"Low fetal DNA fraction (< 4%) samples obtained during noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are responsible for 0.5%-3% of “no calls”. Maternal characteristics such as body mass index (BMI) and gestational age (GA) are the main factors that influence fetal fraction. Here, we improved fetal fraction by performing semiconductor sequencing of shorter fragments (107-145 bp) of cfDNA (traditional NIPT fragment is 160 bp). Multivariable linear regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between fetal fraction and maternal characteristics including BMI and GA. Among the 1495 shorter cfDNA sequencing samples, BMI and GA were negatively and positively correlated with fetal fraction, respectively. Compared with underweight pregnant women, sequencing of shorter fragments decreased the mean fetal fraction differences between BMI groups, especially in the obese women (~15%). We also showed that the average fetal fraction was 22.2% and 96.3% fetal fraction more than 10% in the obese women with the average GA of 17 weeks. Size selection slightly decreased the mean fetal fraction differences between different GA groups, and sequencing shorter cfDNA can yield a fetal fraction at an earlier GA. Collectively, our results support the strategy of sequencing shorter to improve fetal fraction in subjects with a high maternal BMI and earlier GA. ? 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

"H22954, a novel long non-coding RNA down-regulated in AML, inhibits cancer growth in a BCL-2-dependent mechanism",2019,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important in cancer biology. In this study, we analyzed differentially expressed genes in CD34 + hematopoietic cells and identified a novel lncRNA, H22954, which was down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In cultured AML cells and mouse xenograft models, H22954 expression inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis and RNA antisense purification assay indicated that H22954 targeted the 3’ untranslated region of the BCL2 gene. In luciferase assays, H22954 expression inhibited BCL2 expression. In transfected K562 cells and mouse xenograft tumors, H22954 overexpression reduced BCL-2 protein levels and promoted cell death. In AML patients, H22954 expression inversely correlated with BCL-2 protein levels in bone marrow cells, blast cell numbers and disease prognosis. These results indicate that H22954 is a novel regulator of BCL-2 and that reduced H22954 expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AML. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","long untranslated RNA; long untranslated RNA H22954; protein bcl 2; unclassified drug; 3' untranslated region; acute myeloid leukemia; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Bagg albino mouse; BCL2 gene; bioinformatics; blast cell; bone marrow cell; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; CD34 selection; cell count; cell death; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene expression; gene identification; genetic association; hematopoietic cell; human; human cell; K-562 cell line; luciferase assay; molecular pathology; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein function; RNA purification; transfected cell line; tumor growth; tumor xenograft"

Herein, we reviewed the biological features of exosomes, technologies for exosome isolation and identification, as well as progress in exosomal biomarker identification, highlighting the relevance of exosome to human diseases and significance and great potential in translational medicine. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","biological marker; microRNA; protein; RNA; body fluid; breast milk; cell isolation; diseases; exosome; human; molecular diagnosis; plasma; prognosis; Review; saliva; urine"
"EGFR-TKIs plus local therapy demonstrated survival benefit than EGFR-TKIs alone in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligometastatic or oligoprogressive liver metastases",2019,"To investigate whether addition of local therapy to EGFR-TKIs could provide survival benefit than EGFR-TKIs alone in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligometastatic or oligoprogressive liver metastases (LM). Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and oligometastatic or oligoprogressive LM who met inclusion criteria were retrospectively identified. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and patterns of failure. Addition of local therapy was associated with a significantly longer PFS (13.8 vs. 8.6 m, p <0.001) and OS (31.2 vs. 18.5 m, p <0.001) in whole group. In oligometastatic cohort, 20 patients received EGFR-TKIs and 23 received EGFR-TKIs plus local therapy as first-line treatment. Addition of local therapy showed a significantly longer PFS (12.9 vs. 7.9 m, p = 0.041) and OS (36.8 vs. 21.3 m, p = 0.034) than EGFR-TKIs alone. In oligoprogressive cohort, 24 patients received continuation of EGFR-TKIs plus local therapy and 25 received switching chemotherapy. Median PFS2 (13.9 vs. 9.2 m, p = 0.007) and OS (28.3 vs. 17.1 m, p = 0.011) was significantly longer in combined group than in switching chemotherapy group. Distant metastatic sites progression was the major pattern of failure in combined group while locoregional recurrence was the major reason in monotherapy or switching chemotherapy group. Our study suggested that EGFR-TKIs plus local therapy showed prolonged survival benefit than EGFR-TKIs alone in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligometastatic or oligoprogressive LM, indicating addition of local therapy would be alternative choice in this clinical scenario. ? 2018 UICC","epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; erlotinib; gefitinib; icotinib; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; protein tyrosine kinase; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cohort analysis; distant metastasis; endoscopic therapy; female; human; human tissue; liver metastasis; local therapy; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; mutational analysis; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; primary health care; priority journal; progression free survival; radiofrequency ablation; retrospective study; survival rate; survival time; disease exacerbation; genetics; liver tumor; lung tumor; metabolism; metastasis; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Disease Progression; ErbB Receptors; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; Progression-Free Survival; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases"
"Light/pH-Triggered Biomimetic Red Blood Cell Membranes Camouflaged Small Molecular Drug Assemblies for Imaging-Guided Combinational Chemo-Photothermal Therapy",2019,"Nanoparticles camouflaged by red blood cell (RBC) membranes have attracted considerable attention owing to reservation of structure of membrane and surface proteins, endowing prominent cell-specific function including biocompatibility, prolonged circulation lifetime, and reduced reticular endothelial system (RES) uptake ability. Considering the drawbacks of carrier-free nanomedicine including the serious drug burst release, poor stability, and lack of immune escape function, herein we developed and fabricated a novel RBC membranes biomimetic combinational therapeutic system by enveloping the small molecular drug coassemblies of 10-hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT) and indocyanine green (ICG) in the RBC membranes for prolonged circulation, controlled drug release, and synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy (PTT). The self-reorganized RBCs@ICG-HCPT nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited a diameter of ?150 nm with core-shell structure, high drug payload (?92 wt %), and reduced RES uptake function. Taking advantage of the stealth functionality of RBC membranes, RBCs@ICG-HCPT NPs remarkably enhanced the accumulation at the tumor sites by passive targeting followed by cellular endocytosis. Upon the stimuli of near-infrared laser followed by acidic stimulation, RBCs@ICG-HCPT NPs showed exceptional instability by heat-mediated membrane disruption and pH change, thereby triggering the rapid disassembly and accelerated drug release. Consequently, compared with individual treatment, RBCs@ICG-HCPT NPs under dual-stimuli accomplished highly efficient apoptosis in cancer cells and remarkable ablation of tumors by chemo-PTT. This biomimetic nanoplatform based on carrier-free, small molecular drug coassemblies integrating imaging capacity as a promising theranostic system provides potential for cancer diagnosis and combinational therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Biocompatibility; Biomimetics; Blood; Cell death; Diagnosis; Diseases; Infrared devices; Infrared lasers; Medical nanotechnology; Membranes; Molecular biology; Molecular imaging; Nanoparticles; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; 10 hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT); chemo-PTT therapy; Controlled drug release; Drug release; Near-infrared lasers; Photothermal therapy; Red blood cell; small molecular drug coassemblies; Controlled drug delivery; 10-hydroxycamptothecin; antineoplastic agent; camptothecin; indocyanine green; nanoparticle; analogs and derivatives; animal; apoptosis; biomimetics; cell membrane; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; erythrocyte; HeLa cell line; human; infrared radiation; male; metabolism; mouse; neoplasm; nude mouse; pathology; pH; phototherapy; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Biomimetics; Camptothecin; Cell Membrane; Erythrocytes; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Indocyanine Green; Infrared Rays; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Phototherapy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley"
"The Nanoassembly of an Intrinsically Cytotoxic Near-Infrared Dye for Multifunctionally Synergistic Theranostics",2019,"The combination of diagnostic and therapeutic functions in a single theranostic nanoagent generally requires the integration of multi-ingredients. Herein, a cytotoxic near-infrared (NIR) dye (IR-797) and its nanoassembly are reported for multifunctional cancer theranostics. The hydrophobic IR-797 molecules are self-assembled into nanoparticles, which are further modified with an amphiphilic polymer (C18PMH-PEG5000) on the surface. The prepared PEG-IR-797 nanoparticles (PEG-IR-797 NPs) possess inherent cytotoxicity from the IR-797 dye and work as a chemotherapeutic drug which induces apoptosis of cancer cells. The IR-797 NPs are found to have an ultrahigh mass extinction coefficient (444.3 L g?1 cm?1 at 797 nm and 385.9 L g?1 cm?1 at 808 nm) beyond all reported organic nanomaterials (&lt;40 L g?1 cm?1) for superior photothermal therapy (PTT). In addition, IR-797 shows some aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) properties. Combining the merits of good NIR absorption, high photothermal energy conversion efficiency, and AIE, makes the PEG-IR-797 NPs useful for multimodal NIR AIE fluorescence, photoacoustic, and thermal imaging-guided therapy. The research exhibits the possibility of using a single ingredient and entity to perform multimodal NIR fluorescence, photoacoustic, and thermal imaging-guided chemo-/photothermal combination therapy, which may trigger wide interest from the fields of nanomedicine and medicinal chemistry to explore multifunctional theranostic organic molecules. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Consensus on the digestive endoscopic tunnel technique",2019,"With the digestive endoscopic tunnel technique (DETT), many diseases that previously would have been treated by surgery are now endoscopically curable by establishing a submucosal tunnel between the mucosa and muscularis propria (MP). Through the tunnel, endoscopic diagnosis or treatment is performed for lesions in the mucosa, in the MP, and even outside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. At present, the tunnel technique application range covers the following: (1) Treatment of lesions originating from the mucosal layer, e.g., endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection for oesophageal large or circular early-stage cancer or precancerosis; (2) treatment of lesions from the MP layer, per-oral endoscopic myotomy, submucosal tunnelling endoscopic resection, etc.; and (3) diagnosis and treatment of lesions outside the GI tract, such as resection of lymph nodes and benign tumour excision in the mediastinum or abdominal cavity. With the increasing number of DETTs performed worldwide, endoscopic tunnel therapeutics, which is based on DETT, has been gradually developed and optimized. However, there is not yet an expert consensus on DETT to regulate its indications, contraindications, surgical procedure, and postoperative treatment. The International DETT Alliance signed up this consensus to standardize the procedures of DETT. In this consensus, we describe the definition, mechanism, and significance of DETT, prevention of infection and concepts of DETT-associated complications, methods to establish a submucosal tunnel, and application of DETT for lesions in the mucosa, in the MP and outside the GI tract (indications and contraindications, procedures, pre- and postoperative treatments, effectiveness, complications and treatments, and a comparison between DETT and other operations). ?

"LINC00612 enhances the proliferation and invasion ability of bladder cancer cells as ceRNA by sponging miR-590 to elevate expression of PHF14",2019,"Background: Bladder cancer (BC) is a common type of cancer that involves tumors of the urinary system and poses a serious threat to human health. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial biomarkers and regulators in many cancers. Novel lncRNA biomarkers in BC urgently need to be investigated in regard to its function and regulatory mechanisms. Methods: Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs in BC tissue was performed via microarray analysis. To investigate the biological functions of LINC00612, loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, AGO2-RIP assays, RNA pull-down assays, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) arrays, fluorescence in situ hybridization assays, and western blot assays were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Results: LINC00612 was upregulated in BC tissues and cell lines. Functionally, downregulation of LINC00612 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of LINC00612 resulted in the opposite effects. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays revealed that miR-590 was a direct target of LINC0061, which was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assays, AGO2-RIP assays, RNA pull-down assays, RT-qPCR arrays, and rescue experiments. Additionally, miR-590 was shown to directly target the PHD finger protein 14 (PHF14) gene. LNIC00612 modulated the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin by competitively sponging miR-590 to elevate the expression of PHF14, thus affecting BC cellular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conclusions: Our results indicate that LINC00612 enhances the proliferation and invasion ability of BC cells by sponging miR-590 to upregulate PHF14 expression and promote BC cellular EMT, suggesting that LINC00612 may act as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for BC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","competitive endogenous RNA; long untranslated RNA; membrane protein; microRNA; microRNA 590; PHD finger protein 14; RNA; unclassified drug; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN590 microRNA, human; nuclear protein; PHF14 protein, human; transcription factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; bioluminescence; bladder cancer; cell invasion; cell proliferation; cell viability; cellular distribution; colony formation; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gain of function mutation; gene expression profiling; gene function; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; LINC00612 gene; loss of function mutation; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; PHF14 gene; plasmid; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; Western blotting; animal; bladder tumor; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Nuclear Proteins; RNA, Long Noncoding; Transcription Factors; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"

"Carbon monoxide (CO)-Strengthened cooperative bioreductive anti-tumor therapy via mitochondrial exhaustion and hypoxia induction",2019,"Bioreductive chemodrugs require hypoxic conditions to activate their anti-cancer efficacy. The insufficient and heterogeneous hypoxic condition in tumor tissues hurdles the therapeutic potency of bioreductive chemodrugs. We herein report a NIR light-triggered CO release system based on mesoporous Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs)to enable cancer-selective hypoxia aggravation and hypoxia-responsive activation of bioreductive anti-cancer drug, tirapazamine (TPZ). Pentacarbonyl iron (Fe(CO)5)was coupled to PB NPs via coordination interaction, and TPZ was encapsulated into the pores of PB NPs. To prolong blood circulation and improve tumor accumulation, the PB-CO-TPZ NPs were surface-decorated with PEG-NH2. Upon tumor site-specific light irradiation, the non-lethal photothermal effect of PB NPs released CO, which accelerated mitochondrial oxygen consumption and generated hypoxia to activate TPZ. The CO-induced mitochondrial exhaustion simultaneously led to cancer cell apoptosis, thus realizing synergistic anti-cancer effect with TPZ-mediated bioreductive chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to activate bioreductive chemotherapy using CO. This study thus provides a promising paradigm to realize effective and safe cancer treatment via precise manipulation of drug activities, and may open new insights in the use of CO for biomedical treatment. ? 2019","Carbon monoxide; Cardiovascular system; Cell death; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Anti-cancer therapies; Bioreductive drugs; Cancer cell apoptosis; Coordination interactions; Hypoxia responsiveness; Mitochondrial metabolism; Mitochondrial oxygen consumption; Prussian blue nanoparticles; Iron compounds; amine; carbon monoxide; carbonyl iron; ferric ferrocyanide; macrogol; nanocarrier; nanoparticle; oxygen; poly(allylamine hydrochloride); polyacrylic acid; polymer; tirapazamine; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; bioaccumulation; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer tissue; cell hypoxia; chemical bond; circulation; concentration (parameter); controlled drug release; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug delivery system; drug distribution; drug half life; drug potentiation; female; infrared radiation; irradiation; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; photothermal therapy; priority journal"
"EphA2 antagonism alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury via Nrf2/HO-1, TLR4/MyD88 and RhoA/ROCK pathways",2019,"Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have a wide range of biological functions and have gradually been recognized increasingly as key regulators of inflammation and injury diseases. Although previous studies suggested that EphA2 receptor may be involved in the regulation of inflammation and vascular permeability in injured lung, the detailed effects of EphA2 on LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) are still inadequate and the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we detected the effects of EphA2 antagonism on inflammation, pulmonary vascular permeability and oxidative stress in LPS-induced ALI and investigate the potential mechanism. Our results showed that EphA2 antagonism markedly inhibited the cytokines release and inflammatory cells infiltration in BALF, prevented the LPS-induced elevations of MPO activity and MDA level in lung tissues. Our study also found that EphA2 antagonism significantly decreased the wet/dry ratios, reduced the Evans blue albumin extravasation in lung tissues and obviously alleviated the LPS-induced increment of pulmonary vascular permeability. Mechanistically, EphA2 antagonism significantly increased the activation of Nrf2 along with its target antioxidant enzyme HO-1 and inhibited the expressions of TLR4/MyD88 in lung tissues and A549 alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, EphA2 antagonism dramatically inhibited the LPS-evoked activations of RhoA/ROCK in lung tissues. In conclusion, our data indicate that EphA2 receptor plays an essential role in LPS-induced ALI and EphA2 antagonism has protective effects against LPS-induced ALI via Nrf2/HO-1, TLR4/MyD88 and RhoA/ROCK pathways. These results suggest that antagonism of EphA2 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ALI. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ephrin receptor A2; Evans blue; heme oxygenase 1; interleukin 6; malonaldehyde; myeloid differentiation factor 88; myeloperoxidase; protein serine kinase; protein tyrosine kinase; rho associated protein kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; toll like receptor 4; transcription factor Nrf2; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; ephrin receptor A2; heme oxygenase; Hmox1 protein, rat; lipopolysaccharide; malonaldehyde; monoclonal antibody; Myd88 protein, rat; myeloid differentiation factor 88; Nfe2l2 protein, rat; peroxidase; Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein; Rho kinase; RhoA protein, rat; Tlr4 protein, rat; toll like receptor 4; transcription factor Nrf2; tumor necrosis factor; A-549 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood vessel permeability; cell infiltration; controlled study; cytokine release; enzyme activity; extravasation; human; human cell; lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury; lung alveolus epithelium cell; lung parenchyma; lung weight; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; rat; signal transduction; acute lung injury; animal; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; chemistry; drug effect; immunology; lung; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; A549 Cells; Acute Lung Injury; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing); Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; Lung; Male; Malondialdehyde; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Oxidative Stress; Peroxidase; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptor, EphA2; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; rho-Associated Kinases; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
"Epigenetic silencing of ZNF132 mediated by methylation-sensitive Sp1 binding promotes cancer progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Epigenetic alteration of tumor suppression gene is one of the most significant indicators in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, we identified a novel ESCC hypermethylation biomarker ZNF132 by integrative computational analysis to comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation microarray dataset. We validated the hypermethylation status of ZNF132 in 91 Chinese Han ESCC patients and adjacent normal tissues with methylation target bisulfite sequencing (MTBS) assay. Meanwhile, ZNF132 gene silencing mediated by hypermethylation was confirmed in both solid tissues and cancer cell lines. What is more, we found that in vitro overexpression of ZNF132 in ESCC cells could significantly reduce the abilities of the cell in growth, migration and invasion, and tumorigenicity of cells in a nude mouse model. We validated the Sp1-binding site in the ZNF132 promoter region with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and demonstrated that the hypermethylation status could reduce the Sp1 transcript factor activity. Our results suggest that ZNF132 plays an important role in the development of ESCC as a tumor suppressor gene and support the underlying mechanism caused by the DNA hypermethylation-mediated Sp1-binding decay and gene silencing. ? 2018, The Author(s).","biological marker; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; znf132 protein; DNA binding protein; transcription factor; transcription factor Sp1; tumor suppressor protein; zinc finger protein 132 protein, human; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; binding site; cancer cell line; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cell migration; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; DNA methylation; epigenetics; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; gene silencing; Han Chinese; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; reporter gene; RNA extraction; tumor suppressor gene; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; wound healing assay; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; DNA methylation; DNA responsive element; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Methylation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Response Elements; Sp1 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factors; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"Catalpol and panax notoginseng saponins synergistically alleviate triptolide-induced hepatotoxicity through Nrf2/ARE pathway",2019,"Triptolide (TP), as the main component of Tripterygium wilfordii (TW), could induce significant hepatic damage when exerting the therapeutic effect. However, The previous studies have shown that catalpol (CAT) and panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) have synergistic protecting effect against hepatotoxicity induced by TP. This study aims to address the role of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway in their protecting effect, and to explore their synergistic mechanisms. For this purpose, the human hepatocyte cell line L-02 was selected, and the synergistic antioxidative effect of CAT and PNS was confirmed. Then the effects of CAT and PNS on different aspects of the Nrf2/ARE pathway were analyzed. The results showed that CAT significantly reduced TP-induced inhibition of Nrf2 transcription and made it increased, PNS significantly increased Nrf2 phosphorylation for relieving TP-induced potential inhibition of Nrf2/ARE binding activity, while the combination of the two further enhanced their activation by synergistically inducing Nrf2 transcriptional expression and phosphorylated Nrf2 (p-Nrf2) expression, followed with NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) expression and glutathione (GSH) activity increasing, which further enhanced their antioxidative effects. Subsequently, the gene silencing techniques were used, and that the Nrf2/ARE pathway is necessary in this effect was confirmed. In conclusion, the synergistic protecting effect of CAT and PNS is dependent on Nrf2/ARE pathway, while the natural mutual promotion between the regulatory links of CAT and PNS may be the main source of the synergistic effect. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","catalpol; glutathione; NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1; oxidoreductase; panax notoginseng saponin; saponin; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; catalpol; diterpene; epoxide; iridoid; NFE2L2 protein, human; phenanthrene derivative; saponin; transcription factor Nrf2; triptolide; antioxidant activity; antioxidant responsive element; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; drug potentiation; gene silencing; human; human cell; L-02 cell line; liver cell damage; liver protection; liver toxicity; oxidative stress; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; antioxidant responsive element; cell line; drug effect; metabolism; Panax notoginseng; physiology; signal transduction; toxic hepatitis; Antioxidant Response Elements; Cell Line; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Diterpenes; Drug Synergism; Epoxy Compounds; Humans; Iridoid Glucosides; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Panax notoginseng; Phenanthrenes; Saponins; Signal Transduction"

"Upregulation of Spondin-2 protein expression correlates with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the extracellular matrix protein Spondin-2 (SPON2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and to determine its potential value as a prognostic indicator by assessing its correlation with clinicopathological variables and survival. Methods: SPON2 mRNA expression was assessed in 20 matched pairs of HCC and non-cancerous liver tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. SPON2 protein expression was determined in 107 matched pairs of HCC and normal liver tissue by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. Results: Analysis of patient tissues and Oncomine datasets showed that SPON2 mRNA and SPON2 protein expression were both significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, compared with non-cancerous liver tissue; moreover, both correlated significantly with tumor size. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that HCC patients who showed high levels of cytoplasmic SPON2 protein had poorer survival following curative resection, compared with HCC patients who exhibited low protein expression levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that tumor thrombus and SPON2 protein expression both independently correlated with reduced survival in HCC patients. Conclusion: Upregulated expression of SPON2 protein in tumor tissue could be an effective prognostic indicator for patients with HCC. ?

"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) exacerbate severity of infant sepsis",2019,"Background: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are innate defense mechanisms that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. However, the role of NETs in pediatric sepsis is unknown. Methods: Infant (2 weeks old) and adult (6 weeks old) mice were submitted to sepsis by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of bacteria suspension or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neutrophil infiltration, bacteremia, organ injury, and concentrations of cytokine, NETs, and DNase in the plasma were measured. Production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and release of NETs by neutrophils were also evaluated. To investigate the functional role of NETs, mice undergoing sepsis were treated with antibiotic plus rhDNase and the survival, organ injury, and levels of inflammatory markers and NETs were determined. Blood samples from pediatric and adult sepsis patients were collected and the concentrations of NETs measured. Results: Infant C57BL/6 mice subjected to sepsis or LPS-induced endotoxemia produced significantly higher levels of NETs than the adult mice. Moreover, compared to that of the adult mice, this outcome was accompanied by increased organ injury and production of inflammatory cytokines. The increased NETs were associated with elevated expression of Padi4 and histone H3 citrullination in the neutrophils. Furthermore, treatment of infant septic mice with rhDNase or a PAD-4 inhibitor markedly attenuated sepsis. Importantly, pediatric septic patients had high levels of NETs, and the severity of pediatric sepsis was positively correlated with the level of NETs. Conclusion: This study reveals a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of pediatric sepsis susceptibility and suggests that NETs represents a potential target to improve clinical outcomes of sepsis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","arginine deiminase; deoxyribonuclease; histone H3; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; nitrogen derivative; peptidyl arginine deiminase 4; reactive oxygen metabolite; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacteremia; bacterial count; blood sampling; citrullination; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; disease severity; extracellular trap; human; infant; mouse; neutrophil; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; organ injury; peritoneum macrophage; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein blood level; protein degradation; protein expression; scoring system; sepsis; septic shock; survival rate; upregulation; animal; bacterial load; blood; Brazil; C57BL mouse; disease model; extracellular trap; microbiology; mortality; multiple organ failure; pathology; procedures; sepsis; Animals; Bacterial Load; Brazil; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Traps; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Multiple Organ Failure; Sepsis"
"Histone methyltransferase SUV39H2 serves oncogenic roles in osteosarcoma",2019,"Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 2 (SUV39H2), a SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase, trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 9 and serves crucial roles in heterochromatin organization and genome stability. SUV39H2 is overexpressed in various types of human cancer, whereas it is almost undetectable in normal adult tissues, except testis. The aim of this study was to investigate a potential role of SUV39H2 in osteosarcoma. In the present study, increased SUV39H2 expression levels were observed in osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone cancer in children and adolescents, and the knockdown of SUV39H2 expression by specific small interfering RNAs in osteosarcoma cells markedly suppressed cancer cell growth and led to a notable reduction in cell viability. Furthermore, overexpression of SUV39H2 promoted cell proliferation, which indicated that SUV39H2 may possess oncogenic activity in human osteosarcoma. Notably, depletion of SUV39H2 expression caused an increase in the population of G 1 phase and induced apoptosis, which implied that SUV39H2 may have biological significance in the process of cell cycle. These results indicated that SUV39H2 may be an ideal target for osteosarcoma therapeutics. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"HucMSCs-Derived miR-206-Knockdown Exosomes Contribute to Neuroprotection in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Induced Early Brain Injury by Targeting BDNF",2019,"Early brain injury (EBI) is the most important potentially treatable cause of mortality and morbidity following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Apoptosis is one of the main pathologies of SAH-induced EBI. Numerous studies suggest that human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) may exert neuroprotective effect through exosomes instead of transdifferentiation. In addition, microRNA-206 (miR-206) targets BDNF and plays a critical role in brain injury diseases. However, the therapy effect of miR-206 modified exosomes on EBI after SAH and its regulatory mechanism have not been elucidated. Here, to identify whether hucMSCs-derived miR-206-knockdown exosomes have a better neuroprotective effect, we established SAH rat model and treated it with the exosomes to research the mechanism of miR-206 in EBI after SAH. We found that treatment with hucMSCs-derived miR-206-knockdown exosomes has a greater neuroprotective effect on SAH-induced EBI compared to treatment with simple exosomes. The miR-206-knockdown exosomes could significantly improve neurological deficit and brain edema and suppress neuronal apoptosis by targeting BDNF. Moreover, the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway was activated following treatment with miR-206 modified exosomes in vivo. In summary, these findings indicate that the hucMSCs-derived miR-206-knockdown exosomes prevent early brain injury by inhibiting apoptosis via BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling. This may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treatment of SAH-induced EBI. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","binding protein; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cAMP response element binding protein; microRNA; microRNA 206; tropomyosin; tropomyosin related receptor kinase B; unclassified drug; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain edema; brain injury; cell function; controlled study; enzyme activation; exosome; gene function; gene knockdown; genetic association; human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cell; in vivo study; male; mesenchymal stem cell; neuroapoptosis; neurologic disease; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; subarachnoid hemorrhage; umbilical cord cell line"
"Ubiquitin-specific protease 44 inhibits cell growth by suppressing AKT signaling in non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 44 (USP44) has been reported as a tumor suppressor or promoter in some tumors, but its function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear. In this study, USP44 was found significantly downregulated in both of NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and low expression of USP44 predicted a poor prognosis for NSCLC patients. Overexpression of USP44 markedly downregulated the expression levels of Cyclin D1 and CDK4, but upregulated p53 expression, as a result of which, suppressing the cell growth of NSCLC cells. Further studies indicated that overexpression of USP44 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, and its down-stream signals, including mTOR and P70S6K. Moreover, overexpression of USP44 increased PTEN protein but not its mRNA levels, which suggested that USP44 inhibited AKT signaling by stabilizing PTEN in NSCLC cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that USP44 showed prior evidence of a tumor suppressive function in NSCLC cells, and inhibited NSCLC cell growth by suppressing AKT signaling, suggesting that USP44 could be as a novel target for NSCLC therapy. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Interaction of EZH2 and P65 is involved in the arsenic trioxide-induced anti-angiogenesis in human triple-negative breast cancer cells",2019,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female malignancy in the world. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of BC characterized by the lack of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), resulting in the limited therapeutic options. Due to the aggressive behaviors at early stage, TNBC exhibits poorer outcomes compared to other BC subtypes. Hematogenous metastasis, which spreads cancerous cells to lungs and/or bones, plays a pivotal role in the progression of TNBC. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the anti-angiogenesis regulation mechanism for finding new treatment options for TNBC. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) exhibits anti-cancer effect on solid tumors, including TNBC. However, the roles and the molecular mechanism of ATO in the anti-angiogenesis of TNBC remain less well documented. Our data showed that ATO restrained the expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and impaired the angiogenic ability in TNBC cells. In addition, ATO suppressed the angiogenic ability in TNBC by inhibiting the interaction of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) with p65, downregulating the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, hence contributing to the regulation of IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway. All of our findings would help to better understand the mechanism of ATO anti-angiogenesis in TNBC, thus highlighting the therapeutic potential of ATO in TNBC by targeting angiogenesis. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","arsenic trioxide; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; STAT3 protein; synaptotagmin I; transcription factor EZH2; vasculotropin; antiangiogenic activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; drug mechanism; human; human cell; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein secretion; signal transduction; triple negative breast cancer"
"Iodine-Rich Polymersomes Enable Versatile SPECT/CT Imaging and Potent Radioisotope Therapy for Tumor in Vivo",2019,"Emerging tumor treatment demands high sensitivity and high-spatial resolution diagnosis in combination with targeted therapy. Here, we report that iodine-rich polymersomes (I-PS) enable versatile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) dual-modal imaging and potent radioisotope therapy for breast cancer in vivo. Interestingly, I-PS could be easily and stably labeled with radioiodine, 125I and 131I. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy showed that 125I-PS had a size of 106 nm and vesicular morphology, similar to those of the parent I-PS. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays displayed that I-PS and 125I-PS were noncytotoxic, whereas 131I-PS caused significant death of 4T1 cells at 5 mg PS/mL with a radioactivity of 12 μCi. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies showed that 125I-PS has a prolonged circulation and distributes mainly in tumor and the reticuloendothelial system. The intravenous injection of 125I-PS to 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice allowed simultaneous high sensitivity and high-spatial resolution imaging of tumor by SPECT and CT, respectively. The therapeutic studies revealed that 131I-PS could effectively retard the growth of 4T1 breast tumor and significantly prolong mice survival time. The hematoxylin and eosin staining assay proved that 131I-PS induced tumor cell death. I-PS emerges as a robust and versatile platform for dual-modal imaging and targeted radioisotope therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell death; Diagnosis; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Image resolution; Iodine; Light scattering; Light transmission; Mammals; Medical imaging; Particle beams; Polymers; Radioisotopes; Tumors; Contrast agent; High spatial resolution; Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays; Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies; Polymersomes; Reticuloendothelial systems; SPECT/CT; Theranostics; Single photon emission computed tomography; antineoplastic agent; iodine; polymer; radioactive iodine; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell death; chemistry; neoplasm; pathology; single photon emission computed tomography; tissue distribution; tumor cell line; x-ray computed tomography; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Death; Cell Line, Tumor; Iodine; Iodine Radioisotopes; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasms; Polymers; Tissue Distribution; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"MiR-208a-3p functions as an oncogene in colorectal cancer by targeting PDCD4",2019,"Accumulating evidences have shown microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the progression of human cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of miRNAs in CRC still remains to be further investigated. Using microarray, we found and confirmed that miR-208a-3p was up-regulated in CRC tissues. Its high expression was statistically associated with distant metastasis and TNM stage. Functional assays revealed inhibition of miR-208a-3p suppressed proliferation, invasion and migration, and induced cell apoptosis of CRC cells. Moreover, we identified programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), a well-known tumor suppressor, is a direct target of miR-208a-3p. We also found that overexpression of PDCD4 suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Importantly, silencing of PDCD4 efficiently abrogated the promoting effects on CRC cells proliferation, invasion, and migration caused by inhibition of miR-208a-3p. Our findings confirmed the oncogenic role of miR-208a-3p via targeting PDCD4 in CRC, identifying miR-208a-3p as a potential diagnosis and therapeutic biomarker for CRC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","microRNA; microRNA 208a 3p; programmed cell death protein 4; tumor suppressor protein; unclassified drug; adult; apoptosis; Article; cancer staging; carcinogenicity; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical article; colorectal cancer; controlled study; distant metastasis; down regulation; female; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; genetic association; human; human cell; human tissue; male; microarray analysis; middle aged; oncogene; predictive value; upregulation"
"Virulence difference of five type I dengue viruses and the intrinsic molecular mechanism",2019,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most important vector-borne virus globally. The safe and effective vaccines are still under development and there are no antiviral drugs for DENV induced diseases. In this study, we obtained five DENV1 isolates (DENV1 A to E) from the outbreak of dengue fever in 2014 of Guangzhou, China, and analyzed their replication efficiency and virulence in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that among the five DENV1 strains, DENV1 B has the highest replication efficiency in both human and mosquito cells in vitro, also causes the highest mortality to suckling mice. Further study suggested that nonstructural proteins from DENV1B have higher capacity to suppress host interferon signaling. In addition, the NS2B3 protease from DENV1B has higher enzymatic activity compared with that from DENV1 E. Finally, we identified that the 64th amino acid of NS2A and the 55th amino acid of NS2B were two virulence determining sites for DENV1. This study provided new evidences of the molecular mechanisms of DENV virulence. ? 2019 Zou et al.

"Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Male Sexual Function: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review",2019,"Introduction: Obesity is a worldwide public health issue with serious psychological and social impacts. Erectile dysfunction is also a common clinical condition, and obesity is one of its main risk factors. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on male sexual function. Methods: A systematical research was carried out in Medline via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to March 16, 2019, to identify published articles related to bariatric surgery and male sexual function in men. Two reviewers screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. I2 index was applied to estimate the heterogeneity. All analyses were done using RevMan5.3 and Stata14. Results: A total of 12 studies involving 420 participants were included. Analysis showed that bariatric surgery significantly reduced body mass index in morbidly obese patients (mean difference [MD] = -13.73; 95% CI -17.23 to -10.22; P &lt;.00001). From 10 studies that reported the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, bariatric surgery led to a significant increase in IIEF-total score (MD = 8.2; 95% CI = 5.52?10.88; P &lt;.00001), and erectile function score (MD = 3.76; 95% CI = 2.34?5.19; P &lt;.00001), sexual desire (MD = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.55?1.32; P &lt;.00001), sexual intercourse satisfaction (MD = 1.73; 95% CI = 0.43?3.03; P &lt;.01), and total satisfaction (MD = 1.28; 95% CI = 0.56?2.00; P =.0005) were also significantly improved. However, bariatric surgery did not affect orgasm function (MD = 0.26; 95% CI = -0.15 to 0.68; P =.21). Three studies that reported the IIEF-5 score also showed a significant improvement of erectile function (MD = 5.45; 95% CI = 3.38?7.52; P &lt;.00001). Conclusions: Bariatric surgery could improve the erectile function, sexual desire, sexual intercourse satisfaction, and total satisfaction in morbidly obese men. Due to limited data on body mass index and hormone levels, our meta-analysis had some limitations. More clinical studies are needed to further explore the relationship between bariatric surgery and male sexual function. Xu J, Wu Q, Zhang Y, et al.

"Comparison of surgical outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus laparoscopic and open resections: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Robot-assisted distal pancreatectomy (RADP) has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) for pancreatic resections. A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China Biology Medicine databases up to December 2016 for studies that compared the surgical outcomes of RADP vs. LDP or ODP for pancreatic resections. The weighted mean differences, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and the data were combined using the random-effects model. The GRADE system was used to interpret the primary outcomes of this meta-analysis. A total of seventeen non-randomized observational clinical studies involving 2133 patients satisfied the eligibility criteria. Compared with LDP, RADP was associated with a longer operative time (P = 0.018), a shorter hospital length of stay (P = 0.030), and a higher rate of spleen preservation (P = 0.022). Moreover, RADP was associated with a shorter hospital LOS (P = 0.014) and a lower total complication rate (P = 0.034) than ODP. We found no statistically significant differences between the techniques in the mean estimated blood loss, severe complication rate, incidence of total pancreatic fistulas or incidence of severe pancreatic fistulas. The overall quality of evidence was poor for all outcomes. This meta-analysis indicates that RADP may be safe and comparable in terms of surgical results to LDP and ODP. Further RCTs are needed to confirm the outcomes of this meta-analysis. ? 2018","bibliographic database; comparative study; confidence interval; conservative treatment; human; incidence; laparoscopy; length of stay; meta analysis; odds ratio; operation duration; operative blood loss; pancreas fistula; pancreatectomy; patient safety; postoperative complication; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; spleen; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Blood Loss, Surgical; Confidence Intervals; Databases, Bibliographic; Humans; Incidence; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Odds Ratio; Operative Time; Organ Sparing Treatments; Pancreatectomy; Pancreatic Fistula; Patient Safety; Postoperative Complications; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Spleen; Treatment Outcome"
"Systolic blood pressure trajectories in the acute phase and clinical outcomes in 2-year follow-up among patients with ischemic stroke",2019,"BACKGROUND Optimal blood pressure (BP) levels during acute ischemic stroke have not been established. We studied associations between systolic BP trajectories during acute phase and subsequent clinical outcomes among patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS A total of 4,036 patients with acute ischemic stroke and elevated BP from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke trial were included in this analysis. Three BPs were measured every 2 hours in day 1, every 4 hours during days 2 and 3, and every 8 hours thereafter until hospital discharge or death. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 3, 12, and 24 months. Latent variable mixture modeling was used to identify subgroups that share a similar underlying trajectory of systolic BP during the first 7 days after stroke onset. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between systolic BP trajectories and clinical outcomes during follow-up. RESULTS We identified 5 systolic BP trajectories of high, high-to-moderate-low, moderate-high, moderate-low, and low. Compared to participants in high trajectory, multiple-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of all-cause mortality at 3 months for individuals in highto-moderate-low, moderate-high, moderate-low, and low were 0.34 (0.15-0.77), 0.58 (0.32-1.04), 0.29 (0.15-0.56), and 0.56 (0.26-1.19), respectively. Likewise, the corresponding hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in 24 months were 0.66 (0.44-1.00), 0.74 (0.53-1.05), 0.45 (0.32-0.66), and 0.61 (0.40-0.93), respectively. Similar associations were observed for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular disease, and in both the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSIONS Patients with moderate-low systolic BP during acute ischemic stroke had a lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes. ? 2018 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

"Expert consensus on multidisciplinary therapy of colorectal cancer with lung metastases (2019 edition)",2019,"The lungs are the second most common site of metastasis for colorectal cancer (CRC) after the liver. Rectal cancer is associated with a higher incidence of lung metastases compared to colon cancer. In China, the proportion of rectal cancer cases is around 50%, much higher than that in Western countries (nearly 30%). However, there is no available consensus or guideline focusing on CRC with lung metastases. We conducted an extensive discussion and reached a consensus of management for lung metastases in CRC based on current research reports and the experts' clinical experiences and knowledge. This consensus provided detailed approaches of diagnosis and differential diagnosis and provided general guidelines for multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) of lung metastases. We also focused on recommendations of MDT management of synchronous lung metastases and initial metachronous lung metastases. This consensus might improve clinical practice of CRC with lung metastases in China and will encourage oncologists to conduct more clinical trials to obtain high-level evidences about managing lung metastases. ? 2019 The Author(s).","irinotecan; oxaliplatin; cancer incidence; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; China; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; computer assisted tomography; consensus development; differential diagnosis; disease free survival; distant metastasis; evidence based medicine; follow up; histopathology; human; lung metastasis; lung resection; lymphangitic carcinomatosis; lymphatic system malignancy; multidisciplinary team; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; perioperative period; postoperative care; practice guideline; Review; risk factor; stereotactic body radiation therapy; thorax radiography; treatment duration"
"Increased HMGB1 expression correlates with higher expression of c-IAP2 and pERK in colorectal cancer",2019,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and colorectal cancer (CRC).In this prospective study, patients with CRC undergoing primary surgery and healthy subjects (control group) were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2014. The serum HMGB1 concentration and HMGB1 mRNA expression were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine HMGB1, pERK, and c-inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2) protein expression levels in the cancer tissues.A total 144 patients with CRC and 50 healthy subjects underwent serum HMGB1 testing. Resected specimens of 50 patients were used for HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression analyses. Mean serum HMGB1 level in the patients with CRC was higher than that of the control group (8.42?μg/L vs 1.79?μg/L, P?<?.05). Mean serum HMGB1 level in the patients with CRC with distant metastasis was significantly higher than that of the controls (13.32?μg/L vs 7.37?μg/L, P?<?.05). The HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression levels in the CRC tissues were significantly higher than those in the adjacent normal mucosa. HMGB1 protein expression positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis. There were positive correlations between HMGB1 and c-IAP2 (r?=?0.457, P?<?.05), HMGB1 and pERK (r?=?0.461, P?<?.05), as well as pERK and c-IAP2 (r?=?0.399, P?<?.05).HMGB1 expression in CRC correlates with distant and lymph node metastasis.

"Long non-coding RNA LINC01627 is a prognostic risk factor for epithelial ovarian cancer",2019,"Ovarian malignancies are commonly diagnosed cancers of the female reproductive system. Recent studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate a variety of oncological processes. In the present study, ovarian cancer expression datasets were searched in the GEO database using the GPL570 platform. Differential lncRNA expression between normal ovarian tissues and ovarian tumors were analyzed using the R package ‘limma’, and patient prognosis was accessed using the package ‘survival’. Four databases, GSE14001, GSE18520, GSE38666 and GSE40595, were used for the analysis. A total of 64 lncRNAs were highly expressed and 4 were downregulated within these four databases. Prognostic analysis of the 68 lncRNAs in the four databases was performed, and revealed that the expression of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1627 (LINC01627) was negatively associated with patient prognosis in GSE19829 and GSE62193; there was no association between LINC01627 expression and patient's prognosis in GSE18520 or GSE63885. To investigate the proposed association between LINC01627 and patient prognosis, meta-analysis revealed that the total hazard ratio was 1.38 and the 95% confidence interval was between 1.04 and 1.83. Subgroup analysis revealed that LINC01627 may predict patient prognosis in high-grade, advanced and serous epithelial ovarian cancer, which was a risk factor for prognosis. Further assessment was performed in clinical samples and ovarian cancer cells, where the knockdown of LINC01627 inhibited the proliferative and migratory capacities of HO8910 and HEY cells. Collectively, the present results suggested that lncRNA LINC01627 may serve an oncogenic role in the development of epithelial ovarian tumors. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"SILAC Quantitative Proteomics and Biochemical Analyses Reveal a Novel Molecular Mechanism by Which ADAM12S Promotes the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells through Upregulating Hexokinase 1",2019,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for ?14% of total lung cancer, which is the worldwide leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer. Although SCLC can be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, its 5 year survival rate is still below 7%. Therefore, it is essential to discover new molecules and elucidate the underlying mechanisms modulating the tumorigenesis and metastasis of SCLC for the unmet medical needs. The secreted form of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12S) is highly expressed in SCLC and promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of SCLC cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still elusive. Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics, we identify 82 ADAM12S-regulated proteins in an SCLC cell line. Our proteomics and biochemical analyses discover that ADAM12S overexpression elevates while ADAM12 knockdown reduces the rate-limiting enzyme hexokinase 1 (HK1) in glycolysis. Through bioinformatics analyses, genetic manipulation, and in vitro assays, we further reveal that ADAM12S promotes the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of SCLC cells through upregulating HK1. This work links ADAM12S to glucose metabolic pathways in its attribution to the tumorigenesis and metastasis of SCLC cells and might provide valuable information for the exploration of therapeutic intervention for SCLC. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","ADAM12 protein; arginine; cell protein; glucose; glucose transporter 4; hexokinase 1; lactic acid; lysine; messenger RNA; aerobic glycolysis; Article; biochemical analysis; bioinformatics; carcinogenesis; cell culture; cell invasion; cell lysate; cell migration; cell proliferation; colony formation; controlled study; genetic manipulation; glucose intake; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; lung adenocarcinoma; metabolism; metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; proteomics; sarcoplasmic reticulum; small cell lung cancer; squamous cell carcinoma; upregulation; Western blotting"
"The effect and mechanism of miR-210 in down-regulating the autophagy of lung cancer cells",2019,"This project aims to investigate the roles of miR-210 in autophagy of lung cancer cells and the related mechanism. The expressions of miR-210 and ATG7 in 30 cancer tissues and the adjacent tissues in patients with lung cancer were compared using RT-qPCR methods, Western Blot assay was carried out to test the expression of ATG7 in protein. Moreover, the dual luciferase reporter gene assay system was used to confirm ATG7 is a target gene of miR-210. Furthermore, lung cancer cell line A549 was transfected with either miR-210 mimics or inhibitors and RT-qPCR methods was used to detect the expression of miR-210 and ATG7. Next, MTT assay was used to examine the effect of miR-210 on the growth of the lung cancer cells, and finally, the expression of autophagy related genes, ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 were detected by Western Blot and ICC assay. We observed that miR-210 was significantly increased and ATG7 was markedly decreased in cancer tissue of patients with lung cancer compared with normal tissue. Moreover, results of dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that ATG7 is a direct target of miR-210. Next, transfection of miR-210 mimics in lung cancer cells induced significant increase in cell proliferation, and transfection of miR-210 inhibitors lead to inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-210 induced marked decrease in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1, while transfection of miR-210 inhibitors induced significant increase in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and beclin-1. Our results suggested that miR-210 plays a great role in autophagy of lung cancer cell by targeting ATG7. ? 2018","autophagy related protein 7; beclin 1; membrane protein; microRNA 210; protein LC3 I; protein LC3 II; unclassified drug; Atg7 protein, human; autophagy related protein 7; microRNA; MIRN210 microRNA, human; A-549 cell line; adult; Article; autophagy; cancer patient; cancer tissue; cell growth; cell proliferation; controlled study; gene expression; gene function; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; pathogenesis; protein expression; aged; autophagy; biosynthesis; down regulation; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; Adult; Aged; Autophagy; Autophagy-Related Protein 7; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Down-Regulation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged"
"Fatty acid receptor GPR120 promotes breast cancer chemoresistance by upregulating ABC transporters expression and fatty acid synthesis",2019,"Background: Chemoresistance is the major cause of neoadjuvant treatment failure in breast cancer patients. Despite recent progress, the mechanism underlying chemoresistance remains to be further defined. Methods: Expression of G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the biopsies of primary breast cancer who subsequently underwent preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of -function studies were performed to reveal the effects and related mechanism of GPR120 signaling pathway in the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells. Findings: We identified that GPR120, a receptor for long-chain fatty acids, was important for the acquisition of chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. We showed that GPR120 expression was positively associated with clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients. In breast cancer cells, GPR120 enhanced the de novo synthesis of fatty acids that served as GPR120 ligands to activate GPR120 signaling via a feedback mechanism. Upregulated GPR120 signaling rendered cells resistant to epirubicin-induced cell death by upregulating ABC transporters expression and thus decreasing the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin. Akt/NF-κB pathway was responsible for the GPR120-mediated expression of ABC transporters leading to modulation of the concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in cells. The functional importance of GPR120 in chemoresistance was further validated using epirubicin-treated tumor xenografts, in which we showed that blockade of GPR120 signaling with AH7614 or GPR120-siRNA significantly compromised chemoresistance. Interpretation: Our results highlight that GPR120 might be a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer chemoresistance.

"Analyses of predictive factors for pathological complete remission in neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer",2019,"Purpose: To analyze relevant factors for pathological complete remission (PCR) after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. Methods: The clinical data of 531 patients with the Ameri-can Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II or III rectal cancer from January 2014 to December 2017 were retrospec-tively analyzed. Among these patients, 100 (18.83%) patients achieved PCR. Univariate and multivariate logistic regres-sion analyses were applied to analyze the predictive factors for PCR after neoadjuvant therapy. Results: According to univariate analysis, carcinoembryon-ic antigen (CEA) before chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) (p=0.021), tumor (T) stage before CRT (p=0.002), interval between the end of CRT and surgery (p<0.001) and maximum depth of tumor invasion before CRT (p=0.039) influenced significant-ly PCR. Multivariate analysis manifested that the CEA level before CRT [p=0.037, odds ratio (OR) =0.435] and the interval between the end of CRT and surgery (p=0.004, OR=2.864) were significant predictive factors for PCR. Stratified analy-sis showed that low-level CEA before CRT (p=0.029) affected PCR only in non-smoking group. Conclusions: PCR can be observed in some patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. Low-level CEA before CRT and long interval between CRT and surgery are predictive factors for PCR of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer, but low-level CEA is effective in predicting PCR in non-smokers only. ? 2019 Zerbinis Publications.

"MicroRNA-143-3p inhibits colorectal cancer metastases by targeting ITGA6 and ASAP3",2019,"MicroRNAs, which regulate mRNAs, operate through a variety of signaling pathways to participate in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we found that microRNA (miR)-143-3p expression was significantly lower in both CRC and liver metastatic CRC tissues from liver compared with normal colonic tissues. Functional assays showed that miR-143-3p inhibited CRC cell invasion and migration in vitro. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified miR-143-3p target mRNAs. Among the candidate targets, only the expression of integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) and ArfGAP with the SH3 domain and ankyrin repeat and PH domain 3 (ASAP3) were significantly reduced by miR-143-3p mimics as examined by western blot, and the metastasis potential of CRC cells was attenuated by endogenous ITGA6 and ASAP3 knockdown, determined by migration and invasion assays. Both ITGA6 and ASAP3 were upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. Analysis of the relationship between clinicopathological features and ITGA6/ASAP3 protein expression in 200 patients with CRC showed a significant difference in positive ITGA6 expression between the early stage (I?+?II) and the advanced stage (III?+?IV), and ASAP3 expression levels positively correlated with metastasis in the lymph nodes. These results indicate that miR-143-3p acts as an anti-oncogene by downregulating ITGA6/ASAP3 protein expression and could offer new insight into potential therapeutic targets for CRC. ? 2018 The Authors.

"The Value of Plasma-Based MicroRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Ovarian Cancer",2019,"Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most threatening diseases among women in the world. Plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) may serve as promising diagnostic biomarkers for patients with OC. Materials and Methods: Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based on Exiqon panel, we identified 27 differentially expressed miRNAs from 2 OC pool samples and 1 normal control (NC) pool in the initial screening phase. Then we further validated the identified miRNAs through the training (32 OC vs. 34 NCs) and validation stages (69 OC vs. 66 NCs) using qRT-PCR. The expression levels of the miRNAs were also assessed in tissues and exosomes. Results: Five plasma miRNAs (miR-205-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-10a-5p, miR-346 and miR-328-3p) were significantly overexpressed in OC in comparison with NCs. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the 5-miRNA panel were 0.788 for the training stage and 0.763 for the validation stage. The level of miR-205-5p has significantly different expression in patients with well-moderate histological grade compared with those with a poor grade (P = 0.012). The expression levels of the 5 miRNAs were also significantly upregulated in the exosomes of OC plasma samples (32 OC vs. 32 NCs). However, the expression of the 4 miRNAs (miR-145-5p, miR-10a-5p, miR-346 and miR-328-3p) was significantly lower in tumor samples than in normal tissues (22 OC vs. 22 NCs). Conclusions: The 5 plasma miRNAs may be noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers of OC. The plasma miR-205-5p level may reflect the change trend of the histological grade of OC patients. ? 2019 The Authors","microRNA; microRNA 10a 5p; microRNA 145 5p; microRNA 205 5p; microRNA 328 5p; microRNA 346; tumor marker; unclassified drug; adult; Article; bioinformatics; cancer growth; cancer screening; cancer staging; clinical article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; exosome; female; gene expression; gene identification; gene overexpression; genetic analysis; histology; human; human tissue; ovary cancer; quantitative analysis; receiver operating characteristic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation"
"Bromodomain and extraterminal proteins foster the core transcriptional regulatory programs and confer vulnerability in liposarcoma",2019,"Liposarcomas (LPSs) are a group of malignant mesenchymal tumors showing adipocytic differentiation. Here, to gain insight into the enhancer dysregulation and transcriptional addiction in this disease, we chart super-enhancer structures in both LPS tissues and cell lines. We identify a bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein-cooperated FUS-DDIT3 function in myxoid LPS and a BET protein-dependent core transcriptional regulatory circuitry consisting of FOSL2, MYC, and RUNX1 in de-differentiated LPS. Additionally, SNAI2 is identified as a crucial downstream target that enforces both proliferative and metastatic potentials to de-differentiated LPS cells. Genetic depletion of BET genes, core transcriptional factors, or SNAI2 mitigates consistently LPS malignancy. We also reveal a compelling susceptibility of LPS cells to BET protein degrader ARV-825. BET protein depletion confers additional advantages to circumvent acquired resistance to Trabectedin, a chemotherapy drug for LPS. Moreover, this study provides a framework for discovering and targeting of core oncogenic transcriptional programs in human cancers. ? 2019, The Author(s).","actin; bromodomain and extraterminal protein; epidermal growth factor; Myc protein; trabectedin; transcription factor; transcription factor RUNX1; transcriptional factor fosl2; unclassified drug; ARV-825; azepine derivative; FUS-DDIT3 fusion protein, human; oncoprotein; thalidomide; tumor protein; cancer; cell; chemotherapy; differentiation; genetic engineering; protein; tumor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioassay; body weight; brdu incorporation assay; cancer cell culture; carcinogenicity; cell cycle analysis; cell lysate; cell viability assay; chromatin immunoprecipitation; colony formation assay; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; gene silencing; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; liposarcoma; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; plasmid; protein depletion; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; signal transduction; tumor volume; analogs and derivatives; animal; carcinogenesis; drug effect; enhancer region; genetic transcription; genetics; human; human genome; liposarcoma; metabolism; nonobese diabetic mouse; nucleotide sequence; pathology; SCID mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Azepines; Base Sequence; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Genome, Human; Humans; Liposarcoma; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Proteins; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Thalidomide; Transcription, Genetic"
"DNA polymerase iota (Pol I) promotes the migration and invasion of breast cancer cell via EGFR-ERK-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition",2019,"Dysregulation of DNA polymerase iota (Pol I) in breast cancer might contribute to the accumulation of genomic mutations and promotes breast cancer progression. In this study we explored the clinical relevance and biological function of Pol I in breast cancer. METHODS: qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of Pol I in 31 breast cancer tissues. Then the stable overexpression of Pol I and knockdown of Pol I breast cancer cell lines were constructed. Wound-healing assay and transwell assay were performed to evaluate cell migratory and invasiveness, respectively. Signaling pathway was analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: The expression levels of Pol I is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and significantly higher in breast cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis compared to those without lymph node metastasis. Elevated Pol I expression promoted migratory and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Signaling pathway analysis indicated EGFR-ERK cascade works as a mediator of Pol I -induced EMT of breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the underlying mechanism by which Pol I promotes breast cancer progression, suggesting that Pol I may be a potential therapeutic target against breast cancer. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Silk sericin hydrolysate is a potential candidate as a serum-substitute in the culture of Chinese hamster ovary and henrietta lacks cells",2019,"The silk sericin hydrolysate (SSH) from the waste of silk processing as a substitute of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used for the culture of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Henrietta Lacks (Hela) strain of human cervical cancer cells. The survival ratio of these cells cultured in SSH media were similar to or higher than those in FBS media. Especially after the serum was replaced by low concentration of SSH at 15.0 μg/ml for 5 d, the proliferation of both cells was also similar to or higher than that of FBS group; the percentages of CHO and Hela cells in S-phase were 28.9 and 28.0%, respectively. The former is nearly two times that of FBS group, the latter is also higher than the control group. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that among the differentially expressed genes, the relative expression of CXCL12 gene of CHO cells in SSH group increased, was three times that of serum group, and the relative expression of LCN2 gene of Hela cells increased 2.8 times, indicating that these related genes were activated to promote cell growth and proliferation. These results fully illustrated the hydrolysated sericin has a potential use as serum substitutes in cell culture. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"KCTD: A new gene family involved in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders",2019,"The underlying molecular basis for neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders is not known. In contrast, mechanistic understanding of other brain disorders including neurodegeneration has advanced considerably. Yet, these do not approach the knowledge accrued for many cancers with precision therapeutics acting on well-characterized targets. Although the identification of genes responsible for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders remains a major obstacle, the few causally associated genes are ripe for discovery by focusing efforts to dissect their mechanisms. Here, we make a case for delving into mechanisms of the poorly characterized human KCTD gene family. Varying levels of evidence support their roles in neurocognitive disorders (KCTD3), neurodevelopmental disease (KCTD7), bipolar disorder (KCTD12), autism and schizophrenia (KCTD13), movement disorders (KCTD17), cancer (KCTD11), and obesity (KCTD15). Collective knowledge about these genes adds enhanced value, and critical insights into potential disease mechanisms have come from unexpected sources. Translation of basic research on the KCTD-related yeast protein Whi2 has revealed roles in nutrient signaling to mTORC1 (KCTD11) and an autophagy-lysosome pathway affecting mitochondria (KCTD7). Recent biochemical and structure-based studies (KCTD12, KCTD13, KCTD16) reveal mechanisms of regulating membrane channel activities through modulation of distinct GTPases. We explore how these seemingly varied functions may be disease related. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Disordered sleep and myopia among adolescents: a propensity score matching analysis",2019,"Purpose: Observational studies have suggested a possible relationship between disordered sleep and myopia, but the association may be subject to selection biases. We aimed to minimize selection biases and assess the association by applying a propensity score matching (PSM) approach. Methods: The study was designed as a school-based cross-sectional study on a Chinese cohort aged 13–14?years in rural areas of China. The Chinese version of the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire was used for the measurement of sleep quality and a score of 41 or more was used to define the presence of disordered sleep. Each participant’s refractive status was measured after cycloplegia using an autorefractor and myopia was defined as spherical equivalent <?0.50 D. The propensity scores for disordered sleep were formulated using nine potential confounders. We matched the propensity scores for subjects with and without disordered sleep within a caliper of 0.01 of logit function of propensity scores. Results: In this study, 474 pairs (1 subject with vs. 1 subject without disordered sleep) were successfully matched based on propensity scores. The odds ratio (OR) of myopia for disordered sleep before PSM reached conventional levels of statistical significance (OR: 1.43 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 2.58, p =?0.01). After matching, the magnitude of association was reduced and the OR of myopia was not significant (OR: 1.54 95% CI 0.90, 2.57, p =?0.46). Conclusions: At current stage, there are insufficient evidence indicating that disordered sleep could affect the development of myopia in adolescents. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cyclopentolate; adolescent; Article; body height; Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire; China; Chinese; cohort analysis; confounding variable; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; educational status; eye refraction; family history; father; female; human; major clinical study; male; mother; myopia; pretest posttest control group design; priority journal; propensity score; recreation; risk factor; selection bias; sex difference; sleep disorder; sleep disorder assessment; sleep quality; complication; insomnia; myopia; prevalence; propensity score; Adolescent; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Myopia; Prevalence; Propensity Score; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"
"Facile preparation of pH-responsive PEGylated prodrugs for activated intracellular drug delivery",2019,"PEGylated prodrug, covalent attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains to therapeutic drugs, is one of the most promising techniques to improve the water-solubility, stability, and therapeutic effect of drugs. In this study, three PEGylated acid-sensitive prodrugs DOX-PEG-DOX with different molecular weights, were prepared via Schiff-base reaction between aldehyde-modified PEG and the amino groups of doxorubicin (DOX). This kind of amphiphilic polymeric prodrug could be self-assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous solution. The average particle size and morphologies of the prodrug nanoparticles under different pH conditions were observed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. It turned out that the nanoparticles could be kept stable in the physiological environment, but degraded in acidic medium. Subsequently, we also investigated in vitro drug release behavior and found that the prodrug had acid-sensitive property. The cytotoxicity and intracellular uptake assays revealed that the prodrugs could rapidly internalized by HeLa or HepG2 cells to release DOX and effectively inhibited the proliferation of the tumor cells, which have the potential for use in cancer therapy. ? 2019 The Author",""
"Preliminary study of the reliability and validity of the Johns Hopkins Adapted Cognitive Exam (Chinese version) in neurological intensive care unit patients",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Johns Hopkins Adapted Cognitive Exam (ACE) in neurological intensive care unit patients. Design: The English version of the ACE was translated and adapted into Chinese. The cognitive function of 40 critically ill NICU patients was assessed using the Chinese version of the ACE and the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) battery. Scores on the ACE and MMSE were analyzed, and the scale’s content validity, construct validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability metrics were determined. Result: The coefficients for the Pearson correlations between individual item scores and total score ranged from 0.617 to 0.938, and content validity was good. ACE scores were significantly correlated with MMSE scores(r?=?0.822, p<0.05). Five factors were extracted during the principal component analysis, the cumulative contribution of which was 85.90%. Overall, the factor loading of each item was 0.5, and the scale had good construct validity. The Chinese version of the ACE demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’α?=?0.756), inter-rater reliability (ICC>0.95), and test-retest reliability (ICC?=?0.652–0.979).

"Impact of Relative Blood Glucose Changes on Mortality Risk of Patient with Acute Ischemic Stroke and Treated with Mechanical Thrombectomy",2019,"Background and purpose: The impacts of stress hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia on mortality of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) are largely unclear. This study aimed to use stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) to evaluate the influence of pretreatment relative blood glucose changes on mortality risk after MT. Methods: The study retrospectively enrolled 321 acute ischemic stroke patients treated with MT. SHR was calculated as random blood glucose at admission divided by average blood glucose which estimated by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Patients with HbAlc greater than or equal to 6.5% were considered to have background hyperglycemia, patients were tertiled according to their SHR. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze 90 days mortality between SHR categories. Results: Compared with the middle tertiles group (Q2) which the blood glucose is closet to baseline glycaemia, patients in the lowest tertiles group (Q1) and highest tertiles group (Q3) have a higher mortality risk (odds ratio [OR], 3.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-11.06) (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.25-8.12), the differences is still significant after further adjusted for admission hyperglycemia (?11.1 mmol/L). In patients without background hyperglycemia, the mortality risk is significantly higher in Q3 group (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.06-8.53), no significant differences was found between three groups after adjusted for admission hyperglycemia (?11.1 mmol/L). Conclusions: SHR identified acute ischemic stroke patients with relative hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia may have higher mortality risk after MT. ? 2018","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; adult; analytical parameters; Article; brain ischemia; clinical outcome; comparative study; female; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; major clinical study; male; mechanical thrombectomy; middle aged; mortality risk; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; physiological stress; priority journal; retrospective study; stress hyperglycemia ratio; stroke patient; aged; blood; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; complication; metabolism; mortality; risk factor; Aged; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Brain Ischemia; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Male; Mechanical Thrombolysis; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stroke"
"Pseudogene CHIAP2 inhibits proliferation and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells by means of the WNT pathway",2019,"Recently, pseudogenes have emerged as critical regulators in the onset of human neoplasia. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of pseudogene alterations at transcriptional levels in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By combinations of differential expression analysis, survival analysis, and univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, we identified four dysregulated pseudogenes, whose expression level was closely related to LUAD patients' prognosis and the four pseudogene signature could act as an independent prognostic indicator for LUAD patients. We further characterized CHIAP2, one of those four pseudogenes, whose expression level was the most closely linked to LUAD patients' prognosis. Consistent with our analysis, the expression of CHIAP2 was abnormally downregulated in LUAD tissues compared with that in normal tissues in our 50 pairs of clinical samples. Functional assays demonstrated that upregulation of CHIAP2 significantly impaired cell proliferation and invasion. After performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and small RNA-seq between CHIAP2 overexpression and negative control LUAD cell lines, we identified differentially expressed messenger RNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs), among which six miRNAs were downregulated. Target genes of six downregulated miRNAs were predicted with online miRNA target prediction tools and significant pathways including the WNT signal pathway were identified with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. By combining predictor genes of six downregulated miRNAs and dysregulated genes of the WNT pathway, we inferred that overexpression of CHAP2 may inhibit LUAD cell proliferation and invasion via modulation of NFATC2 or GSK3B (WNT signal pathway) targeted by miR-3614-5p or miR-873-3p. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","chiap2 protein; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 3614 5p; microRNA 873 3p; protein; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; Article; cancer prognosis; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; priority journal; protein expression; pseudogene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; RNA sequence; survival analysis; upregulation; Wnt signaling"
"Dandy–Walker syndrome associated with syringomyelia in an adult: a case report and literature review",2019,"Dandy–Walker syndrome associated with syringomyelia is a rare condition, with few reports of adult cases. We describe an adult case of Dandy–Walker syndrome with concomitant syringomyelia. A 33-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of walking instability, numbness in the hands, memory deterioration, and urinary incontinence. A physical examination showed a positive Romberg sign. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed hydrocephalus, a cyst in the posterior fossa, absence of the cerebellar vermis, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cerebella, and syringomyelia. All of these symptoms were consistent with the diagnosis of Dandy–Walker syndrome. Surgery involving arachnoid adhesiolysis and endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed. At the 6-month follow-up, the symptoms were completely relieved. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that syringomyelia was greatly reduced and the hydrocephalus remained unchanged.

"Preparation, characterization and application of anti-human OX40 ligand (OX40L) monoclonal antibodies and establishment of a sandwich ELISA for autoimmune diseases detection",2019,"OX40L (CD252, TNFSF4), a type II transmembrane protein which like other tumor necrosis factor ligands, involved in the costimulation and differentiation of T cells, functions as a positive signal in immune response. To investigate the biological function of soluble OX40L (sOX40L), three functional anti-OX40L monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3D2, 3F7 and 2H3 were obtained by hybridoma technology. Besides, specificity of the mAbs was further demonstrated by ELISA, Western blot and Immunofluorescence experiments. We also developed a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on two anti-human OX40L antibodies 3D2 and 3F7 with different epitopes. Using the ELISA system, we found that sOX40L in the sera of healthy donors increases in an age-dependent manner and that enhanced sOX40L expression in some autoimmune diseases especially in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, suggesting the potential diagnostic significance of sOX40L in the autoimmune diseases. Together, these data demonstrate that the existence of circulating sOX40L in human sera might play an important role in immunoregulation. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","3d2 monoclonal antibody; 3f7 monoclonal antibody; CD134 antigen; cytokine; monoclonal antibody; OX40 ligand; unclassified drug; OX40 ligand; TNFSF4 protein, human; animal cell; Article; autoimmune disease; CD4+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; cytokine release; cytokine response; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; human; immunofluorescence; immunoregulation; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic sclerosis; Western blotting; blood; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immunology; metabolism; procedures; Sjoegren syndrome; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; OX40 Ligand; Sjogren's Syndrome"
"Light-Enhanced O 2 -Evolving Nanoparticles Boost Photodynamic Therapy to Elicit Antitumor Immunity",2019,"Breast cancer remains to show high mortality and poor prognosis in women despite of significant progress in recent diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we report the rational design of a highly efficient ultrasmall nanotheranostic agent with excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT) performance to against breast cancer and its metastasis by eliciting antitumor immunity. The ultrasmall nanoagent (3.1 ± 0.4 nm) was fabricated from polyethylene glycol modified Cu 2-x Se nanoparticles, β-cyclodextrin, and chlorin e6 under ambient conditions. The resultant nanoplatform (CS-CD-Ce6 NPs) can be passively accumulated into the tumor to exhibit dramatic antitumor efficacy through the excellent PDT effect under near-infrared irradiation. The excellent PDT performance of this nanoplatform is owing to its role as a Fenton-like Haber-Weiss catalyst for the efficient degradation of H 2 O 2 within the tumor to release hydroxyl radicals ( · OH) and very toxic singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) under irradiation. The generated vast amounts of reactive oxygen species not only killed primary tumor cells but also elicited immunogenic cell death (ICD) to release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and induced proinflammatory M1-macrophages polarization. Thereby, antitumor immune responses against the metastasis of breast cancer were robustly evoked. Our work demonstrates that ultrasmall Cu 2-x Se nanoparticle-based nanoplatform offers a promising way to prevent cancer metastasis via immunogenic effects through its excellent PDT performance. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell death; Copper compounds; Diagnosis; Diseases; Infrared devices; Irradiation; Molecular oxygen; Nanoparticles; Pathology; Selenium compounds; Tumors; Ambient conditions; Anti-tumor efficacy; Anti-tumor immune; Antitumor immunity; hypoxia; Molecular patterns; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Reactive oxygen species; Photodynamic therapy; hydrogen peroxide; metal nanoparticle; oxygen; animal; breast tumor; cell hypoxia; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; female; human; immunity; immunology; light; metastasis; mouse; pathology; photochemotherapy; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Hypoxia; Female; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Immunity; Light; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Oxygen; Photochemotherapy; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Delivery of miR-675 by stem cell-derived exosomes encapsulated in silk fibroin hydrogel prevents aging-induced vascular dysfunction in mouse hindlimb",2019,"Vascular disease is a major complication of aging, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the aging-induced vascular dysfunction remain unclear, and there is no effective treatment to prevent aging induced diseases. The objectives of the present study are to identify the signaling pathway mediating aging-induced vascular dysfunction and to develop an exosome based therapy to inhibit aging process. We used 11-month-old C57BL6 mice as pre-aging animal model and H 2 O 2 treated H9C2 cells as an in vitro aging model to examine the therapeutic effect of miR-675. We found decreased expression of the potential aging modulator miR-675 in aging muscle, and H 2 O 2 treatment decreased the expression of miR-675 and upregulated the expression of the aging marker β-gal and TGF-β1. We also found that miR-675 mimic decreased β-gal staining in H 2 O 2 treated H9C2 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays verified TGF-β1 as the target gene of miR-675. Moreover, senescent H9C2 cells incubated with exosomes isolated from UMSCs transfected with the miR-675 mimic showed increased expression of miR-675, reduced activity of the aging marker β-gal and reduced protein levels of TGF-β1. We employed silk fibroin hydrogel to encapsulate exosomes in order to prolong the half-life of exosome in vivo. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that exosomes were successfully encapsulated by the hydrogel. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging showed that the miR-675 exosomes encapsulated in silk fibroin hydrogel promote blood perfusion in ischemic hindlimbs. We demonstrated that miR-675 exosomes encapsulated in silk fibroin hydrogel provided sustained release of exosomes in vitro, and increased the retention time of red fluorescent PKH26-exosome in the tissue. Taken together, this study identified miR-675 as an important regulator of cell senescence and provided a novel strategy to deliver powerful exosomes by silk fibroin hydrogel to treat aging-induced vascular dysfunction. ? 2019 The Authors","Aging of materials; Cytology; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Mammals; Stem cells; Exosome; Hind limbs; Laser Doppler perfusion imaging; Luciferase reporter assays; miR-675; Molecular mechanism; Silk fibroin hydrogels; Therapeutic effects; Hydrogels; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; fibroin; microRNA; MIRN675 microRNA, mouse; transforming growth factor beta1; aging; animal; Bombyx; cell aging; cell shape; chemistry; cytology; exosome; gene expression regulation; gene transfer; genetics; HEK293 cell line; hindlimb; human; hydrogel; mesenchymal stem cell; metabolism; mouse; nucleotide sequence; pathology; pathophysiology; perfusion; signal transduction; umbilical cord; vascularization; Aging; Animals; Base Sequence; Bombyx; Cell Shape; Cellular Senescence; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21; Exosomes; Fibroins; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Transfer Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Hindlimb; Humans; Hydrogels; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; MicroRNAs; Perfusion; Signal Transduction; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Umbilical Cord"
"Intermittent wetting clothing as a cooling strategy for body heat strain alleviation of vulnerable populations during a severe heatwave incident",2019,"Many documented studies have demonstrated the human mortality rate increases during severe heatwaves. There remains a need for further explore ecologically valid cooling strategies to alleviate body heat strain during extreme heatwaves. The main aim of this work was to explore whether intermittent wetting clothing can be served as an ecologically valid cooling strategy to mitigate heat stress on inactive vulnerable populations not having access to air-conditioning during a severe heatwave. Ten young male subjects underwent two 90-min separate trials: a dry clothing trial (i.e., CON) and a wetted clothing cooling trial (i.e., WEC). A set of light summer wear was chosen and intermittently wetted by tap water at intervals of every 30 min. Physiological and perceptual responses of subjects were examined and compared. All trials were performed in a chamber with an air temperature of 43 ± 0.5 °C, RH= 57 ± 5% and an air velocity of 0.15 ± 0.05 m/s (WBGT=37.35 °C). Results demonstrated that WEC, compared with CON, could significantly reduce both the mean skin temperature and the core temperature throughout the 5–90th min and 25–90th min of the trial, respectively (p < 0.05). Besides, WEC could also remarkable reduce local skin temperatures at those body sites covered by wet clothing (p < 0.05). In comparison, no significant difference was found between WEC and CON on perceptual responses. Further, it was also found from PHS simulations that conditions with a partial water vapour pressure ? 3.1–3.5 kPa would not induce pronounced core temperature rises at 43 °C. Finally, it may be concluded that intermittent wetting clothing could be served as an ecologically valid cooling strategy to reduce thermophysiological strain of vulnerable populations while seating during humid heatwaves and thereby improve their health and safety. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","tap water; adult; air pressure; air temperature; Article; body temperature; clinical effectiveness; core temperature; heat; heat stress; human; induced hypothermia; male; normal human; perception; simulation; skin temperature; summer; temperature measurement; vulnerable population; water vapor; wettability; young adult; heat; heat injury; protective clothing; randomization; standards; thermoregulation; Adult; Body Temperature Regulation; Heat Stress Disorders; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Protective Clothing; Random Allocation; Skin Temperature; Wettability"
"Risk Factors for Severe Community-aquired Pneumonia among Children Hospitalized with CAP Younger Than 5 Years of Age",2019,"Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) causes great morbidity and mortality as well as enormous economic burden worldwide. This study intended to describe the clinical characteristics of CAP and explore the risk factors of severe CAP among children in downtown Suzhou, China. Methods: This was a retrospective study of childhood hospitalizations in Soochow University Affiliated Children's Hospital from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. Children who were residents of downtown Suzhou, 29 days to < 5 years of age, with discharge diagnosis codes J09 to J18 and J20 to J22 were included. Medical charts and chest radiograph reports were reviewed for included children to collect clinical information. CAP with intensive care unit (ICU) admission and poor clinical outcome were categorized as severe CAP. Results: A total of 28,043 children were identified with CAP; 17,501 (62.4%) of these children were male, and 20,747 (74.0%) children were less than 2 years of age. The common clinical symptoms at admission were cough (94.8%), fever (52.9%), wheezing (37.7%) and respiratory distress (9.5%). In total, 21,898 (78.1%) children had radiologic evidence of pneumonia, and 1,403 (5.0%) children developed at least 1 complication. Multivariate regression analysis showed that younger age, congenital heart disease and abnormal white blood cells, and C-reactive protein results were independent risk factors for both ICU admission and poor clinical outcome (odds ratio [OR] > 1 for all). Respiratory distress symptoms at admission (OR = 12.10) greatly increased the risk for ICU admission, while ICU admission (OR = 8.87) and complications (OR = 2.55) increased the risk of poor outcome. However, cough was a protective factor for ICU admission, so were wheezing, antibiotic and antiviral therapies for clinical failure. Conclusion: Pediatric CAP hospitalizations of those of younger age, with congenital heart diseases, respiratory distress symptoms/tachypnea, abnormal white blood cells and C-reactive protein results as well as complications were at higher risk for progressing to severe CAP. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Long noncoding RNA AK027294 acts as an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer by up-regulating STAT3",2019,"OBJECTIVE: Recent researches have proved that long noncoding RNAs (ln-cRNAs) play an important role in multiple diseases, including malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to explore the exact role of ln-cRNA AK027294 in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to investigate the possible underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect the AK027294 expression in NS-CLC patients. Then, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay were performed, respectively. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and Western blot assay were used to explore the potential mechanism. RESULTS: The expression level of AK027294 NSCLC samples was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues. Subsequent functional assays showed that the growth ability of NSCLC cells was markedly inhibited after AK027294 silence. In addition, after AK027294 knock-down, the expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) was remarkably down-regulated. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the STAT3 expression was positively correlated with the AK027294 expression in NSCLC tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The above results indicated that AK027294 could enhance the growth ability of NSCLC by up-regulating STAT3. Our findings suggested that AK027294 might be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC. ? 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

"Holo-Lactoferrin Modified Liposome for Relieving Tumor Hypoxia and Enhancing Radiochemotherapy of Cancer",2019,"Hypoxic microenvironments in the solid tumor play a negative role in radiotherapy. Holo-lactoferrin (holo-Lf) is a natural protein, which acts as a potential ligand of transferrin receptor (TfR). In this work, an anticancer drug, doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded liposome-holo-Lf nanocomposites, is developed for tumor targeting and imaging guided combined radiochemotherapy. Dox-loaded liposome-holo-Lf (Lf-Liposome-Dox) nanocomposites exhibit significant cellular uptake likely owing to the TfR receptor-mediated targeting accumulation of Lf-Liposome-Dox nanocomposites. Additionally, the nanocomposites exhibit high accumulation in the tumor site after intravenous injection as evidenced from in vivo fluorescence imaging. More importantly, it is found that the holo-Lf has the ability to catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to oxygen for relieving the tumor hypoxic microenvironment. Photoacoustic imaging further confirms the abundant generation of oxygen in the presence of Lf-Liposome-Dox nanocomposites. Based on these findings, in vivo combined radiochemotherapy is performed using Lf-Liposome-Dox as therapeutic agent, achieving excellent cancer treatment effect. The study further promotes the potential biomedical application of holo-Lf in cancer treatment. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"MiR-150 promotes angiogensis and proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells in deep venous thrombosis by targeting SRCIN1",2019,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the third most common cardiovascular disease. miR-150 is one of important microRNAs which play critical role in various cellular function such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In this study, we investigate the effect of miR-150 on EPCs function ex vivo and thrombus resolution in vivo. We determined miR-150 expression in EPCs isolated from DVT patients and control subjects by RT-PCR. Potential target of miR-150 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter respectively. The angiogenesis and proliferation were tested by MTT and tube formation assay. A murine model of venous thrombosis was developed as in vivo model. Finally, the effect of miR-150 on EPCs with inferior venous thrombosis were evaluated in vivo. Our data showed that miR-150 was downregulated in EPCs from DVT patients. By using miR-150 agomir and antagomir, we found that miR-150 promoted angiogenesis and proliferation of EPCs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed SRCIN1 as a target of miR-150 and SRCIN1 knockdown inhibited function of EPCs. Forced expression of miR-150 contributed thrombus resolution in a murine model of venous thrombosis. In general, miR-150 was downregulated in EPCs from DVT. Upregulation of miR-150 promoted angiogenesis and proliferation of EPCs by targeting SRCIN1 in vitro and thrombus resolution in vivo. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","antagomir; microRNA; microRNA 150; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIRN150 microRNA, human; MIRN150 microRNA, rat; SNIP protein, human; vesicular transport adaptor protein; adult; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell function; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; down regulation; endothelial progenitor cell; ex vivo study; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene knockdown; gene targeting; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; SRCIN1 gene; upregulation; adolescent; animal; case control study; cell culture; disease model; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; vein thrombosis; young adult; Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Case-Control Studies; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Endothelial Progenitor Cells; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; Venous Thrombosis; Young Adult"
"Longitudinal analysis of the relationships between social support and health-related quality of life in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients",2019,"Background The correlation between social support and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has been well documented, but whether social support changes or whether social support consistently plays a significant role in the various phases of the treatment process remains unknown among hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients. Objectives The aims of this study were to assess the changing trends of HRQOL and social support and evaluate the relationship between HRQOL and social support before and after transplantation. Methods Measures were completed by 122 HSCT patients before and after transplantation. The measures administered included the Perceived Social Support Scale and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant questionnaire. Results The social support score presented a marked downward trend (F = 17.090, P <.001). The overall HRQOL was the lowest, 103.61 (SD, 19.14) at 1 month and increased steadily over time to 108.10 (SD, 19.58) at 3 months and 110.02 (SD, 18.00) at 6 months after HSCT. The generalized estimating equation models showed that social support consistently had a positive impact on HRQOL in the 6-month period post-HSCT. Conclusion We confirmed a significant positive association between social support and HRQOL in HSCT recipients. However, it is noteworthy that the social support score declined during the 6-month period even while the HRQOL scores were increasing. Implications for Practice Social support is closely related to the HRQOL; thus, clinicians should give close attention to social support to improve the HRQOL of HSCT patients. Social support should not be overlooked during the first 6 months after transplantation. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Inhibition of JNK and p38 MAPK-mediated inflammation and apoptosis by ivabradine improves cardiac function in streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy",2019,"Inflammation plays a critical role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), which has been identified as a major predisposing factor for heart failure in diabetic patients. Previous studies indicated that ivabradine (a specific agent for heart rate [HR] reduction) has anti-inflammatory properties, but its role in DCM remains unknown. This study investigated whether ivabradine exerts a therapeutic effect in DCM. C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes; then administered with ivabradine or saline (control). After 12 weeks, the surviving mice were analyzed to determine the cardioprotective effect of ivabradine against DCM. Although treatment with ivabradine did not affect blood glucose levels, it attenuated tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation, reduced histological abnormalities, myocardial apoptosis and collagen deposition, and improved cardiac function in the diabetic mice. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties of ivabradine, but not its inhibitory effect on JNK and p38 MAPK, were observed in high-glucose-cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Attenuating inflammation and apoptosis via intramyocardial injection of lentiviruses carrying short hairpin RNA?targeting JNK and p38 MAPK validated that the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of ivabradine were partly attributed to JNK and p38 MAPK inactivation in diabetic mice. In summary, these data indicate that ivabradine-mediated improvement of cardiac function in STZ-induced diabetic mice may be partly attributed to inhibition of JNK/p38 MAPK-mediated inflammation and apoptosis, which is dependent on the reduction in HR. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","caspase 3; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; glucose; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; ivabradine; lentivirus vector; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; short hairpin RNA; sodium chloride; streptozocin; stress activated protein kinase; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory agent; autacoid; cytokine; ivabradine; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; protein kinase inhibitor; stress activated protein kinase; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; controlled study; cytokine release; diabetic cardiomyopathy; enzyme activation; enzyme inactivation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; glucose blood level; heart protection; male; mouse; mRNA expression level; myocarditis; newborn; nonhuman; nonviral gene delivery system; nonviral gene therapy; priority journal; protein expression level; rat; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; animal; apoptosis; C57BL mouse; cell culture; convalescence; diabetic cardiomyopathy; drug effect; enzymology; genetics; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Apoptosis; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Inflammation Mediators; Ivabradine; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myocytes, Cardiac; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Rats; Recovery of Function; Signal Transduction; Streptozocin"
"Silk sericin hydrolysate is a potential candidate as a serum-substitute in the culture of Chinese hamster ovary and henrietta lacks cells",2019,"The silk sericin hydrolysate (SSH) from the waste of silk processing as a substitute of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used for the culture of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Henrietta Lacks (Hela) strain of human cervical cancer cells. The survival ratio of these cells cultured in SSH media were similar to or higher than those in FBS media. Especially after the serum was replaced by low concentration of SSH at 15.0 μg/ml for 5 d, the proliferation of both cells was also similar to or higher than that of FBS group; the percentages of CHO and Hela cells in S-phase were 28.9 and 28.0%, respectively. The former is nearly two times that of FBS group, the latter is also higher than the control group. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that among the differentially expressed genes, the relative expression of CXCL12 gene of CHO cells in SSH group increased, was three times that of serum group, and the relative expression of LCN2 gene of Hela cells increased 2.8 times, indicating that these related genes were activated to promote cell growth and proliferation. These results fully illustrated the hydrolysated sericin has a potential use as serum substitutes in cell culture. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"Accurate detection of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in clinical gastric cancer tissues using a fluorescent probe",2019,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis of gastric cancer. Therefore, specific and sensitive detection of MMP-2 is of great significance for clinical diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of gastric cancer. Herein, we developed a new approach for accurate detection of MMP-2 activity both in gastric cancer cells and clinical tissues using a fluorescent probe Dab-PLGVRGY-FITC. The capability of the probe for detecting MMP-2 was systematically evaluated in gastric cancer MGC-803 cells and clinical gastric cancer tissues. Around 40-fold fluorescence enhancement at a wavelength of 520 nm was determined for the assays of the probe with recombinant MMP-2. The detection limit of MMP-2 was as low as 42 ng mL-1. Strong fluorescence signals were detected in MGC-803 cells and mouse gastric cancer tissues. Fluorescence signal enhancements of 11 clinical gastric cancer tissue lysates were 5.8 ? 9 times (7.53 ± 0.77 on average) higher than those from gastritis patients. This probe could be potentially used for early diagnosis of gastric cancer in clinics. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Diagnosis; Diseases; Fluorescence; Histology; Probes; Tissue; Clinical diagnosis; Detection limits; Fluorescence enhancement; Fluorescence signals; Fluorescent probes; Gastric cancer cells; Matrix metalloproteinase-2; Sensitive detection; Tissue engineering"

"High expression levels of AGGF1 and MFAP4 predict primary platinum-based chemoresistance and are associated with adverse prognosis in patients with serous ovarian cancer",2019,"Primary platinum-based chemoresistance occurs in approximately one-third of patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC); however, traditional clinical indicators are poor predictors of chemoresistance. So we aimed to identify novel genes as predictors of primary platinum-based chemoresistance. Gene expression microarray analyses were performed to identify the genes related to primary platinum resistance in SOC on two discovery datasets (GSE51373, GSE63885) and one validation dataset (TCGA). Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed to evaluate the predictive values of the genes for platinum resistance. Machine learning algorithms (linear kernel support vector machine and artificial neural network) were applied to build prediction models. Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazards regression and log-rank tests were used to assess the effects of these gene signatures for platinum resistance on prognosis in two independent datasets (GSE9891, GSE32062). AGGF1 and MFAP4 were found highly expressed in patients with platinum-resistant SOC and independently predicted platinum resistance. Platinum resistance prediction models based on these targets had robust predictive power (highest AUC: 0.8056, 95% CI: 0.6338-0.9773; lowest AUC: 0.7245, 95% CI: 0.6052-0.8438). An AGGF1- and MFAP4-centered protein interaction network was built, and hypothetical regulatory pathways were identified. Enrichment analysis indicated that aberrations of extracellular matrix may play important roles in platinum resistance in SOC. High AGGF1 and MFAP4 expression levels were also related to shorter recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with SOC after adjustment for other clinical variables. Therefore, AGGF1 and MFAP4 are potential predictive biomarkers for response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival outcomes in SOC. ? 2018 Ivyspring International Publisher.","antineoplastic metal complex; messenger RNA; adult; age; aged; aggf1 gene; Article; artificial neural network; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chemosensitivity; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; copy number variation; DNA methylation; DNA microarray; extracellular matrix; female; gene expression level; gene expression profiling; human; major clinical study; mfap4 gene; mRNA expression level; ovary cancer; overall survival; predictive value; protein interaction; recurrence free survival; regulator gene; support vector machine; survival analysis; treatment response"

Methods: Baseline hemoglobin levels were measured in 3881 patients with acute ischemic stroke. The primary outcome was defined as composite outcome of major disability and death (modified Rankin Scale score ? 3) at 3 months after stroke onset. Secondary outcomes were separately those of major disability and death. Results: Compared with the lowest quartile of hemoglobin, the multivariate adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) associated with the highest quartile were 1.38 (1.03–1.86), 1.49 (1.11–1.99), 0.79 (0.41–1.52) for primary outcome, major disability and death, respectively. Multiple-adjusted spline regression model showed linear associations of hemoglobin levels with primary outcome (P for linearity =0.037) and major disability (P for linearity =0.004). Subgroup analyses further confirmed the positive association between high hemoglobin and poor prognosis of ischemic stroke. Conclusions: Elevated hemoglobin levels in the acute phase were associated with poor prognosis at 3 months after ischemic stroke. Further prospective studies from other samples of ischemic stroke patients are needed to validate our findings. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","antihypertensive agent; hemoglobin; hemoglobin; adult; aged; Article; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; confidence interval; controlled study; death; disability; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; multiple regression; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; Rankin scale; single blind procedure; stroke patient; systolic blood pressure; blood; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; complication; hypertension; metabolism; statistical model; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Brain Ischemia; Cohort Studies; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Hypertension; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Single-Blind Method; Stroke"
"The effect of overexpression of the enhancer zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) gene on aristolochic acid-induced injury in HK-2 human kidney proximal tubule cells in vitro",2019,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) involves the renal tubular epithelium. The enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) gene has a role in cell development and differentiation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of overexpression of the EZH1 gene on aristolochic acid-induced injury in HK-2 human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells in vitro. The HK-2 cells were cultured and treated with aristolochic acid and the effects of aristolochic acid-injury were evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Overexpression of EZH1 used gene plasmid transfection into HK-2 cells. The cell apoptosis rate and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to determine the expressions of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), apoptosis-related genes, and the downstream target genes of NF-kB signaling pathway, including NFKBIA, CXCL8, and cyclin D1. Aristolochic acid inhibited HK-2 cell viability, induced cell apoptosis, increased the levels of ROS and inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and activated the NF-kB pathway. Overexpression the EZH1 gene inhibited HK-2 cell apoptosis, reduced ROS levels, and down-regulated the expressions of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, Bax and Cyt C mRNA and protein, and increased the expressions of Bcl-2 and NFKBIA, CXCL8 and cyclin D1, indicating that overexpression of EZH1 suppressed NF-kB signaling in aristolochic acid-injured HK-2 cells. Overexpression of EZH1 reduced HK-2 cell injury induced by aristolochic acid in vitro by inhibition of NF-kB signaling. ?

"Efficacy of urinary glucose for diabetes screening: a reconsideration",2019,"Aims: Previous studies indicated that urinary glucose (UG) had a limited efficacy in diabetes screening. This study was designed to have a re-evaluation of its efficacy, taking into consideration the collection method of urine and the measurement approach for UG among Chinese adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 7689 participants without known diabetes, who were fasted and asked to empty bladders before a 75?g glucose loading. Urine was collected 2 h post glucose loading, and UG was measured using quantitative and qualitative approaches. The efficacy of UG in detecting diabetes was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The area under the ROC curve was 0.89 for quantitative UG and 0.87 for qualitative UG. Quantitative UG was positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2?h plasma glucose (2?h PG) (r = 0.55 and 0.56, respectively, both P < 0.001). Quantitative UG displayed a sensitivity of 82.9% and a specificity of 84.7% in detecting diabetes at the corresponding optimal cutoff of 130?mg. Qualitative UG exhibited a sensitivity of 80.2% and a specificity of 85.6% at the optimal cutoff of glycosuria + 1. In addition, the sensitivity of both quantitative and qualitative UG was significantly higher than that of HbA1c (? 6.5%) (P < 0.001) and had a comparable sensitivity to 2?h PG (? 11.1?mmol/L) (P = 0.493). Conclusions: UG, either quantitatively or qualitatively measured at 2 h post glucose loading, was effective in diabetes screening. This indicates that UG is a feasible approach for diabetes screening. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; glucose; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; female; glucose urine level; glucosuria; Han Chinese; high performance liquid chromatography; human; male; population research; predictive value; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; adolescent; analysis; blood; clinical trial; diabetes mellitus; diet restriction; evaluation study; feasibility study; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; glucosuria; mass screening; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; urinalysis; urine; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Fasting; Feasibility Studies; Female; Glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test; Glycosuria; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Sensitivity and Specificity; Urinalysis; Young Adult"
"X-ray-induced reproductive dysfunction and differentially expressed piRNAs in male mice",2019,"The effects of X-ray radiation on spermatogenesis, sperm motility, and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in mice were analyzed. Male C57BL/6 J mice were divided into control and two irradiation groups (n = 9 mice/group). After irradiation of their reproductive regions, the mice were fed for 3 days (irradiation group 1) or 7 days (control and irradiation group 2). The sperm viability, motility, velocity, and motion curve were analyzed. After piRNA expression profiling, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted for validation. Ionizing radiation led to vessel dilation and congestion, fewer spermatogenic cells, and reduced sperm production compared to the control. At 3 and 7 days postirradiation, the sperm count (grade d) increased while sperm viability and sperm lateral head displacement decreased. At 7 days, the sperm abnormality rate was higher compared to the control. Many piRNAs were differentially expressed after irradiation, including decreased and increased expression of mmu_piR_009082 and mmu_piR_020217, respectively. Downregulated piRNAs were involved in Rap1 signaling, non-homologous end-joining, hedgehog signaling, oxytocin signaling, and cholinergic synapse. Upregulated piRNAs participated in pathways including proteoglycans in cancer, phosphatidylinositol signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling, and stem cell pluripotency regulation. X-ray irradiation inhibited spermatogenesis and increased abnormal sperm rate in mice. piRNA-related signaling pathways may be involved in this process. ?

"Upregulation of Spondin-2 protein expression correlates with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the extracellular matrix protein Spondin-2 (SPON2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and to determine its potential value as a prognostic indicator by assessing its correlation with clinicopathological variables and survival. Methods: SPON2 mRNA expression was assessed in 20 matched pairs of HCC and non-cancerous liver tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. SPON2 protein expression was determined in 107 matched pairs of HCC and normal liver tissue by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. Results: Analysis of patient tissues and Oncomine datasets showed that SPON2 mRNA and SPON2 protein expression were both significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, compared with non-cancerous liver tissue; moreover, both correlated significantly with tumor size. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that HCC patients who showed high levels of cytoplasmic SPON2 protein had poorer survival following curative resection, compared with HCC patients who exhibited low protein expression levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that tumor thrombus and SPON2 protein expression both independently correlated with reduced survival in HCC patients. Conclusion: Upregulated expression of SPON2 protein in tumor tissue could be an effective prognostic indicator for patients with HCC. ?

"Enhanced expressions of FHL2 and iASPP predict poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"iASPP is a negative regulator of the apoptotic function of p53, and it can enhance the ability of hematopoietic stem cells to self-renew and resist chemo- and radiation therapy. Recent study showed that iASPP could impact the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemia cells by interacting with FHL2. However, whether they have prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unknown. Eighty-four AML patients with FHL2 and iASPP expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were enrolled in the study. Patients with high expressions of FHL2 and iASPP had significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low expressions (P = 0.005, P = 0.003, respectively). Univariate analysis indicated that high expressions of FHL2 or iASPP were unfavorable for EFS and OS (all P < 0.05), while multivariate analysis confirmed that high FHL2 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (all P < 0.05). In patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), however, EFS and OS were not significantly different between FHL2 or iASPP high- and low-expression groups. Our results suggested that high expressions of FHL2 and iASPP were poor prognostic factors for AML, but the prognostic effect might be overcome by allo-HSCT. ? 2018, Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.","apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53; FHL2 protein; LIM protein; protein p53; regulator protein; unclassified drug; FHL2 protein, human; LIM homeodomain protein; muscle protein; PPP1R13L protein, human; repressor protein; signal peptide; transcription factor; acute myeloid leukemia; adult; aged; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; apoptosis; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell proliferation; event free survival; female; FHL2 gene; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; human; iASPP gene; leukemia cell; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; overall survival; priority journal; acute myeloid leukemia; disease free survival; gene expression regulation; genetics; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; metabolism; middle aged; prognosis; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; LIM-Homeodomain Proteins; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Proteins; Prognosis; Repressor Proteins; Transcription Factors; Young Adult"
"Comparative Study Between Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion with ROI-C Cage and Laminoplasty for Multilevel Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy without Spinal Stenosis",2019,"Background: Selection of anterior versus posterior surgery for multilevel (?3) cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM) continues to be controversial. A comparison between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with ROI-C cage and laminoplasty was made to determine the better treatment for MCSM. Methods: Between 2012 and 2017, 57 patients received either ACDF with ROI-C or laminoplasty (LMP) treatment. Clinical and radiologic outcomes between the 2 groups were compared. Results: In total, 24 patients underwent ACDF with ROI-C cage (ACDF group) and 33 patients underwent LMP (LMP group). They were studied with a median follow-up of 22 months. Less operative blood loss (136.7 ± 60.8 vs. 316.7 ± 139.6 mL, P < 0.001) and a shorter hospital stay (7.8 ± 1.6 vs. 9.9 ± 3.3 days, P < 0.01) were notable for ACDF. The Japanese Orthopedic Association score showed that ACDF and LMP improved similarly (recovery rate, 55.3 ± 19.2% vs. 58.9 ± 18.1%, P > 0.05). Preoperative occupying rate and JOA score significantly affected the operation result (P < 0.01). The cervical lordosis, segmental cervical lordosis, and T1 slope were all larger in the ACDF group. The cervical range of motion decreased 10.6° in the ACDF group and 4.8° in the LMP group (P = 0.01). No significant differences were found between complication rates. Conclusions: ACDF with ROI-C cage has a similar clinical efficacy to LMP for patients with MCSM. There was less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and improved sagittal balance when ACDF was used. However, a greater decrease in range of motion was observed after ACDF. Preoperative occupying ratio and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score are potential risk factors for different outcomes. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; anterior spine fusion; Article; cervical spondylotic myelopathy; clinical outcome; discectomy; female; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; laminoplasty; length of stay; lordosis; major clinical study; male; operative blood loss; postoperative complication; range of motion; surgical technique; cervical vertebra; comparative study; complication; diagnostic imaging; discectomy; laminoplasty; nonparametric test; outcome assessment; procedures; radiography; retrospective study; spinal cord disease; spine fusion; spondylosis; treatment outcome; Cervical Vertebrae; Diskectomy; Female; Humans; Laminoplasty; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Cord Diseases; Spinal Fusion; Spondylosis; Statistics, Nonparametric; Treatment Outcome"
"Selective deletion of endothelial cell calpain in mice reduces diabetic cardiomyopathy by improving angiogenesis",2019,"Aims/hypothesis: The role of non-cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiomyopathy has not been fully addressed. This study investigated whether endothelial cell calpain plays a role in myocardial endothelial injury and microvascular rarefaction in diabetes, thereby contributing to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods: Endothelial cell-specific Capns1-knockout (KO) mice were generated. Conditions mimicking prediabetes and type 1 and type 2 diabetes were induced in these KO mice and their wild-type littermates. Myocardial function and coronary flow reserve were assessed by echocardiography. Histological analyses were performed to determine capillary density, cardiomyocyte size and fibrosis in the heart. Isolated aortas were assayed for neovascularisation. Cultured cardiac microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated with high palmitate. Angiogenesis and apoptosis were analysed. Results: Endothelial cell-specific deletion of Capns1 disrupted calpain 1 and calpain 2 in endothelial cells, reduced cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, and alleviated myocardial dysfunction in mouse models of diabetes without significantly affecting systemic metabolic variables. These protective effects of calpain disruption in endothelial cells were associated with an increase in myocardial capillary density (wild-type vs Capns1-KO 3646.14 ± 423.51 vs 4708.7 ± 417.93 capillary number/high-power field in prediabetes, 2999.36 ± 854.77 vs 4579.22 ± 672.56 capillary number/high-power field in type 2 diabetes and 2364.87 ± 249.57 vs 3014.63 ± 215.46 capillary number/high-power field in type 1 diabetes) and coronary flow reserve. Ex vivo analysis of neovascularisation revealed more endothelial cell sprouts from aortic rings of prediabetic and diabetic Capns1-KO mice compared with their wild-type littermates. In cultured cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, inhibition of calpain improved angiogenesis and prevented apoptosis under metabolic stress. Mechanistically, deletion of Capns1 elevated the protein levels of β-catenin in endothelial cells of Capns1-KO mice and constitutive activity of calpain 2 suppressed β-catenin protein expression in cultured endothelial cells. Upregulation of β-catenin promoted angiogenesis and inhibited apoptosis whereas knockdown of β-catenin offset the protective effects of calpain inhibition in endothelial cells under metabolic stress. Conclusions/interpretation: These results delineate a primary role of calpain in inducing cardiac endothelial cell injury and impairing neovascularisation via suppression of β-catenin, thereby promoting diabetic cardiomyopathy, and indicate that calpain is a promising therapeutic target to prevent diabetic cardiac complications. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","beta catenin; calpain; calpain 1; calpain 2; palmitic acid; beta catenin; calpain; Capns1 protein, mouse; CTNNB1 protein, mouse; adult; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aortic ring (slice); apoptosis; Article; capillary density; capillary rarefaction; capns1 gene; cardiac muscle cell; cell size; controlled study; coronary flow reserve; diabetic cardiomyopathy; echocardiography; endothelium cell; endothelium injury; enzyme activity; ex vivo study; gene; gene deletion; heart function; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle hypertrophy; histology; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; metabolic stress; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cardiac muscle; cytology; diabetic cardiomyopathy; endothelium cell; enzymology; fibroblast; genetics; knockout mouse; macrophage; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); physiology; signal transduction; Animals; Apoptosis; beta Catenin; Calpain; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Endothelial Cells; Fibroblasts; Gene Deletion; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Signal Transduction"
"Genetic basis of surfactant dysfunction in Chinese children: A retrospective study",2019,"Objective: To investigate the prevalence of surfactant dysfunction (SD) and the genotype distribution in Chinese childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD). Methods: From December 2013 to December 2016, whole exons and splicing regions of surfactant protein (SP)-B, SP-C, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3) were sequenced in chILD with unknown etiology in five children's medical centers of China. The sequencing was performed by Next-generation sequencing technique in a molecular genetics laboratory. The clinical and genetic data were reviewed retrospectively. Results: In total, 136 patients of age 3 months to 13 years (mean 12.5 ± 9.4 months) were recruited, among which 76 were males. Of the 136 cases of chILD, 13.2% (18 of 136) were diagnosed with SD. In these 18 SD cases, 15 had heterozygous SP-C deficiencies, two cases had compound heterozygous ABCA3 deficiencies, and no SP-B deficiency was identified. In SP-C deficiencies, there were six cases with p.I73T, 2 with p.I73N, 5 with p.V39L, 1 with c.417delA, and 1 case with IVS4, +1G>C. Two cases of ABCA3 mutation were heterozygous with c.1755delC and c.2890G>A; c.3913T>C (R1305W) and exon 13 to 18 deletion. One was negative by sequencing while diagnosed positive by pathology. Conclusion: The proportion of genetic mutation of SD in chILD is 13.2% in China, of which SP-C deficiency is predominant. The mutation, SP-C p.V39L, was found to be relatively prevalent in China and warrants further investigation. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ABC transporter subfamily A; ABC transporter subfamily A member 3; alanine; asparagine; cysteine; glycine; isoleucine; leucine; surfactant protein B; surfactant protein C; threonine; unclassified drug; valine; ABCA3 gene; adolescent; amino acid substitution; Article; child; China; Chinese; controlled study; exon; female; gene deletion; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic disorder; genotype; heterozygosity; histopathology; human; human tissue; infant; interstitial lung disease; lung biopsy; major clinical study; male; medical record review; molecular genetics; mutational analysis; next generation sequencing; pediatric hospital; pediatric patient; preschool child; priority journal; protein splicing; retrospective study; school child; surfactant dysfunction"
"The Efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Treat Depression and Anxiety and Improve Quality of Life Among Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients",2019,"Purpose: Positive results have appeared among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients with the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, earlier stage patient results have been mixed. This novelty of this study was the focus on stage I and II breast cancer patients. The objective of the current study was to conduct a meta-analysis of psychosocial functions in early-stage breast cancer survivors to determine its efficacy. Methods: A search of Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and PubMed yielded 3237 abstracts, which were independently evaluated by research pairs. Meta-analysis was conducted on 8 studies that included a total of 1053 patients. Psychosocial functions were categorized according to 3 domains: (1) anxiety, (2) depression, and (3) quality of life. Results: Improvement in anxiety was observed in patients treated with CBT relative to controls without CBT (P =.04). Depression and quality of life improvement was not observed in the CBT group within or after 4 months of treatment (P >.05). Conclusions: The results indicated that observed improvements in anxiety in patients with early-stage breast cancer were moderate. The effectiveness of CBT for the improvement of patient outcomes could not be determined, given the methodological and clinical shortcomings of the included trials. ?

"Contribution of Human Hair in Solar UV Transmission in Skin: Implications for Melanoma Development",2019,"Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer with its prevalence on the rise. Recently, the melanocyte stem cells in hair follicles have been identified as the possible origin of melanoma upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) through skin. It is hypothesized that colourless vellus hair (predominant in childhood) can serve as an alternative pathway in transmitting these ultraviolet (UV) photons to the stem cells. To investigate this, we have used the CRAIC microspectrophotometer to investigate the optical properties of ‘vellus-like’ hairs and terminal hairs of different colours using UV–VIS–NIR light sources. It was found that the average attenuation coefficient of ‘vellus-like’ hair is significantly lower than that of terminal hair in the UVA (p < 0.0001) and UVB (p < 0.001) wavelength ranges. Next, the optical properties of hairs are applied to simulations for examining their influence on UV transmission into the skin. The results show that the presence of vellus hair would increase the solar UV transmission to the melanocyte stem cell layer significantly. The findings explain why children are particularly vulnerable to sun exposure and the positive correlation found between the incidence of melanoma in adults’ bodies and the number of vellus hairs in these areas. ? 2019, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Cytology; Dermatology; Diseases; Intelligent systems; Light sources; Monte Carlo methods; Oncology; Optical properties; Radiotherapy; Ultraviolet radiation; Attenuation coefficient; Medulla; Melanocyte stem cells; Melanoma; Microspectrophotometry; Skin cancers; Tissue optic; Vellus hair; Stem cells; adult; Article; child; female; hair; hair color; human; human tissue; infrared radiation; male; melanocyte; melanoma; microspectrophotometry; Monte Carlo method; optics; priority journal; radiation attenuation; solar radiation; stem cell; sun exposure; terminal hair; ultraviolet A radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; ultraviolet radiation; vellus hair"
"Graphically encoded suspension array for multiplex immunoassay and quantification of autoimmune biomarkers in patient sera",2019,"In precision medicine, clinical decisions and pharmaceutical evaluations tends to be made upon parallel analysis of multiple protein biomarkers. Currently, the growing needs of high-throughput multiplex immunoassay is partially satisfied by spectrally encoded bead flow suspension arrays and other platforms, yet there is still room for progress in terms of encoding capacity, decoding accuracy, ease-of-manufacture/operation, and cost-effectiveness, for which graphical suspension arrays could make substantial contributions. Here we described a suspension array system made up of graphically encoded silica particles, an automated microplate imager and an in-house data processing program. The micro-fabricated, highly uniform planar particles provide a code space of 128-plex with further extendibility. The derived multiplex immunoassay reaches sub-picogram per milliliter sensitivity level (lowest LoD = 80 fg/ml) with wide dynamic range, as well as high precision and accuracy. The potential of clinical diagnostics was demonstrated by parallel measurement of three serum biomarkers for type 1 diabetes patients. Importantly, use of standard microplates as assay vessel extends its power to high-throughput applications, such as disease screening or drug discovery. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Diagnosis; Encoding (symbols); Immunology; Signal encoding; Silica; Throughput; Autoimmune diabetes; Clinical decision; Clinical diagnostics; Cytokines; Multiplex immunoassays; Parallel analysis; Suspension array; Wide dynamic range; Suspensions (fluids); biological marker; fibroblast growth factor 19; fibroblast growth factor 9; gamma interferon; interleukin 1beta; silicon dioxide; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin; biological marker; cytokine; immobilized antibody; signal peptide; adolescent; analytic method; Article; autoimmunity; automation; child; clinical article; computer graphics; controlled study; data processing; female; graphically recognizable array of suspension particle; human; immunoassay; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; multiplex immunoassay; sensitivity analysis; software; autoimmunity; blood; chemistry; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; genetic procedures; immunoassay; limit of detection; protein microarray; Antibodies, Immobilized; Autoimmunity; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; Cytokines; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Equipment Design; Humans; Immunoassay; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Limit of Detection; Protein Array Analysis"
"Vitamin D Protects Against Alcohol-Induced Liver Cell Injury Within an NRF2–ALDH2 Feedback Loop",2019,"Scope: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress induced during the alcohol metabolism plays a crucial role in ALD, and clinical evidence demonstrates the prevalence and risks of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in ALD. This study aims to explore the mechanism of VD administration to ameliorate alcohol-induced cell injury. Methods and results: VD activates NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2) signals along with upregulation of ALDH2 expression. Knockdown of NRF2 eliminates the protective effects of VD treatment. ALDH2 knockdown not only partially affects this protection, but also mildly reduces NRF2 expression. ALDH2 overexpression enhances ERK phosphorylation and upregulated NRF2 transcription via a newly identified TRE in the exon 1 of NRF2. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that VD protects against alcohol-induced cell injury within an NRF2-ALDH2 feedback loop. NRF2 induced by VD could transcriptionally upregulate ALDH2 expression to help metabolize alcohol. TRE-driven transcriptional upregulation of NRF2 through ALDH2-ERK/MEK signals would further exert the anti-oxidant effects. The study explores a novel potential protection of VD in alcohol-induced liver cell injury, and contributes to alcohol-related liver disease nutritional therapies. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Drug Response in Dynamic Bioengineered Lung Cancer Microenvironment",2019,"Tumor microenvironment and the interplay of physical and mechanical forces are key determinants of cancer initiation, progression, and response to drug treatment. However, the impact of tumor microenvironment on cancer progression is poorly understood, in large due to the lack of in vitro models that recapitulate the physical aspects of tumor microenvironment. Herein, a simple, dynamic 3D nonsmall cell lung carcinoma culture using a multichannel microfluidic model platform is developed for evaluating the contribution of flow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is found that flow induces changes in cellular morphology and EMT in 2D and 3D when lung cancer A549 cells are cultured on a microfluidic chip under laminar flow for 4–5 days compared to traditional static cultures. The role of dynamic cell culture on chemotherapeutic effects is monitored. Drug response with an existing anti-cancer drug, e.g., erlotinib and an investigational drug (NSC-750212), shows distinct cytotoxic effects in flow compared to static cultures, suggesting a potential influence of flow on drug efficacy in 2D and 3D models. The platform demonstrates the ability to create a dynamic microscale tumor model, which could be explored as a tool for early drug screening and treatment monitoring in cancer and other diseases. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"TCF3-activated LINC00152 exerts oncogenic role in osteosarcoma through regulating miR-1182/CDK14 axis",2019,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to participate in tumorigenesis and diverse cellular processes in osteosarcoma (OS). However, the role of lncRNA LINC00152 in OS remains elusive. In this study, LINC00152 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Moreover, MTT and colony formation assays revealed that knockdown of LINC00152 significantly suppressed cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of LINC00152 knockdown on OS cell migration and invasion was analyzed and demonstrated by transwell assays. Additionally, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays suggested that LINC00152 was transcriptionally activated by the transcription factor TCF3. More importantly, mechanism investigation revealed that LINC00152 was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of OS cells and acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in OS by regulating miR-1182/CDK14 axis. Collectively, LINC00152 was activated by TCF3 and promotes cell proliferation and migration in osteosarcoma via miR-1182-CDK14 axis. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","cyclin dependent kinase; cyclin dependent kinase 14; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; microRNA 1182; RNA; transcription factor 7 like 1; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; CDK14 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase; long non-coding RNA Linc00152, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN1182 microRNA, human; TCF3 protein, human; adult; Article; bioinformatics; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer survival; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clinical feature; colony formation; controlled study; enzyme activation; female; gene control; gene expression; gene function; human; human cell; human tissue; LINC00152 gene; loss of function mutation; luciferase assay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; MTT assay; oncogene; osteosarcoma; osteosarcoma cell line; overall survival; aged; bone tumor; carcinogenesis; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; osteosarcoma; pathology; physiology; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Bone Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Osteosarcoma; RNA, Long Noncoding"
"Inhibition of DYRK1A-EGFR axis by p53-MDM2 cascade mediates the induction of cellular senescence",2019,"Activation of p53 may induce apoptosis or cellular senescence in stressed cells. We here report that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is downregulated by p53 activation in a subset of cancer cell lines, and this EGFR downregulation mediates cellular senescence caused by p53 activation. EGFR confers resistance to senescence by sustaining the ERK signaling. DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A), an EGFR-stabilizing kinase, is downregulated by p53 and, when ectopically expressed, can attenuate p53 activation-induced EGFR reduction and cellular senescence. We further showed that the increased degradation of DYRK1A caused by p53 activation was mediated by MDM2. MDM2 was found to physically interact with and ubiquitinate DYRK1A, ultimately leading to its proteosomal degradation. Importantly, administration of Nutlin-3a, which disrupts the binding of MDM2 to p53, but not that of MDM2 to DYRK1A, reduced the levels of DYRK1A and EGFR, induced senescence, and inhibited growth of tumor xenografts formed by U87 glioblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of EGFR in tumor xenografts attenuated senescence and tumor reduction caused by Nultin-3a. Our findings thus established a novel link between p53 and EGFR and may have implications in p53 activation-based therapies. ? 2019, The Author(s).","dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylated and tyrosine regulated kinase 1a; epidermal growth factor receptor; nultin 3a; peptides and proteins; phosphotransferase; protein MDM2; protein p53; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell aging; down regulation; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein protein interaction; tumor xenograft; U87 cell line; ubiquitination"
"Effects of miR-106b-3p on cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and targeting of ZNRF3 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRs) is frequently associated with cancer progression. Deregulation of miR-106b-3p has been observed in various types of human cancer. However, the biological function of miR-106b-3p in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC ) remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-106b-3p in ESCC. In the current study, the results indicated that miR-106b-3p was upregulated in ESCC cell lines and tissues. An increase in miR-106b-3p using miR mimics significantly promoted the proliferation of ESCC cells in vitro. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that miR-106b-3p overexpression promoted migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ESCC cells. In addition, zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) was identified as a target of miR-106b-3p in ESCC cells, and the ZNRF3 expression level was inversely associated with miR-106b-3p. It was also demonstrated that miR-106b-3p has a role in EMT by regulating Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway in ESCC. In conclusion, these data suggested that miR-106b-3p promotes cell proliferation and invasion, partially by downregulating ZNRF3 and inducing EMT via Wnt/?-catenin signaling in ESCC cells. Thus, miR-106b-3p and ZNRF3 may be novel molecular targets for the future treatment of ESCC . ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"The reciprocity between radiotherapy and cancer immunotherapy",2019,"The clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in treating metastatic and refractory cancers has generated significant interest in investigating their role in treating locally advanced diseases, thus requiring them to be combined with standard treatments in the hope of producing synergistic antitumor responses. Radiotherapy, in particular, has long been hypothesized to have actions complementary to those of immune checkpoint blockade, and a growing body of evidence indicates that cancer immunotherapy may also have radiosensitizing effects, which would provide unique benefit for locoregional treatments. Recent studies have demonstrated that when immune cells are activated by immunotherapeutics, they can reprogram the tumor microenvironment in ways that may potentially increase the radiosensitivity of the tumor. In this review, we highlight the evidence that supports reciprocal interactions between cancer immunotherapy and radiotherapy, where in addition to the traditional notion that radiation serves to enhance the activation of antitumor immunity, an alternative scenario also exists in which T-cell activation by cancer immunotherapy may sensitize tumors to radiation treatment through mechanisms that include normalization of the tumor vasculature and tissue hypoxia. We describe the empirical observations from preclinical models that support such effects and discuss their implications for future research and trial design. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.","adenosine triphosphate; antineoplastic monoclonal antibody; ATM protein; ATR protein; biological factor; calreticulin; checkpoint kinase 1; cyclic GMP AMP synthase; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody; damage associated molecular pattern; durvalumab; gamma interferon; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; high mobility group B1 protein; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase inhibitor; ipilimumab; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; membrane protein; monoclonal antibody OX40; neoantigen; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; programmed death 1 ligand 1; protein p53; stimulator of interferon genes; synthetase; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta antibody; tumor antigen; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; adoptive transfer; brain metastasis; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; CD8+ T lymphocyte; colon cancer; cytokine release; DNA damage; DNA repair; down regulation; feedback system; gene expression; human; hypofractionated radiotherapy; immunomodulation; immunostimulation; innate immunity; intestine flora; low energy radiation; lung cancer; melanoma; metastatic melanoma; mutation; mutational burden; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein expression; protein expression level; radiation dose; radiosensitivity; radiosensitization; Review; T cell adoptive transfer; treatment response; tumor hypoxia; tumor immunogenicity; tumor microenvironment; tumor vascularization; upregulation"
"Risk of fracture with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in real-world use: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies",2019,"Summary: In the present meta-analysis based on real-world data, the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1ra), or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) was not associated with the risk of fracture. Introduction: Cumulative evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) with limited fracture events showed that the use of DPP-4i, GLP-1ra, or SGLT2i may not affect the risk of fracture. However, additional insights from large population-based studies with routinely collected data on fracture events and an adequate amount of fracture events are necessary to draw firm conclusions. To refine and complement the results from RCTs, a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies were performed to investigate the association between the use of DPP-4i, GLP-1ra, or SGLT2i and the risk of fracture in real-world settings. Methods: The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant observational studies. A random-effect model was used to estimate the summary relative risks (RRs). Results: The use of DPP-4i (RR 0.83, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.60, 1.14; n = 11), GLP-1ra (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.24, 1.74; n = 4), or SGLT2i (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91, 1.16; n = 4) was not associated with the risk of fracture. In general, there was a consistent lack of association between the use of DPP-4i or GLP-1ra and the risk of fracture across nearly all subgroups, except for a significantly reduced risk of hip fracture with the use of GLP-1ra (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04, 0.98). Conclusions: Cumulative real-world evidence does not support an association between the use of DPP-4i, GLP-1ra, or SGLT2i and the risk of fracture. Our findings, together with the cumulative evidence from RCTs, should reassure policy makers and medical practitioners that the use of these medications is unlikely to increase the risk of fracture among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in general. Further studies need to investigate the long-term impact of these drugs on the fracture risk, particularly in high-risk populations. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","albiglutide; alkaline phosphatase; alogliptin; anagliptin; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; ertugliflozin; exendin 4; gliclazide; glimepiride; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin glargine; insulin lispro; linagliptin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; metformin; phosphate; saxagliptin; semaglutide; sitagliptin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; vildagliptin; adverse drug reaction; alkaline phosphatase blood level; calcium blood level; drug use; forearm fracture; fracture; fragility fracture; high risk population; hip fracture; human; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phosphate blood level; priority journal; radius fracture; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk reduction; side effect; spine fracture; systematic review; ulna fracture"
"Multifunctional Polymeric Prodrug with Simultaneous Conjugating Camptothecin and Doxorubicin for pH/Reduction Dual-Responsive Drug Delivery",2019,"Amphiphilic polymeric prodrugs show improved therapeutic indices with respect to traditional hydrophobic anticancer drugs because these prodrugs can self-assemble into nanoparticles, prolong the circulation of drugs in the blood, improve the accumulation of drugs in the disease site, reduce the side effects of drugs, and achieve therapeutic effect. Here, we describe a novel pH/reduction dual-responsive polymeric prodrug, abbreviated as CPT-ss-poly(BYP -hyd-DOX -co-EEP), with simultaneous conjugating camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX), wherein BYP and EEP represent two cyclic phosphate monomers, respectively, that is, 2-(but-3-yn-1-yloxy)-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane and 2-ethoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane. This prodrug was prepared through a polyphosphoester-DOX conjugate using a CPT derivative (CPT-ss-OH) as the initiator. CPT is linked to the terminal of polyphosphoester via disulfide carbonate, which is easy to break up under intracellular reductive environment and release the parent CPT, whereas DOX was efficiently incorporated onto the pendants of polyphosphoester through a hydrazone bond (-hyd-), which would be cleaved in the intracellular acidic medium. We show that the stable prodrug nanoparticles formed by self-assembly could release CPT and DOX simultaneously in the tumor microenvironment. The results of MTT assay demonstrate that the prodrug, which binds two antitumor drugs simultaneouly, has the properties of dual pH/reduction sensitiveness, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and effective tumor therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Biocompatibility; Biodegradability; Body fluids; Controlled drug delivery; Drug interactions; Functional polymers; Nanoparticles; Self assembly; Sulfur compounds; Tumors; Camptothecin (CPT); Click reaction; Polymeric prodrugs; Polyphosphoesters; Prodrugs; Therapeutic effects; Therapeutic index; Tumor microenvironment; Targeted drug delivery; antineoplastic agent; camptothecin; doxorubicin; drug carrier; nanoparticle; polymer; prodrug; cell survival; chemical phenomena; chemistry; confocal microscopy; drug effect; drug release; human; metabolism; pH; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Camptothecin; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Drug Liberation; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Microscopy, Confocal; Nanoparticles; Polymers; Prodrugs"
"Ectopic expression of human airway trypsin-like protease 4 in acute myeloid leukemia promotes cancer cell invasion and tumor growth",2019,"Transmembrane serine proteases have been implicated in the development and progression of solid and hematological cancers. Human airway trypsin-like protease 4 (HAT-L4) is a transmembrane serine protease expressed in epithelial cells and exocrine glands. In the skin, HAT-L4 is important for normal epidermal barrier function. Here, we report an unexpected finding of ectopic HAT-L4 expression in neutrophils and monocytes from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Such expression was not detected in bone marrow cells from normal individuals or patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In AML patients who underwent chemotherapy, persistent HAT-L4 expression in bone marrow cells was associated with minimal residual disease and poor prognostic outcomes. In culture, silencing HAT-L4 expression in AML–derived THP-1 cells by short hairpin RNAs inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation and Matrigel invasion. In mouse xenograft models, inhibition of HAT-L4 expression reduced the proliferation and growth of THP-1 cell–derived tumors. Our results indicate that ectopic HAT-L4 expression is a pathological mechanism in AML and that HAT-L4 may be used as a cell surface marker for AML blast detection and targeting. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Forensic entomology application in China: Four case reports",2019,"We present four cases that use entomological data to estimate postmortem interval (PMI). In the first case, the body was found in an outdoor environment at 26 °C and was at the fresh stage. However, the PMI min estimated using maggots collected from the corpse was more than 68 h. This was certainly an incorrect estimation because the degree of the body decomposition was light, and it may have been caused by flies invading the corpse before death occurred. In the second case, a corpse of an adult male was found in a semi-closed room, and the body was highly decomposed and mummified. In this case, we used Dermestes maculatus DeGeer (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) to successfully estimate the PMI. The third case involved a female body discovered in her room after she committed suicide by consuming excessive clozapine and alcohol. The PMI min estimated through entomological data did not match the time of death that the other evidence indicated. Thus, we speculated that clozapine and alcohol may have influenced the development of fly larvae. The fourth case occurred in the winter. The murderer killed the victim and burned and dumped the corpse. However, the burned body still attracted necrophagous insects and we successfully calculated the PMI min by using insect evidence. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine","alcohol; clozapine; adult; Article; autolysis; beetle; cadaver; case report; cause of death; climate; clinical article; Dermestes maculatus; female; human; larva; maggot; male; nonhuman; suicide; time of death; winter; zoology; animal; China; drug overdose; feeding behavior; fire; forensic pathology; growth, development and aging; homicide; insect; paleopathology; physiology; postmortem change; temperature; zoology; Adult; Animals; China; Drug Overdose; Entomology; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fires; Forensic Pathology; Homicide; Humans; Insecta; Larva; Male; Mummies; Poisoning; Postmortem Changes; Temperature"
"Ubiquitin specific peptidase 49 inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell growth by suppressing PI3K/AKT signaling",2019,"Ubiquitin specific peptidase 49 (USP49) has been reported as a tumor suppressor in several tumors, but its function and molecular mechanism in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still unknown. In this study, USP49 was found downregulated in NSCLC primary tissues and cell lines, and high USP49 predicted a positive index for the overall survival of NSCLC patients. Overexpression of USP49 downregulated the expression levels of Cyclin D1, and upregulated p53 expression. Further flow cytometry analysis showed that overexpressed USP49 induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. As a result, overexpression of USP49 significantly inhibited cell growth of NSCLC cells. In mechanism, overexpression of USP49 inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling, but knockdown of USP49 enhanced this signaling. Further studies indicated that USP49 deubiquitinated PTEN and stabilized PTEN protein, which suggested that USP49 inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling by stabilizing PTEN in NSCLC cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that USP49 was functional in NSCLC cells, and inhibited NSCLC cell growth by suppressing PI3K/AKT signaling, suggesting that USP49 could be as a novel target for NSCLC therapy. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Recombinant human glucagon-like peptide-1 protects against chronic intermittent hypoxia by improving myocardial energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis",2019,"Background and aims: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a chronic disease associated with intermittent hypoxia (IH) and is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) is a naturally occurring incretin used as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, and advanced heart failure. However, whether GLP-1 can protect against IH-induced cardiac injury is still unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the effects of recombinant human GLP-1 (rhGLP-1) on cardiac health in mice. Methods: Mice were subjected to repetitive 5% O 2 for 30 s and 21% O 2 for 30 s, for a total of 8 h/day for 4 weeks. Subsequently, mice received subcutaneous injection of saline or rhGLP-1 (100 μg/kg, three times per day). Cardiac function, myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis were examined for evaluation of cardiac injury. Results: A reduction in diastolic function (E/A ratio) in mice exposed to IH was significantly reversed by rhGLP-1. IH induced marked cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, IH resulted in a shift from fatty acid to glucose metabolism in the myocardium with downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and PPARγ. Moreover, IH caused a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and transcription, together with reduced mtDNA content and impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure. These changes were abolished by rhGLP-1 via activation of PGC-1α and Akt signaling. Conclusions: rhGLP-1 protects against IH-induced cardiac injury by improving myocardial energy metabolism and enhancing the early adaptive changes of mitochondrial biogenesis. ? 2018","glucagon like peptide 1; mitochondrial DNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; protein kinase B; recombinant human glucagon like peptide 1; unclassified drug; glucagon like peptide 1; recombinant protein; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; chronic intermittent hypoxia; controlled study; down regulation; energy metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; heart muscle fibrosis; heart muscle metabolism; male; mitochondrial biogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; animal; cardiac muscle cell; cytology; drug effect; energy metabolism; fibrosis; genetics; human; hypoxia; metabolism; organelle biogenesis; pathology; signal transduction; subcutaneous drug administration; Animals; Apoptosis; Energy Metabolism; Fibrosis; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoxia; Injections, Subcutaneous; Male; Mice; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organelle Biogenesis; Recombinant Proteins; Signal Transduction"
"Nanoparticle-mediated internal radioisotope therapy to locally increase the tumor vasculature permeability for synergistically improved cancer therapies",2019,"The limited tumor specific uptake of nanoparticles is one of major bottlenecks for clinical translation of nanoscale therapeutics. Herein, we propose a strategy using internal radioisotope therapy (RIT) delivered by liposomal nanoparticles to improve the tumor vasculature permeability, so as to increase the tumor specific uptake of the second-wave therapeutic nanoparticles for enhanced cancer therapies. Via a convenient method, a therapeutic radioisotope iodine-131 is labeled onto albumin-encapsulated liposomes with greatly improved radiolabeling stability compared to 131 I labeled albumin. The obtained 131 I-liposome with long blood half-life could accumulate in the tumor and damage tumor blood endothelial cells to improve the tumor vascular permeability. As the result, the tumor retention of the second wave of liposomal nanoparticles could be greatly increased owing to the RIT-enhanced EPR effect. In three separated experiments, we then demonstrate that such strategy could be utilized for photothermal therapy (PTT), hypoxia-activated chemotherapy (HCT) and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, all of which could be enhanced by RIT with excellent in vivo synergistic therapeutic outcomes. Our work highlights the great promises of employing nanoparticle-mediated RIT to modulate tumor vasculature for further enhanced cancer therapy, and may have potential value for clinical translation. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blood; Chemotherapy; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Liposomes; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Oncology; Radioisotopes; Increasing tumor specific uptake; Internal radioisotope therapy; Liposomal nanoparticles; Nanoscale therapeutics; Photothermal therapy; Therapeutic outcomes; Tumor vasculature; Vascular permeability; Tumors; albumin; iodine 131; nanoparticle; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood vessel permeability; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug labeling; drug penetration; encapsulation; endothelium cell; female; isotope labeling; mouse; nonhuman; photothermal therapy; priority journal; radioisotope therapy; treatment outcome; tumor vascularization"
"MicroRNA-143-3p inhibits colorectal cancer metastases by targeting ITGA6 and ASAP3",2019,"MicroRNAs, which regulate mRNAs, operate through a variety of signaling pathways to participate in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we found that microRNA (miR)-143-3p expression was significantly lower in both CRC and liver metastatic CRC tissues from liver compared with normal colonic tissues. Functional assays showed that miR-143-3p inhibited CRC cell invasion and migration in vitro. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified miR-143-3p target mRNAs. Among the candidate targets, only the expression of integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) and ArfGAP with the SH3 domain and ankyrin repeat and PH domain 3 (ASAP3) were significantly reduced by miR-143-3p mimics as examined by western blot, and the metastasis potential of CRC cells was attenuated by endogenous ITGA6 and ASAP3 knockdown, determined by migration and invasion assays. Both ITGA6 and ASAP3 were upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. Analysis of the relationship between clinicopathological features and ITGA6/ASAP3 protein expression in 200 patients with CRC showed a significant difference in positive ITGA6 expression between the early stage (I?+?II) and the advanced stage (III?+?IV), and ASAP3 expression levels positively correlated with metastasis in the lymph nodes. These results indicate that miR-143-3p acts as an anti-oncogene by downregulating ITGA6/ASAP3 protein expression and could offer new insight into potential therapeutic targets for CRC. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Prognostic nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines for overall survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",2019,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the association of pre-treatment inflammatory status with survival time and to develop a prognostic nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Methods: A total of 228 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) received R-CHOP-based regimens from a prospective randomized study (NCT01852435) were included as a training cohort. Other cohorts of 886 lymphoma patients were served as validation cohorts. Lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), serum levels of soluble interleukin s(IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were assessed before treatment. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables for nomogram of overall survival (OS). The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was determined by concordance index (C-index). Findings: The nomogram included lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sIL-2R, TNF-α and decreased LMR. The C-index of the nomogram for OS prediction were range from 0.61 to 0.86 for training cohort of DLBCL and validation cohorts of DLBCL, PTCL, NKTCL and ASCT, which were superior to the predictive power of International Prognostic Index (IPI, 0.67 to 0.84) or NCCN-IPI (0.59 to 0.78), but not in those of indolent lymphoma like FL and MALT. Interpretations: The nomogram incorporating inflammatory cytokines provides a useful tool for risk stratification in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

"Fluorinated Polymer Mediated Transmucosal Peptide Delivery for Intravesical Instillation Therapy of Bladder Cancer",2019,"Surgical intervention combined with intravesical instillation of chemotherapeutics to clear residual cancer cells after operation is the current standard treatment method for bladder cancer. However, the poor bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients for bladder cancer cells on account of the biological barriers of bladder mucosa, together with significant side effects of currently used intravesical medicine, have limited the clinical outcomes of localized adjuvant therapy for bladder cancer. Aiming at improved intravesical instillation therapy of bladder cancer, a fluorinated polyethylenimine (F-PEI) is employed here for the transmucosal delivery of an active venom peptide, polybia-mastoparan I (MPI), which shows selective antiproliferative effect against various bladder cancer cell lines. Upon simple mixing, MPI and F-PET would coassemble to form stable nanoparticles, which show greatly improved cross-membrane and transmucosal penetration capacities compared with MPI alone or nonfluorinated MPI/PEI nanoparticles. MPI/F-PEI shows higher in vivo tumor growth inhibition efficacy for local treatment of a subcutaneous tumor model. More excitingly, as further demonstrated in an orthotopic bladder cancer model, MPI/F-PEI offers remarkably improved therapeutic effects compared to those achieved by free MPI or the first-line bladder cancer drug mitomycin C. This work presents a new transmucosal delivery carrier particularly promising for intravesical instillation therapy of bladder cancer. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Utility of CT assessment in hematology patients with invasive aspergillosis: A post-hoc analysis of phase 3 data",2019,"Background: Pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used as part of the clinical criteria in diagnostic workup of invasive fungal diseases like invasive aspergillosis, and may identify radiographic abnormalities, such as halo signs or air-crescent signs. We assessed the diagnostic utility of CT assessment in patients with hematologic malignancies or those who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in whom invasive aspergillosis was suspected. Methods: This post-hoc analysis assessed data from a prospective, multicenter, international trial of voriconazole (with and without anidulafungin) in patients with suspected invasive aspergillosis (IA; proven, probable, or possible, using 2008 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria) [NCT00531479]. Eligible patients received at least one baseline lung CT scan. Results: Of 395 patients included in this post-hoc analysis, 240 patients (60.8%) had 'confirmed' proven (9/240, 3.8%) or probable (231/240, 96.3%) invasive aspergillosis (cIA) and 155 patients (39.2%) had 'non-confirmed' invasive aspergillosis (all nIA; all possible IA (de Pauw et al., Clin Infect Dis 46:1813-21, 2008)). Mean age was 52.3 and 50.5 years, 56.3 and 60.0% of patients were male, and most patients were white (71.7 and 71.0%) in the cIA and nIA populations, respectively. Median baseline galactomannan was 1.4 (cIA) and 0.2 (nIA), mean Karnofsky score was 65.3 (cIA) and 66.8 (nIA), and mean baseline platelet count was 48.0 (cIA) and 314.1 (nIA). Pulmonary nodules (46.8% of all patients), bilateral lung lesions (37.5%), unilateral lung lesions (28.4%), and consolidation (24.8%) were the most common radiographic abnormalities. Ground-glass attenuation (cIA: 24.2%; nIA: 11.6%; P < 0.01) and pulmonary nodules (cIA: 52.5%; nIA: 38.1%; P < 0.01) were associated with cIA. Other chest CT scan abnormalities (including halo signs and air-crescent signs) at baseline in patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and suspected IA, were not associated with cIA. Conclusions: These findings highlight the limitations in the sensitivity of chest CT scans for the diagnosis of IA, and reinforce the importance of incorporating other available clinical data to guide management decisions on individual patients, including whether empirical treatment is reasonable, pending full evaluation. ? 2019 The Author(s).","anidulafungin; galactomannan; voriconazole; anidulafungin; galactomannan; mannan; voriconazole; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; Caucasian; clinical effectiveness; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic value; double blind procedure; female; gender; hematologic malignancy; human; invasive aspergillosis; Karnofsky Performance Status; lung lesion; lung nodule; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; phase 3 clinical trial; platelet count; post hoc analysis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; blood; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; hematologic disease; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; invasive aspergillosis; lung; microbiology; mortality; pathology; procedures; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Anidulafungin; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis; Karnofsky Performance Status; Lung; Male; Mannans; Middle Aged; Platelet Count; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Voriconazole"
"Comparison of efficacy between HLA6/6- and HLA3/6-matched haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant in T-cell-replete transplants between parents and children",2019,"To compare the efficacy of HLA6/6-matched haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (haplo-HSCT) with that of HLA3/6-matched HSCT in T-cell-replete transplants, we recruited 27 consecutive recipients from multiple centers who received HLA6/6-matched haplo-HSCT from a parent or child donor between February 2010 and May 2016. A matched-pair analysis was designed. For each recipient from the study cohort, two recipients were randomly selected from the control cohort and matched (according to patient age, patient sex, disease type, disease status, donor age, donor sex, and recipient-donor relationship). No significant differences were found in hematopoietic recovery. The incidence of grade II–IV and III–IV acute graft versus host disease was similar (18.5% vs. 31.5%, P=0.216; 11.1% vs. 9.3%, P=0.792) in the HLA6/6 and HLA3/6 groups, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 14.8% and 17.0% (P=0.800). The 3-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 12.1% and 17.6% (P=0.751). The estimated 3-year disease-free survival was 73.1% and 65.5% (P=0.489). The estimated 3-year overall survival was 74.7% and 74.0% (P=0.946). The data suggested the efficacy and safety of the HLA6/6- and the HLA3/6-matched haplo-HSCT between parents and children are comparable. That HLA-mismatch disparity is not correlated with T-cell-replete haplo-HSCT outcome was substantiated. ? 2018, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Metformin induces apoptotic cytotoxicity depending on AMPK/PKA/GSK-3β-mediated c-FLIP l degradation in non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"Background: Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug, has recently been reported with anticancer activities in various cancers; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of cellular FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory protein large (c-FLIP L ) in metformin-induced anticancer activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in vitro. Materials and methods: Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to detect the level of mRNA of related genes. The expression of related proteins was detected by Western blot. siRNA was used to silence the expression of targeted proteins. Results: Metformin significantly suppressed proliferation of both A549 and H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies suggested that metformin killed NSCLC cells by inducing apoptotic cell death. Moreover, metformin greatly inhibited c-FLIP L expression and then promoted its degradation. Furthermore, metformin significantly activated Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3β), block the expression of AMPK, and GSK-3β with siRNA partially reversed metformin-induced cytotoxicity and restored the expression of c-FLIP L in lung cancer cells. Metformin also suppressed the activity of AMPK downstream protein kinase A (PKA), PKA activators, both 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin, greatly increased c-FLIP L expression in NSCLC cells. Conclusion: This study provided evidence that metformin killed NSCLC cells through AMPK/ PKA/GSK-3β axis-mediated c-FLIP L degradation. ? 2019 Luo et al.","8 bromo cyclic AMP; adenosine kinase; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; FLICE inhibitory protein; forskolin; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; metformin; small interfering RNA; A-549 cell line; AMPK signaling; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell mediated cytotoxicity; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; human; human cell; in vitro study; mRNA expression level; MTT assay; NCI-H460 cell line; non small cell lung cancer; protein degradation; protein expression; protein targeting; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting"
"Recent Advances on Reactive Oxygen Species-Responsive Delivery and Diagnosis System",2019,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in biological metabolism and intercellular signaling. However, ROS level is dramatically elevated due to abnormal metabolism during multiple pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cancer, and premature aging. By taking advantage of the discrepancy of ROS levels between normal and diseased tissues, a variety of ROS-sensitive moieties or linkers have been developed to design ROS-responsive systems for the site-specific delivery of drugs and genes. In this review, we summarized the ROS-responsive chemical structures, mechanisms, and delivery systems, focusing on their current advances for precise drug/gene delivery. In particular, ROS-responsive nanocarriers, prodrugs, and supramolecular hydrogels are summarized in terms of their application for drug/gene delivery, and common strategies to elevate or diminish cellular ROS concentrations, as well as the recent development of ROS-related imaging probes were also discussed. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Controlled drug delivery; Diagnosis; Metabolism; Neurodegenerative diseases; Oxygen; Abnormal metabolism; Biological metabolism; Delivery systems; Diagnosis systems; Drug/gene delivery; Intercellular signaling; Reactive oxygen species; Supramolecular hydrogels; Targeted drug delivery; biomaterial; chalcogen; nanocarrier; polymer; prodrug; reactive oxygen metabolite; selenium; Article; chemical structure; diabetes mellitus; drug delivery system; drug release; gene delivery system; gene targeting; human; hydrogel; malignant neoplasm; nonhuman; polymerization; priority journal; supramolecular chemistry; upregulation"
"SphK1 functions downstream of IGF-1 to modulate IGF-1-induced EMT, migration and paclitaxel resistance of A549 cells: A preliminary in vitro study",2019,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) -induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in the metastasis and drug resistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) is also involved in EMT of NSCLC. However, the interaction between SphK1 and IGF-1 in the EMT of NSCLC is largely unknown. To clarify this issue, we examined the involvement of SphK1 in IGF-1-induced EMT using human lung cancer cell line A549, and its paclitaxel-resistant subline. Cell viability was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 assay; Migratory ability was examined using scratch wound healing test; Protein expression levels of SphK1, vimentin, fibronectin, N-cadherin and E-cadherin were detected by western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that, IGF-1 treatment of A549 cells stimulated the expression of SphK1, the activation of ERK and AKT, the cell migration, and the expression of EMT hallmark proteins, while inhibition of SphK1 by its specific inhibitor SKI-II suppressed all the above changes and increased the sensitivity of A549 cells to paclitaxel. Our data demonstrate that SphK1 acts as a downstream effector of IGF-1 and plays a critical role in IGF-1-induced EMT, cell migration and paclitaxel resistance of A549 cells, suggesting that SphK1 might be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC. ?

"Family Caregivers’ Subjective Caregiving Burden, Quality of Life, and Depressive Symptoms Are Associated With Terminally Ill Cancer Patients’ Distinct Patterns of Conjoint Symptom Distress and Functional Impairment in Their Last Six Months of Life",2019,"Context: Family caregivers constitute a critical component of the end-of-life care system with considerable cost to themselves. However, the joint association of terminally ill cancer patients’ symptom distress and functional impairment with caregivers’ subjective caregiving burden, quality of life (QOL), and depressive symptoms remains unknown. Objectives/Methods: We used multivariate hierarchical linear modeling to simultaneously evaluate associations between five distinct patterns of conjoint symptom distress and functional impairment (symptom-functional states) and subjective caregiving burden, QOL, and depressive symptoms in a convenience sample of 215 family caregiver–patient dyads. Data were collected every 2 to 4 weeks over patients’ last 6 months. Results: Caregivers of patients in the worst symptom-functional states (States 3–5) reported worse subjective caregiving burden and depressive symptoms than those in the best two states, but the three outcomes did not differ between caregivers of patients in State 3 and States 4–5. Caregivers of patients in State 5 endured worse subjective caregiving burden and QOL than those in State 4. Caregivers of patients in State 4 suffered worse subjective caregiving burden and depressive symptoms but comparable QOL to those in State 2. Conclusion: Patients’ five distinct, conjoint symptom-functional states were significantly and differentially associated with their caregivers’ worse subjective caregiving burden, QOL, and depressive symptoms while caring for patients over their last 6 months. ? 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","adult; Article; cancer patient; caregiver burden; controlled study; depression; distress syndrome; female; functional disease; functional status; human; major clinical study; male; quality of life; symptom; terminally ill patient; caregiver; cost of illness; disability; family; longitudinal study; mental stress; middle aged; neoplasm; psychology; terminally ill patient; Caregivers; Cost of Illness; Depression; Disability Evaluation; Family; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological; Terminally Ill"
"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) exacerbate severity of infant sepsis",2019,"Background: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are innate defense mechanisms that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. However, the role of NETs in pediatric sepsis is unknown. Methods: Infant (2 weeks old) and adult (6 weeks old) mice were submitted to sepsis by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of bacteria suspension or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neutrophil infiltration, bacteremia, organ injury, and concentrations of cytokine, NETs, and DNase in the plasma were measured. Production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and release of NETs by neutrophils were also evaluated. To investigate the functional role of NETs, mice undergoing sepsis were treated with antibiotic plus rhDNase and the survival, organ injury, and levels of inflammatory markers and NETs were determined. Blood samples from pediatric and adult sepsis patients were collected and the concentrations of NETs measured. Results: Infant C57BL/6 mice subjected to sepsis or LPS-induced endotoxemia produced significantly higher levels of NETs than the adult mice. Moreover, compared to that of the adult mice, this outcome was accompanied by increased organ injury and production of inflammatory cytokines. The increased NETs were associated with elevated expression of Padi4 and histone H3 citrullination in the neutrophils. Furthermore, treatment of infant septic mice with rhDNase or a PAD-4 inhibitor markedly attenuated sepsis. Importantly, pediatric septic patients had high levels of NETs, and the severity of pediatric sepsis was positively correlated with the level of NETs. Conclusion: This study reveals a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of pediatric sepsis susceptibility and suggests that NETs represents a potential target to improve clinical outcomes of sepsis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","arginine deiminase; deoxyribonuclease; histone H3; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; nitrogen derivative; peptidyl arginine deiminase 4; reactive oxygen metabolite; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacteremia; bacterial count; blood sampling; citrullination; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; disease severity; extracellular trap; human; infant; mouse; neutrophil; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; organ injury; peritoneum macrophage; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein blood level; protein degradation; protein expression; scoring system; sepsis; septic shock; survival rate; upregulation; animal; bacterial load; blood; Brazil; C57BL mouse; disease model; extracellular trap; microbiology; mortality; multiple organ failure; pathology; procedures; sepsis; Animals; Bacterial Load; Brazil; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Traps; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Multiple Organ Failure; Sepsis"
"Luteolin suppresses tumor proliferation through inducing apoptosis and autophagy via MAPK activation in glioma",2019,"Purpose: Glioma is a malignant tumor that originates in the brain and spine and is difficult to be completely removed. Though glioma patients receive active treatment, the survival rate is still poor. Therefore, it is urgent to discover a new medicine to treat glioma patients in order to improve the survival rate. In this study, we explored the anticancer effect and the potential mechanism of luteolin on glioma in vitro. Materials and methods: Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were used to determine the cellular apoptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to explore the changes in protein expression. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was utilized to evaluate the expression level of the tumor suppressor miR-124-3p. Results: CCK-8 assays indicated that luteolin significantly inhibited glioma cell proliferation in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that luteolin induced glioma cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that luteolin induced cellular apoptosis in glioma cells via MAPK activation (JNK, ERK, and p38). Luteolin stimulated the death receptor (FADD) to regulate the apoptosis proteins (Caspase-8, Caspase-3, and PARP). Luteolin increased the expression levels of LC3B II/I and downregulated the level of p62 that promotes cell autophagy. Finally, qRT-PCR confirmed that luteolin upregulated the expression levels of miR-124-3p. Conclusion: These findings illustrate that luteolin may be a potential drug for glioma treatment. ? 2019 You et al.","autophagy related protein; caspase 3; caspase 8; Fas associated death domain protein; luteolin; microRNA; microRNA 124 3p; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; protein LC3B I; protein LC3B II; sequestosome 1; stress activated protein kinase; temozolomide; unclassified drug; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; gene expression; GI50; glioma; human; human cell; in vitro study; protein expression; U-251MG cell line; upregulation"
"Endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) has a critical role in supporting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic B-cells",2019,"The molecular underpinnings of b-cell dysfunction and death leading to diabetes are not fully elucidated. The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) in pancreatic b-cells. Chemically induced ERAD deficiency in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 markedly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The mechanistic basis for this effect was studied in cells and mice lacking ERAD as a consequence of genetic ablation of the core ERAD protein SEL1L. Targeted disruption of SEL1L in INS-1 cells and in mouse pancreatic b-cells impaired ERAD and led to blunted GSIS. Additionally, mice with SEL1L deletion in b-cells were chronically hyperglycemic after birth and increasingly glucose intolerant over time. SEL1L absence caused an entrapment of proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment in both INS-1 cells and mouse pancreatic b-cells. Both folding-competent and folding-deficient proinsulin can physiologically interact with and be efficiently degraded by HRD1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the ERAD complex. GSIS impairment in insulinoma cells was accompanied by a reduced intracellular Ca 2+ ion level, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and lowered mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these findings suggest that ERAD plays a pivotal role in supporting pancreatic b-cell function by targeting wild-type and folding-deficient proinsulin for proteosomal degradation. ERAD deficiency may contribute to the development of diabetes by affecting proinsulin processing in the ER, intracellular Ca 2+ concentration, and mitochondrial function. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","glucose; hrd1 protein; proinsulin; reactive oxygen metabolite; sel1l protein; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; glucose; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; calcium cell level; calcium signaling; cell death; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; cytosol; diabetes mellitus; diabetogenesis; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; gene deletion; gene editing; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; Golgi complex; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; hyperglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; INS-1 cell line; insulin release; insulin tolerance test; male; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell function; priority journal; protein degradation; protein processing; protein protein interaction; rat; secretory pathway; animal; drug effect; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; insulin release; metabolism; pancreas islet beta cell; physiology; transgenic mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Death; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation; Glucose; Insulin Secretion; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Mice; Mice, Transgenic"
"Photodynamic therapy-triggered on-demand drug release from ROS-responsive core-cross-linked micelles toward synergistic anti-cancer treatment",2019,"Polymeric micelles have demonstrated wide utility for chemodrug delivery, which however, still suffer from shortcomings such as undesired drug loading, disassembly upon dilution, pre-leakage of drug cargoes during systemic circulation, and lack of cancer-selective drug release. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-polyphosphoester-based, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive, core-cross-linked (CCL) micellar system was developed to encapsulate both chemodrug (doxorubicin, Dox) and photosensitizer (chlorin e6, Ce6). The hydrophobic core of the micelles was cross-linked via a thioketal (TK)-containing linker, which notably enhanced the drug loading and micelle stability. In tumor cells, far-red light irradiation of Ce6 generated ROS to cleave the TK linkers and disrupt the micelle cores. As such, micelles were destabilized and Dox release was promoted, which thereafter imparted synergistic anti-cancer effect with ROS-mediated photodynamic therapy. This study provides an effective approach to realize the precise control over drug loading, formulation stability, and cancer-selective drug release using polymeric micelles, and would render promising utilities for the programmed anti-cancer combination therapy.

"Single cell transcriptomic analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells reveals limited heterogeneity",2019,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a population of multipotent cells with a superior ability to promote tissue repair by regulating regeneration and inflammation. Effective application of MSCs in disease treatment relies on the production of relatively homogeneous cell population. However, the cellular heterogeneity and the differentiation trajectories of in vitro expanded MSCs remain largely unclear. We profiled the transcriptomes of 361 single MSCs derived from two umbilical cords (UC-MSCs). These UC-MSCs were harvested at different passages and stimulated with or without inflammatory cytokines. Weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed that UC-MSCs surprisingly possess only limited heterogeneity, regardless of donors, and passages. We also found that upon pretreatment with inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ and TNFα), a classical strategy that can improve the efficiency of MSC-based therapy, MSCs exhibited uniformed changes in gene expression. Cell cycle-based principal component analysis showed that the limited heterogeneity identified in these UC-MSCs was strongly associated with their entrance into the G2/M phase. This was further proven by the observation that one featured gene, CD168, was expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. When CD168 high UC-MSCs were sorted and cultured in vitro, they again showed similar CD168 expression patterns. Our results demonstrated that in vitro expanded UC-MSCs are a well-organized population with limited heterogeneity dominated by cell cycle status. Thus, our studies provided information for standardization of MSCs for disease treatment. ? 2019, The Author(s).","alpha interferon; transcriptome; tumor necrosis factor; Article; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell heterogeneity; cell selection; gene expression; genetic correlation; human; in vitro study; mesenchymal stem cell; next generation sequencing; priority journal; single cell analysis; transcriptomics; umbilical cord"
"Weighted correlation network analysis of triple-negative breast cancer progression: Identifying specific modules and hub genes based on the geo and tcga database",2019,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents an aggressive malignancy of frequent high histologic grade with no effective specific targeted therapies. The present study aimed to identify specific modules and hub genes that may influence the progression of TNBC. The key words ‘breast cancer’ were used to search microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases that included 5 datasets. A total of 11 co-expression modules were constructed based on the expression levels of 5,782 genes obtained from 456 patients with TNBC using the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). The results demonstrated that the red module was significantly associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with TNBC [hazard ratio (HR)=0.381, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.183-0.793; P=0.010]. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that the biological processes corresponding to the red module were ‘mRNA processing’, ‘histone lysine methylation’ and ‘regulation of TOR signaling’. In addition, Hedgehog signaling pathways were considered to serve a critical role in the development of this disease (P<0.001). A total of 12 hub genes were identified, of which α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) was significantly associated with RFS in patients with TNBC (HR=0.601; 95%CI, 0.376-0.960; P=0.033). The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that ATRX could distinguish relapse from non-relapse in patients with TNBC (area under the curve=0.570; P=0.023). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that ATRX was associated with TNBC progression, which suggested that ATRX may be involved in a recombination-mediated telomere maintenance mechanism. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Construction of a Polypyrrole-Based Multifunctional Nanocomposite for Dual-Modal Imaging and Enhanced Synergistic Phototherapy against Cancer Cells",2019,"Design and construction of multifunctional theranostic nanoplatforms are still desired for cancer-effective treatment. Herein, a kind of polypyrrole (PPy)-based multifunctional nanocomposite was designed and successfully constructed for dual-model imaging and enhanced synergistic phototherapy against cancer cells. Through graphene oxide (GO) sheet coating, PPy nanoparticles (NPs) were effectively combined with polyethylene glycol chains, Au NPs, and IR820 molecules. The obtained PGPAI NPs showed promising ability for photoacoustic/computed tomography imaging. Under near-infrared light irradiation, the PPy core and IR820 molecule effectively generated heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. Furthermore, the loaded Au NPs owning catalase-like activity produced oxygen by decomposing H2O2 (up-regulated in tumor region), enhancing the oxygen-dependent photodynamic therapy efficacy. The formed PGPAI NPs were also proved to own desirable photothermal conversion efficiency, photothermal stability, colloidal stability, cytocompatibility, and cellular internalization behaviors. Furthermore, cell assay demonstrated that PGPAI NPs displayed enhanced synergistic phototherapy efficacy against cancer cells. These developed multifunctional nanoplatforms are promising for effective cancer theranostic applications.

"A panel of seven-miRNA signature in plasma as potential biomarker for colorectal cancer diagnosis",2019,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in global. The differential expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in CRC plasma of patients have the potential to serve as a diagnostic biomarker. We conducted a four-stage study to identify the potential plasma miRNAs for CRC detection. In the initial screening phase, Exiqon panel (miRCURY-Ready-to-Use-PCR-Human-panel-I + II-V1.M) including 3 CRC pools and 1 normal controls (NCs) pool were applied to acquire miRNA profiles. In the training stage (30 CRC VS. 30 NCs) and testing stage (79 CRC VS. 76 NCs), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to conduct candidate miRNA profiles. Then the identified miRNAs were verified in external validation stage (30 CRC VS. 26 NCs). Expression levels of identified miRNAs were assessed in tissue samples (24 pairs) and plasma exosomes (18 CRC VS. 18 NCs). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. Seven miRNAs (miR-103a-3p, miR-127-3p, miR-151a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-18a-5p and miR-18b-5p) were significantly overexpressed in CRC compared with NCs.

"The relationship between obesity subtypes based on BMI and cardio-cerebrovascular disease",2019,"The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of various obesity phenotypes and metabolic abnormalities on cardio-cerebrovascular disease. We performed a large-scale, cross-sectional study including 10,089 participants aged ?18 years in the National High-Technology district of Suzhou, China, from March 2016 to April 2016. Cardio-cerebrovascular disease included stroke and coronary heart disease. The prevalence rates of cardio-cerebrovascular disease among people with normal weight, overweight, and obesity in the unhealthy metabolism subgroup were higher than those among the three BMI groups in the healthy metabolism subgroup. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that after adjustment, the odds ratio (OR) of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) with cardio-cerebrovascular disease was not statistically significant and that metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) was statistically associated with cardio-cerebrovascular disease, with an OR of 2.106 (1.294–3.429) in Model 1 and 3.043 (1.510–6.133) in Model 2. This study also found that regardless of whether in Model 1 or Model 2, the number of participants with MHO was much lower than that of those with MUO. Therefore, the obese population usually had metabolic abnormalities. Although MHO was not statistically associated with cardio-cerebrovascular disease, obesity should be controlled along with metabolic abnormalities to reduce the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular disease. ? 2019, The Japanese Society of Hypertension.","cholesterol; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; blood pressure measurement; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; drinking behavior; educational status; female; glucose blood level; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; marriage; metabolic disorder; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; questionnaire; risk factor; smoking"
"microRNA-874 inhibition targeting STAT3 protects the heart from ischemia–reperfusion injury by attenuating cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mouse model",2019,"MicroRNAs (miRs) were involved in numerous cardiovascular diseases, especially ischemic heart diseases, but the miR changes during cardiac ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury following sevoflurane (SEV) preconditioning are still unknown. This study aims to investigate the effect of miR-874 on cardiac I/R injury in mouse models pretreated with SEV. Following establishment of mouse models with myocardial I/R injury, mice were pretreated with SEV. The functional mechanism of miR-874 in I/R injury was explored when miR-874 and the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway were inhibited. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to detect cardiomyocyte apoptosis and dual luciferase reporter gene assay to identify the targeting relationship between miR-874 and STAT3. Expression of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and apoptosis-related genes was determined. Initially, upregulated miR-874 was observed in I/R mice. Then, miR-874 inhibition improved cardiac function of I/R mice, inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis (also shown as decreased Bcl-2 associated X protein B [Bax] and increased B-cell lymphoma-2 [Bcl-2]), and activated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. STAT3, a target gene of miR-874, was upregulated following miR-874 inhibition. Finally, we also observed that the effect of miR-874 was lost when the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was blocked. The findings indicate miR-874 as a contributory role in cardiac I/R injury, with miR-874 inhibition alleviating cardiac I/R injury in mice following SEV pretreatment by targeting STAT3 through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biotin; Janus kinase 2; microRNA; microRNA 874; n benzyl 2 cyano 3 (3,4 dihydroxyphenyl)acrylamide; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; sevoflurane; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; controlled study; heart function; JAK-STAT signaling; luciferase assay; male; mouse; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; nonhuman; priority journal; reporter gene; signal transduction; staining; TUNEL assay"
"Histogram analysis of diffusion kurtosis imaging in the differentiation of malignant from benign breast lesions",2019,"Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of histogram analysis of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in breast lesions. Materials and methods: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Seventy-two breast lesions (30 benign and 42 malignant) in 71 patients were histopathologically confirmed. All breast lesions were evaluated by 3.0-T diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with 4 b-values of 0, 500, 800, and 2000s/mm2 and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Histogram analyses of conventional DWI and DKI were performed using FireVoxel software for whole lesions. The parameters included apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), diffusivity (D), and kurtosis (K). The metrics of ADC and DKI parameters (D and K) for benign lesions were compared with those for malignant lesions. The effectiveness of the ADC and DKI parameters (D and K) for diagnosing breast lesions was analysed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) regression models. Results: For the malignant breast lesions, the mean, median, and 10th/25th/75th percentile values of ADC and D were significantly lower, while the skewness of ADC and D were significantly higher in comparison of the benign lesions(all p &lt; 0.05). The malignant lesions had significantly higher mean, median, and 10th/25th/75th/90th percentile K values than did the benign lesions (all p &lt; 0.05). Within each set of parameters, the 10th percentile ADC (Az = 0.752) and D, (Az = 0.834) coupled with the 75th percentile K (Az = 0.904) were the best metrics for differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions. After comparing the parameters in pairs, the Az for the 75th percentile K was significantly higher than that for the 10th percentile ADC (p = 0.0321) in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions. When comparing the combination of the 75th percentile K and the 10th percentile D (Az = 0.937) with the 10th percentile D, 75th percentile K and the mean K, a significantly higher Az was observed for the combination than that for the 10th percentile D and the mean K (p = 0.0097 and p = 0.0431, respectively). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the combination of the 75th percentile K and the 10th percentile D were 85.71% and 93.33%, respectively. Conclusion: Histogram analysis of DKI can accurately reflect the histologic characteristics and heterogeneity and is a reliable method for diagnosing breast lesions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adolescent; adult; Article; benign breast tumor; breast cancer; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; diffusion kurtosis imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; female; histogram; histopathology; human; image analysis; imaging and display; major clinical study; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; breast tumor; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; Breast Neoplasms; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity"
"Neuroendocrine cells of prostate cancer: Biologic functions and molecular mechanisms",2019,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health risk for older men worldwide. Existing systemic therapies mostly target androgen receptor (AR). Although treatments are initially effective, the disease always recurs. A potential mechanism for the treatment failure is that PCa contains, in addition to the AR-positive luminal type tumor cells, a small component of neuroendocrine (NE) cells. The function of NE cells in PCa remains poorly understood, and one important characteristic of these cells is their lack of expression of AR and resistance to hormonal therapy. In addition, many patients develop the more aggressive small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC) after hormonal therapy. Although this clinical phenomenon of disease transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCNC is well established, the cell of origin for SCNC remains unclear. Recently, loss of function of Rb and TP53 and amplification and overexpression of MYCN and Aurora A kinase have been identified as important biomarkers and potential disease drivers. In this article, we systematically review the histology of normal prostate and prostate cancer including the main histologic types: adenocarcinoma and SCNC. We also review the findings from many studies using cellular and animal models as well as human specimens that attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms of treatment failure, disease progression, and tumor transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCNC. ?

"Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 promotes antitumor immunity and contributes to colon cancer therapy",2019,"Background: Effectiveness of clinical therapy such as chemotherapy for solid tumors is limited by acquired drug resistance and side effects. Available antitumor immunity methods showed promising prospect of cancer therapy. However, more drug targets for boosting antitumor immunity still need to be explored and selective and effective compounds are yet to be developed. Purpose: To study the effect and possible mechanism of compound P5091, a selective USP7 inhibitor, on CT26 xenografts growth in mice. Materials and methods: CT26 xenografts model was employed to examine the anti-tumor effect of P5091. RT-PCR and ELISA analysis were used to detect the level of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 in tumor tissue and serum, respectively. IFN-γ expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was analyzed by intracellular stain. The level of FOXP3 in Treg cells was confirmed by intracellular stain and western blotting. Results: Compound P5091, a selective USP7 inhibitor, was found to inhibit CT26 xenografts growth in mice, which is comparable to the effect of Anti-PD-1 antibody. RT-PCR analysis showed that P5091 treatment decreased IL-10 mRNA level in tumor tissue while elevated mRNA level of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Moreover, ELISA analysis manifested decreased of IL-10 and elevation of IFN-γ and TNF-α in serum from tumor bearing mice. Intracellular stain showed increased IFN-g expression both in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after P5091 treatment. Furthermore, P5091 treatment caused FOXP3 loss in Treg cells decreased the proportion of Treg cells in tumor bearing mice. Conclusion: Our study here showed that P5091 may be a candidate for cancer immunotherapy. ? 2019 Fu et al.","antineoplastic agent; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; messenger RNA; p 5091; protein antibody; proteinase inhibitor; transcription factor FOXP3; tumor necrosis factor; ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase 7; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; colon cancer; controlled study; drug effect; drug inhibition; drug mechanism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; regulatory T lymphocyte; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; staining; tumor growth; tumor immunity; tumor xenograft; Western blotting"
"Intermediate screws or kyphoplasty: Which method of posterior short-segment fixation is better for treating single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures?",2019,"Purpose: To compare intermediate screws (IS) with kyphoplasty (KP) in posterior short-segment fixation (PSSF) for patients with single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures. Methods: Between 2010 and 2016, 1465 patients were retrospectively reviewed; 48 patients were enrolled with a minimal follow-up of 2?years. Perioperative and functional outcomes were compared. The regional Cobb angle (CA) was included in radiographic analysis. Implant failures or CA correction loss over 10° were regarded as surgical failures. Multiple linear regression was performed to investigate the risk factors of kyphosis recurrence. Results: Fluoroscopic time (23.7 ± 3.6 vs. 79.3 ± 12.1?s, p < 0.001), operative time (109.6 ± 13.1 vs. 123.8 ± 19.0?min, p = 0.006) and blood loss (104.6 ± 34.9 vs. 129.1 ± 21.7?ml, p = 0.005) were all lower in the IS group. The KP group had lower Visual Analogue Scale scores (3.3 ± 0.9 vs. 2.7 ± 0.8, p = 0.028) and greater anterior body height (ABH) (30.3 ± 9.0 vs. 36.3 ± 11.0%, p = 0.044) after surgery, and less correction loss (5.6 ± 2.7 vs. 0.4 ± 1.2%, p < 0.001). Both groups had a CA correction loss of 4° with a 10% failure rate. The A3 Magerl subclassification, smaller preoperative ABH and smaller postoperative CA had positive correlations with CA correction loss. Conclusion: PSSF with KP provides better back pain relief, greater ABH reduction and less correction loss, while IS has the advantages of less operative time, fluoroscopic time and blood loss. Magerl subclassification of burst fracture is a potential predictor for recurrent kyphosis. Reducing fractured vertebral body height rather than segmental curvature may be more important in PSSF.

"TRAF6 inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis through regulating selective autophagic CTNNB1/β-catenin degradation and is targeted for GSK3B/GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and degradation",2019,"Aberrant CTNNB1 signaling is one of the fundamental processes in cancers, especially colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we reported that TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase important for inflammatory signaling, inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CRC metastasis through driving a selective autophagic CTNNB1 degradation machinery. Mechanistically, TRAF6 interacted with MAP1LC3B/LC3B through its LC3-interacting region ‘YxxL’ and catalyzed K63-linked polyubiquitination of LC3B. The K63-linked ubiquitination of LC3B promoted the formation of the LC3B-ATG7 complex and was critical to the subsequent recognition of CTNNB1 by LC3B for the selective autophagic degradation. However, TRAF6 was phosphorylated at Thr266 by GSK3B in most clinical CRC, which triggered K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6 and thereby attenuated its inhibitory activity towards the autophagy-dependent CTNNB1 signaling. Clinically, decreased expression of TRAF6 was associated with elevated GSK3B protein levels and activity and reduced overall survival in CRC patients. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B activity stabilized the TRAF6 protein, promoted CTNNB1 degradation, and effectively suppressed EMT and CRC metastasis. Thus, targeting TRAF6 and its pathway may be meaningful for treating advanced CRC.

"Increased calpain-1 in mitochondria induces dilated heart failure in mice: role of mitochondrial superoxide anion",2019,"We and others have reported that calpain-1 was increased in myocardial mitochondria from various animal models of heart disease. This study investigated whether constitutive up-regulation of calpain-1 restricted to mitochondria induced myocardial injury and heart failure and, if so, whether these phenotypes could be rescued by selective inhibition of mitochondrial superoxide production. Transgenic mice with human CAPN1 up-regulation restricted to mitochondria in cardiomyocytes (Tg-mtCapn1/tTA) were generated and characterized with low and high over-expression of transgenic human CAPN1 restricted to mitochondria, respectively. Transgenic up-regulation of mitochondria-targeted CAPN1 dose-dependently induced cardiac cell death, adverse myocardial remodeling, heart failure, and early death in mice, the changes of which were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial superoxide generation. Importantly, a daily injection of mitochondria-targeted superoxide dismutase mimetics mito-TEMPO for 1?month starting from age 2?months attenuated cardiac cell death, adverse myocardial remodeling and heart failure, and reduced mortality in Tg-mtCapn1/tTA mice. In contrast, administration of TEMPO did not achieve similar cardiac protection in transgenic mice. Furthermore, transgenic up-regulation of mitochondria-targeted CAPN1 induced a reduction of ATP5A1 protein and ATP synthase activity in hearts. In cultured cardiomyocytes, increased calpain-1 in mitochondria promoted mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and induced cell death, which were prevented by over-expression of ATP5A1, mito-TEMPO or cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of mPTP opening. In conclusion, this study has provided direct evidence demonstrating that increased mitochondrial calpain-1 is an important mechanism contributing to myocardial injury and heart failure by disrupting ATP synthase, and promoting mitochondrial superoxide generation and mPTP opening. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy; ATP5A1 protein; calpain 1; cyclosporine; malonaldehyde; mitochondrial permeability transition pore; mitochondrial superoxide anion; piperidine derivative; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide; unclassified drug; amine oxide; calpain; Capn1 protein, mouse; carrier protein; mitochondrial permeability transition pore; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; superoxide; TEMPO; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell culture; cell death; congestive heart failure; controlled study; disease association; disorders of mitochondrial functions; enzyme activity; heart mitochondrion; heart muscle injury; heart protection; heart ventricle remodeling; male; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; protein expression; transgenic mouse; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; congestive cardiomyopathy; disease model; heart failure; metabolism; mitochondrion; Animals; Calpain; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Cell Death; Cyclic N-Oxides; Disease Models, Animal; Heart Failure; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins; Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases; Myocytes, Cardiac; Superoxides"
"Glycyrrhizin administration ameliorates Streptococcus aureus-induced acute lung injury",2019,"Streptococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) has a high incidence of mortality clinically. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a traditional Chinese medicine for anti-inflammatory. However, the role of GL in S. aureus-induced ALI has not previously been elucidated. GL (25 mg/kg i.p.) administration exerts potent anti-inflammatory effect in this model. GL administration significantly alleviated inflammation via reduction of multiple cytokines (serum and lung tissue IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β and HMGB1) and immune cells (lung tissue neutrophil and macrophage infiltration). Additionally, we measured the signaling pathways (NF-kB and MARKs) and inflammasome dependent pyroptosis. The results suggest that GL inhibits NF-kB, p38/ERK pathways and pyroptosis. Furthermore, we used different inhibitors to treat infected-A549 cells and found that BMS-582949 (a p38 inhibitor) is the most effective inhibitor for inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β) production, which suggests that p38 signaling pathway might be the main pathway for S. aureus-induced inflammation. Collectively, the data demonstrates that GL could mitigate inflammation after S. aureus infection. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","antiinflammatory agent; bms 582949; glycyrrhizic acid; high mobility group B1 protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; mitogen activated protein kinase p38 inhibitor; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; autacoid; cytokine; glycyrrhizic acid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; A-549 cell line; acute lung injury; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; Chinese medicine; controlled study; cytokine production; female; human; human cell; human cell culture; immunocompetent cell; lung lavage; lung parenchyma; macrophage; MAPK signaling; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; pyroptosis; signal transduction; Streptococcus; Streptococcus aureus; Streptococcus infection; tissue section; acute lung injury; animal; C57BL mouse; Chinese medicine; disease model; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; neutrophil chemotaxis; physiology; Streptococcus; Streptococcus infection; A549 Cells; Acute Lung Injury; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Glycyrrhizic Acid; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Macrophages; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neutrophil Infiltration; NF-kappa B; Pyroptosis; Signal Transduction; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus"
"Sequencing of short cfDNA fragments in NIPT improves fetal fraction with higher maternal BMI and early gestational age",2019,"Low fetal DNA fraction (< 4%) samples obtained during noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are responsible for 0.5%-3% of “no calls”. Maternal characteristics such as body mass index (BMI) and gestational age (GA) are the main factors that influence fetal fraction. Here, we improved fetal fraction by performing semiconductor sequencing of shorter fragments (107-145 bp) of cfDNA (traditional NIPT fragment is 160 bp). Multivariable linear regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between fetal fraction and maternal characteristics including BMI and GA. Among the 1495 shorter cfDNA sequencing samples, BMI and GA were negatively and positively correlated with fetal fraction, respectively. Compared with underweight pregnant women, sequencing of shorter fragments decreased the mean fetal fraction differences between BMI groups, especially in the obese women (~15%). We also showed that the average fetal fraction was 22.2% and 96.3% fetal fraction more than 10% in the obese women with the average GA of 17 weeks. Size selection slightly decreased the mean fetal fraction differences between different GA groups, and sequencing shorter cfDNA can yield a fetal fraction at an earlier GA. Collectively, our results support the strategy of sequencing shorter to improve fetal fraction in subjects with a high maternal BMI and earlier GA. ? 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

"ISL1 loss-of-function mutation contributes to congenital heart defects",2019,"Congenital heart defect (CHD) is the most common form of birth deformity and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in humans. Increasing evidence has convincingly demonstrated that genetic defects play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CHD. However, CHD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and the genetic basis underpinning CHD in the vast majority of cases remains elusive. This study was sought to identify the pathogenic mutation in the ISL1 gene contributing to CHD. A cohort of 210 unrelated patients with CHD and a total of 256 unrelated healthy individuals used as controls were registered. The coding exons and splicing boundaries of ISL1 were sequenced in all study subjects. The functional effect of an identified ISL1 mutation was evaluated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. A novel heterozygous ISL1 mutation, c.409G > T or p.E137X, was identified in an index patient with congenital patent ductus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect. Analysis of the proband’s pedigree revealed that the mutation co-segregated with CHD, which was transmitted in the family in an autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance. The nonsense mutation was absent in 512 control chromosomes. Functional analysis unveiled that the mutant ISL1 protein failed to transactivate the promoter of MEF2C, alone or in synergy with TBX20. This study firstly implicates ISL1 loss-of-function mutation with CHD in humans, which provides novel insight into the molecular mechanism of CHD, implying potential implications for genetic counseling and individually tailored treatment of CHD patients. ? 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","homeodomain protein; ISL1 protein; mutant protein; myocyte enhancer factor 2; transcription factor; transcription factor TBX20; unclassified drug; DNA; insulin gene enhancer binding protein Isl-1; LIM homeodomain protein; transcription factor; adolescent; adult; Article; autosomal dominant inheritance; child; chromosome; cohort analysis; congenital heart malformation; controlled study; exon; female; gene; gene sequence; genetic code; heart ventricle septum defect; human; human cell; ISL1 gene; loss of function mutation; luciferase assay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; molecular pathology; nonsense mutation; patent ductus arteriosus; pedigree analysis; penetrance; preschool child; priority journal; promoter region; protein function; RNA splicing; congenital heart malformation; dna mutational analysis; genetics; infant; metabolism; pedigree; polymerase chain reaction; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA; DNA Mutational Analysis; Exons; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Infant; LIM-Homeodomain Proteins; Loss of Function Mutation; Male; Pedigree; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transcription Factors; Young Adult"
"Gut Microbiota Alteration After Long-Term Consumption of Probiotics in the Elderly",2019,"Gut microbiota has been proven to be of crucial importance in maintaining human health. However, the microbiota profile changes with aging, while the loss of microbiota diversity and the alterations in the optimal composition and quantity of beneficial microbes are believed to increase the risk of many diseases. Although the short-term modulatory impact of probiotics on gut microbiota has been revealed in various studies, no studies focused on longer time consumption of probiotics have been demonstrated. In this study, we found that microbial diversity in the probiotic group was similar to that in the control. We identified a panel of microbiota changes, such as Blautia (10.24 vs. 3.76%, P = 0.006), Streptococcus (7.38 vs. 1.16%, P = 0.004), and Enterococcus (0.13 vs. 0.00%, P = 0.030) were more abundant in the probiotic group. Faecalibacterium, a genus containing anti-inflammatory property, also had a higher abundance in the probiotic group in the gut. The microbiota architecture in the different probiotic dose groups was also revealed. No statistical difference was observed in regard to the short-chain fatty acid concentration between the groups. High-dose intake of probiotics resulted in lower microbial richness. The profile of inflammatory factors indicated that only the level of IL-1β was higher in the probiotic population. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the long-time intake of probiotics caused significant changes in the gut microbiota structure, including an increase in the composition of beneficial microorganisms, which might contribute to the maintenance of host health and homeostasis of microenvironment. More prospective cohorts were needed to illustrate the influences of probiotics on the gut microbiota. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","alpha fetoprotein; CA 19-9 antigen; carbohydrate antigen; carcinoembryonic antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; probiotic agent; short chain fatty acid; tumor necrosis factor; Actinobacteria; adult; age; aged; antiinflammatory activity; Article; Bacteroidetes; Blautia; case control study; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug dose comparison; dysbiosis; Enterococcus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Faecalibacterium; feces analysis; female; Firmicutes; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; homeostasis; human; human experiment; inflammation; intestine flora; long term care; male; microbial diversity; Mollicutes; normal human; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; prospective study; Proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; questionnaire; risk factor; species richness; Streptococcus"
"T2 mapping of cartilage and menisci at 3T in healthy subjects with knee malalignment: initial experience",2019,"Purpose: To assess the relationship between knee alignment and T2 values of femorotibial cartilage and menisci in healthy subjects at 3?T. Materials and methods: Thirty-six healthy subjects divided into three subgroups of 12 neutral, 12 varus, and 12 valgus alignment of the femorotibial joint were investigated on 3-T MR scanner using a 2D multi-echo turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence for T2 mapping. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to determine any statistically significant differences in subregional T2 values of femorotibial cartilage and menisci among the three subgroups of healthy subjects. Results: Lateral femoral anterior cartilage subregion (52 ± 3 ms, mean ± standard deviation; 53 ± 2?ms) had significantly higher T2 values (p < 0.05) than medial femoral anterior cartilage subregion (51 ± 2?ms; 51 ± 2?ms) in varus and valgus groups, respectively. There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in T2 values of tibial central cartilage subregion between lateral and medical compartment among varus, valgus, and neutral subgroups. Lateral body segment of meniscus (41 ± 3?ms) had significantly higher (p < 0.05) T2 values than medial body segment (40 ± 2?ms) in the varus subgroup. Conclusions: Some degree of correlation between knee alignment and subregional T2 values of femorotibial cartilage and menisci exists in healthy subjects. These findings indicate that T2 mapping may be sensitive in assessing the load distribution pattern of human cartilage and menisci with knee alignment abnormality, which may be used as reference baseline when understanding the occurrence and progression of knee osteoarthritis. ? 2019, ISS.","adult; aged; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical assessment; contact angle; controlled study; disease course; female; human; knee meniscus; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; valgus knee; varus knee; weight bearing; articular cartilage; bone malformation; diagnostic imaging; knee; knee meniscus; normal human; procedures; Adult; Bone Malalignment; Cartilage, Articular; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Menisci, Tibial"
"The application of induced pluripotent stem cells in pathogenesis study and gene therapy for vascular disorders: Current progress and future challenges",2019,"Vascular disorders are complex diseases with high morbidity and mortality. Among them, the dilated macrovascular diseases (MVD), such as aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, have presented a huge threat to human health. The pathogenesis of vascular diseases is mostly associated with property alteration of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Studies have confirmed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be proliferated and differentiated into other somatic cells, such as VECs and VSMCs. And patient-specific cells could provide detailed human-associated information in regard to pathogenesis or drug responses. In addition, differentiated ECs from iPSC have been widely used in disease modeling as a cell therapy. In this review, we mainly discussed the application of hiPSCs in investigating the pathological mechanism of different inherited vascular diseases and provide a comprehensive understanding of hiPSCs in the field of clinical diagnosis and gene therapy.

"Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework 8-Derived Au@ZnO for Efficient and Robust Photocatalytic Degradation of Tetracycline",2019,"Tetracycline (TC) and other antibiotics accumulated in groundwater and soil pollute ecological environment and threaten human health. Gold nanoparticles doped on photocatalysts are able to enhance the photodegradation efficiency during removing these antibiotics, but preparation of Au nanoparticles of well-dispersion on photocatalysts remains challenging. In this work, zeolite imidazolate (ZIF-8) was employed as the precursor to prepare Au@ZnO photocatalyst via impregnation and in-situ reduction method to efficiently degrade the tetracycline in the aqueous solution. Au nanoparticles are of 10 nm in size and uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of ZnO microstructures. The as-prepared Au@ZnO is able to remove 85.5% of TC of 0.010 mg/mL within 2 h, presenting higher photocatalytic activity than pure ZnO catalyst. Most importantly, the catalyst shows its superior stability after five cycles without structure and activity changing. The mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation was discussed in detail. ? 2019 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai, & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",""
"Prognostic value and clinical feature of SF3B1 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes: A meta-analysis",2019,"SF3B1 gene mutations are the most frequent mutations found in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and the prognostic implication of these mutations remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the prognostic impact and clinical feature of SF3B1 mutations in MDS patients. The overall hazard ratio for overall survival (OS) was 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.60–1.35, P = 0.61) in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations compared to those without. Lower leukemia-free survival was associated with SF3B1 mutations. Subgroup analyses showed that Asian cohorts and Illumina HiSeq 2000 methods were significantly associated with OS. Furthermore, SF3B1 mutations were significantly correlated with a lower level of blast cells and a high level of platelet counts and bone marrow ring sideroblasts. Thus, the current meta-analysis suggests that SF3B1 mutations have no significant impact on the OS of MDS patients, and the hematologic parameters of SF3B1 mutations identify a distinct subset of MDS patients with homogeneous features. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Asian; blast cell; bone marrow; clinical feature; correlational study; disease free survival; gene; gene mutation; genetic association; human; myelodysplastic syndrome; overall survival; platelet count; prognosis; Review; SF3B1 gene; survival rate; genetics; meta analysis; mortality; mutation; myelodysplastic syndrome; predictive value; prognosis; survival analysis; phosphoprotein; RNA splicing factor; SF3B1 protein, human; tumor marker; Biomarkers, Tumor; Humans; Mutation; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Phosphoproteins; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; RNA Splicing Factors; Survival Analysis"
"The Influence of Sex on Cardiac Physiology and Cardiovascular Diseases",2020,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. Most of treatment strategies were based on studies conducted on male patients. Studies have shown that significant differences exist between the two sexes in the development of CVD. There are certain differences between men and women in the structure and physiological functions of the heart such as left ventricular mass index, resting heart rate, and contractile function. Accordingly, the pathological features of the heart such as the extend of hypertrophy, fibrosis, and remodeling are also different. In addition, different genders also affect clinical symptoms, responses to treatment and prognosis in the development of CVD. Therefore, it is important to take these differences into consideration when design treatment options for men and women. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","fibrinolytic agent; hormone; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical feature; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; emotion; fibrinolytic therapy; heart arrhythmia; heart contraction; heart function; heart left ventricle mass; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle hypertrophy; human; hypertension; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; percutaneous coronary intervention; physical activity; priority journal; prognosis; resting heart rate; Review; risk assessment; sex; sex difference; smoking; treatment response"
"MicroRNA-221 regulates osteosarcoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion by targeting CDKN1B/p27",2019,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miR) are of critical importance in growth and metastasis of cancer cells; however, the underlying functions of miRNAs in osteosarcoma (OS) remain largely unknown. This study was aimed to elucidate the role of miR-221 in regulating the biological behavior of OS cells. The proliferation ability was examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell cycle assay. The abilities of cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis were monitored by transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The effect of miR-221 on cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) expression was evaluated by luciferase assays, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. We found that miR-221 was elevated in OS cell lines compared with the normal osteoblastic cell line. Transfection of the miR-221 inhibitor into MG63 and U-2OS cell lines obviously suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which is accompanied with cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays indicated that CDKN1B is directly targeted by miR-221 in OS cells. Knockdown of CDKN1B inhibited the effects of miR-221 inhibitor, along with decreased Bax and caspase-3 and increased cyclin E, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Snail, and Twist1 expression. The results suggested that miR-221 might act as a potentially useful target for treatment of OS. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","caspase 3; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cyclin E; microRNA 221; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; transcription factor Snail; Twist related protein 1; apoptosis; Article; cell migration; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene function; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; HOS cell line; human; human cell; MG-63 cell line; osteosarcoma; priority journal; protein targeting; regulatory mechanism; SaOS-2 cell line; tumor invasion; U2OS cell line; upregulation"
"Recombinant human glucagon-like peptide-1 protects against chronic intermittent hypoxia by improving myocardial energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis",2019,"Background and aims: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a chronic disease associated with intermittent hypoxia (IH) and is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) is a naturally occurring incretin used as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, and advanced heart failure. However, whether GLP-1 can protect against IH-induced cardiac injury is still unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the effects of recombinant human GLP-1 (rhGLP-1) on cardiac health in mice. Methods: Mice were subjected to repetitive 5% O 2 for 30 s and 21% O 2 for 30 s, for a total of 8 h/day for 4 weeks. Subsequently, mice received subcutaneous injection of saline or rhGLP-1 (100 μg/kg, three times per day). Cardiac function, myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis were examined for evaluation of cardiac injury. Results: A reduction in diastolic function (E/A ratio) in mice exposed to IH was significantly reversed by rhGLP-1. IH induced marked cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, IH resulted in a shift from fatty acid to glucose metabolism in the myocardium with downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and PPARγ. Moreover, IH caused a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and transcription, together with reduced mtDNA content and impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure. These changes were abolished by rhGLP-1 via activation of PGC-1α and Akt signaling. Conclusions: rhGLP-1 protects against IH-induced cardiac injury by improving myocardial energy metabolism and enhancing the early adaptive changes of mitochondrial biogenesis. ? 2018","glucagon like peptide 1; mitochondrial DNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; protein kinase B; recombinant human glucagon like peptide 1; unclassified drug; glucagon like peptide 1; recombinant protein; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; chronic intermittent hypoxia; controlled study; down regulation; energy metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; heart muscle fibrosis; heart muscle metabolism; male; mitochondrial biogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; animal; cardiac muscle cell; cytology; drug effect; energy metabolism; fibrosis; genetics; human; hypoxia; metabolism; organelle biogenesis; pathology; signal transduction; subcutaneous drug administration; Animals; Apoptosis; Energy Metabolism; Fibrosis; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoxia; Injections, Subcutaneous; Male; Mice; Myocytes, Cardiac; Organelle Biogenesis; Recombinant Proteins; Signal Transduction"
"Inhibition of ATM reverses EMT and decreases metastatic potential of cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells through JAK/STAT3/PD-L1 pathway",2019,"Background: The cisplatin-resistance is still a main course for chemotherapy failure of lung cancer patients. Cisplatin-resistant cancer cells own higher malignance and exhibited increased metastatic ability, but the mechanism is not clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) on lung cancer metastasis. Materials and methods: Cisplatin-resistant A549CisR and H157CisR cell line were generated by long-term treating parental A549 and H157 cells (A549P and H157P) with cisplatin. Cell growth, cell migration and cell invasion were determined. Gene expressions were determined by Western Blot and qPCR. Tumor metastasis was investigated using a xenograft mouse model. Results: The IC50 of the cisplatin-resistant cells (A549CisR and H157CisR cells) to cisplatin was 6-8 higher than parental cells. The A549CisR and H157CisR cells expressed lower level of E-cadherin and higher levels of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail compared to the parental A549P and H157P cells, and exhibited stronger capabilities of metastatic potential compared to the parental cells. The ATM expression was upregulated in A549CisR and H157CisR cells and cisplatin treatment also upregulated expression of ATM in parental cells, The inhibition of ATM by using specific ATM inhibitor CP466722 or knock-down ATM by siRNA suppressed Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic potential of A549CisR and H157CisR cells. These data suggest that ATM mediates the cisplatin-resistance in lung cancer cells. Expressions of JAK 1,2, STAT 3 PD-L1 and ATM were increased in A549CisR and H157CisR cells and could by induced by cisplatin in parental lung cancer cells. Interestedly, ATM upregulated PD-L1 expression via JAK 1,2 /STAT 3 pathway and inhibition of ATM decreased JAK/STAT3 signaling and decreased PD-L1 expression. The treatment of PD-L1 neutralizing Ab reduced EMT and cell invasion. Inhibition of JAK 1,2 /STAT 3 signaling by specific inhibitors suppressed ATM-induced PD-L1 expression, EMT and cell invasion. Importantly, inhibition of ATM suppressed EMT and tumor metastasis in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Conclusions: Our results show that ATM regulates PD-L1 expression through activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling in cisplatin-resistant cells. Overexpression of ATM contributes to cisplatin-resistance in lung cancer cells. Inhibition of ATM reversed EMT and inhibited cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Thus, ATM may be a potential target for the treatment of cisplatin-resistant lung cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).","ATM protein; Janus kinase; nerve cell adhesion molecule; programmed death 1 ligand 1; STAT3 protein; transcription factor Snail; uvomorulin; vimentin; ATM protein; ATM protein, human; STAT3 protein; A-549 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer resistance; cell growth; cell invasion; cell migration; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene expression; human; human cell; intracellular signaling; lung cancer cell line; metastasis potential; mouse; NCI-H157 cell line; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; ataxia telangiectasia; drug effect; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; Animals; Ataxia Telangiectasia; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; STAT3 Transcription Factor"
"MiR-4465 directly targets PTEN to inhibit AKT/mTOR pathway–mediated autophagy",2019,"Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining cell function. Abnormal autophagy leads to cell dysfunction and is associated with many diseases such as tumors, immunodeficiency diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is precisely regulated, and PTEN plays an important role in regulating autophagy. As noncoding small RNAs, miRNAs play an important role in the fine regulation of cellular processes. However, the mechanism of the miRNA regulation of PTEN-related autophagy has not been fully elucidated. In this study, our results showed that miR-4465 significantly inhibited the expression of PTEN, upregulated phosphorylated AKT, and thereby inhibited autophagy by activating mTOR in HEK293, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y cells. Further studies indicated that miR-4465 reduced PTEN mRNA levels through posttranscriptional regulation via directly targeting the 3′-UTR. Our novel findings provide useful hints for the comprehensive elucidation of the molecular mechanism of miRNA-regulated PTEN-related autophagy and may also provide some new insights for the exploration of miRNAs in the treatment of PTEN-related diseases. ? 2018, Cell Stress Society International.","mammalian target of rapamycin; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 4465; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; microRNA; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; PTEN protein, human; target of rapamycin kinase; 3' untranslated region; Akt/mTOR signaling; Article; autophagy; controlled study; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; human; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein targeting; SH-SY5Y cell line; transcription regulation; upregulation; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; signal transduction; 3' Untranslated Regions; Autophagy; Gene Expression Regulation; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Transcription, Genetic"
"Surface Modification of Polymeric Nanoparticles with M2pep Peptide for Drug Delivery to Tumor-Associated Macrophages",2019,"Purpose: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with immune-suppressive M2-like phenotype constitute a significant part of tumor and support its growth, thus making an attractive therapeutic target for cancer therapy. To improve the delivery of drugs that control the survival and/or functions of TAMs, we developed nanoparticulate drug carriers with high affinity for TAMs. Methods: Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles were coated with M2pep, a peptide ligand selectively binding to M2-polarized macrophages, via a simple surface modification method based on tannic acid-iron complex. The interactions of M2pep-coated nanoparticles with macrophages of different phenotypes were tested in vitro and in vivo. PLX3397, an inhibitor of the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)/CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) pathway and macrophage survival, was delivered to B16F10 tumors via M2pep-modified PLGA nanoparticles. Results: In bone marrow-derived macrophages polarized to M2 phenotype, M2pep-coated nanoparticles showed greater cellular uptake than those without M2pep. Consistently, M2pep-coated nanoparticles showed relatively high localization of CD206+ macrophages in B16F10 tumors. PLX3397 encapsulated in M2pep-coated nanoparticles attenuated tumor growth better than the free drug counterpart. Conclusion: These results support that M2pep-coating can help nanoparticles to interact with M2-like TAMs and facilitate the delivery of drugs that control the tumor-supportive functions of TAMs. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","antineoplastic agent; colony stimulating factor 1; drug carrier; M2pep peptide; nanoparticle; paclitaxel; peptide; pexidartinib; polyglactin; polymer; unclassified drug; wr 12; 5-((5-chloro-1H-pyrrolo(2,3-b)pyridin-3-yl)methyl)-N-((6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl)methyl)pyridin-2-amine; aminopyridine derivative; drug carrier; nanoparticle; peptide; polymer; pyrrole derivative; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow derived macrophage; cell function; cell survival; controlled study; drug delivery system; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; melanoma; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor growth; animal; C57BL mouse; cell line; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug effect; experimental melanoma; human; macrophage; procedures; RAW 264.7 cell line; tumor cell line; Aminopyridines; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Macrophages; Male; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nanoparticles; Peptides; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer; Polymers; Pyrroles; RAW 264.7 Cells"
"Sensitivity improved with Parylene-C passivized on Lamb wave sensor for aPTT measurement through monitoring whole blood reaction",2019,"Blood clotting time monitoring is of great importance in predicting the risk of haemorrhage and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, a new P-Lamb wave sensor was developed to measure activated partial thromboplastic time (aPTT) with enhanced sensitivity. The sensor utilizes a piezoelectric and hydrophobic material, Parylene-C, as a waveguide for the P-Lamb wave sensor in order to monitor the aPTT in whole blood samples. With a smooth surface, the P-Lamb wave sensor reduced energy loss and prevented leaky modes, with a decrease of 33% ± 1.25% in the surface roughness and an increase of 2.75% ± 0.15% in the signal. The experimental results demonstrated that, compared to a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), a P-Lamb sensor with high sensitivity (the frequency shift of a P-Lamb sensor is approximately 200 times greater than that of a QCM) improved stability and enhanced repeatability. Parylene-C worked as a phonon coupling layer, which improved the stability and sensitivity of the Lamb sensor. The relative standards deviation (RSD) of the aPTT measurement was 2.11%, which was 1.22 times lower than reported values. The P-Lamb wave sensor was also tested for its sensitivity to different concentrations of heparin and was found to exhibit an increase in coagulation time with an increasing heparin concentration. Compared to the SYSMEX CS 5100 haematology analyser, the clinical coefficient index (R2) was 0.99467. Considering its compact size, low cost, and mass production of the chip unit, the developed P-Lamb wave sensor is a promising device for point-of-care diagnosis of haemostasis and personal health monitoring. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blood; Diagnosis; Energy dissipation; Polysaccharides; Quartz crystal microbalances; Surface roughness; Surface waves; A0 mode; aPTT; High sensitivity; Lamb-wave sensors; Linearity; Ultrasonic waves"
"Increased growth differentiation factor 15 is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke",2019,"BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a stress-responsive biomarker, is known to be independently associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in different disease settings, but data on the prognostic value of GDF-15 after stroke are limited. METHODS: Baseline serum GDF-15 was measured in 3066 acute ischemic stroke patients from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke (CATIS). The primary outcome was a composite of death and major disability within 3 months. Secondary outcomes included death, major disability, vascular events, and stroke recurrence. The associations between GDF-15 and clinical outcomes after stroke were assessed by multivariate logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: At 3 months’ follow-up, 676 (22.05%), 86 (2.80%), 81 (2.64%), and 51 (1.66%) patients had experienced major disability, death, vascular events, or stroke recurrence, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, current smoking, alcohol consumption, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, the odds ratio/hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1 SD higher of base-10 log-transformed GDF-15 was 1.26 (1.15–1.39) for primary outcome, 1.13 (1.02–1.25) for major disability, 1.79 (1.48 –2.16) for death, and 1.26 (1.00 –1.58) for vascular events. The addition of GDF-15 to established risk factors improved risk prediction of the composite outcome of death and major disability (c-statistic, net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement, all P 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High GDF-15 concentrations are independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke, suggesting that baseline serum GDF-15 could provide additional information to identify ischemic stroke patients at high risk of poor prognosis. ? 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.","growth differentiation factor 15; GDF15 protein, human; growth differentiation factor 15; tumor marker; adult; Article; brain ischemia; clinical outcome; disability; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; outcome assessment; prognosis; prospective study; protein blood level; risk assessment; risk factor; aged; blood; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; mortality; multivariate analysis; proportional hazards model; statistical model; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Ischemia; Female; Growth Differentiation Factor 15; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Stroke"
"Comparison of Ivor-Lewis versus Sweet procedure for middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A STROBE compliant study",2019,"Our study compared the Ivor-Lewis and Sweet procedures used for treating middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and assessed the associated perioperative complications and long-term survival rates of the patients.This retrospective study involved 624 middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous carcinoma patients who received either Ivor-Lewis (n=325) or Sweet (n=299) procedures at our hospital. Further, the perioperative conditions and long-term survival rates were analyzed for both groups.Relative to the Sweet group, the Ivor-Lewis group showed lower volume of drainage within 24hours after operation (400 (300-500) ml vs 550 (400-658) ml, P=.031). Although we found no significant differences in major postoperative complications between the groups (72 (22.2) vs 65 (21.7), P=.90), there were significant differences observed in minor postoperative complications between the Ivor-Lewis and Sweet groups (59 (18.2) vs 32 (10.7), P=.008). Perioperative death rates remained comparable for the 2 groups (2 (0.6) vs 2 (0.7), P>.99). Further, comparison of the 2 groups revealed that the Ivor-Lewis group had increased number of dissected lymph nodes, (20 (4-42) vs 16 (3-31), P<.001), especially in the upper mediastinum (4 (0-5) vs 2 (0-2), P<.001). The long-term survival rates did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (Kaplan-Meier method, P=.95; Cox regression, P=.20).These findings suggest that perioperative complications and long-term survival rates were comparable for both patients groups. Patients receiving the Sweet procedure had reduced minor postoperative complications compared to those receiving the Ivor-Lewis procedure. Due to improved quality of lymph node dissection in the upper mediastinum, the Ivor-Lewis procedure may have advantages over the Sweet procedure for treating patients with esophageal cancer with enlarged lymph nodes in the upper mediastinum. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Efficacy and safety of sonothombolysis versus non-sonothombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2019,"Recent studies have shown that inconsistent results of safety and efficacy between sonothombolysis vs. non-sonothombolysis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We implemented a meta-analysis to explore the value of sonothrombolysis in AIS treatment. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which had evaluated sonothrombolysis or ultrasound thrombolysis in AIS. One hundred five studies were retrieved and analyzed, among them, 7 RCTs were included in the current meta-analysis. In comparison with the non-sonothombolysis, sonothrombolysis significantly improved complete recanalization (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.08, P < 0.001), complete or partial recanalization (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.88, P = 0.002), there is also a tendency to improvement of 4 points in NIHSS score (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.07, P = 0.057). However, sonothrombolysis and non-sonothrombolysis had insignificant differences in neurological recovery and adverse events. In subgroup analysis, we found that “With t-PA”, “NIHSS > 15”, “Treatment time 150min”, and “Age 65 years” are potential favorable factors for efficacy outcomes of sonothombolysis. Sonothrombolysis can significantly increase the rate of recanalization in patients with AIS compared with non-sonothrombolysis, but there is no significant effect on improving neurological functional recovery and avoiding complications.

"Adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of stroke and stroke subtypes",2019,"Several meta-analyses including a small number of cohorts showed inverse associations between the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) and risk of stroke. However, it remains unclear whether such a relation varies by region of the study population or by major subtypes of stroke. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for relevant studies and we further included unpublished results from the Singapore Chinese Health Study (N = 57,078) and the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) study (N = 12,670). We used a random-effects model to calculate summary relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of stroke for each 4-point increment of the MedDiet score, roughly corresponding to the difference between extreme quintiles of the MedDiet score among participants of the included studies. The final analyses included 20 prospective cohort studies involving 682,149 participants and 16,739 stroke cases. The summary RRs for each 4-point increment of the MedDiet score were 0.84 (95% CI 0.81–0.88; I 2 = 11.5%) for all combined, 0.76 (95% CI 0.65–0.89) for studies in Mediterranean populations and 0.86 (95% CI 0.83–0.89) for those in non-Mediterranean populations. Lower risk of stroke associated with higher MedDiet score also was observed in the analyses stratified by study population and methodological characteristics including study risk of bias, version of the MedDiet index, and definition of moderate alcohol consumption. The MedDiet was similarly associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81–0.91; nine studies) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.93; eight studies). Our meta-analysis suggests that adhering to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower risk of stroke in both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean populations, and for both ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke risk. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","alcohol consumption; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; dietary compliance; human; Mediterranean diet; risk factor; risk reduction; scoring system; stroke patient; systematic review; transient ischemic attack; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; Mediterranean diet; meta analysis; risk assessment; Brain Ischemia; Diet, Mediterranean; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Risk Assessment; Stroke"
"Construction of a Polypyrrole-Based Multifunctional Nanocomposite for Dual-Modal Imaging and Enhanced Synergistic Phototherapy against Cancer Cells",2019,"Design and construction of multifunctional theranostic nanoplatforms are still desired for cancer-effective treatment. Herein, a kind of polypyrrole (PPy)-based multifunctional nanocomposite was designed and successfully constructed for dual-model imaging and enhanced synergistic phototherapy against cancer cells.

The obtained PGPAI NPs showed promising ability for photoacoustic/computed tomography imaging. Under near-infrared light irradiation, the PPy core and IR820 molecule effectively generated heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. Furthermore, the loaded Au NPs owning catalase-like activity produced oxygen by decomposing H2O2 (up-regulated in tumor region), enhancing the oxygen-dependent photodynamic therapy efficacy. The formed PGPAI NPs were also proved to own desirable photothermal conversion efficiency, photothermal stability, colloidal stability, cytocompatibility, and cellular internalization behaviors. Furthermore, cell assay demonstrated that PGPAI NPs displayed enhanced synergistic phototherapy efficacy against cancer cells. These developed multifunctional nanoplatforms are promising for effective cancer theranostic applications.

"Meta-analysis of the prognostic value of C-C chemokine receptor type 7 in patients with solid tumors",2019,"Background: Expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) is associated with the prognosis of several cancers. The aim of this study was to conduct the meta-analysis to determine the prognostic value of CCR7 expression in solid tumors. Materials and methods: We searched for relevant literature in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases (last updated on January 15, 2018). The associations of CCR7 expression with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), progress-free survival (PFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were estimated. Results: In total, 30 qualified studies including 3,413 patients were enrolled. The results revealed that higher expression of CCR7 predicted poorer OS (pooled HR =1.79; 95% CI =1.49–2.16; P<0.001) and PFS (pooled HR =2.18; 95% CI =1.49–3.18; P<0.001), but was not associated with DFS (pooled HR =1.69; 95% CI =0.79–3.61; P=0.175), RFS (pooled HR =1.29; 95% CI =0.48–3.44; P=0.618), or DSS (pooled HR =3.06; 95% CI =0.38–24.83; P<0.294). Conclusion: From this meta-analysis, we concluded that high expression of CCR7 in tumor tissue is associated with poor survival in patients with solid tumors, and may be a prognostic biomarker for tumor progression. ? 2019 Zu et al.","chemokine receptor CCR7; disease free survival; disease specific survival; human; outcome assessment; overall survival; prognosis; progression free survival; protein expression; recurrence free survival; Review; solid malignant neoplasm; systematic review"

"Facile preparation of reduction-responsive micelles based on biodegradable amphiphilic polyurethane with disulfide bonds in the backbone",2019,"In this paper, we synthesized a biodegradable amphiphilic polymer of polyurethanepolyethylene glycol with disulfide bonds in the main chain (PEG-PU(SS)-PEG). DLS and SEM showed that the polymer could self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution and could be used to load the hydrophobic anticancer drug DOX. Intriguingly, drug release in vitro indicated that DOX-loaded PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles had good stability under the extracellular physiological environment, but the disulfide bonds broke rapidly and DOX was released quickly under the intracellular reducing conditions. CCK-8 assays showed that DOX-loaded PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles had a high in vitro antitumor activity in C6 cells, whereas blank PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles were nontoxic to C6 cells. It was also found that there was strong and persistent accumulation of DOX-loaded PEG-PU(SS)-PEG as compared with PEG-PU-PEG both by the cell internalization tests and the flow cytometry measurements. Hence, PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles will have a potential use for clinical treatment of cancer in the future. ? 2019 by the authors.","Biodegradable polymers; Controlled drug delivery; Covalent bonds; Drug products; Polyurethanes; Reduction; Sulfur compounds; Targeted drug delivery; Amphiphilic polymers; Anticancer drug; Cell internalization; Clinical treatments; Facile preparation; Physiological environment; Reducing conditions; Triggered release; Micelles"
"Relationship between stromal cells and tumor spread through air spaces in lung adenocarcinoma",2019,"Background: The mechanism underlying tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) has not been well studied. We investigated the role of tumor stromal cells in the pathogenesis of STAS from a pathological perspective and evaluated the prognostic significance of tumor stromal cells and STAS in postoperative patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 208 postsurgical patients with stage I–IIIA lung adenocarcinoma. The presence of STAS was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and CD204-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. A logistic regression model was applied to confirm the predictive factors of STAS. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of α-SMA-positive CAFs, CD204-positive TAMs, and STAS on prognosis. A nomogram was generated to evaluate the prognosis of postoperative patients. Results: Logistic regression suggested that the expression of α-SMA-positive CAFs (P < 0.001) and the number of CD204-positive TAMs (P < 0.001) were related to the presence of STAS. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model suggested that STAS (P = 0.004), α-SMA-positive CAFs (P < 0.001), and CD204-positive TAMs (P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for prognosis. Harrell's c-indexes for overall and recurrence-free survival prediction based on nomograms were 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.76–0.91) and 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.76–0.89), respectively. Conclusions: The presence of STAS was associated with high expression of α-SMA and CD204 in lung adenocarcinoma. Nomograms including STAS and stromal cells as variables are recommended as practical models to evaluate the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Treatment of Blood Blister–like Aneurysms with Stent-Assisted Coiling: A Retrospective Multicenter Study",2019,"Objective: To clarify safety and efficacy of stent-assisted coiling for treatment of blood blister–like aneurysm (BBA) in a multicenter experience. Methods: A total of 212 consecutive cases (213 BBAs) treated with stent-assisted coiling were retrospectively reviewed and included in the final analysis. Outcomes including complete occlusion, recurrence, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and overall good neurologic outcome during follow-up were analyzed. Results: Of 212 patients, 102 (48.1%) were treated with a single stent, 77 (36.3%) were treated with 2 stents, and 33 (15.6%) were treated with ?3 stents. Angiographic follow-up data were available for 96 BBAs; 64.6% of BBAs showed complete obliteration, and 22.9% showed recurrence. Complete obliteration rates of patients treated with single, 2, and ?3 stents were 42.9%, 78.4%, and 88.2%. Recurrence rates of patients treated with single, 2, and ?3 stents were 38.1%, 13.5%, and 5.9%. Using ?2 stents seemed to result in higher obliteration rates (P < 0.001) and lower recurrence rates (P = 0.002). Clinical follow-up data available for 180 patients showed 91.1% of patients had a good clinical outcome. No difference was found between the 3 stent treatments. There were 14 (6.6%) perioperative ischemic complications and 12 (5.7%) hemorrhagic complications, with 10 (4.7%) cases of perioperative deaths. Using ?2 stents seemed to result in a lower perioperative hemorrhagic complication rate compared with single stent (P = 0.037). Conclusions: Our data support the use of overlapping (?2) stents combined with coiling as a safe and effective therapeutic modality for BBA. Overlapping (?2) stents may provide higher obliteration rate, lower recurrence rate, and lower perioperative hemorrhagic risk in treatment of BBA. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","antithrombocytic agent; adult; aneurysm; Article; blood blister like aneurysm; cardiovascular mortality; clinical outcome; coil embolization; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; digital subtraction angiography; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; perioperative period; postoperative care; recurrence risk; retrospective study; aged; artificial embolization; blood vessel prosthesis; carotid artery disease; clinical trial; devices; endovascular surgery; intracranial aneurysm; procedures; stent; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Carotid Artery Diseases; Embolization, Therapeutic; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Stents; Treatment Outcome"
"An outline for the pharmacological effect of icariin in the nervous system",2019,"Icariin is a major active component of the traditional herb Epimedium, also known as Horny Goat Weed. It has been extensively studied throughout the past several years and is known to exert anti-oxidative, anti-neuroinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. It is now being considered as a potential therapeutic agent for a wide variety of disorders, ranging from neoplasm to cardiovascular disease. More recent studies have shown that icariin exhibits potential preventive and/or therapeutic effects in the nervous system. For example, icariin can prevent the production of amyloid β (1?42) and inhibit the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Icariin has been shown to mitigate pro-inflammatory responses of microglia in culture and in animal models of cerebral ischemia, depression, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Icariin also prevents the neurotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ibotenic acid, and homocysteine. In addition, icariin is implicated in facilitating learning and memory in both normal aging animals and disease models. To date, we still have no consolidated source of knowledge about the pharmacological effects of icariin in the nervous system, though its roles in other tissues have been reviewed in recent years. Here, we summarize the pharmacological development of icariin as well as its possible mechanisms in prevention and/or therapy of disorders afflicting the nervous system in hope of expanding the knowledge about the preventive and/or therapeutic effect of icariin in brain disorders. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid precursor protein; beta secretase 1; chitosan; collagen; homocysteine; hydrogen peroxide; ibotenic acid; icariin; paclitaxel; flavonoid; icariin; neuroprotective agent; aging; antidepressant activity; antiinflammatory activity; brain ischemia; cognitive defect; depression; disease association; disease model; drug effect; drug tissue level; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Epimedium; excitotoxicity; human; microglia; multiple sclerosis; nerve regeneration; nervous system inflammation; neuroapoptosis; neurologic disease; neuropathology; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; pharmacokinetic parameters; priority journal; protein expression; Review; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; traumatic brain injury; animal; nervous system; Animals; Flavonoids; Humans; Nervous System; Neuroprotective Agents"
"The anthelmintic agent oxfendazole inhibits cell growth in non?small cell lung cancer by suppressing c?Src activation",2019,"The c-Src protein family of tyrosine kinases are important in the tumorigenesis of many types of tumors, and may be a potential target for antitumor drug discovery. In the present study, immunoblotting was performed to analyze protein expression, CCK-8 assay was carried out to assess cell viability and cell cycle was analyzed using a flow cytometer. The anthelmintic agent oxfendazole was observed to be a novel c-Src inhibitor that blocked the activation of c-Src. Oxfendazole also suppressed the cell growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and overexpression of c-Src decreased the cytotoxicity of oxfendazole against NSCLC cells. In addition, oxfendazole induced cell cycle arrest at the G 0 /G 1 phase, and downregulated the protein levels of Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-4, CDK6, retinoblastoma protein and E2 transcription factor 1, and upregulated the expression levels of p53 and p21 in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, oxfendazole enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin against NSCLC cells. These results demonstrated that oxfendazole exerted its antitumor activity by suppressing c-Src signaling, and it was also indicated that the anthelmintic agent oxfendazole may be effective for anti-NSCLC therapy in the clinic as a single agent or in combination with other antitumor drugs. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Selective deletion of endothelial cell calpain in mice reduces diabetic cardiomyopathy by improving angiogenesis",2019,"Aims/hypothesis: The role of non-cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiomyopathy has not been fully addressed. This study investigated whether endothelial cell calpain plays a role in myocardial endothelial injury and microvascular rarefaction in diabetes, thereby contributing to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods: Endothelial cell-specific Capns1-knockout (KO) mice were generated. Conditions mimicking prediabetes and type 1 and type 2 diabetes were induced in these KO mice and their wild-type littermates. Myocardial function and coronary flow reserve were assessed by echocardiography. Histological analyses were performed to determine capillary density, cardiomyocyte size and fibrosis in the heart. Isolated aortas were assayed for neovascularisation. Cultured cardiac microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated with high palmitate. Angiogenesis and apoptosis were analysed. Results: Endothelial cell-specific deletion of Capns1 disrupted calpain 1 and calpain 2 in endothelial cells, reduced cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, and alleviated myocardial dysfunction in mouse models of diabetes without significantly affecting systemic metabolic variables. These protective effects of calpain disruption in endothelial cells were associated with an increase in myocardial capillary density (wild-type vs Capns1-KO 3646.14 ± 423.51 vs 4708.7 ± 417.93 capillary number/high-power field in prediabetes, 2999.36 ± 854.77 vs 4579.22 ± 672.56 capillary number/high-power field in type 2 diabetes and 2364.87 ± 249.57 vs 3014.63 ± 215.46 capillary number/high-power field in type 1 diabetes) and coronary flow reserve. Ex vivo analysis of neovascularisation revealed more endothelial cell sprouts from aortic rings of prediabetic and diabetic Capns1-KO mice compared with their wild-type littermates. In cultured cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, inhibition of calpain improved angiogenesis and prevented apoptosis under metabolic stress. Mechanistically, deletion of Capns1 elevated the protein levels of β-catenin in endothelial cells of Capns1-KO mice and constitutive activity of calpain 2 suppressed β-catenin protein expression in cultured endothelial cells. Upregulation of β-catenin promoted angiogenesis and inhibited apoptosis whereas knockdown of β-catenin offset the protective effects of calpain inhibition in endothelial cells under metabolic stress. Conclusions/interpretation: These results delineate a primary role of calpain in inducing cardiac endothelial cell injury and impairing neovascularisation via suppression of β-catenin, thereby promoting diabetic cardiomyopathy, and indicate that calpain is a promising therapeutic target to prevent diabetic cardiac complications. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","beta catenin; calpain; calpain 1; calpain 2; palmitic acid; beta catenin; calpain; Capns1 protein, mouse; CTNNB1 protein, mouse; adult; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aortic ring (slice); apoptosis; Article; capillary density; capillary rarefaction; capns1 gene; cardiac muscle cell; cell size; controlled study; coronary flow reserve; diabetic cardiomyopathy; echocardiography; endothelium cell; endothelium injury; enzyme activity; ex vivo study; gene; gene deletion; heart function; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle hypertrophy; histology; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; metabolic stress; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cardiac muscle; cytology; diabetic cardiomyopathy; endothelium cell; enzymology; fibroblast; genetics; knockout mouse; macrophage; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); physiology; signal transduction; Animals; Apoptosis; beta Catenin; Calpain; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Endothelial Cells; Fibroblasts; Gene Deletion; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Signal Transduction"
"The optimal treatment for improving cognitive function in elder people with mild cognitive impairment incorporating Bayesian network meta-analysis and systematic review",2019,"It's widely acknowledged that, as a neurodegenerative aging disease representing an intermediate stage between cognitive intactness and Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) poses an excessive burden on patients’ well-being, family members, health-care providers as well as the whole society. This study focuses on three cognitive interventions proposed by Clare and Woods, which are, Cognitive stimulation (CS), Cognitive training (CT) and Cognitive rehabilitation (CR). Our Network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to compar them with one another to determine the optimal cognitive intervention for elderly adults with MCI in improving their cognitive function. We applied extensive strategies to preliminary literature retrieval to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which scrupulously compared any two of the three cognitive interventions with one another or any one of the three with a control group as the placebo or non-active group in treating elder patients with MCI in accordance with Petersen's criteria. Our NMA of cognitive interventions for patients diagnosed with MCI appraised the relative effectiveness of cognitive interventions across trials simultaneously. Our study attempts to summarize available data to suggest that CS (Mean difference [MD] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.27, 1.70) and CT (MD = 0.70, [CI]:0.11,1.30) were significantly beneficial to MCI patients for improving their cognition status while CR (MD = 0.59, [CI]:-0.30,1.50) scored lowest. Our study suggested CS was most likely to be the best intervention for improving the cognitive function of MCI patients. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bayes theorem; cognition; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; comparative study; disorders of higher cerebral function; human; meta analysis; mild cognitive impairment; network meta-analysis; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; treatment outcome"
"Overexpression of lncRNA GAS5 suppresses prostatic epithelial cell proliferation by regulating COX-2 in chronic non-bacterial prostatitis",2019,"Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis (CNP) is a common urologic disease that is linked to the development of prostate cancer. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) GAS5 has been identified to mediate cell proliferation in prostate cancer, although its role in CNP is still unclear. Human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic CNP model in vitro. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the expression of GAS5 and COX-2, while western blotting was used to evaluate the protein expression of COX-2. The interaction between GAS5 and COX-2 was determined using RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). Cell proliferation was determined using MTT assay. The expression of GAS5 was decreased, while COX-2 was increased in prostatitis tissues and in LPS-induced RWPE-1 cells. The overexpression of GAS5 suppressed the protein level of COX-2, and inhibited cell proliferation of LPS-induced RWPE-1 cells and HPECs, which was rescued by the co-transfection with pcDNA-GAS5 and pcDNA-COX-2. GAS5 was confirmed to promote the ubiquitination of COX-2, and the in vivo GAS5-overexpressed CNP rat model decreased the motor scores, the volume of prostate tissues, the average number of inflammatory cells, prostatic proliferation, and COX-2 expression. Our findings revealed that overexpression of GAS5 inhibited cell proliferation via negatively regulating the expression of COX-2, thus alleviating the progression of CNP. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cyclooxygenase 2; long non coding RNA GAS5; long untranslated RNA; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell proliferation; chronic non bacterial prostatitis; chronic prostatitis; controlled study; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammatory cell; male; mRNA expression level; MTT assay; nonhuman; pathogenesis; prostate epithelium cell; prostate tissue; protein DNA binding; protein expression level; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; RWPE-1 cell line; ubiquitination; Western blotting"
"A panel of 12-lncRNA signature predicts survival of pancreatic adenocarcinoma",2019,"Background: Recent studies have highlighted the important roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) prognosis. However, most studies explored a limited number of lncRNAs based on small sample size. Methods: Systematic and comprehensive analysis of the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was performed to identify a panel of lncRNA signature for predicting prognosis in PCa. Results: A total of 160 PCa patients with complete clinical data were included in our study. Twelve lncRNAs were identified to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in PCa patients using Cox regression analysis. A risk score formula was constructed to assess the prognostic value of the lncRNA signature in PCa. Patients with high risk score had worse OS than those with low risk score. The multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that the lncRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. Additionally, the signature might act as an indicator to predict treatment outcome. Functional enrichment analyses showed that the lncRNAs might involve in several molecular pathways closely related with PCa such as DNA replication, pancreatic cancer and regulation of tor signaling. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a lncRNA signature including 12 lncRNAs with the potential to be served as an independent prognostic biomarker of PCa. ?

"Risk of Cardiovascular Involvement in Patients with Primary Sj?gren’s Syndrome: a large-scale cross-sectional cohort study [Risk of Cardiovascular Involvement in Patients with Primary Sj?gren's Syndrome: a large-scale cross-sectional cohort study]",2019,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of cardiovascular involvement and analyze potential risk factors independently associated with cardiovascular involvement in primary Sj?gren's syndrome (PSS) patients. METHODS: We recruited a cohort of 367 PSS patients and 367 age- and gender-matched controls from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, and overt cardiovascular involvement events were recorded. Potential risk factors associated with cardiovascular involvement were determined by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: PSS patients had a significantly higher cardiovascular involvement rate than that of the controls (61.6% versus 29.7%; p<0.01). Compared with PSS patients without cardiovascular involvement, those with cardiovascular involvement were significantly older; had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipemia; were more likely to have extraglandular organ involvement; and had a higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (all p<0.05). In the multivariate analysis, age, hypertension, and extraglandular organ involvement were found to be risk factors independently correlated with cardiovascular events in PSS patients. CONCLUSIONS: PSS patients are more vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In addition to traditional CVD risk factors such as age and hypertension, extraglandular organ involvement was found to be independently associated with cardiovascular involvement in PSS patients, which suggests the need for early detection and prevention measures to improve the prognosis in those patients.","C reactive protein; adult; age; blood; cardiovascular disease; case control study; complication; diabetic angiopathy; female; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; hypoalbuminemia; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; prevalence; risk factor; Sjoegren syndrome; Adult; Age Factors; C-Reactive Protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Diabetic Angiopathies; Female; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Hypertension; Hypoalbuminemia; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sjogren's Syndrome"
"Peroxisomal regulation of redox homeostasis and adipocyte metabolism",2019,"Peroxisomes are ubiquitous cellular organelles required for specific pathways of fatty acid oxidation and lipid synthesis, and until recently their functions in adipocytes have not been well appreciated. Importantly, peroxisomes host many oxygen-consumption reactions and play a major role in generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), influencing whole cell redox status. Here, we review recent progress in peroxisomal functions in lipid metabolism as related to ROS/RNS metabolism and discuss the roles of peroxisomal redox homeostasis in adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism. We provide a framework for understanding redox regulation of peroxisomal functions in adipocytes together with testable hypotheses for developing therapies for obesity and the related metabolic diseases. ? 2019 The Authors","lipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; adipocyte; adipogenesis; cell differentiation; cell function; cell metabolism; diabetic obesity; human; insulin signaling; lipid metabolism; metabolic disorder; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; peroxisome; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; Review; signal transduction; white adipose tissue"
"T2 mapping of cartilage and menisci at 3T in healthy subjects with knee malalignment: initial experience",2019,"Purpose: To assess the relationship between knee alignment and T2 values of femorotibial cartilage and menisci in healthy subjects at 3?T. Materials and methods: Thirty-six healthy subjects divided into three subgroups of 12 neutral, 12 varus, and 12 valgus alignment of the femorotibial joint were investigated on 3-T MR scanner using a 2D multi-echo turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence for T2 mapping. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to determine any statistically significant differences in subregional T2 values of femorotibial cartilage and menisci among the three subgroups of healthy subjects. Results: Lateral femoral anterior cartilage subregion (52 ± 3 ms, mean ± standard deviation; 53 ± 2?ms) had significantly higher T2 values (p < 0.05) than medial femoral anterior cartilage subregion (51 ± 2?ms; 51 ± 2?ms) in varus and valgus groups, respectively. There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in T2 values of tibial central cartilage subregion between lateral and medical compartment among varus, valgus, and neutral subgroups. Lateral body segment of meniscus (41 ± 3?ms) had significantly higher (p < 0.05) T2 values than medial body segment (40 ± 2?ms) in the varus subgroup. Conclusions: Some degree of correlation between knee alignment and subregional T2 values of femorotibial cartilage and menisci exists in healthy subjects. These findings indicate that T2 mapping may be sensitive in assessing the load distribution pattern of human cartilage and menisci with knee alignment abnormality, which may be used as reference baseline when understanding the occurrence and progression of knee osteoarthritis. ? 2019, ISS.","adult; aged; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical assessment; contact angle; controlled study; disease course; female; human; knee meniscus; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; valgus knee; varus knee; weight bearing; articular cartilage; bone malformation; diagnostic imaging; knee; knee meniscus; normal human; procedures; Adult; Bone Malalignment; Cartilage, Articular; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Menisci, Tibial"
"Selenium Levels in Community Dwellers with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",2019,"Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient required by the human body and exerts biological functions through selenoproteins. The relationship between Se and diabetes remains ambiguous. This study aimed at, through measurements of serum selenoprotein P (SelP), glutathione peroxidase (GPx3), and Se content?in serum and hair, evaluating Se levels in community dwellers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 336 subjects, including 176 T2DM patients (65.5 ± 8.7?years old) and 160 healthy residents (63.7 ± 9.8?years old, as controls), were recruited in this cross-sectional community-based study performed in Suzhou. Samples of fasting venous blood and hair were collected for measurements of Se levels, glycometabolism, and biochemistry parameters. We found that the serum Se level and SelP concentration in T2DM patients were substantially higher than those in healthy residents (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in GPx3 activity and hair Se level between the two groups of subjects (p > 0.05). Serum Se was positively correlated with both GPx3 and hair Se in T2DM patients (r = 0.167 and 0.164, respectively, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with SelP in healthy controls (r = ? 0.293, p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study showed significantly higher levels of serum Se and SelP in community dwellers with T2DM than in matched healthy residents. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","glutathione peroxidase; selenium; selenoprotein P; glutathione peroxidase; selenium; selenoprotein P; aged; Article; community dwelling person; controlled study; cross-sectional study; fasting; female; hair level; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; protein blood level; selenium blood level; blood; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glutathione Peroxidase; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Selenium; Selenoprotein P"
"Circulating microRNA-23b as a new biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis",2019,"MicroRNA-23b (miR-23b) is associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases. This study evaluated miR-23b expression and assessed its potential as a biomarker of disease activity for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Differential expression of microRNAs was determined by miRNA microarray analysis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from four trauma patients as healthy controls (HCs) and eight RA patients. The microarray results showed elevated expression of miR-23b in FLSs from RA patients and this finding was corroborated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization using synovial tissues (STs). Furthermore, we found miR-23b levels in plasma of RA patients were significantly higher than in HCs, and plasma miR-23b levels positively correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), C-reactive protein (CRP), DAS28, and platelet (PLT) count (P < 0.05). MiR-23b levels in plasma inversely correlated with the levels of hemoglobin (Hb), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P < 0.05), but not with rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) (P > 0.05). Moreover, patients with anorexia showed higher levels of miR-23b in plasma than those without anorexia. Similar results were observed with fatigue. Appropriate treatment for RA not only ameliorated the disease condition but also reversed the elevated plasma miR-23b level remarkably. These results suggest that circulating miR-23b may be a promising biomarker for RA disease activity. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","bilirubin; biological marker; C reactive protein; cholesterol; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; hemoglobin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; microRNA; microRNA 23b; rheumatoid factor; unclassified drug; bilirubin; biological marker; C reactive protein; cholesterol; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; hemoglobin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; microRNA; MIRN23 microRNA, human; rheumatoid factor; adult; aged; anorexia; Article; bilirubin blood level; blood analysis; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; DAS28; disease activity; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; fatigue; female; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; hemoglobin blood level; human; in situ hybridization; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; platelet count; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; rheumatoid arthritis; RNA analysis; synoviocyte; synovium; upregulation; blood; chemistry; cytology; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; rheumatoid arthritis; Adult; Aged; Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Bilirubin; Biomarkers; Blood Sedimentation; C-Reactive Protein; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Platelet Count; Rheumatoid Factor; Synovial Membrane"
"Stem cell-derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction through a novel exosome/lncRNA MALAT1/NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway",2019,"Aging is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and there is no effective therapeutic approach to alleviate this condition. NF-κB and TNF-α have been implicated in the activation of the aging process, but the signaling molecules responsible for the inactivation of NF-κB and TNF-α remain unknown. Exosomes have been reported to improve heart functions by releasing miRNA. Recent studies suggest that lncRNAs are more tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific compared to miRNA. However, the role of lncRNA in exosome-mediated cardiac repair has not been explored. In the present study, we focused on metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), which is an lncRNA associated with cell senescence. We discovered that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell- (UMSC-) derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction. Silencer RNA against lncRNA MALAT1 blocked the beneficial effects of exosomes. In summary, we discovered that UMSC-derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction by releasing novel lncRNA MALAT1, which in turn inhibits the NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway. These findings will lead to the development of therapies that delay aging and progression of age-related diseases. Copyright ? 2019 Bao Zhu et al.

"Graphically encoded suspension array for multiplex immunoassay and quantification of autoimmune biomarkers in patient sera",2019,"In precision medicine, clinical decisions and pharmaceutical evaluations tends to be made upon parallel analysis of multiple protein biomarkers. Currently, the growing needs of high-throughput multiplex immunoassay is partially satisfied by spectrally encoded bead flow suspension arrays and other platforms, yet there is still room for progress in terms of encoding capacity, decoding accuracy, ease-of-manufacture/operation, and cost-effectiveness, for which graphical suspension arrays could make substantial contributions. Here we described a suspension array system made up of graphically encoded silica particles, an automated microplate imager and an in-house data processing program. The micro-fabricated, highly uniform planar particles provide a code space of 128-plex with further extendibility. The derived multiplex immunoassay reaches sub-picogram per milliliter sensitivity level (lowest LoD = 80 fg/ml) with wide dynamic range, as well as high precision and accuracy. The potential of clinical diagnostics was demonstrated by parallel measurement of three serum biomarkers for type 1 diabetes patients. Importantly, use of standard microplates as assay vessel extends its power to high-throughput applications, such as disease screening or drug discovery. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Diagnosis; Encoding (symbols); Immunology; Signal encoding; Silica; Throughput; Autoimmune diabetes; Clinical decision; Clinical diagnostics; Cytokines; Multiplex immunoassays; Parallel analysis; Suspension array; Wide dynamic range; Suspensions (fluids); biological marker; fibroblast growth factor 19; fibroblast growth factor 9; gamma interferon; interleukin 1beta; silicon dioxide; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin; biological marker; cytokine; immobilized antibody; signal peptide; adolescent; analytic method; Article; autoimmunity; automation; child; clinical article; computer graphics; controlled study; data processing; female; graphically recognizable array of suspension particle; human; immunoassay; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; multiplex immunoassay; sensitivity analysis; software; autoimmunity; blood; chemistry; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; genetic procedures; immunoassay; limit of detection; protein microarray; Antibodies, Immobilized; Autoimmunity; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; Cytokines; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Equipment Design; Humans; Immunoassay; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Limit of Detection; Protein Array Analysis"
"Characteristics and workload of pediatricians in China",2019,"OBJECTIVES: Although it is widely believed that China is facing a major shortage of pediatricians, the real situation of the current national status of pediatric human resources and their working conditions has not been evaluated to date. METHODS: We administered a survey to 54 214 hospitals from all 31 provinces in mainland China from 2015 to 2016. Hospital directors of all secondary and tertiary hospitals with pediatric services and a random sample (10%) of primary hospitals provided information on number of pediatricians and their educational levels, specialties, workloads, dropout rates, and other hospital characteristics. A data set of medical resources and socioeconomic information regarding each region (1997–2016) was constructed from the Chinese National Statistics Bureau. The Gini coefficient was used to describe the geographical distributions of pediatricians and hospitals. RESULTS: There were 135 524 pediatricians in China or ?4 pediatricians per 10 000 children. Pediatricians’ average educational level was low, with ?32% having only 3 years of junior college training after high school. The distribution of pediatricians was extremely skewed (Gini coefficient 0.61), and the imbalance of highly educated pediatricians was even more skewed (Gini coefficient 0.68). The dropout rate of pediatricians was 12.6%. Despite an increase in the Chinese government’s financial investment in health over the last decade, physicians have been burdened with a greater workload. CONCLUSIONS: Uneven development of the pediatric care system, inadequately trained pediatricians, low job satisfaction, and unmet demand for pediatric care are the major challenges facing China’s pediatric health care system.

"Micro-RNA 205-5p is involved in the progression of gastric cancer and targets phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells",2019,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the role of micro-RNA 205-5p (miR-205-5p) in the progression of gastric cancer, and the target of miR-205-5p in human gastric cancer cells in vitro. Material/Methods: Expression of miR-205-5p and PTEN in gastric cancer tissue samples and adjacent normal gastric tissue from 35 patients was studied using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells included a normal control (NC) group, a group transfected with empty vector (Vector), a group treated with miR-205-5p inhibitor (miR-inhibitor), and a group treated with miR-205-5p inhibitor and small interfering PTEN mRNA (miR-inhibitor+si-PTEN). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measured miR-205-5p expression, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, transwell and wound healing assays measured cell migration, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed ultrastructural changes in SGC-7901 cells. PTEN, AKT and p-AKT protein expression were measured using Western blot. The correlation between miR-205-5p and PTEN was analyzed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: Increased expression of miR-205-5p and PTEN in gastric cancer tissues were correlated with tumor stage. In SGC-7901 cells, miR-205-5p mRNA expression in the miR-inhibitor and miR-inhibitor+si-PTEN groups was significantly lower than that in the NC group (P<0.001). In the miR-inhibitor group, cell proliferation was significantly decreased, and apoptosis was significantly increased (P<0.001). Conclusions: In gastric cancer, increased expression of miR-205-5p was associated with tumor stage, and in SGC-7901 cells PTEN was a target gene for miR-205-5p. ?

"Physicochemical characterization and cytotoxicity of chitosan-modified single walled carbon nanotubes as drug carriers",2019,"The application of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as drug carriers is limited by their poor dispersal in aqueous medium. This study aimed to prepare chitosan (CS)-modified SWCNTs (CS-SWCNTs) and to evaluate their physicochemical properties and cytotoxicity. Oxidized SWCNTs (O-SWCNTs) were prepared with the use of strong acid, and the effects of acidizing conditions on the oxidation degree of the O-SWCNTs were investigated. CS was then non-covalently modified on the surfaces of O-SWCNTs. O-SWCNTs and CS-SWCNTs were characterized through ultraviolet spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The cytotoxic effects of the functionalized SWCNTs were determined through the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. O-SWCNTs with relatively complete structure were successfully synthesized through 5?h of treatment with 5?M acid. The amine group of the CS and the carboxyl group of O-SWCNTs interacted in CS-SWCNTs. The functionalized SWCNTs did not aggregate or precipitate in water and exerted no cytotoxic effects on A549 and MCF-7 tumor cells. The CS-SWCNTs possess the advantages of a simple preparation process, excellent water dispersibility, and biocompatibility for drug loading. ? 2018, The Korean Society of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology.","carbon nanotube; carboxyl group; chitosan; drug carrier; single walled nanotube; Article; biocompatibility; cell viability; cytotoxicity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; human; human cell; MCF-7 cell line; MTT assay; non small cell lung cancer; physical chemistry; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; reaction temperature; transmission electron microscopy; tumor cell; ultraviolet spectroscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray diffraction"
"Fatty acid 2-hydroxylation inhibits tumor growth and increases sensitivity to cisplatin in gastric cancer",2019,"Background: Most gastric cancers are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage with poor prognosis and survival rate. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) with high expression in stomach generates chiral (R)-2-hydroxy FAs ((R)-2-OHFAs) and regulates glucose utilization which is important for cell proliferation and invasiveness. We hypothesized that FA2H impacts gastric tumor growth and could represent a novel target to improve gastric cancer therapy. Methods: FA2H level in 117 human gastric tumors and its association with tumor growth, metastasis and overall survival were examined. Its roles and potential mechanisms in regulating tumor growth were studied by genetic and pharmacological manipulation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Findings: FA2H level was lower in gastric tumor tissues as compared to surrounding tissues and associated with clinicopathologic status of patients, which were confirmed by analyses of multiple published datasets. FA2H depletion decreased tumor chemosensitivity, partially due to inhibition of AMPK and activation of the mTOR/S6K1/Gli1 pathway. Conversely, FA2H overexpression or treatment with (R)-2-OHFAs had the opposite effects. In line with these in vitro observations, FA2H knockdown promoted tumor growth with increased level of tumor Gli1 in vivo. Moreover, (R)-2-OHFA treatment significantly decreased Gli1 level in gastric tumors and enhanced tumor chemosensitivity to cisplatin, while alleviating the chemotherapy-induced weight loss in mice. Interpretation: Our results demonstrate that FA2H plays an important role in regulating Hh signaling and gastric tumor growth and suggest that (R)-2-OHFAs could be effective as nontoxic wide-spectrum drugs to promote chemosensitivity.

"Nitroxoline induces cell apoptosis by inducing MDM2 degradation in small-cell lung cancer",2019,"The proto-oncogene MDM2 is a nuclear-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes tumor formation by targeting tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, for proteasomal degradation. In this study, the anti-infective drug nitroxoline (NXQ) was screened out to effectively inhibit cell survival of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, and induce SCLC cell apoptosis by suppressing antiapoptotic proteins (such as Bcl-2 and MCL1) and upregulating proapoptotic protein Bim. In the mechanistic study, NXQ was found to downregulate MDM2 expression by inducing its proteasomal degradation, and thus upregulated p53 expression, which was a substrate protein of MDM2. Moreover, overexpression of MDM2 decreased the cytotoxicity of NXQ on SCLC cells. These results demonstrated that NXQ displayed anti-SCLC activity by suppressing MDM2 expression, which suggested that anti-infective NXQ had potential for SCLC treatment by targeting the MDM2/p53 axis. ? 2019 The Authors.

"The Unique Spatial-Temporal Treatment Failure Patterns of Adjuvant Gefitinib Therapy: A Post Hoc Analysis of the ADJUVANT Trial (CTONG 1104)",2019,"Introduction: Adjuvant gefitinib therapy prolonged disease-free survival in patients with resected early-stage EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC in the ADJUVANT study (CTONG 1104). However, treatment failure patterns after gefitinib therapy are less well characterized. Methods: Overall, 222 stage N1–N2, EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients received gefitinib or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (VP) treatment. Tumor recurrences or metastases occurring during follow-up were defined as treatment failure; sites and data of first treatment failure were recorded. A post hoc analysis of treatment failure patterns which was estimated by Kaplan-Meier and hazard rate curves in modified intention-to-treat patients was conducted. Results: There were 114 recurrences and 10 deaths before recurrence across 124 progression events. Spatial distribution analysis showed that the first metastasis site was most frequently the central nervous system in the gefitinib group (29 of 106 [27.4%]), extracranial metastases were most frequent in the VP group (32 of 87 [36.8%]). Temporal distribution analysis showed lower tumor recurrence with gefitinib than with VP 0 to 21 months post-surgery. However, recurrence with gefitinib showed a constant rate of increase 12 months post-surgery. The first peak of extracranial metastasis appeared during 9 to 15 months with VP and 24 to 30 months with gefitinib. The highest peak for central nervous system metastases post-surgery occurred after 12 to 18 months with VP and 24 to 36 months with gefitinib. Conclusions: Adjuvant gefitinib showed advantages over VP chemotherapy in treatment failure patterns especially in extracranial metastasis. Adjuvant tyrosine kinas inhibitors may be considered as a treatment option in resected stage N1–N2 EGFR-mutant NSCLC but longer duration should be explored. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","cisplatin; gefitinib; vasculotropin receptor; vinorelbine tartrate; adjuvant chemotherapy; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; disease free survival; EGFR gene; gene mutation; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; non small cell lung cancer; oncogene; priority journal; tumor recurrence"
"TLR9 agonist enhances radiofrequency ablation-induced CTL responses, leading to the potent inhibition of primary tumor growth and lung metastasis",2019,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most common approach to thermal ablation for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, its efficacy is limited by incomplete ablation, and further optimization of RFA is required. Here, we demonstrate that incubation at 65 °C triggers more EG7 tumor cell death by necrosis than treatment at 45 °C, and the 65 °C-treated cells are more effective at inducing antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses after injection in mice than the 45 °C-treated ones. Dendritic cells (DCs) that phagocytose 65 °C-treated EG7 cells become mature with upregulated MHCII and CD80 expression and are capable of efficiently inducing effector CTLs in mouse tumor models. RFA (65 °C) therapy of EG7 tumors induces large areas of tumor necrosis and stimulates CTL responses. This leads to complete regression of small (~100 mm3) tumors but fails to suppress the growth of larger (~350 mm3) tumors. The administration of the Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) agonist unmethylated cytosine-phosphorothioate-guanine oligonucleotide (CpG) to DCs phagocytosing 65 °C-treated EG7 cells enhances the expression of MHCII and CD40 on DCs as well as DC-induced stimulation of CTL responses. Importantly, the intratumoral administration of CpG following RFA also increases the frequencies of tumor-associated immunogenic CD11b?CD11c+CD103+ DC2 and CD11b+F4/80+MHCII+ M1 macrophages and increases CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration, leading to enhanced CD4+ T cell-dependent CTL responses and potent inhibition of primary RFA-treated or distant untreated tumor growth as well as tumor lung metastasis in mice bearing larger tumors. Overall, our data indicate that CpG administration, which enhances RFA-induced CTL responses and ultimately potentiates the inhibition of primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, is a promising strategy for improving RFA treatment, which may assist in optimizing this important cancer therapy. ? 2018, The Chinese Society of Immunology and The University of Science and Technology of China, All rights reserved.","B7 antigen; CD103 antigen; CD11b antigen; CD40 antigen; glycoprotein p 15095; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; oligonucleotide; toll like receptor 9; toll like receptor agonist; unclassified drug; unmethylated cytosine phosphorothioate guanine oligonucleotide; adjuvant therapy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen expression; antigen specificity; Article; cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; cancer model; cancer size; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell death; cell maturation; cellular immunity; controlled study; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; dendritic cell; effector cell; EG7 cell; female; incubation temperature; lung metastasis; lymphocytic infiltration; macrophage; metastasis inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; phagocytosis; primary tumor; radiofrequency ablation; T lymphocyte activation; tumor necrosis; tumor volume; upregulation"
"Light-Triggered Covalent Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles for Photothermal Cancer Therapy",2019,"Manipulating the cross-coupling of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to maximize the photothermal effect is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Here, by taking advantage of the well-known tetrazole/alkene photoclick chemistry, we have demonstrated for the first time that small AuNPs (23 nm) decorated with both 2,5-diphenyltetrazole and methacrylic acid on their surfaces can form covalently crosslinked aggregates upon laser irradiation (λ=405 nm). In vitro studies indicated that the light-triggered assembling shifted the surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs significantly to near-infrared (NIR) regions, which as a consequence effectively enhanced the efficacy of photothermal therapy for 4T1 breast cancer cells. We thus believe that this new light-triggered cross-coupling approach might offer a valuable tool for cancer treatment. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate stimulates autophagy and reduces apoptosis levels in retinal M?ller cells under high-glucose conditions",2019,"Retinal neurodegeneration is an early feature in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic process involved in protein and organelle degradation that has been linked in DR. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol in green tea that has beneficial effects in diabetic. however, it is not currently known whether EGCG can regulate M?ller cell autophagy. Here, we showed that EGCG increased autophagy by promoting the formation of autophagosomes, increasing lysosomal acidification, and stimulating autophagic flux in M?ller cells, while high glucose (HG) induced a decrease in autophagy and an increase in apoptosis. However, retinal M?ller cells in HG treated with EGCG showed autophagy machinery activation and reestablishment of cargo degradation, protecting the cells from apoptosis. EGCG could increase the ability of cells to proliferate by increasing autophagy. In an experimental model of diabetic retinopathy, EGCG reduced the reactive gliosis of M?ller cells and decreased retinal damage. These results highlight that HG downregulates autophagy and accumulates P62 cargo due to lysosomal dysfunction and then increases apoptosis, which was reversed by treatment with EGCG. This finding might be valuable for developing a novel therapeutic strategy to treat DR. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","beclin 1; caspase 3; epigallocatechin gallate; glucose; microtubule associated protein 1; microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 i; microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 ii; sequestosome 1; unclassified drug; acidification; animal cell; antiapoptotic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; cell pH; cell protection; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; drug mechanism; gliosis; in vitro study; lysosome; Mueller cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; rat"
"Salinomycin reduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition-mediated multidrug resistance by modifying long noncoding RNA HOTTIP expression in gastric cancer cells",2019,"Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) has become a major obstacle in chemotherapy in many tumors, including gastric cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is considered an important process in cancer development, also contributes toward tumor MDR. Salinomycin, an EMT blocker, shows broad-spectrum antitumor and chemosensitization properties. Here, we hypothesized that salinomycin could reverse the MDR of SGC7901/cisplatin (CDDP) gastric cancer cell by inhibiting EMT and further explored its possible underlying mechanisms. Our results indicated higher 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) and stronger migration capacity in SGC7901/CDDP than in SGC7901 cells, whereas salinomycin could reduce the IC50 (50% inhibition of the concentration of chemodrugs after 4 μmol/l salinomycin treatment) and migration capacity in SGC7901/CDDP cells. At the molecular level, we found that the expression of E-cadherin, ZO-1 decreased, whereas the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB-1, and Twist increased in SGC7901/CDDP cells, and that salinomycin potently blocked the EMT by enhancing the expression of E-cadherin, ZO-1 and reducing the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB-1, and Twist in the above MDR cells. In addition, we also found that long noncoding RNA HOTTIP, an oncogenic regulator, was upregulated in SGC7901/CDDP cells, whereas its downregulation could markedly attenuate the EMT, thereby reversing the MDR. Furthermore, our data showed that the salinomycin-elicited MDR-reversion effect was associated closely with suppression of EMT through inhibition of the expression of long noncoding RNA HOTTIP. Collectively, our findings suggest a new underlying mechanism and applicable therapeutic regimen for MDR gastric cancer. Copyright ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Comparison of surgical outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus laparoscopic and open resections: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Robot-assisted distal pancreatectomy (RADP) has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) for pancreatic resections. A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China Biology Medicine databases up to December 2016 for studies that compared the surgical outcomes of RADP vs. LDP or ODP for pancreatic resections. The weighted mean differences, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and the data were combined using the random-effects model. The GRADE system was used to interpret the primary outcomes of this meta-analysis. A total of seventeen non-randomized observational clinical studies involving 2133 patients satisfied the eligibility criteria. Compared with LDP, RADP was associated with a longer operative time (P = 0.018), a shorter hospital length of stay (P = 0.030), and a higher rate of spleen preservation (P = 0.022). Moreover, RADP was associated with a shorter hospital LOS (P = 0.014) and a lower total complication rate (P = 0.034) than ODP. We found no statistically significant differences between the techniques in the mean estimated blood loss, severe complication rate, incidence of total pancreatic fistulas or incidence of severe pancreatic fistulas. The overall quality of evidence was poor for all outcomes. This meta-analysis indicates that RADP may be safe and comparable in terms of surgical results to LDP and ODP. Further RCTs are needed to confirm the outcomes of this meta-analysis. ? 2018","bibliographic database; comparative study; confidence interval; conservative treatment; human; incidence; laparoscopy; length of stay; meta analysis; odds ratio; operation duration; operative blood loss; pancreas fistula; pancreatectomy; patient safety; postoperative complication; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; spleen; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Blood Loss, Surgical; Confidence Intervals; Databases, Bibliographic; Humans; Incidence; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Odds Ratio; Operative Time; Organ Sparing Treatments; Pancreatectomy; Pancreatic Fistula; Patient Safety; Postoperative Complications; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Spleen; Treatment Outcome"
"Construction of nanomaterials with targeting phototherapy properties to inhibit resistant bacteria and biofilm infections",2019,"The spread of resistant bacteria and the development bacterial biofilm have been two major challenges in the application of biomaterials, causing device failure as well as tissue infections. The overuse of antibiotics has become a common cause of the emergence of multiple antibiotics-resistant bacteria. Besides, biofilm infections are notoriously difficult to treat, as the biofilm matrix provides physical protection from antibiotic treatment. Recently, nanomaterials with high drug loading capacity, various types of stimuli responsiveness, smart targeting and small-size are able to increase local drug concentration and to escape the capture of macrophages. Especially, the loading of drugs to the nanomaterials enhances chances for macrophage capture which is a serious problem related to interaction with immune system. Phototherapy including photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy has attracted wide attentions in treating infectious diseases as the development of drug-resistant bacteria and bacterial biofilms. In addition, based on the special microenvironment of bacterial infections, various construction and modification methods of nanomaterials showed high efficient antibacterial properties. This review describes the latest advances in the phototherapy strategies to resist resistant bacteria and biofilms related infections. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biofilms; Disease control; Macrophages; Nanostructured materials; Photodynamic therapy; Antibacterial properties; Bacterial biofilm; Bacterial infections; Drug-resistant bacteria; Modification methods; Photothermal therapy; Stimuli responsiveness; Targeting; Drug therapy"
"Recent Advances in Anti-cancer Protein/Peptide Delivery",2019,"Protein/peptide drugs possess unique advantages, such as high pharmacological potency, molecular specificity, multifunctionality, and low toxicity, and thus hold great potential for use in cancer therapy. In the past decades, great achievements have been made in protein delivery systems, which can protect cargo proteins against detrimental physiological environments and efficiently deliver proteins into tumor sites and cells. In this Review, we first summarize the existing protein/peptide drugs used for cancer treatment, illustrate their anti-tumor mechanisms, and point out the potential challenges/barriers against their medical utility. We then discuss the existing strategies for protein encapsulation/conjugation and survey recent advances in the development of protein delivery vehicles, including lipid-based membrane nanocarriers, polymeric carriers, metal-organic frameworks, inorganic carriers, protein/peptide-based nanocarriers, and DNA nanostructures. The design strategies, advantages in potentiating protein delivery efficiencies, and possible limitations of these delivery systems are also discussed. Finally, future opportunities and challenges in anti-cancer protein/peptide delivery are indicated. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","antibody; antineoplastic agent; carbon nanotube; cytokine; gold nanoparticle; graphene oxide; lipid; liposome; magnetic nanoparticle; mesoporous silica nanoparticle; metal organic framework; molecular scaffold; nanocarrier; nanocoating; nanomaterial; nanosheet; peptide; protein; tumor antigen; antineoplastic agent; drug carrier; peptide; protein; apoptosis; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; cell membrane; conjugation; drug delivery system; encapsulation; exosome; human; hydrogel; liposomal delivery; malignant neoplasm; micelle; nanopharmaceutics; nonhuman; polymerization; protein modification; Review; animal; chemistry; drug delivery system; neoplasm; procedures; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Neoplasms; Peptides; Proteins"
"Inhibition of DYRK1A-EGFR axis by p53-MDM2 cascade mediates the induction of cellular senescence",2019,"Activation of p53 may induce apoptosis or cellular senescence in stressed cells. We here report that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is downregulated by p53 activation in a subset of cancer cell lines, and this EGFR downregulation mediates cellular senescence caused by p53 activation. EGFR confers resistance to senescence by sustaining the ERK signaling. DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A), an EGFR-stabilizing kinase, is downregulated by p53 and, when ectopically expressed, can attenuate p53 activation-induced EGFR reduction and cellular senescence. We further showed that the increased degradation of DYRK1A caused by p53 activation was mediated by MDM2. MDM2 was found to physically interact with and ubiquitinate DYRK1A, ultimately leading to its proteosomal degradation. Importantly, administration of Nutlin-3a, which disrupts the binding of MDM2 to p53, but not that of MDM2 to DYRK1A, reduced the levels of DYRK1A and EGFR, induced senescence, and inhibited growth of tumor xenografts formed by U87 glioblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of EGFR in tumor xenografts attenuated senescence and tumor reduction caused by Nultin-3a. Our findings thus established a novel link between p53 and EGFR and may have implications in p53 activation-based therapies. ? 2019, The Author(s).","dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylated and tyrosine regulated kinase 1a; epidermal growth factor receptor; nultin 3a; peptides and proteins; phosphotransferase; protein MDM2; protein p53; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell aging; down regulation; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein protein interaction; tumor xenograft; U87 cell line; ubiquitination"
"Intratumoral delivery of M-CSF by calcium crosslinked polymer micelles enhances cancer immunotherapy",2019,"Immunotherapy has shown promising results in multiple malignancies. However, there are still significant challenges in cancer immunotherapy including the powerful immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and adverse off-target side effects. Nanomaterials with defined physico-biochemical properties are versatile drug delivery platforms that may address these key technical challenges faced by cancer immunotherapy. Here, a tumor acidity-responsive biomacromolecule delivery system was designed to intratumorally deliver an immune-activating cytokine, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and attenuate the acidic microenvironment. This nanoparticle was prepared by introducing CaCO3 as a crosslinker to form an M-CSF-loaded stable micelle (NP/M-CSF/CaCO3). Administration of NP/M-CSF/CaCO3 significantly inhibited tumor growth by enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and reversing the TAM-mediated immunosuppression. This study provides new avenues for cascade amplification of the antitumor effects by targeting the tumor microenvironment. This approach may also help avoid unwanted complications. ?

"Endovascular thrombectomy can be beneficial to acute ischemic stroke patients with large infarcts",2019,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess whether patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and large infarct lesions benefit from reperfusion management. To determine the efficacy of different recanalization managements on AIS patients with Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) < 6, the authors retrospectively analyzed hospitalized patients with AIS. METHODS Eighty-nine patients with AIS and ASPECTS < 6 were screened from 13,285 hospitalized patients treated by thrombolysis, thrombectomy, or conventional care in two stroke medical centers. Logistic regression or Fisher’s exact test was performed for comparison of the outcome and risk events between patients treated by thrombectomy (or thrombolysis) and conventional care. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was used to assess the major clinical outcome of patients 3 months after disease onset. Disease outcome was also examined by analyzing symptom improvement at discharge. In particular, mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) were evaluated as risk factors. RESULTS This study included 21 patients who received thrombolysis, 36 patients receiving thrombectomy, and 32 patients receiving conventional treatment. Among these 3 treatments, only the thrombectomy group clearly showed the most encouraging clinical outcome (mRS score 0–2; p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test) and marked improvement (OR 25.84, 95% CI 2.44–273.59) compared with conventional treatment. It is noteworthy that the mortality rate of the thrombectomy and thrombolysis group was similar to that of the conventional group, and thrombectomy and thrombolysis increased the risk of sICH in comparison with conventional care (p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). CONCLUSIONS Patients with AIS and ASPECTS < 6 definitely benefited from thrombectomy with higher sICH risk, whereas thrombolysis management showed similar efficacy to the control group. ?

"A multicenter, prospective evaluation of the Chinese Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Scoring System for disseminated intravascular coagulation",2019,"Introduction: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe complication of critical conditions. There are several scoring systems used for the diagnosis of DIC, including the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) Overt-DIC criteria, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) criteria and the Chinese Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis scoring system for DIC (CDSS). The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy and predictive value of the CDSS. Materials and methods: 1318 patients, aged 18–70 years old and suspected of DIC were enrolled from 18 hospitals across China. Participants were divided into two groups for analysis (group 1, non-hematological diseases; group 2, hematological diseases). 242 patients were excluded because of incomplete data collection and failure to follow-up. Results and conclusions: The rates of concordance of diagnosis of DIC between the CDSS and two other scoring systems were close to 80%. The area under ROC curves of CDSS had a slight advantage when using the ISTH, JMHW criteria or prognosis as gold standard, respectively. The CDSS DIC was an independent predictor of mortality, and its odds-ratio was superior or comparable to that of the ISTH and JMHW criteria in the two groups. The CDSS DIC score also had a significant correlation with the APACHE II and SOFA score (p < 0.05). In summary, as a quantification standard of the Chinese experts’ consensus, the CDSS is conducive to the standardized diagnosis of DIC because of its favorable diagnostic and prognostic utility. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; APACHE; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; disseminated intravascular clotting; female; follow up; gold standard; human; informed consent; limit of quantitation; major clinical study; male; mortality; practice guideline; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; scoring system; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; standardization; blood; China; clinical trial; disseminated intravascular clotting; hemostasis; medical society; middle aged; multicenter study; odds ratio; Adult; APACHE; China; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Female; Hemostasis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Societies, Medical"
"Long noncoding RNA FGD5-AS1 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through upregulating CDCA7 via sponging miR-302e",2019,"The biologic function as well as the mechanism of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) still remain largely unknown. Long noncoding RNA FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) has been reported to have a promotive effect on other human cancers, but its function in CRC still remains unknown. The expression levels of long noncoding RNA FGD5-AS1, CDCA7 mRNA, and miR-302e were assessed by RT-qPCR. The protein levels of CDCA7 were assessed by Western blot. The function of FGD5-AS1 was detected using cell viability assay, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, transwell, and caspase-3 activity assay. Additionally, the microRNAs (miRNAs) sponge potential of FGD5-AS1 was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation assay, RNA pull-down assay, and luciferase reporter assay. FGD5-AS1 was increased in colorectal cancer cell lines compared to normal cell lines. Inhibition of FGD5-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and accelerated cell apoptosis in CRC. FGD5-AS1 competitively bound with miR-302e to modulate CDCA7. The inhibiting effects of FGD5-AS1 knockdown on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the promoting effects on CRC cell apoptosis could be revived by miR-302e suppression or CDCA7 upregulation. LncRNA FGD5-AS1 could promote CRC progression through sponging miR-302e and upregulating CDCA7. FGD5-AS1 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC. ? 2019, The Society for In Vitro Biology.","CDCA7 protein, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN302A microRNA, human; nuclear protein; apoptosis; binding competition; cell motion; cell proliferation; colorectal tumor; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; upregulation; Apoptosis; Base Sequence; Binding, Competitive; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Nuclear Proteins; RNA, Long Noncoding; Up-Regulation"
"The role of miRNAs in the invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer",2019,"Cervical cancer (CC) with early metastasis of the primary tumor results in poor prognosis and poor therapeutic outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that play a substantial role in regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally and influence the development and progression of tumors. Numerous studies have discovered that miRNAs play significant roles in the invasion and metastasis of CC by affecting specific pathways, including Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways. miRNAs also effectively modulate the process of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Many studies provide new insights into the role of miRNAs and the pathogenesis of metastatic CC. In this review, we will offer an overview and update of our present understanding of the potential roles of miRNAs in metastatic CC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","autophagy related protein 7; mammalian target of rapamycin; matrix metalloproteinase; microRNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3; vasculotropin; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene overexpression; genetic association; human; metastasis; molecular pathology; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; overall survival; progression free survival; protein targeting; Review; tumor invasion; tumor volume; uterine cervix cancer; Wart virus"
"A multicenter retrospective study of endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection for large lesser gastric curvature superficial neoplasms",2019,"Background and aim: Endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection (ESTD) has been used for dissection of esophageal and gastric lesions. However, outcomes of ESTD for large lesions in the lesser gastric curvature had not been acknowledged because previous reports had the limitations of being single-center studies. We aimed to clarify the outcomes of ESTD for large lesser gastric curvature superficial neoplasms and provide our experience to accelerate its application. Methods: Between July 2014 and July 2016, 87 patients with early cancer in the lesser gastric curvature treated at six Chinese institutions were enrolled. Our primary outcome was dissection speed. Moreover, both efficacy and safety clinical data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results: All of the 87 patients were found to successfully undergo ESTD or ESD. Of these, 32 underwent ESTD and 55 underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The ESTD group had a higher dissection speed (18.0?mm 2 /min vs. 7.8?mm 2 /min, p &lt; 0.01) and was associated with higher en bloc resection rate (100% vs. 87.3%, p = 0.035) and curative resection rate (100% vs. 85.5%, p = 0.024) compared with the ESD group. No perforation or muscular injury occurred in the ESTD group and its intraprocedural bleeding rate was lower (59.4% vs. 100%, p &lt; 0.01) than that of the ESD group. Conclusions: In this multicenter retrospective study, outcomes of ESTD were excellent with a higher dissection speed and radical curative rate compared with ESD. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; bleeding; cancer surgery; clinical study; controlled study; early cancer; endoscopic submucosal dissection; endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection; female; follow up; gastric curvature superficial neoplasm; gastroscopy; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; muscle injury; priority journal; radiofrequency ablation; retrospective study; stomach cancer"
"Construction of immune-related risk signature for renal papillary cell carcinoma",2019,"The kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) is a relatively rare type of kidney cancer. There has been no investigation to find a robust signature to predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients in the aspect of tumor immunology. In this study, 285 KIRP samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were randomly divided into training and testing set. A total of 1534 immune-related genes from The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) were used as candidates to construct the signature. Using univariate Cox analysis, we evaluated the relationship between overall survival and immune-related genes expression and found 272 immune-related genes with predicting prognostic ability. In order to construct an efficient predictive model, the Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic-net penalty was used and identified 23 groups after 1000 iterations. As a result, 15-genes model showing more stable than other gene groups was chosen to construct our immune-related risk signature. In line with our expectations, the signature can independently predict the survival outcome of KIRP patients. Patients with high-immune risk were found correlated with advanced stage. We also found that the high-immune risk patients with higher PBRM1 and SETD2 mutations, increasing chromosomal instability, together with the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results showing intensive connection of our signature with immune pathways. In conclusion, our study constructs a robust 15-gene signature for predicting KIRP patients’ survival outcome on the basis of tumor immune environment and may provide possible relationship between prognosis and immune-related biological function. ? 2018 The Authors.

"TRAF6 neddylation drives inflammatory arthritis by increasing NF-κB activation",2019,"Neddylation is a process similar to ubiquitination, and is critical in various inflammatory diseases; however, its importance in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of neddylation in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and its clinical relevance. We showed that neddylation-related genes, including NEDD8 and CULLIN-1, were significantly upregulated in inflamed arthritic synovia. Functionally, neddylation activation was crucial for synovitis of CIA, as the inhibition of neddylation by MLN4924 significantly suppressed synovial cell proliferation and inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, neddylation mediated inflammatory arthritis by regulating NF-κB activation in fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSs). Furthermore, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) neddylation at Lys124 was essential for IL-17A-induced NF-κB activation. Replacing the Lys-124 residue with Arg (K124R) resulted in significantly impaired conjugation of NEDD8 to TRAF6, as well as markedly attenuated IL-17A-induced NF-κB activity. Therefore, the pathogenic role of neddylation in CIA as well as its mechanism of action demonstrated here provides a new insight into understanding the role of post-transcriptional modifications in the arthritis inflammatory response. ? 2019, The Author(s).","arginine; collagen type 2; cullin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 17; NEDD8 protein; pevonedistat; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; NEDD8 protein; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell proliferation; clinical article; collagen-induced arthritis; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; fibroblast; human; human tissue; immune response; innate immunity; intracellular signaling; male; mouse; neddylation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein processing; synovial fluid; synoviocyte; synovitis; upregulation; animal; arthritis; cell culture; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; physiology; Animals; Arthritis; Cells, Cultured; Fibroblasts; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; NEDD8 Protein; NF-kappa B; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6"
"Overexpression of GBP1 predicts poor prognosis and promotes tumor growth in human glioblastoma multiforme",2019,"OBJECTIVE: Guanylate binding protein-1 (GBP1) is highly associated with cell proliferation, and can modulate growth and invasiveness of gliomas. The relationship between GBP1 expression and the prognosis of glioma patients is further evaluated for the purpose of investigating whether GBP1 can serve as an predictor for evaluating prognosis of glioma patients. METHODS: GBP1 expression in 528 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were investigated, then 103 surgical specimens from glioma patients in our center were further evaluated. The effect of GBP1 on proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells in vitro was analyzed, and the effects of GBP1 on sensitivity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy on glioma cells in vitro were also analyzed. GBP1 associated signaling pathways were identified with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Besides, the effect of GBP1 expression on proliferation of glioma cells in vivo was analyzed. RESULTS: In both TCGA database and our clinical data, GBM tissues exhibited increased mRNA expression of GBP1 gene, its expression level was co-related to PETN deletion and EGFR amplification, and was associated with prognosis of GBM patients. GBP1 overexpression can enhance migration and invasion ability of tumor cells in vitro, and in vivo studies showed that GBP1 can promote tumor proliferation, decrease survival in tumor-bearing mice. GSEA analysis predicted that GBP1 may play its biological roles via toll-like receptor pathway. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights and evidences that high level expression of GBP1 is significantly correlated with progression and prognosis in GBMs. Furthermore, transfection of GBP1 revealed its regulation on migration and invasiveness of glioma cells, decreasing sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agent, shortening survival of tumor-bearing animals. These data demonstrate that GBP1 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for gliomas. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Designing a nanoparticle-containing polymeric substrate for detecting cancer cells by computer simulations",2019,"Efficient and accurate detection of cancer cells (from normal cells) is of great importance in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this work, we design a new type of polymeric substrate containing nanoparticles for detecting cancers by the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation. It is found that the cancer cells and the normal cells can be indeed distinguished since the uptake number of nanoparticles from the substrate is different. The competition between the nanoparticle-cell specific interaction and nanoparticle-polymer non-specific interaction is the main factor for different uptake behaviors. Moreover, the dynamics of the nanoparticle diffusion in the polymer layer also plays an important role in the detection. To improve the detection accuracy, we further investigate the effect of the polymer type and density as well as the ligand type on the detection, and find that there may exist an optimal parameter to maximize the difference between cancer cells and normal cells. The present study may provide useful insights into the design of functionalized substrate-based nanodevices in biomedicine. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Cytology; Diseases; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Polymers; Cancer diagnosis; Detection accuracy; Dissipative particle dynamics; Functionalized substrates; Non-specific interactions; Optimal parameter; Polymeric substrate; Specific interaction; Cells; ligand; nanoparticle; polymer; cell membrane; chemistry; computer simulation; diffusion; human; metabolism; molecular model; neoplasm; pathology; software; transport at the cellular level; Biological Transport; Cell Membrane; Computer Simulation; Diffusion; Humans; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Polymers; Software"
"MiR-150 promotes angiogensis and proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells in deep venous thrombosis by targeting SRCIN1",2019,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the third most common cardiovascular disease. miR-150 is one of important microRNAs which play critical role in various cellular function such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In this study, we investigate the effect of miR-150 on EPCs function ex vivo and thrombus resolution in vivo. We determined miR-150 expression in EPCs isolated from DVT patients and control subjects by RT-PCR. Potential target of miR-150 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter respectively. The angiogenesis and proliferation were tested by MTT and tube formation assay. A murine model of venous thrombosis was developed as in vivo model. Finally, the effect of miR-150 on EPCs with inferior venous thrombosis were evaluated in vivo. Our data showed that miR-150 was downregulated in EPCs from DVT patients. By using miR-150 agomir and antagomir, we found that miR-150 promoted angiogenesis and proliferation of EPCs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed SRCIN1 as a target of miR-150 and SRCIN1 knockdown inhibited function of EPCs. Forced expression of miR-150 contributed thrombus resolution in a murine model of venous thrombosis. In general, miR-150 was downregulated in EPCs from DVT. Upregulation of miR-150 promoted angiogenesis and proliferation of EPCs by targeting SRCIN1 in vitro and thrombus resolution in vivo. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","antagomir; microRNA; microRNA 150; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIRN150 microRNA, human; MIRN150 microRNA, rat; SNIP protein, human; vesicular transport adaptor protein; adult; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell function; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; down regulation; endothelial progenitor cell; ex vivo study; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene knockdown; gene targeting; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; SRCIN1 gene; upregulation; adolescent; animal; case control study; cell culture; disease model; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; vein thrombosis; young adult; Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Case-Control Studies; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Endothelial Progenitor Cells; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; Venous Thrombosis; Young Adult"
"Facile preparation of reduction-responsive micelles based on biodegradable amphiphilic polyurethane with disulfide bonds in the backbone",2019,"In this paper, we synthesized a biodegradable amphiphilic polymer of polyurethanepolyethylene glycol with disulfide bonds in the main chain (PEG-PU(SS)-PEG). DLS and SEM showed that the polymer could self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution and could be used to load the hydrophobic anticancer drug DOX. Intriguingly, drug release in vitro indicated that DOX-loaded PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles had good stability under the extracellular physiological environment, but the disulfide bonds broke rapidly and DOX was released quickly under the intracellular reducing conditions. CCK-8 assays showed that DOX-loaded PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles had a high in vitro antitumor activity in C6 cells, whereas blank PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles were nontoxic to C6 cells. It was also found that there was strong and persistent accumulation of DOX-loaded PEG-PU(SS)-PEG as compared with PEG-PU-PEG both by the cell internalization tests and the flow cytometry measurements. Hence, PEG-PU(SS)-PEG micelles will have a potential use for clinical treatment of cancer in the future. ? 2019 by the authors.","Biodegradable polymers; Controlled drug delivery; Covalent bonds; Drug products; Polyurethanes; Reduction; Sulfur compounds; Targeted drug delivery; Amphiphilic polymers; Anticancer drug; Cell internalization; Clinical treatments; Facile preparation; Physiological environment; Reducing conditions; Triggered release; Micelles"
"Overexpression of HHLA2 in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma is significantly associated with poor survival of the patients",2019,"Background: It is well known that human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly immunogenic and chemo-resistant tumor. Recently, emerging data suggest that the immune checkpoint blockade therapy is an important breakthrough in the treatment against ccRCC. HHLA2, a recently reported member of B7 family, is uniquely expressed in humans but not in mice, and it plays an important role in the functional inhibition of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Herein, we aimed to study the clinical implications of HHLA2 expression in human ccRCC and its potential regulatory role in the biological functions of the cancer cells. Methods: In the present study, we examined HHLA2 expression in human ccRCC tissues and analyzed the clinical implications as well as prognostic value. The intervention of HHLA2 in human ccRCC cell lines ACHN and 786-O was performed and its effect on the cellular function of the cells was also analyzed. We also identified the differentially expressed genes upon HHLA2 knockdown in ccRCC cell lines by using gene microarray analysis. Results: We found that higher HHLA2 mRNA expression level in human ccRCC tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues based on TCGA data, and the HHLA2 expression at mRNA level was positively and significantly correlated with PD-L1, PD-L2, B7-H6, but negatively and significantly correlated with B7-H3. Moreover, our immunohistochemistry study showed that the staining intensity of HHLA2 in human ccRCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the adjacent normal tissues, and the overall survival rate of ccRCC patients with higher HHLA2 expression was significantly poorer than that of the patients with lower HHLA2 expression. Higher expression of HHLA2 in ccRCC tissues was positively and significantly associated with larger tumor size and advanced TNM stage. The COX model revealed that the parameters including patient's age, TNM stage and HHLA2 expression level could be used as the independent risk factors respectively for the prognostic prediction of the patients. Our cellular study showed that upon knockdown of HHLA2 expression in human ccRCC cell lines, the cell viability, the migration and the invasion ability were significantly inhibited, while the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase was induced and the expressions of Cyclin D1, c-Myc and Cyclin E1 were decreased. In addition, according to the microarray data, the expressions of epithelia-to-mesenchymal transition markers, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin, were significantly changed after knockdown of HHLA2 expression. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that HHLA2 was involved in the progression of human ccRCC and could be used as an important prognostic predictor for this malignancy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","B7 H3 protein; B7 H6 protein; cyclin D1; cyclin E; HHLA2 protein; messenger RNA; Myc protein; nerve cell adhesion molecule; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 ligand 2; regulator protein; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; viral protein; 786-O cell line; ACHN cell line; adult; advanced cancer; age; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer survival; cancer tissue; cell function; cell invasion; cell migration; cell viability; controlled study; disease association; endogenous retrovirus; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; HHLA2 gene; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; kidney tissue; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; middle aged; overall survival; prediction; protein function; renal cell carcinoma; risk factor; very elderly"

Older adult participants diagnosed with AD were recruited. Measures: We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to rank the included treatments. Cognitive functions were measured based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A series of analyses and assessments, such as the Pairwise meta-analysis and the risk of bias, were performed concurrently. Results: Only 22 studies were included in our analysis based on a series of rigorous screenings, which comprised 1368 participants. No obvious heterogeneities were found in NMA (I 2 = 32.7%, P =.07) after the data were pooled. The mean difference (MD) of CT [MD = 2.1, confidence interval [CI]: 1.0, 3.2), CS (MD = 0.92, CI: ?0.20, 2.0), and CR (MD = 2.0, CI: 0.73, 3.4) showed that CT and CR could significantly improve cognitive function as measured by MMSE in the treatment group whereas the CS was less effective. CT had the highest probability among the 3 cognitive interventions [the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) = 84.7%], followed by CR (SUCRA = 50.0%) and CS (SUCRA = 47.4%). Conclusions/Relevance: Our study indicated that the CT might be the best method for improving the cognitive function of AD patients. The findings from our study may be useful for policy makers and service commissioners when they make choices among different alternatives. ? 2018","Alzheimer disease; Article; cognition; cognitive rehabilitation; cognitive stimulation; cognitive therapy; cognitive training; disease severity; human; meta analysis; Mini Mental State Examination; network meta-analysis; systematic review"
"High-yield synthesis of gold bipyramids for in vivo CT imaging and photothermal cancer therapy with enhanced thermal stability",2019,"Monodisperse gold bipyramids (AuBPs) with controlled aspect ratio and tunable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) property have been synthesized using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium oleate (NaOL). The morphological yield of AuBPs is about 90% without any purification step. The presence of NaOL plays an important role in promoting the morphological yield of AuBPs by pre-reduce Au3+ to Au+. The obtained AuBPs exhibit strong absorbance in the near infrared region (NIR) that can be systematically tuned from 740 nm to 960 nm. After functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), the as-prepared AuBPs have shown excellent photothermal stability and great biocompatibility, which could be used for high contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. This work provides not only a simple method for the synthesis of AuBPs with high morphological yield, but also a promising theranostic agent for cancer therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aspect ratio; Biocompatibility; Diseases; Gold; Infrared devices; Oncology; Plasmons; Surface plasmon resonance; Bipyramids; Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; CT imaging; Near infrared region; Photo-stability; Photothermal cancer therapy; Photothermal stability; Photothermal therapy; Computerized tomography"
"Overexpression of zeb2-as1 lncrna is associated with poor clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a fatal hematopoietic malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. To determine whether the expression of the long non-coding (lnc)RNA zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) antisense RNA 1 (ZEB2-AS1) is associated with clinical outcomes, its expression was analyzed in a retrospective cohort of 62 AML and 10 non-malignant cases. The results revealed that the expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA was notably high and closely associated with adverse clinical outcomes in AML cases compared with the non-malignant cases, based on either modified Medical Research Council or European Leukemia Net risk stratification systems. Univariate analyses indicated that patients with a higher expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (P=0.036) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates (P=0.039) compared with patients with a lower expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA. In addition, patients with a higher expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA had a significant lower complete remission rate in response to induction by chemotherapy compared with patients with a lower expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA (P=0.031). In cases with low levels of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA, patients treated with allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had significantly longer OS and DFS rates compared with that of chemotherapy-treated patients (P=0.037 and P=0.049 respectively). Furthermore, the knockdown of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA effectively inhibited AML cell invasion and migration, which was closely associated with the downregulation of ZEB2 and upregulation of E-cadherin expression. Collectively, although its independent prognostic value for survival was not rigorously determined, ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA may function as a candidate marker to improve conventional risk stratification systems and the evaluation of therapeutic responses for AML. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Family Caregivers’ Subjective Caregiving Burden, Quality of Life, and Depressive Symptoms Are Associated With Terminally Ill Cancer Patients’ Distinct Patterns of Conjoint Symptom Distress and Functional Impairment in Their Last Six Months of Life",2019,"Context: Family caregivers constitute a critical component of the end-of-life care system with considerable cost to themselves. However, the joint association of terminally ill cancer patients’ symptom distress and functional impairment with caregivers’ subjective caregiving burden, quality of life (QOL), and depressive symptoms remains unknown. Objectives/Methods: We used multivariate hierarchical linear modeling to simultaneously evaluate associations between five distinct patterns of conjoint symptom distress and functional impairment (symptom-functional states) and subjective caregiving burden, QOL, and depressive symptoms in a convenience sample of 215 family caregiver–patient dyads. Data were collected every 2 to 4 weeks over patients’ last 6 months. Results: Caregivers of patients in the worst symptom-functional states (States 3–5) reported worse subjective caregiving burden and depressive symptoms than those in the best two states, but the three outcomes did not differ between caregivers of patients in State 3 and States 4–5. Caregivers of patients in State 5 endured worse subjective caregiving burden and QOL than those in State 4. Caregivers of patients in State 4 suffered worse subjective caregiving burden and depressive symptoms but comparable QOL to those in State 2. Conclusion: Patients’ five distinct, conjoint symptom-functional states were significantly and differentially associated with their caregivers’ worse subjective caregiving burden, QOL, and depressive symptoms while caring for patients over their last 6 months. ? 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","adult; Article; cancer patient; caregiver burden; controlled study; depression; distress syndrome; female; functional disease; functional status; human; major clinical study; male; quality of life; symptom; terminally ill patient; caregiver; cost of illness; disability; family; longitudinal study; mental stress; middle aged; neoplasm; psychology; terminally ill patient; Caregivers; Cost of Illness; Depression; Disability Evaluation; Family; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological; Terminally Ill"
"A circular RNA hsa_circ_0079929 inhibits tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Purpose: Most recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) were considered playing regulatory roles in tumor initiation and development. The specific function of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. This study was designed to detect specific roles of a circRNA hsa_circ_0079299 in HCC. Methods: The expression of hsa_circ_0079299 in HCC and tumor cell lines was detected using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle and apoptosis after overexpression of the circRNA were measured using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, wound healing assay, transwell culture system and flow cytometry. Western blotting assay detected the protein expression of PI3K/AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway and cyclin B1 (CCNB1). Overexpression of the circRNA in vivo was measured by nude mice tumorigenesis. Results: The expression of hsa_circ_0079299 was lower in HCC tissues. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0079299 suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, retarded cell cycle progression while had no effect on cell migration and apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of hsa_circ_0079299 was partly mediated by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our study shows that tumor suppressive role of hsa_circ_0079299 in HCC provides new recognition of circRNAs in cancers. ? 2019 Zheng et al.","cyclin B1; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; RNA; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; carcinogenesis; cell cycle progression; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical article; colony formation; controlled study; down regulation; gene expression; gene function; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; liver cell carcinoma; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; tumor cell line; wound healing"
"Genome-wide Association Studies of Specific Antinuclear Autoantibody Subphenotypes in Primary Biliary Cholangitis",2019,"Anti-nuclear antibodies to speckled 100?kDa (sp100) and glycoprotein 210 (gp210) are specific serologic markers of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) of uncertain/controversial clinical or prognostic significance. To study the genetic determinants associated with sp100 and gp210 autoantibody subphenotypes, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of 930 PBC cases based on their autoantibody status, followed by a replication study in 1,252 PBC cases. We confirmed single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs492899 (P?=?3.27?×?10?22; odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.34-3.66) and rs1794280 (P?=?5.78?×?10?28; OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 3.05-4.96) in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region associated with the sp100 autoantibody. However, no genetic variant was identified as being associated with the gp210 autoantibody. To further define specific classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles or amino acids associated with the sp100 autoantibody, we imputed 922 PBC cases (211 anti-sp100-positive versus 711 negative cases) using a Han Chinese MHC reference database. Conditional analysis identified that HLA-DRβ1-Asn77/Arg74, DRβ1-Ser37, and DPβ1-Lys65 were major determinants for sp100 production. For the classical HLA alleles, the strongest association was with DRB1*03:01 (P?=?1.51?×?10?9; OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.06-4.29). Regression analysis with classical HLA alleles identified DRB1*03:01, DRB1*15:01, DRB1*01, and DPB1*03:01 alleles can explain most of the HLA association with sp100 autoantibody. Conclusion: This study indicated significant genetic predisposition to the sp100 autoantibody, but not the gp210 autoantibody, subphenotype in PBC patients. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if these findings have clinical significance to PBC pathogenesis and/or therapeutics. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Molecular Programming of Biodegradable Nanoworms via Ionically Induced Morphology Switch toward Asymmetric Therapeutic Carriers",2019,"Engineering biodegradable nanostructures with precise morphological characteristics is a key objective in nanomedicine. In particular, asymmetric (i.e., nonspherical) nanoparticles are desirable due to the advantageous effects of shape in a biomedical context. Using molecular engineering, it is possible to program unique morphological features into the self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs). However, the criteria of biocompatibility and scalability limit progress due to the prevalence of nondegradable components and the use of toxic solvents during fabrication. To address this shortfall, a robust strategy for the fabrication of morphologically asymmetric nanoworms, comprising biodegradable BCPs, has been developed. Modular BCPs comprising poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly(caprolactone-gradient-trimethylene carbonate) (PEG?PCLgTMC), with a terminal chain of quaternary ammonium-TMC (PTMC-Q), undergo self-assembly via direct hydration into well-defined nanostructures. By controlling the solution ionic strength during hydration, particle morphology switches from spherical micelles to nanoworms (of varying aspect ratio). This ionically-induced switch is driven by modulation of chain packing with salts screening interchain repulsions, leading to micelle elongation. Nanoworms can be loaded with cytotoxic cargo (e.g., doxorubicin) at high efficiency, preferentially interact with cancer cells, and increase tumor penetration. This work showcases the ability to program assembly of BCPs and the potential of asymmetric nanosystems in anticancer drug delivery. ? 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Values of applying white blood cell counts in the prognostic evaluation of resectable colorectal cancer",2019,"The count and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) may be used as prognostic markers in certain types of cancer. The present study investigated the prognostic potential ofthecountsofWBCs,includinglymphocytes(LYs),monocytes (MOs), neutrophils (NEs), eosinophils (EOs) and basophils (BAs), in the prognosis of resectable colorectal cancer. The present study recruited 153 resectable colorectal cancer cases retrospectively, which were pathologically confirmed. All patients were divided into two groups, according to the median value of LY (low LY, ?1.632x10 9 /l or high LY, &gt;1.632x10 9 /l), MO (low MO, ?0.330x10 9 /l or high MO, &gt;0.330x10 9 /l), NE (low NE, ?3.600x10 9 /l or high NE, &gt;3.600x10 9 /l), EO (low EO, ?0.085x10 9 /l or high EO, &gt;0.085x10 9 /l), BA (low BA, ?0.010x10 9 /l or high BA, &gt;0.010x10 9 /l), or WBC (low WBC, ?5.780x10 9 /l or high WBC, &gt;5.780x10 9 /l). To evaluate the alterations in WBC counts following surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; all samples received oxiplatin and capecitabine (XELOX) for 6-8 cycles or 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) for 10-12 cycles. XELOX included oxaliplatin administered intravenously at a dose of 130 mg/m 2 on day 1 and 850-1,250 mg/m 2 capecitabine twice daily for days 1-14, repeated every 3 weeks. mFOLFOX6 included oxaliplatin administered intravenously at a dose of 85 mg/m 2 , 400 mg/m 2 leucovorin and 400 mg/m 2 5-FU on day 1 followed by 1,200 mg/m 2 /days continuous infusion for 2 days (in total, 2,400 mg/m 2 over 46-48 h), repeated every 2 weeks. The present study investigated the post/pre-treatment of LY, MO, NE, EO, BA and WBC ratios (?1 indicated that LY, MO, NE, EO, BA and WBC counts were not increased following therapy; whereas, &gt;1 suggested increased counts). Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to demonstrate overall survival (OS). A multivariate and univariate logistic regression analyses model was employed to identify the independent risk factors. Low pre-treatment BA counts were associated with larger tumor size (&gt;5 cm); pre-treatment BA levels were positively associated with OS. Surgery significantly decreased the count of BAs and increased the count of EOs; whereas, no effect was observed on LYs, MOs, NEs or WBCs. Adjuvant chemotherapy markedly decreased the counts of LY, NE and WBC; whereas, no notable effects on MOs, EOs or BAs were observed. Whole course treatment (surgery combined with adjuvant chemotherapy) significantly decreased the values of LY, NE and WBC; however, increased the value of EO; no effects on the MO or BA counts were observed. An increased post-/pre-treatment NE ratio suggested poorer prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that sex, tumor size, pre-treatment BA count and the post-/pre-treatment NE ratio were independent prognostic factors affecting OS. The results of the present study suggested that the pre-treatment BA count and post-/pre-treatment NE ratio may be potential prognostic factors for resectable colorectal cancer. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted right colectomy compared with laparoscopic surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of robotic-assisted right colectomy (RRC) with conventional laparoscopic right colectomy (LRC) by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published studies. All published literature for comparative studies reporting preoperative outcomes of RRC and LRC were searched. We searched the databases included Cochrane Library of Clinical Comparative Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) from 1973 to 2018. The censor date was up to January 2018. Operative time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, conversion rates to open surgery, postoperative complications, and related outcomes were evaluated. All calculations and statistical tests were performed using Stata 12.0 software. A total of 7769 patients with colon cancer enrolled in 13 trials were divided into a study group (n = 674) and a control group (n = 7095). Meta-analysis suggested significantly greater length of hospital stay in the LRC group [MD = ?0.85; 95% CI: ?1.07 to ?0.63; P < 0.00001]. Robotic surgery was also associated with a significantly lower complication rate [OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.01; P = 0.05]. There were statistically significant differences between the groups in estimated blood loss [MD = ?16.89; 95% CI: ?24.80 to ?8.98; P < 0.00001] and the rate of intraoperative conversion to open surgery [OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.75; P = 0.008)], but these differences were not clinically relevant. The recovery of bowel function in two groups is no significant differences [MD = ?0.58, 95% CI: ?0.96 to ?0.20, P = 0.0008]. However, operation times [MD = 43.61, 95% CI: 39.11 to 48.10, P < 0.00001] were longer for RRC than for LRC. Compared to LRC, RRC was associated with reduced estimated blood loss, reduced postoperative complications, longer operation times. Recovery of bowel function and other perioperative outcomes were equivalent between the two surgeries. ? 2018","bibliographic database; colon resection; comparative study; convalescence; female; human; laparoscopy; length of stay; male; meta analysis; operation duration; operative blood loss; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; time factor; treatment outcome; Blood Loss, Surgical; Colectomy; Databases, Bibliographic; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Operative Time; Recovery of Function; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"TRIM11 promotes proliferation and glycolysis of breast cancer cells via targeting AKT/GLUT1 pathway",2019,"Background: Tripartite motif-containing protein 11 (TRIM11) is one of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, which is upregulated in several human tumors. Meanwhile, the detailed function of TRIM11 remains unclear in breast cancer cells. Purpose: The purpose of the present study is to analyze the biological function of TRIM11 and identify its potential signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. Patients and methods: Thirty five pairs of breast cancer specimens and adjacent-matched noncancerous samples were used to analyse the expression profile of TRIM11. RNA interference was utilized to silence TRIM11 in three breast cancer cell lines (T47D, ZR7530, and BT474) respectively. Meanwhile, overexpression of TRIM11 was induced in one breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) by using Lentiviral vector. Moreover, the AKT inhibitor (MK-2206) was used to determine the correlation between TRIM11 and AKT in breast cancer cells. Results: Our results indicated that TRIM11 was increased in breast cancer tissues. Moreover, TRIM11 was a pro-proliferation regulator in breast cancer cells and participated in the metabolism of glycolysis. Importantly, our results demonstrated that TRIM11 was involved in the AKT/GLUT1 signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. Conclusion: Present research not only gained a deep understanding of the biological function of TRIM11 but also provided evidences to indicate its possible signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. ? 2019 Song et al.","8 [4 (1 aminocyclobutyl)phenyl] 9 phenyl 1,2,4 triazolo[3,4 f][1,6]naphthyridin 3(2h) one; glucose transporter 1; protein kinase B; tripartite motif containing protein 11; tripartite motif protein; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; breast cancer; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; glucose transport; glycolysis; human; human cell; human tissue; mouse; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; signal transduction; upregulation; Western blotting"
"Relationship between stromal cells and tumor spread through air spaces in lung adenocarcinoma",2019,"Background: The mechanism underlying tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) has not been well studied. We investigated the role of tumor stromal cells in the pathogenesis of STAS from a pathological perspective and evaluated the prognostic significance of tumor stromal cells and STAS in postoperative patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 208 postsurgical patients with stage I–IIIA lung adenocarcinoma. The presence of STAS was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and CD204-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. A logistic regression model was applied to confirm the predictive factors of STAS. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of α-SMA-positive CAFs, CD204-positive TAMs, and STAS on prognosis. A nomogram was generated to evaluate the prognosis of postoperative patients. Results: Logistic regression suggested that the expression of α-SMA-positive CAFs (P < 0.001) and the number of CD204-positive TAMs (P < 0.001) were related to the presence of STAS. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model suggested that STAS (P = 0.004), α-SMA-positive CAFs (P < 0.001), and CD204-positive TAMs (P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for prognosis. Harrell's c-indexes for overall and recurrence-free survival prediction based on nomograms were 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.76–0.91) and 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.76–0.89), respectively. Conclusions: The presence of STAS was associated with high expression of α-SMA and CD204 in lung adenocarcinoma. Nomograms including STAS and stromal cells as variables are recommended as practical models to evaluate the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Increased CX3CL1 mRNA expression level is a positive prognostic factor in patients with lung adenocarcinoma",2019,"Chemokines are a family of small cytokines, which are signalling proteins secreted by cells. The principal role of chemokines is to serve as chemoattractants to guide the migration of their target cells. Chemokine C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1) is a protein-coding gene of fractalkine, which serves as a ligand for chemokine C-X3-C motif receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and integrins. However, the roles of CX3CL1 in different pathological types of lung cancer remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the potential clinical and biological function of CX3CL1 mRNA expression in patients with lung cancer. In the present study, lung cancer data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and The Cancer Genome Atlas were downloaded and analysed, and the results demonstrated that an increased CX3CL1 mRNA expression in tumour tissues from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) was associated with improved overall survival. However, no significant association was identified between CX3CL1 expression and the prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Furthermore, the genes whose expression levels were correlated with CX3CL1 expression were subjected to enrichment analysis, and the results for the LUAD data demonstrated that the most significant biological processes included ‘positive regulation of cell adhesion’, ‘leukocyte cell-cell adhesion’, ‘leukocyte migration’ and ‘T cell activation’, whereas, the important highly ranked pathways included ‘cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)’, ‘leukocyte transendothelial migration’ and ‘natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity’. However, in the patients with LUSC, the genes that were highly correlated with CX3CL1 were not enriched for any biological processes or signalling pathways. Based on the data of the present study, it was hypothesised that CX3CL1 may serve as a prognostic marker for LUAD. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"FBXW7 in cancer: What has been unraveled thus far?",2019,"The FBXW7 (F-box with 7 tandem WD40) protein encoded by the gene FBXW7 is one of the crucial components of ubiquitin ligase called Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) complex that aids in the degradation of many oncoproteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) thus regulating cellular growth. FBXW7 is considered as a potent tumor suppressor as most of its target substrates can function as potential growth promoters, including c-Myc, Notch, cyclin E, c-JUN, and KLF5. Its regulators include p53, C/EBP-d, Numb, microRNAs, Pin 1, Hes-5, BMI1, Ebp2. Mounting evidence has indicated the involvement of aberrant expression of FBXW7 for tumorigenesis. Moreover, numerous studies have also shown its role in cancer cell chemosensitization, thereby demonstrating the importance of FBXW7 in the development of curative cancer therapy. This comprehensive review emphasizes on the targets, functions, regulators and expression of FBXW7 in different cancers and its involvement in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Preliminary study of the reliability and validity of the Johns Hopkins Adapted Cognitive Exam (Chinese version) in neurological intensive care unit patients",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Johns Hopkins Adapted Cognitive Exam (ACE) in neurological intensive care unit patients. Design: The English version of the ACE was translated and adapted into Chinese. The cognitive function of 40 critically ill NICU patients was assessed using the Chinese version of the ACE and the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) battery. Scores on the ACE and MMSE were analyzed, and the scale’s content validity, construct validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability metrics were determined. Result: The coefficients for the Pearson correlations between individual item scores and total score ranged from 0.617 to 0.938, and content validity was good. ACE scores were significantly correlated with MMSE scores(r?=?0.822, p<0.05). Five factors were extracted during the principal component analysis, the cumulative contribution of which was 85.90%. Overall, the factor loading of each item was 0.5, and the scale had good construct validity. The Chinese version of the ACE demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’α?=?0.756), inter-rater reliability (ICC>0.95), and test-retest reliability (ICC?=?0.652–0.979).

"Safety and activity of sintilimab in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (ORIENT-1): a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial",2019,"Background: Sintilimab (Innovent Biologics, Suzhou, China), a highly selective, fully humanised, monoclonal antibody, blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. We aimed to assess the activity and safety profile of sintilimab in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Methods: In this ongoing, single-arm, phase 2 study, we recruited patients with histopathologically diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma that was relapsed or refractory after two or more lines of therapy from 18 hospitals in China. Patients were given intravenous sintilimab (200 mg, once every 3 weeks) until progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the full analysis set (ie, those with classical Hodgkin lymphoma confirmed by the central pathology laboratory) who had an objective response, as assessed by an independent radiological review committee (IRRC), by 24 weeks after enrolment of the last patient. Tumour response was assessed by enhanced CT scan or MRI at baseline, at weeks 6, 15, and 24, every 12 weeks from weeks 24 to 48, and every 16 weeks beyond week 48. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03114683, and is ongoing. Findings: Between April 19, 2017, and Nov 1, 2017, 96 patients were enrolled and commenced treatment. Four patients, whose diagnosis was not subsequently confirmed by the central pathology laboratory, were excluded from the full analysis set. Ten patients discontinued treatment. Median duration of follow-up was 10·5 months. In the full analysis set (n=92), 74 patients (80·4%; 95% CI 70·9–88·0) had an IRRC-assessed objective response before the analysis cutoff date of April 16, 2018. 89 (93%) of 96 patients had treatment-related adverse events, and 17 patients (18%) had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, the most common being pyrexia (three [3%] patients). 14 (15%) patients had serious adverse events of any cause. No patient died during the study. Interpretation: Sintilimab could be a new treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma in China.

"Machine learning for prediction of sudden cardiac death in heart failure patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction: Study protocol for a retroprospective multicentre registry in China",2019,"Introduction Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ?35%, as current significant implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) indication for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in heart failure (HF) patients, has been widely recognised to be inefficient. Improvement of patient selection for low LVEF (?35%) is needed to optimise deployment of ICD. Most of the existing prediction models are not appropriate to identify ICD candidates at high risk of SCD in HF patients with low LVEF. Compared with traditional statistical analysis, machine learning (ML) can employ computer algorithms to identify patterns in large datasets, analyse rules automatically and build both linear and non-linear models in order to make data-driven predictions. This study is aimed to develop and validate new models using ML to improve the prediction of SCD in HF patients with low LVEF. Methods and analysis We will conduct a retroprospective, multicentre, observational registry of Chinese HF patients with low LVEF. The HF patients with LVEF ?35% after optimised medication at least 3 months will be enrolled in this study. The primary endpoints are all-cause death and SCD. The secondary endpoints are malignant arrhythmia, sudden cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and rehospitalisation due to HF. The baseline demographic, clinical, biological, electrophysiological, social and psychological variables will be collected. Both ML and traditional multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models will be developed and compared in the prediction of SCD. Moreover, the ML model will be validated in a prospective study. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (2017-SR-06). All results of this study will be published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences. Trial registration number ChiCTR-POC-17011842; Pre-results. ?

"Disease severity and clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses in adults: A multicentre prospective registry study from the CAP-China Network",2019,"Although broad knowledge of influenza viral pneumonia has been established, the significance of non-influenza respiratory viruses in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and their impact on clinical outcomes remains unclear, especially in the non-immunocompromised adult population. Hospitalised immunocompetent patients with CAP were prospectively recruited from 34 hospitals in mainland China. Respiratory viruses were detected by molecular methods. Comparisons were conducted between influenza and non-influenza viral infection groups. In total, 915 out of 2336 adult patients with viral infection were enrolled in the analysis, with influenza virus (28.4%) the most frequently detected virus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (3.6%), adenovirus (3.3%), human coronavirus (3.0%), parainfluenza virus (2.2%), human rhinovirus (1.8%) and human metapneumovirus (1.5%). Non-influenza viral infections accounted for 27.4% of viral pneumonia. Consolidation was more frequently observed in patients with adenovirus infection. The occurrence of complications such as sepsis (40.1% versus 39.6%; p=0.890) and hypoxaemia (40.1% versus 37.2%; p=0.449) during hospitalisation in the influenza viral infection group did not differ from that of the noninfluenza viral infection group. Compared with influenza virus infection, the multivariable adjusted odds ratios of CURB-65 (confusion, urea >7 mmol L-1, respiratory rate ?30 breaths min-1, blood pressure <90 mmHg (systolic) or ?60 mmHg (diastolic), age ?65 years) ?3, arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction <200 mmHg, and occurrence of sepsis and hypoxaemia for non-influenza respiratory virus infection were 0.87 (95% CI 0.26-2.84), 0.72 (95% CI 0.26-1.98), 1.00 (95% CI 0.63-1.58) and 1.05 (95% CI 0.66-1.65), respectively. The hazard ratio of 90-day mortality was 0.51 (95% CI 0.13-1.91). The high incidence of complications in non-influenza viral pneumonia and similar impact of noninfluenza respiratory viruses relative to influenza virus on disease severity and outcomes suggest more attention should be given to CAP caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses. ?

"Peripheral BDNF/TrkB protein expression is decreased in Parkinson's disease but not in Essential tremor",2019,"BDNF-to-TrkB signaling pathways plays an important role in the long-term maintenance of the nigrostriatal system and that its deficiency may contribute to the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylation status of TrkB in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 28 PD and 28 Essential tremor (ET) patients and 28 healthy controls using western blot analysis. Compared with controls, no significant difference of BDNF and total and phosphorylated TrkB levels were observed in ET, whereas BDNF and phosphorylated TrkB levels were significantly decreased in the PD groups (p < 0.001). Interestingly, BDNF and phosphorylated TrkB levels were positively correlated with disease duration, UPDRS score, Hoehn-Yahr staging, as well as L-DOPA medication in PD patients. These results suggest that the decreased peripheral alteration of BDNF/TrkB levels found in patients with PD is directly related to the dopaminergic neurons neurodegeneration and that decreased expression of BDNF/TrkB may lead to the development of innovative biomarkers of PD, whereas the increased level of BDNF and phosphorylated TrkB at advanced stages may due to L-DOPA medication. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","biological marker; brain derived neurotrophic factor; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; carbidopa plus levodopa; levodopa; brain derived neurotrophic factor; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; membrane protein; tropomyosin-related kinase-B, human; adult; age; aged; Article; controlled study; daily life activity; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; dopaminergic nerve cell; essential tremor; female; human; major clinical study; male; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; Western blotting; blood; essential tremor; lymphocyte; metabolism; middle aged; Parkinson disease; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Essential Tremor; Female; Humans; Lymphocytes; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Receptor, trkB"
"FLT3-ITD and CEBPA Mutations Predict Prognosis in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Irrespective of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation",2019,"Cytogenetic and genetic changes have prognostic significance in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In our study, we compared the cytogenetic changes and gene mutations (NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and C-KIT)with clinical outcomes in 1132 patients with AML enrolled at our center over a 10-year period. A total of 977 patients provided gene mutation data. There were subsets of patients who exhibited mutations in NPM1 (17.9%), CEBPA (16.4%), FLT3-ITD (18.5%), FLT3-TKD (3.9%), DNMT3A (8.6%), and C-KIT (8.8%). A total of 557 patients (49.2%)underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)as consolidation therapy. Multivariate analysis identified an adverse karyotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; P =.001), the presence of FLT3-ITD (HR, 1.90; P &lt;.001), and receipt of nonstandard first-line induction chemotherapy (HR, 1.45; P =.003)as significant risk factors for poor overall survival (OS), and the presence of CEBPA mut (HR,.42; P &lt;.001)and receipt of HSCT (HR,.35; P &lt;.001)as prognostic factors for favorable OS. In addition, the presence of FLT3-ITD mut (HR, 2.11; P &lt;.001)was identified as an independent risk factor for poor disease-free survival (DFS), and receipt of HSCT was correlated with improved DFS (HR,.74; P =.046). Compared with chemotherapy as consolidation therapy, HSCT improved the prognosis and overcame the prognostic effect of karyotype from the initial diagnosis; however, the presence of FLT3-ITD or CEBPA mutation can predict prognosis in AML irrespective of HSCT. ? 2018 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","busulfan; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CD135 antigen; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; daunorubicin; DNA methyltransferase 3A; idarubicin; nucleophosmin; acute myeloid leukemia; adult; aged; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; central nervous system leukemia; clinical outcome; disease free survival; drug megadose; female; gene mutation; genetic analysis; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; high risk patient; HLA system; human; induction chemotherapy; intermediate risk population; karyotype; leukemia remission; major clinical study; male; mutation rate; myeloablative conditioning; overall survival; reduced intensity conditioning; risk factor; treatment duration; treatment response; whole body radiation"
"Abnormal gut microbiota composition contributes to cognitive dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice",2019,"Both diabetes and Alzheimer's disease are age-related disorders, and numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction (CD) and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting shared or interacting pathomechanisms. The present study investigated the role of abnormal gut microbiota in diabetes-induced CD and the potential underlying mechanisms. An intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin administered for 5 consecutive days was used for establishing a diabetic animal model. Hierarchical cluster analysis of Morris water maze (MWM) performance indices (escape latency and target quadrant crossing) was adopted to classify the diabetic model mice into CD and Non-CD phenotypes. Both β-diversity and relative abundance of several gut bacteria significantly differed between the CD and Non-CD groups. Further, fecal bacteria transplantation from Non-CD mice, but not from CD mice, into the gut of pseudo-germ-free mice significantly improved host MWM performance, an effect associated with alterations in β-diversity and relative abundance of host gut bacteria. Collectively, these findings suggest that abnormal gut microbiota composition contributes to the onset of diabetes-induced CD and that improving gut microbiota composition is a potential therapeutic strategy for diabetes and related comorbidities. ?

"Circulating Heme Oxygenase-1 and Complement Activation in Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy",2019,"Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a severe complication in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The pathogenesis of TA-TMA is still unclear. Previous studies showed that complement activation plays an important role in the development of TA-TMA. However, no data showed which kind of complement component triggers this process. In this study we found that heme oxygenase-1, which could induce decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and inhibit the membrane-attack complex, was significantly decreased in patients with TA-TMA. DAF levels in the TA-TMA group were in line with the levels in the myocardial infarction group but were lower than levels in the healthy, noncomplication, infection, and graft-versus-host disease groups (P <.05). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with TA-TMA plasma showed lower DAF levels compared with that incubated with normal human plasma. Notably, treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a drug against oxidation, increased the level of DAF. NAC could also inhibit complement activation in HUVECs incubated with TA-TMA plasma. Taken together, we propose that NAC represents a new potential therapy for patients facing TA-TMA. ? 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","acetylcysteine; complement component C3b; complement membrane attack complex; decay accelerating factor; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; heme oxygenase 1; messenger RNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; acute graft versus host disease; acute heart infarction; antigen expression; Article; cell protection; clinical article; complement activation; complement dependent cytotoxicity; complement deposition; controlled study; drug efficacy; gene expression regulation; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; graft dysfunction; graft infection; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; human cell; mRNA expression level; promoter region; protein blood level; retrospective study; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy; umbilical vein endothelial cell; upregulation"
"MicroRNAs in the Migration of Mesenchymal Stem Cells",2019,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising source of cell-based therapies for treatment of a wide variety of injuries and diseases. Their tropism and migration to the damaged sites, which are elicited by cytokines secreted from tissues around pathology, are the prerequisite for tissue repair and regeneration. Better understanding of the elicited-migration of MSCs and discovering conditions that elevate their migration ability, will help to increase their homing to pathologies and improve therapeutic efficacy. It is increasingly recognized that microRNAs are important regulators of cell migration.

"Pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα represses LPS-induced microglial activation through the NF-κB pathway",2019,"REV-ERBα, the NR1D1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1) gene product, is a dominant transcriptional silencer that represses the expression of genes involved in numerous physiological functions, including circadian rhythm, inflammation, and metabolism, and plays a crucial role in maintaining immune functions. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is tightly associated with various neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. However, the role of REV-ERBα in neuroinflammation is largely unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα affected lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in mouse microglia in vitro and in vivo. In BV2 cells or primary mouse cultured microglia, application of REV-ERBα agonist GSK4112 or SR9011 dose-dependently suppressed LPS-induced microglial activation through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. In BV2 cells, pretreatment with GSK4112 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (IκBα) kinase (IκK), thus restraining the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, and blocked the nuclear translocation of p65, a NF-κB subunit, thereby suppressing the expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Moreover, REV-ERBα agonist-induced inhibition on neuroinflammation protected neurons from microglial activation-induced damage, which were also demonstrated in mice with their ventral midbrain microinjected with GSK4112, and then stimulated with LPS. Our results reveal that enhanced REV-ERBα activity suppresses microglial activation through the NF-κB pathway in the central nervous system. ? 2018, CPS and SIMM.","central nervous system agents; cytokine; gsk 4112; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; neuroprotective agent; nuclear receptor NR1D1; sr 9011; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; glycine; GSK4112; neuroprotective agent; Nr1d1 protein, mouse; nuclear receptor NR1D1; pyrrolidine derivative; Rela protein, mouse; SR9011; thiophene derivative; transcription factor RelA; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; BV-2 cell line; cell activation; circadian rhythm; controlled study; cytokine release; embryo; gene repression; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation; male; microglia; microglial cell culture; mouse; nerve cell lesion; neuroprotection; newborn; nonhuman; protein degradation; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; silencer element; ventral mesencephalon; agonists; analogs and derivatives; animal; C57BL mouse; drug effect; inflammation; mesencephalon; metabolism; microglia; pathophysiology; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Glycine; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Mesencephalon; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microglia; Neuroprotective Agents; Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1; Pyrrolidines; Signal Transduction; Thiophenes; Transcription Factor RelA"
"Multivalency-assisted membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery sensitizes photothermal ablation via inhibition of tumor glycolysis metabolism",2019,"The success of photothermal therapy (PTT) is often hampered by the thermo-resistance of tumor cells mediated by over-expressed heat shock proteins (HSPs). Herein, we developed a guanidine-rich, spherical helical polypeptide (DPP) with multivalency-assisted strong membrane penetrating capability, which mediated effective RNAi against tumor glycolysis metabolism to sensitize PTT. ICG was loaded into the internal cavity of DPP, and siRNA against pyruvate kinase M2 (siPKM2) was condensed by DPP to form positively charged nanocomplexes (NCs). The NCs were further coated with human serum albumin to enhance serum stability, prolong blood circulation, and improve tumor targeting. Due to its multivalent topology, DPP exhibited stronger membrane activity yet lower cytotoxicity than its linear analogue (LPP), thus enabling efficient PKM2 silencing in MCF-7 cells in vitro (~75%) and in vivo (~70%). The PKM2 silencing inhibited tumor glycolysis metabolism and further depleted the energy supply for HSPs production, thus overcoming the heat endurance of tumor cells to strengthen ICG-mediated photothermal ablation. Additionally, siPKM2-mediated energy depletion led to tumor cell starvation, which imparted synergistic anti-cancer effect with PTT. This study therefore provides a promising strategy for designing membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery materials, and it renders a unique RNAi-mediated anti-metabolic mechanism in sensitizing PTT and enabling starvation therapy. ? 2019","Ablation; Cardiovascular system; Cells; Cytology; Heat resistance; Membranes; Metabolism; Pathology; Proteins; RNA; Helical polypeptides; Membrane penetration; Photothermal therapy; siRNA delivery; Starvation therapy; Tumors; acid anhydride; dendrimer; guanidine; guanidine derivative; heat shock protein; human serum albumin; indocyanine green; n carboxyanhydride; nanocarrier; polyamidoamine; polypeptide; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase M2; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; binding affinity; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer gene therapy; cancer inhibition; circulation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug half life; drug penetration; drug potentiation; drug targeting; female; gene delivery system; gene silencing; glycolysis; heat tolerance; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; infrared radiation; MCF-7 cell line; membrane permeability; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; photothermal therapy; polymerization; priority journal; ring opening; RNA binding; RNA interference; static electricity"
"VEGFR2 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in a pro-angiogenic-independent way in gastric cancer",2019,"Background: VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway is the central therapeutic target in anti-angiogenic treatment in multiple cancers. However, little work has been carried out concerning the pro-malignancy functions of VEGFR2 that are independent of its pro-angiogenesis effects in gastric cancer. Here, we demonstrated that VEGFR2 up-regulation in gastric cancer tissues was a prognostic marker for poor disease-free survival and overall survival of gastric cancer patients. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect VEGFR2 and VTN expressions in specimens. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for survival analysis. Stably knockdown cell lines and overexpression cell lines were constructed by small interfering RNA and plasmids transfection. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to confirm the expressions of target genes at both RNA and protein levels. Cell proliferation was measured by using Cell Counting Kit-8 and xenograft models. Microarray and bioinformatic analysis were also performed to identify the relationship between Vitronectin (VTN) and VEGFR2. Results: When overexpressed in gastric cancer cells, VEGFR2 increased cellular proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumor formation in xenograft models. By using integrating microarray and bioinformatic analysis, we identifiedVTN as a downstream of VEGFR2 pathway. In gain- and loss-of function analysis in gastric cancer cells, VTN was further verified in consistent with VEGFR2 in expression levels and in regulating cell growth and motility in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in gastric cancer samples, VTN was as also revealed as a poor prognostic factor. Conclusions: Our present findings defined a novel activity for VEGFR2 in promoting tumorogenicity, motility and indicating a poor survival in gastric cancer beyond its known pro-angiogenic effects. Implications: Our present findings defined a novel activity for VEGFR2 in promoting tumorogenicity, motility and indicating a poor survival in gastric cancer beyond its known pro-angiogenic effects, which may provide a new and valuable target for design of therapies for intervention and a new cognitive perspective for the anti-angiogenesis therapies. ? 2019 The Author(s).","RNA; small interfering RNA; vasculotropin receptor 2; vitronectin; tumor marker; vasculotropin receptor 2; aged; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; cancer cell; cancer tissue; cell growth; cell invasion; cell motility; cell proliferation; controlled study; disease free survival; female; gene expression; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; metastasis; microarray analysis; MKN45 cell line; mouse; NCI-N87 cell line; nonhuman; overall survival; plasmid; prognosis; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; stomach cancer; stomach carcinogenesis; survival analysis; tumor xenograft; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; biology; cancer grading; cancer staging; cell motion; cell transformation; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; metabolism; metastasis; middle aged; mortality; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; procedures; signal transduction; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; tumor volume; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Computational Biology; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mice; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Prognosis; Signal Transduction; Stomach Neoplasms; Tumor Burden; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2"
"Peripheral blood platelet to lymphocyte ratio as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers of acute cerebral infarction and its clinical significance",2019,"Background: The aim of the present study is to explore the diagnostic and prognostic value of peripheral blood platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in acute cerebral infarction (ACI). Methods: We enrolled 121 patients with ACI and 35 healthy volunteers in the present study. The lymphocyte and platelet counts and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios of the candidates were calculated, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to examine whether PLR was a sensitive biomarker for distinguishing ACI patients from the healthy volunteers; moreover, the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) results of the patients were recorded to evaluate the short-term prognosis of the patients, and the relationship between PLR and GOS were investigated. Results: We observed that the platelet counts were decreased in patients with ACI compared to the healthy volunteers, but no significant differences were observed (p > 0.05). On the other hand, lymphocyte counts were significantly decreased in patients with ACI, and PLR was significantly increased in patients with ACI compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.001). Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) of platelet counts, lymphocyte counts, and PLR were 0.5365 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4373 to 0.6357), 0.7526 (95% CI, 0.6630 to 0.8421), and 0.8320 (95% CI, 0.7586 to 0.9054), respectively, suggesting that PLR was a sensitive biomarker for distinguishing ACI patients from the healthy controls. Finally, the PLR of the patients were negatively correlated with the GOS score of the patients. Conclusions: We reported that PLR was significantly increased in the peripheral blood of patients with ACI, suggesting that PLR might be a potential early diagnostic and prognostic marker for ACI. ? 2019 Verlag Klinisches Labor GmbH.

"The caspase-3/PKCd/Akt/VEGF-A signaling pathway mediates tumor repopulation during radiotherapy",2019,"Purpose: Tumor repopulation is known as a major cause of treatment failure and/or tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. The underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that irradiated apoptotic cells mediated tumor repopulation, in which caspase-3 played an important role. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of caspase- 3 involved in this process. Experimental Design: A dominant-negative protein kinase Cδ (DN-PKCδ) mutant that could not be cleaved by caspase-3 and therefore could not be activated by irradiation-induced apoptosis was constructed. DN-PKCδ stably transduced tumor cells were compared with wild-type tumor cells for their growth stimulation effects in in vitro and in vivo tumor repopulation models. Downstream effectors of caspase-3 and PKCδ were investigated. The role of PKCδ was further verified in human colorectal tumor specimens. Results: Inactivation of caspase-3 or caspase-7 attenuated tumor repopulation and weakened PKCδ cleavage. Both DN-PKCδ and PKCδ inhibitors restrained tumor repopulation both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated Akt was attenuated in caspase-3-, caspase-7-, or PKCδ-inactivated tumor cells. Furthermore, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A but not hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a) was decreased in PKCδ- or Akt-inactivated tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of p-Akt, HIF1a, VEGF-A, or VEGF-A receptor reduced tumor repopulation significantly. Finally, increased nuclear translocation of PKCδ in colorectal tumor specimens was associated with worse patient prognosis. Conclusions: The caspase-3/PKCδ/Akt/VEGF-A axis is involved in tumor repopulation and could be exploited as a potential target to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","caspase 3; caspase 7; protein kinase B; protein kinase C delta; vasculotropin A; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; clinical effectiveness; colorectal tumor; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; enzyme phosphorylation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein transport; signal transduction; treatment failure; tumor cell; tumor growth; tumor recurrence; tumor repopulation"
"Forging successful partnerships in psychosis research: Lessons from the Cavan-Monaghan First Episode Psychosis Study",2019,"Embedding psychosis research within community mental services is highly desirable from several perspectives but can be difficult to establish and sustain, especially when the clinical service has a rural location at a distance from academic settings with established research expertise. In this article, we share the experience of a successful partnership in psychosis research between a rural Irish mental health service and the academic department of a Dublin medical school that has lasted over 30 years. We describe the origins and evolution of this relationship, the benefits that accrued and the challenges encountered, from the overlapping perspectives of the academic department, the mental health service and psychiatric training. We discuss the potential learning that arose from the initiative, particularly for national programme planning for early intervention in psychosis, and we explore the opportunities for enhanced training, career development and professional reward that can emerge from this type of partnership. ? 2019 College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.","career; clinical research; community; early intervention; experience; health program; human; Ireland; medical education; medical school; mental health service; planning; psychiatry; psychosis; Review; rural area"
"microRNA-4500 inhibits human glioma cell progression by targeting IGF2BP1",2019,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) overexpression promotes glioma cell progression. The aim of the current study is to silence IGF2BP1 in glioma cells by the microRNA (miRNA) strategy. The bio-informatic analyses identified that microRNA-4500 (miR-4500) putatively targets 3′-UTR (3′-untranslated region) of IGF2BP1. In A172 cells and primary human glioma cells ectopic overexpression of the wild-type miR-4500 (but not the mutant form) downregulated IGF2BP1 and its target genes (Gli1, IGF2 and c-Myc). Functional studies show that ectopic miR-4500 overexpression inhibited glioma cell growth, survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. Conversely, in A172 cells miR-4500 inhibition, by a lentiviral construct, increased expression of IGF2BP1 and its targets, promoting cell survival, proliferation and migration. Furthermore, IGF2BP1 knockout by the CRISPR/Cas9 method inhibited A172 cell progression. Significantly, miR-4500 overexpression or miR-4500 inhibition was ineffective in IGF2BP1 knockout A172 cells. At last, we show that miR-4500 levels are downregulated in human glioma tissues, correlating with IGF2BP1 upregulation. Together, we conclude that miR-4500 inhibits human glioma cell progression by targeting IGF2BP1. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","caspase 3; caspase 9; insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1; microRNA; microRNA 4500; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; RNA binding protein; somatomedin B; somatomedin binding protein 1; unclassified drug; 3' untranslated region; A-172 cell line; Article; bioinformatics; cancer diagnosis; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical indicator; controlled study; CRISPR-CAS9 system; down regulation; gene expression regulation; gene knockout; gene overexpression; gene silencing; gene targeting; genetic identification; Gli1 gene; glioma cell; human; human cell; human tissue; IGF2 gene; IGF2BP1 gene; oncogene c myc; priority journal; protein cleavage; tumor gene; tumor invasion; U-251MG cell line; upregulation; wild type"
"Spatiotemporally Light-Activatable Platinum Nanocomplexes for Selective and Cooperative Cancer Therapy",2019,"Highly efficient nanoarchitectures are of great interest for achieving precise chemotherapy with minimized adverse side effects in cancer therapy. However, a major challenge remains in exploring a rational approach to synthesize spatiotemporally selective vehicles for precise cancer chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate a rational design of bifunctional light-activatable platinum nanocomplexes (PtNCs) that produce dually cooperative cancer therapy through spatiotemporally selective thermo-chemotherapy. The Pt4+-coordinated polycarboxylic nanogel is explored as the nanoreactor template, which is exploited to synthesize bifunctional PtNCs consisting of a zero-valent Pt0 core and a surrounding bivalent Pt2+ shell with tunable ratios through a facile and controllable reduction. Without light exposure, chemotherapeutic Pt2+ ions are tightly bound on the surface of PtNCs, efficiently reducing undesirable drug leakage and nonselective damage on normal tissues/cells. Upon light exposure, PtNCs generate much heat via photothermal conversion from the Pt0 core and simultaneously trigger a rapid release of chemotherapeutic Pt2+ ions, thereby leading to the spatiotemporally light-activatable synergistic effect of thermo-chemotherapy. Moreover, PtNCs show enhanced tumor accumulation through the heat-triggered hydrophilicity hydrophobicity transition upon immediate light exposure after injection, dramatically facilitating in vivo tumor regression through their cooperative anticancer efficiency. This rational design of spatiotemporally activatable nanoparticles provides an insightful tool for precise cancer therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Nanoreactors; Oncology; Tumors; Adverse side effects; Cancer Chemotherapy; Cancer therapy; Nanocomplexes; Photo-thermal conversions; Photothermal therapy; Synergistic effect; Tumor accumulation; Platinum compounds"
"High expression levels of AGGF1 and MFAP4 predict primary platinum-based chemoresistance and are associated with adverse prognosis in patients with serous ovarian cancer",2019,"Primary platinum-based chemoresistance occurs in approximately one-third of patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC); however, traditional clinical indicators are poor predictors of chemoresistance. So we aimed to identify novel genes as predictors of primary platinum-based chemoresistance. Gene expression microarray analyses were performed to identify the genes related to primary platinum resistance in SOC on two discovery datasets (GSE51373, GSE63885) and one validation dataset (TCGA). Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed to evaluate the predictive values of the genes for platinum resistance. Machine learning algorithms (linear kernel support vector machine and artificial neural network) were applied to build prediction models. Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazards regression and log-rank tests were used to assess the effects of these gene signatures for platinum resistance on prognosis in two independent datasets (GSE9891, GSE32062). AGGF1 and MFAP4 were found highly expressed in patients with platinum-resistant SOC and independently predicted platinum resistance. Platinum resistance prediction models based on these targets had robust predictive power (highest AUC: 0.8056, 95% CI: 0.6338-0.9773; lowest AUC: 0.7245, 95% CI: 0.6052-0.8438). An AGGF1- and MFAP4-centered protein interaction network was built, and hypothetical regulatory pathways were identified. Enrichment analysis indicated that aberrations of extracellular matrix may play important roles in platinum resistance in SOC. High AGGF1 and MFAP4 expression levels were also related to shorter recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with SOC after adjustment for other clinical variables. Therefore, AGGF1 and MFAP4 are potential predictive biomarkers for response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival outcomes in SOC. ? 2018 Ivyspring International Publisher.","antineoplastic metal complex; messenger RNA; adult; age; aged; aggf1 gene; Article; artificial neural network; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chemosensitivity; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; copy number variation; DNA methylation; DNA microarray; extracellular matrix; female; gene expression level; gene expression profiling; human; major clinical study; mfap4 gene; mRNA expression level; ovary cancer; overall survival; predictive value; protein interaction; recurrence free survival; regulator gene; support vector machine; survival analysis; treatment response"
"Identification of key genes and pathways downstream of the β-catenin-TCF7L1 complex in pancreatic cancer cells using bioinformatics analysis",2019,"As a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, the β-catenin-transcription factor 7 like 1 (TCF7L1) complex activates transcription and regulates downstream target genes that serve important roles in the pathology of pancreatic cancer. To identify associated key genes and pathways downstream of the β-catenin-TCF7L1 complex in pancreatic cancer cells, the current study used the gene expression profiles GSE57728 and GSE90926 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. GSE57728 is an array containing information regarding β-catenin knockdown and GSE90926 was developed by high throughput sequencing to provide information regarding TCF7L1 knockdown. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were sorted separately and the shared 88 DEGs, including 37 upregulated and 51 downregulated genes, were screened. Clustering analysis of these DEGs was performed by heatmap analysis. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were then performed using FunRich software and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, which revealed that the DEGs were predominantly enriched in terms associated with transport, transcription factor activity, and cytokine and chemokine mediated signaling pathway process. A DEG-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, consisting of 58 nodes and 171 edges, was then constructed using Cytoscape software and the 15 genes with top node degrees were selected as the hub genes. Overall survival (OS) analysis of the 88 DEGs was performed and the relevant gene expression datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Consequently, three upregulated and seven downregulated genes were identified to be associated with prognosis. Furthermore, high expression levels of five downregulated genes, including CXCL5, CYP27C1, FUBP1, CDK14 and TRIM24, were associated with worse OS. In addition, CDK14 and TRIM24 were revealed as hub genes in the PPI network and both were confirmed to be involved in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Promoter analysis was also applied to the five downregulated DEGs associated with prognosis, which revealed that TCF7L1 may serve as a transcription factor of the DEGs. In conclusion, the genes and pathways identified in the current study may provide potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"BCL2 overexpression: Clinical implication and biological insights in acute myeloid leukemia",2019,"Background: BCL2 protein inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199) has been authorized by Food and Drug Administration for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphoid leukemia with 17p deletion. Although venetoclax/ABT-199 also caused cell death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whether it could be applied to clinical treatment needs further studies. Here, we revealed clinical implication of BCL2 overexpression in de novo adult AML, and may provide theoretical basis for targeted therapy using venetoclax. Methods: BCL2 expression was analyzed in adult AML patients from public datasets The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and confirmed by another independent cohort from our own data. Results: BCL2 expression showed up-regulated in AML patients among TCGA data and confirmed by our own data. BCL2 overexpression was correlated with FAB-M0/M1, whereas BCL2 under-expression was related to FAB-M5. However, BCL2 expression has no effect on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of AML patients (determined in BCL2 low and BCL2 high groups). Interestingly, in the BCL2 low group, patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto/allo-HSCT) had significantly better OS and LFS compared with patients only received chemotherapy, whereas, no significant difference was found in OS and LFS between chemotherapy and auto/allo-HSCT patients in the BCL2 high group. BCL2 expression was found positively correlated with HOX family gene, and negatively correlated with tumor suppressor microRNA such as miR-195, miR-497, and miR-193b. Conclusions: BCL2 overexpression identified specific FAB subtypes of AML, but it did not affect prognosis. Patients with BCL2 overexpression did not benefit from auto/allo-HSCT among whole-cohort-AML and cytogenetically normal AML. ? 2019 The Author(s).",""
"Bioresponsive Protein Complex of aPD1 and aCD47 Antibodies for Enhanced Immunotherapy",2019,"Despite the promising efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in treating many types of cancers, the clinical benefits have often been restricted by the low objective response rates and systemic immune-related adverse events. Here, a bioresponsive ICB treatment is developed based on the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive protein complex for controlled sequential release of anti- ""don't eat me"" signal antibody (aCD47) and antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (aPD1), by leveraging the abundant ROS in the tumor microenvironment (TME). These protein complexes can also act as scavengers of ROS in the TME to reverse the immunosuppressive responses, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in vivo. In a melanoma cancer model, the synergistic antitumor efficacy was achieved, which was accompanied by enhanced T cell immune responses together with reduced immunosuppressive responses. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Antibodies; Cell death; Diseases; Drug delivery; Drug products; Medical nanotechnology; T-cells; Targeted drug delivery; Anti-tumor efficacy; bioresponsive; immune checkpoint blockade; Immune response; immunotherapy; Protein complexes; Reactive oxygen species; Tumor microenvironment; Controlled drug delivery"
"Prognostic role of preoperative platelet, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: A multicenter prospective study",2019,"Background: The relationships between coagulation factors and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis have been intensively studied. However, no previous study has investigated the combined effects of preoperative platelet (PLT), fibrinogen (FIB), and D-dimer (D-D) levels on the prognosis of NSCLC. Methods: A multicenter prospective study was conducted over seven hospitals. A total of 395 patients diagnosed with operable NSCLC for the first time were included and followed-up until disease progression or the end of the study. Baseline demographic and clinicopathological information, and preoperative coagulation test results were collected for each patient. Univariate and multilevel survival analyses were conducted using Cox regression and shared frailty models. Results: Multilevel analyses revealed that there was a marginally significant association between elevated PLT level (&gt; 215 × 10 9 /L) and unfavorable progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio 2.42, P = 0.05), whereas preoperative FIB and D-D were not significant prognostic factors for PFS (P = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Compared to patients with one elevation of the three coagulation factors, patients with at least two elevations of the three factors had a significantly higher risk of cancer progression (hazard ratio 4.62, P = 0.02). Conclusion: The number of elevated preoperative coagulation factors may have a significant effect on PFS and could be used to predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients after surgery. Future studies are warranted to further investigate the interactions between these three coagulation factors. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Altered expression of the CSMD1 gene in the peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients",2019,"Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heritable, refractory, and devastating psychiatric disorder. Previous studies have shown that the variants of CUB and sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) demonstrate significant genome-wide association with SCZ. However, few studies have been conducted on the effect of antipsychotics on the expression levels of CSMD1. This study explored whether a change occurs in the expression of the CSMD1 gene before and after antipsychotic treatment in SCZ patients. Methods: The study population comprised Han Chinese patients from eastern China, including 32 SCZ patients and 48 healthy controls. The expression of CSMD1 before and after treatment in the SCZ group and between the two groups was analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: The expression levels of the CSMD1 gene in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SCZ patients were lower than those in the healthy controls. The expression levels of the CSMD1 gene in the PBMCs of the SCZ patients after antipsychotic treatment were higher than those in the baseline SCZ patients (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results showed that the expression levels of CSMD1 are correlated with the development and treatment of SCZ, providing further evidence for the involvement of CSMD1 in SCZ. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amisulpride; aripiprazole; olanzapine; quetiapine; risperidone; ziprasidone; biological marker; CSMD1 protein, human; membrane protein; neuroleptic agent; tumor suppressor protein; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; CSMD1 gene; disease course; female; gene; gene expression; gene expression level; genetic association; genetic correlation; Han Chinese; human; human cell; male; molecular pathology; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; schizophrenia; treatment duration; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; China; drug effect; epidemiology; gene expression; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; middle aged; mononuclear cell; physiology; procedures; risk factor; schizophrenia; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers; China; Female; Gene Expression; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Membrane Proteins; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"Saporin-loaded CD44 and EGFR dual-targeted nanogels for potent inhibition of metastatic breast cancer in vivo",2019,"Metastasis poses a long-standing treatment challenge for many cancers including breast cancer. Once spreading out, cell-selective delivery of drug appears especially critical. Here, we report on epidermal growth factor receptor and CD44 dual-targeted hyaluronic acid nanogels (EGFR/CD44-NGs) that afford enhanced targetability and protein therapy for metastatic 4T1 breast cancer in vivo. Flow cytometry in CD44 and EGFR-positive 4T1 metastatic breast cancer cells showed over 6-fold higher cellular uptake of EGFR/CD44-NGs than mono-targeting CD44-NGs. MTT and scratch assays displayed that saporin-loaded EGFR/CD44-NGs (Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs) was highly potent in inhibiting growth as well as migration of 4T1 cells in vitro, with an IC 50 of 5.36 nM, which was 1.7-fold lower than that for Sap-CD44-NGs. In 4T1-luc metastatic breast cancer model in mice, Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs exhibited significant inhibition of tumor metastasis to lung at a small dose of 3.33 nmol Sap equiv./kg. Increasing the dosage to 13.3 nmol Sap equiv./kg resulted in further reduced lung metastasis without causing notable adverse effects. These dual-targeted nanogels with improved cancer cell selectivity provide a novel platform for combating breast cancer metastasis. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","epidermal growth factor receptor; Hermes antigen; hyaluronic acid; nanocarrier; nanogel; saporin; unclassified drug; drug carrier; EGFR protein, mouse; epidermal growth factor receptor; hyaluronic acid; hyaluronic acid binding protein; nanoparticle; 4T1 cell line; animal cell; animal cell culture; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; breast cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; cell migration; drug delivery system; flow cytometry; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung metastasis; metastatic breast cancer; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; priority journal; protein synthesis; wound healing assay; administration and dosage; animal; Bagg albino mouse; breast tumor; cell motion; chemistry; drug effect; experimental mammary neoplasm; female; gel; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; pharmacology; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Movement; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; ErbB Receptors; Female; Flow Cytometry; Gels; Hyaluronan Receptors; Hyaluronic Acid; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nanoparticles; Neoplasm Metastasis; Saporins"
"Highly fluorescent conjugated microporous polymers for concurrent adsorption and detection of uranium",2019,"Uranium is one of the most important elements in the nuclear industry, but it also causes potential health risks to human beings when released into the natural environment. It is highly desired to develop a strategy that enables concurrent uranium detection and adsorption for sustainable development of nuclear energy and environmental conservation. In this work, a fluorescent conjugated microporous polymer consisting of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene and amidoxime/carboxylate-substituted fluorene (CMPAO) is designed and synthesized for efficient extraction and detection of uranyl ions. The amidoxime ligands on CMPAO provide selective uranium-binding properties, while hydrophilic carboxylate groups largely enhance aqueous dispersibility leading to adequate contact with uranyl ions. As a consequence, CMPAO is capable of selective and efficient extraction of uranyl ions, achieving an optimal sorption capacity of 251.9 mg U g-1. Moreover, the adsorption of uranium on CMPAO leads to dramatic fluorescence quenching, allowing selective and sensitive detection of uranyl ions by fluorescence spectroscopy. Importantly, thanks to the signal amplification by the conjugated skeleton, CMPAO has a fairly low detection limit of 1.7 × 10-9 M for uranyl ions in deionized water, which is far below the maximum contamination standard in drinking water of the World Health Organization (6.3 × 10-8 M). ?

"Cathepsin L-mediated resistance of paclitaxel and cisplatin is mediated by distinct regulatory mechanisms",2019,"Background: Cathepsin L (CTSL) is a cysteine protease known to have important roles in regulating cancer cellular resistance to chemotherapy. However mechanism underlying which regulates CTSL-mediated drug resistance remain largely unknown. Methods: We used NSCLC cell lines: A549, A549/TAX (paclitaxel-resistant), A549/DDP (cisplatin-resistant), H460 and PC9 cells, to evaluate CTSL and drug resistance changes. Tumor specimens from 53 patients with NSCLC and Xenograft models was also utilized to explore the regulatory relationship of CTSL, TGF-β, Egr-1 and CREB. Results: TGF-β and smad3 were overexpressed only in A549/TAX cells, silencing TGF-β or smad3 in A549/TAX cells decreased the expression of CTSL and enhanced their sensitivity to paclitaxel. Smad3 binds to the Smad-binding-element(SBE) of the CTSL promoter, resulting in increased activity of the CTSL promoter and subsequent CTSL. Egr-1 and CREB were overexpressed only in A549/DDP cells, and silencing Egr-1 or CREB reduced the expression of CTSL and increased cisplatin cytotoxicity. CREB could affect the activity of the CTSL promoter by binding to it. And the potential regulatory factors of CTSL were consistent in vivo and in human lung cancer. These different regulatory mechanisms of CTSL-mediated drug resistance exist in two other NSCLC cell lines. Conclusion: CTSL-mediated drug resistance to paclitaxel and cisplatin may be modulated by different mechanisms. The results of our study identified different mechanisms regulating CTSL-mediated drug resistance and identified smad3 as a novel regulator of CTSL. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cathepsin L; cisplatin; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; early growth response factor 1; paclitaxel; Smad3 protein; transforming growth factor beta; antineoplastic agent; cathepsin L; cisplatin; CREB1 protein, human; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; early growth response factor 1; EGR1 protein, human; paclitaxel; protein binding; Smad3 protein; SMAD3 protein, human; A-549 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer resistance; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; in vivo study; major clinical study; male; mouse; NCI-H460 cell line; nonhuman; PC-9 cell line; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; cell proliferation; disease model; drug effect; drug resistance; drug screening; genetics; metabolism; promoter region; reporter gene; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cathepsin L; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cisplatin; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Male; Paclitaxel; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; Smad3 Protein; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Dual-specificity phosphatase 5 suppresses ovarian cancer progression by inhibiting il-33 signaling",2019,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are proteins that are reported involved in carcinogenesis, but their roles in OC have not be extensively studied. Here, we found that DUSP5 is markedly down-regulated in OC tissues. We reanalyzed DUSP5 expression in OC using published microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and found that patients with low DUSP5 expression have significantly shorter overall survival than those with high expression (P < 0.001). Down-regulation of DUSP5 in OC tissues was immunohistochemically confirmed in tissue microarrays containing 15 normal ovary tissue samples and 60 OC specimens. Functional studies suggest that DUSP5 silence facilitates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells in vitro. DUSP5 over-expression inhibits cell proliferation but has no effect on OC cell migration or invasion. Mechanistically, silencing DUSP5 transcriptionally activates interleukin 33 (IL-33) expression and secretion. Blockage of IL-33 with a neutralizing anti-IL33 antibody attenuates the effect of DUSP5 silencing to promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, recombinant IL-33 protein treatment dramatically promotes OC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion with DUSP5 over-expression. Our study provides proof of principle that DUSP5 down-regulation promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells via activation of IL-33 signaling. ? 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

"The role of DKK1 in Alzheimer's disease: A potential intervention point of brain damage prevention?",2019,"Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a secretory glycoprotein discovered for ‘inducing generation of head’, is an endogenous inhibitor of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It was found to be involved in many pathophysiological processes in vivo. Abnormal expression of DKK1 will alter expressions of related proteins and genes not only in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway but also in other signaling pathways. Previous studies of DKK1 focused on its function in tumors. In recent years, a large number of studies have shown that it plays an important role in embryonic development, neural regeneration, synaptogenesis and so on. Therefore, its role in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as neurodysplasia, cognitive impairment and emotional disorder, has attracted increasing attention. At present, the role of DKK1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the research hot topics. This article reviewed the research progress of its role in AD in order to provide new ideas and directions for further studies on the pathogenesis and treatment of AD. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","beta catenin; dickkopf 1 protein; frizzled protein; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; tau protein; Wnt protein; Alzheimer disease; brain damage; central nervous system disease; excitotoxicity; human; nerve cell differentiation; nerve degeneration; nerve regeneration; neuropathology; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; Review; signal transduction"
"Effective cancer immunotherapy by Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide-gold nanocomposites through dendritic cell activation and memory T cell response",2019,"Polysaccharides purified from natural herbs possess immunoregulatory functions, while the efficacy of natural polysaccharides on cancer treatment remains unreliable, likely due to their low prescribed doses and fast clearances in clinical settings. In this study, gold nanocomposites containing Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP-Au) efficiently induced dendritic cell (DC) activation, evident by the increase of CD80/CD86/CD40/MHCII, decrease of phagocytic ability and acid phosphatase activity, and increased cytokine transcription. GLP-Au significantly promoted the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes. DC/T cell co-culture study proved that GLP-Au activation on DC directly resulted in T cell proliferation. GLP-Au exhibited strong inhibitory effects on 4T1 tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis when combined with doxorubicin. GLP-Au recovered body weight loss by doxorubicin and increased the percentage of CD4+/CD44+ memory T cells.

"Exposure to Chinese famine in early life modifies the association between hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease",2019,"Background and aims: The Great Leap Forward Famine during 1959–1961 was the world's largest famine, and its adverse long-term effects might be more apparent in the coming decade with ageing of the exposed populations. The aim of this study was to examine whether the Chinese Famine modified the effect of hyperglycaemia on cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods and results: We used data of 4337 adults born between 1952 and 1964 collected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) between hyperglycaemia and CVD. The prevalence of CVD showed significant difference among different famine exposure cohorts (P = 0.0156). After multivariable adjustment, the ORs (95% CIs) were as follows: 1.46 (0.94, 2.26) for late childhood, 1.76 (1.06, 2.90) for mid childhood, 1.40 (0.86, 2.27) for early childhood, 2.55 (1.30, 5.02) for the foetal cohort and 1.10 (0.63, 1.95) for the non-exposed cohort. There was a significant interaction between hyperglycaemia and famine exposure for CVD (P = 0.0374). In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that the effect of hyperglycaemia on CVD in the foetal exposure cohort was significantly higher than those in any of the other famine-exposed cohorts, especially in those who lived in rural areas (OR: 4.67, 95% CI: 1.70–12.84), those who lived in severe famine areas (OR: 5.01, 95% CI: 1.22–20.66) and those who were men (OR: 3.66, 95% CI: 1.01–13.33). Conclusion: Exposure to the Chinese Famine, especially during the foetal stage of life, aggravated the association between hyperglycaemia and CVD. ? 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; childhood; Chinese; disease association; female; human; hunger; hyperglycemia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; rural area; age; blood; cardiovascular disease; child; child development; China; comparative study; gestational age; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; life event; longitudinal study; malnutrition; maternal nutrition; metabolism; nutritional disorder; pathophysiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; prevalence; prognosis; risk assessment; risk factor; sex factor; time factor; biological marker; Age Factors; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child Development; Child Nutrition Disorders; Child, Preschool; China; Famine; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Life Change Events; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Malnutrition; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prevalence; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Time Factors"
"MicroRNA?200a suppresses migration and invasion and enhances the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells by inhibiting the HGF/c?Met signaling pathway",2019,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), an activator of the c-Met signaling pathway, is involved in tumor invasiveness, metastasis and radiotherapy resistance. In the present study, a novel HGF regulatory pathway in lung cancer involving microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is described. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analyses demonstrated that HGF was upregulated and associated with miR-200a downregulation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples compared with normallungtissues.TheassociationbetweenHGFandmiR-200a was associated with the degree of tumor malignancy and cell migration and invasion. miR-200a negatively regulated HGF expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of the HGF mRNA. miR-200a overexpression induced HGF downregulation, decreased NSCLC cell migration and invasion, promoted apoptosis, and decreased cell survival in A549 and H1299 cells in response to ionizing radiation. The present results revealed a previously uncharacterized role of miRNA-200a in regulating tumor malignancy and radiosensitivity by suppressing HGF expression, a key factor in the HGF/c-Met pathway. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"KLF2 regulates osteoblast differentiation by targeting of Runx2",2019,"Osteoblast differentiation plays a critical role in bone formation and maintaining balance in bone remodeling. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) is a central transcription factor regulating osteoblast differentiation and promoting bone mineralization. Until now, the molecular regulatory basis and especially the gene regulatory network of osteogenic differentiation have been unclear. Kr?ppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a zinc finger structure and DNA-binding transcription factor. The current study aimed to investigate the physiological function of KLF2 in osteoblast differentiation. Our results indicate that KLF2 is expressed in pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts. Interestingly, KLF2 expression is increased in osteoblasts during the osteoblastic differentiation process. Overexpression of KLF2 in MC3T3-E1 cells promoted the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation marker genes Alp, Osx, and Ocn, and stimulated mineralization by increasing Runx2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, knockdown of KLF2 produced the opposite effects. Importantly, we found that KLF2 could physically interact with Runx2. KLF2 promoted osteoblast differentiation by regulating Runx2 and physically interacting with Runx2. Taken together, the findings of this study identify KLF2 as a novel regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Our findings suggest that KLF2 might be a new therapeutic target for bone disease. ? 2018, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","kruppel like factor 2; transcription factor RUNX2; Klf2 protein, mouse; kruppel like factor; Runx2 protein, mouse; transcription factor RUNX2; Article; cell differentiation; marker gene; MC3T3-E1 cell line; mineralization; osteoblast; physiological process; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; animal; cell line; cytology; gene knockdown; genetics; human; metabolism; mouse; physiology; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Mice; Osteoblasts"
"Nomogram incorporating clinicopathological parameters to predict the survival of patients with mantle cell lymphoma",2019,"This study intended to present a practicable prognostic nomogram for patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The clinical data of 281 patients were reviewed. A nomogram that could predict overall survival (OS) was constructed based on the Cox proportional hazard model. To compare the capacity of the nomogram with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI) scoring systems, we used the concordance index (C-index) to validate the veracity and the calibration curve. Age, Eastern Cooperation Oncology Group, lactate dehydrogenase, white cell count and Ki-67 were independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis and were subsequently included in the nomogram construction. The C-index was 0.81 and 0.79 in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively, which were superior to the predictive capacity of the IPI and MIPI systems in both cohorts. The nomogram makes it possible for physicians to predict patient OS individually and correctly, but certain limitations are noted. ? American Federation for Medical Research 2019.

"NEAT1 induces osteosarcoma development by modulating the miR-339-5p/TGF-β1 pathway",2019,"The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been recognized as a tumor oncogene involved in the development of multiple cancers. However, the function of NEAT1 and its molecular mechanism in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. First, we detected the NEAT1 expression in OS cell lines by performing quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Next, the effects of NEAT1 on OS cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were tested by lentivirus-mediated downregulation. We observed that inhibition of NEAT1 restrained OS cell progression greatly. Interestingly, in the last few years, increasing studies have shown that some lncRNAs can act as miRNA sponges and reduce the amount of the same. Here, we found that NEAT1 can modulate OS development via sponging miR-339-5p. MiR-339-5p was significantly decreased in OS cells, and its overexpression can remarkably repress the OS proliferation. These results indicated that NEAT1 could function as a tumor oncogene in OS by inhibiting miR-339-5p in vitro. Then, the following assays validated that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) can act as a functional target of miR-339-5p in OS cells. Finally, we indicated that NEAT1 could mediate TGF-β1 expression by competitively sponging miR-339-5p. NEAT1 induced OS cell proliferation and cell mobility by binding to miR-339-5p and increasing TGF-β1 in OS. It was demonstrated in our study that lncRNA NEAT1 could impede miR-339-5p expression to maintain the expression of TGF-β1, which led to the development of OS. Our findings implied that the novel identified NEAT1/miR-339-5p/TGF-β1 axis might be a new molecular pathway or therapeutic target for OS diagnosis and treatment. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","long noncoding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; microRNA 339 5p; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; 143B cell line; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; cell growth; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; embryo; gene expression; gene overexpression; HEK293T cell line; hFOB 1.19 cell line; human; human cell; KHOS/NP cell line; MG-63 cell line; osteosarcoma; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SaOS-2 cell line"
"SILAC Quantitative Proteomics and Biochemical Analyses Reveal a Novel Molecular Mechanism by Which ADAM12S Promotes the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells through Upregulating Hexokinase 1",2019,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for ?14% of total lung cancer, which is the worldwide leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer. Although SCLC can be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, its 5 year survival rate is still below 7%. Therefore, it is essential to discover new molecules and elucidate the underlying mechanisms modulating the tumorigenesis and metastasis of SCLC for the unmet medical needs. The secreted form of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12S) is highly expressed in SCLC and promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of SCLC cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still elusive. Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics, we identify 82 ADAM12S-regulated proteins in an SCLC cell line. Our proteomics and biochemical analyses discover that ADAM12S overexpression elevates while ADAM12 knockdown reduces the rate-limiting enzyme hexokinase 1 (HK1) in glycolysis. Through bioinformatics analyses, genetic manipulation, and in vitro assays, we further reveal that ADAM12S promotes the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of SCLC cells through upregulating HK1. This work links ADAM12S to glucose metabolic pathways in its attribution to the tumorigenesis and metastasis of SCLC cells and might provide valuable information for the exploration of therapeutic intervention for SCLC. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","ADAM12 protein; arginine; cell protein; glucose; glucose transporter 4; hexokinase 1; lactic acid; lysine; messenger RNA; aerobic glycolysis; Article; biochemical analysis; bioinformatics; carcinogenesis; cell culture; cell invasion; cell lysate; cell migration; cell proliferation; colony formation; controlled study; genetic manipulation; glucose intake; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; lung adenocarcinoma; metabolism; metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; proteomics; sarcoplasmic reticulum; small cell lung cancer; squamous cell carcinoma; upregulation; Western blotting"
"Doxorubicin conjugated with nanodiamonds and in free form commit glioblastoma cells to heterodromous fates",2019,"Aim: To mechanistically compare the effects of doxorubicin (DOX) and DOX conjugated with nanodiamonds (Nano-DOX) on human glioblastoma cells (GC). Materials & methods: GC viablity, proliferation and activation of apoptosis and autophagy was assayed in response to DOX and Nano-DOX. Expression and release of HMGB1 were measured and its role in apoptosis and autophagy probed in response to DOX and Nano-DOX. Results: DOX induced apoptosis in GC while Nano-DOX induced autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy in Nano-DOX-Treated GC promoted apoptosis. DOX suppressed the emission of HMGB1 while Nano-DOX stimulated HMGB1 emission which was attenuated when autophagy was repressed. Blocking of HMGB1 emission mitigated autophagy and enhanced apoptosis in Nano-DOX-Treated GC. Exogenously administered HMGB1 promoted autophagy and protected against apoptosis in both Nano-DOX-Treated GC and DOX-Treated GC. Conclusions: Nano-DOX is a potent autophagy activator as opposed to DOX as an apoptosis inducer. Nano-DOX initiates a mutual reinforcement loop between autophagy and HMGB1 in GC and thereby protects GC against apoptosis. ? 2019 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.","doxorubicin; high mobility group B1 protein; doxorubicin; high mobility group B1 protein; nanodiamond; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cell proliferation; cell viability; concentration response; confocal microscopy; controlled study; down regulation; drug delivery system; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; staining; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting; animal; chemistry; drug effect; glioblastoma; metabolism; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin; Glioblastoma; HMGB1 Protein; Humans; Nanodiamonds"
"Whi2: a new player in amino acid sensing",2019,"A critical function of human, yeast, and bacterial cells is the ability to sense and respond to available nutrients such as glucose and amino acids. Cells must also detect declining nutrient levels to adequately prepare for starvation conditions by inhibiting cell growth and activating autophagy. The evolutionarily conserved protein complex TORC1 regulates these cellular responses to nutrients, and in particular to amino acid availability. Recently, we found that yeast Whi2 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and a human counterpart, KCTD11, that shares a conserved BTB structural domain, are required to suppress TORC1 activity under low amino acid conditions. Using yeast, the mechanisms were more readily dissected. Unexpectedly, Whi2 suppresses TORC1 activity independently of the well-known SEACIT–GTR pathway, analogous to the GATOR1–RAG pathway in mammals. Instead, Whi2 requires the plasma membrane-associated phosphatases Psr1 and Psr2, which were known to bind Whi2, although their role was unknown. Yeast WHI2 was previously reported to be involved in regulating several fundamental cellular processes including cell cycle arrest, general stress responses, the Ras–cAMP–PKA pathway, autophagy, and mitophagy, and to be frequently mutated in the yeast knockout collections and in genome evolution studies. Most of these observations are likely explained by the ability of Whi2 to inhibit TORC1. Thus, understanding the function of yeast Whi2 will provide deeper insights into the disease-related KCTD family proteins and the pathogenesis of plant and human fungal infections. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","amino acid; leucine; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; unclassified drug; whi2 protein; amino acid; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; Whi2 protein, S cerevisiae; human; mycosis; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Amino Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Humans; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"
"Characteristics and workload of pediatricians in China",2019,"OBJECTIVES: Although it is widely believed that China is facing a major shortage of pediatricians, the real situation of the current national status of pediatric human resources and their working conditions has not been evaluated to date. METHODS: We administered a survey to 54 214 hospitals from all 31 provinces in mainland China from 2015 to 2016. Hospital directors of all secondary and tertiary hospitals with pediatric services and a random sample (10%) of primary hospitals provided information on number of pediatricians and their educational levels, specialties, workloads, dropout rates, and other hospital characteristics. A data set of medical resources and socioeconomic information regarding each region (1997–2016) was constructed from the Chinese National Statistics Bureau. The Gini coefficient was used to describe the geographical distributions of pediatricians and hospitals. RESULTS: There were 135 524 pediatricians in China or ?4 pediatricians per 10 000 children. Pediatricians’ average educational level was low, with ?32% having only 3 years of junior college training after high school. The distribution of pediatricians was extremely skewed (Gini coefficient 0.61), and the imbalance of highly educated pediatricians was even more skewed (Gini coefficient 0.68). The dropout rate of pediatricians was 12.6%. Despite an increase in the Chinese government’s financial investment in health over the last decade, physicians have been burdened with a greater workload. CONCLUSIONS: Uneven development of the pediatric care system, inadequately trained pediatricians, low job satisfaction, and unmet demand for pediatric care are the major challenges facing China’s pediatric health care system.

"MiR-221 Promotes Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Migration via Targeting PHF2",2019,"MicroRNAs (MiRNAs), which regulate the gene expression leading to translational inhibition or mRNA degradation, are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Previous studies have demonstrated that miR-221 was one of the most consistent overexpressed miRNAs in several types of cancer. However, the role of miR-221 in human liver cancer progression is not yet fully elucidated. Levels of miR-221 and plant homeodomain finger 2 (PHF2) expressions in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines were detected using western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Cell migration was studied using the transwell assays. A dual-luciferase reporter system was used to validate the target gene of miR-221. The results indicated that miR-221 promoted HCC cell migration. By performing subsequent systematic bioinformatic analyses, we found PHF2 was the target gene of miR-221 and the direct binding relationship was further validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. In addition, lower expression of PHF2 promoted HCC cell migration and linked to worse overall survival in HCC patients. Finally, the negative correlation between miR-221 and PHF2 expression levels in HCC specimens was further confirmed. Taken together, our findings implied that miR-221 could be a potential candidate for the therapeutics of HCC metastasis. ? 2019 Yi Fu et al.","microRNA 221; homeodomain protein; microRNA; MIRN221 microRNA, human; PHF2 protein, human; RNA; tumor protein; adult; Article; bioinformatics; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cell migration; controlled study; female; gene expression level; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; liver cell carcinoma; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; MHCC97 cell line; middle aged; overall survival; plant homeodomain finger 2 gene; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SMMC-7721 cell line; tumor gene; tumor thrombus; tumor volume; Western blotting; wound healing assay; biosynthesis; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Movement; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hep G2 Cells; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Proteins; RNA, Neoplasm"
"Cancer-Selective Bioreductive Chemotherapy Mediated by Dual Hypoxia-Responsive Nanomedicine upon Photodynamic Therapy-Induced Hypoxia Aggravation",2019,"Stimuli-responsive drug delivery has rendered promising utilities in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, cancer selectivity as well as sensitivity still remains critical challenges that would undermine the therapeutic efficacy of chemodrugs and cause undesired systemic toxicity. Herein, a dual hypoxia-responsive drug delivery system was developed to enable photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced drug release and drug activation intermediated via PDT-induced hypoxia. Particularly, tumor-targeting and hypoxia-dissociable nanoparticles (NPs) were self-assembled from the amphiphilic polyethylenimine-alkyl nitroimidazole [PEI-ANI, (PA)] and hyaluronic acid-chlorin e6 (HA-Ce6) to encapsulate bioreductive chemodrug, tirapazamine (TPZ). After systemic administration, the obtained PA/HA-Ce6@TPZ NPs enabled effective tumor accumulation due to HA-mediated cancer targeting. Upon receptor-mediated endocytosis, light irradiation (660 nm, 10 mW/cm2) produced high levels of reactive oxygen species to mediate PDT and generated a severe local hypoxic environment to dissociate the NPs and selectively release TPZ, as a consequence of hypoxia-triggered hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transformation of ANI. In the meantime, TPZ was activated under hypoxia, finally contributing to a synergistic anticancer treatment between PDT and hypoxia-strengthened bioreductive chemotherapy. This study, therefore, demonstrates a suitable strategy for cancer-selective drug delivery as well as programmed combination therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Hyaluronic acid; Medical nanotechnology; Molecular biology; Photodynamic therapy; Tumors; Drug delivery system; Hypoxic environments; Photodynamic therapy (PDT); Reactive oxygen species; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Stimuli-responsive drug deliveries; Systemic administration; Therapeutic efficacy; Targeted drug delivery; alkyl group; antineoplastic agent; hyaluronic acid; nitroimidazole; polyethyleneimine; reactive oxygen metabolite; tirapazamine; 4T1 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; Bagg albino mouse; cancer chemotherapy; controlled study; drug activation; drug blood level; drug delivery system; drug release; drug selectivity; drug targeting; endocytosis; experimental hypoxia; female; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; irradiation; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nanomedicine; NCTC clone 929 cell line; nonhuman; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); systemic therapy; tumor xenograft; xenograft"
"Biofunctional magnetic hybrid nanomaterials for theranostic applications",2019,"Cancer is a major disease that seriously threatens human health and is a leading cause of human death. At present, the commonly used cancer treatment methods are surgical therapy, chemical drug therapy and radiation therapy (RT). However, these treatments all have their own shortcomings and cannot perfectly meet the needs of clinical diagnosis and treatment. It is of great significance to improve the diagnosis and treatment level, so that the curative effect and quality of life of tumor patients can be improved. The rapid development of nanotechnology has brought hope to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and the appearance of biofunctional magnetic hybrid nanomaterials (MHNs) has provided a new possibilities for the integration of cancer diagnosis and treatment. As a promising research direction, the multifunctional nanoplatform integrates imaging diagnosis, drug therapy and drug delivery. Better treatment effects and fewer side effects can be achieved by optimizing materials to build stable, efficient, and safe MHNs with combined functions of multimodal imaging and various treatments. This review focuses on not only the research progress of MHNs but also their applications and development trend in the integration of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

"Intelligent protein-coated bismuth sulfide and manganese oxide nanocomposites obtained by biomineralization for multimodal imaging-guided enhanced tumor therapy",2019,"Radiotherapy (RT) has been used clinically to overcome cancer in recent decades. However, the abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME), involving hypoxia, acidosis and a dense extracellular matrix, is found to be related to the resistance of tumors to RT. Herein, intelligent bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated Bi2S3 and MnO2 (Bi2S3-MnO2) nanocomposites synthesized via biomineralization are capable of modulating the hypoxic TME effectively to enhance the efficacy of RT. After intravenous injection, the BSA-Bi2S3-MnO2 nanocomposites show efficient accumulation in tumors, where endogenous H2O2 can react with MnO2 to generate oxygen in situ, leading to increased tumor oxygenation to overcome the hypoxia-associated resistance to RT. Moreover, the photothermal effect induced by the BSA-Bi2S3-MnO2 nanocomposites further relieves hypoxia in the TME and, finally, synergistically improves the effects of RT. In this work, we present a simple strategy to fabricate intelligent therapeutic nanoparticles to improve therapeutic efficiency towards cervical cancer. This journal is ?

"The role of miRNAs in the invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer",2019,"Cervical cancer (CC) with early metastasis of the primary tumor results in poor prognosis and poor therapeutic outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that play a substantial role in regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally and influence the development and progression of tumors. Numerous studies have discovered that miRNAs play significant roles in the invasion and metastasis of CC by affecting specific pathways, including Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways. miRNAs also effectively modulate the process of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Many studies provide new insights into the role of miRNAs and the pathogenesis of metastatic CC.

"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor mediates the cardiac developmental toxicity of EOM from PM2.5 in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells",2019,"Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been found to be associated with congenital heart defects, but the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Our previous study revealed that extractable organic matter (EOM) from PM2.5 exerted cardiac developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. The aim of the current study is to explore the effects of EOM on cardiac differentiation of P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma stem cells. We found that EOM at 10 μg/ml (a non-cytotoxic dose level) significantly reduced the proportion of cardiac muscle troponin (cTnT) positive cells and the percentage of spontaneously beating embryoid bodies, indicating a severe inhibition of cardiac differentiation. Immunofluorescence and qPCR data demonstrated that EOM increased the expression levels of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its target gene Cyp1A1 and diminished the expression level of β-catenin. Furthermore, EOM treatment significantly upregulated cell proliferation rate and elevated the percentage of γH2A.X positive cells without affecting apoptosis. It is worth noting that the EOM-induced changes in gene expression, cellular proliferation and DNA double strain breaks were attenuated by the AhR antagonist CH223191. In conclusion, our data indicate that AhR mediates the inhibitory effects of EOM (from PM2.5) on the cardiac differentiation of P19 cells. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cell death; Cell proliferation; Gene expression; Hydrocarbons; Particles (particulate matter); Polymerase chain reaction; Stem cells; Toxicity; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Cardiac differentiation; Cell proliferation rate; Cellular proliferations; Congenital heart defects; Extractable organic matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); PM2.5; Heart; 6 [[2 [[4 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 5 (4 methyl 1h imidazol 2 yl) 2 pyrimidinyl]amino]ethyl]amino]nicotinonitrile; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; beta catenin; ch 223191; cytochrome P450 1A1; extractable organic matter; gamma histone H2AX; histone H2AX; organic matter; protein inhibitor; troponin T; unclassified drug; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; microRNA; MIRN19 microRNA, mouse; cancer; cardiovascular system; cell; chemoreception; cyprinid; embryo; gene expression; hydrocarbon; organic matter; particulate matter; rodent; toxicity; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; congenital heart malformation; controlled study; developmental toxicity; DNA strand breakage; embryo; embryoid body; gene expression; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; P19 cell line; particulate matter; polymerase chain reaction; protein expression; Wnt signaling; animal; cardiotoxicity; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; embryonal carcinoma stem cell; metabolism; pathology; Danio rerio; Animals; Cardiotoxicity; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells; Gene Expression; Mice; MicroRNAs; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon"
"Oncogenic functions of protein kinase D2 and D3 in regulating multiple cancer-related pathways in breast cancer",2019,"Protein Kinase D (PKD) family contains PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 in human. Compared to consistent tumor-suppressive functions of PKD1 in breast cancer, how PKD2/3 functions in breast cancer are not fully understood. In the current study, we found that PKD2 and PKD3 but not PKD1 were preferentially overexpressed in breast cancer and involved in regulating cell proliferation and metastasis. Integrated phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and interactome showed that PKD2 was associated with multiple cancer-related pathways, including adherent junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and cell cycle-related pathways. ELAVL1 was identified as a common hub-node in networks of PKD2/3-regulated phosphoproteins and genes. Silencing ELAVL1 inhibited breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Direct interaction between ELAVL1 and PKD2 or PKD3 was demonstrated. Suppression of PKD2 led to ELAVL1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus without significant affecting ELAVL1 expression. Taken together, we characterized the oncogenic functions of PKD2/3 in breast cancer and their association with cancer-related pathways, which shed lights on the oncogenic roles and mechanisms of PKDs in breast cancer. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Integrated Endotoxin Adsorption and Antibacterial Properties of Cationic Polyurethane Foams for Wound Healing",2019,"Gram-negative bacteria, containing toxic proinflammatory and pyrogenic substances [endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], can lead to infection and associated serious diseases, such as sepsis and septic shock. Development of antimicrobial materials with intrinsically endotoxin adsorption activity can prevent the release of bacterial toxic components while killing bacteria. Herein, a series of imidazolium-type polyurethane (PU) foams with antimicrobial properties were synthesized. The content effects of cationic moieties on the antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus as well as the endotoxin adsorption property were investigated. The obtained PU foams show slightly higher efficiency against two Gram-negative strains than for Gram-positive one and high absorbability of LPS. A wound healing test using P. aeruginosa and its isolated LPS-treated mice as the models further demonstrated that imidazolium-type PU foams combine both antibacterial and endotoxin adsorption properties and may have a potential application as an antimicrobial wound dressing in a clinical setting. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","Escherichia coli; Mammals; Polyurethanes; Rigid foamed plastics; Toxic materials; Anti-microbial activity; Anti-microbial properties; antibacterial; Antibacterial properties; Antimicrobial materials; Imidazolium cation; Mouse models; Polyurethane Foam; Adsorption; antiinfective agent; endotoxin; lipopolysaccharide; polyurethan; polyurethan foam; adsorption; animal; chemistry; drug effect; human; microbiology; mouse; pathogenicity; pathology; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; wound healing; Adsorption; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Endotoxins; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; Mice; Polyurethanes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Wound Healing"
"Circulating spexin decreased and negatively correlated with systemic insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β cell function in obese children",2019,"Objectives: Spexin (SPX) is a novel peptide that has recently emerged as an important regulatory adipokine of obesity and related metabolic disease. Little is known about its role in children. The aim of the current study was to determine the potential role of SPX in obese children and explore its relationships with obesity-related markers, insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β cell function. Method: We studied the levels of serum SPX in 40 obese and 32 normal weight pre-puberty children (mean age was 8.59 ± 1.82 and 8.15 ± 2.03 years in obesity and control groups respectively). We investigated the levels of body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, glucose, insulin, Homeostasis model assessment for insulin-resistant (HOMA-IR, HOMA for β-cell function [HOMA-β]), insulinogenic index and C-peptide index and analyzed their correlations with SPX levels. Results: SPX levels were significantly decreased in obese children compared to controls. Moreover, serum SPX levels were lower in IR obese subjects in contrast with the non-IR obese subjects. Serum SPX concentrations correlated negatively and significantly with triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin level, HOMA-IR, insulinogenic index, and HOMA-β levels in obese children. Conclusions: In summary, serum SPX levels significantly decreased in obese children and negatively correlated with insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell function indicators. Therefore, SPX may play a protective role in the process of glucose homeostasis and is closely related to β cell function in obese children. ? 2019 S.

"Fatty acid synthase enhances colorectal cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via regulating AMPK/mTOR pathway",2019,"Objective: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Materials and methods: FASN levels were analyzed in human CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues by Western blots and immunohistochemistry. Potential roles of FASN in regulating CRC cell proliferation and migration were examined by genetic manipulation in vitro. The molecular signaling was determined to understand the mechanisms of observed FASN effects. Results: FASN level was upregulated in CRC tissues and high expression of FASN was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastases) stage and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Knockdown of FASN attenuated CRC cell proliferation and migration in vitro while FASN overexpression possessed the opposite effects. FASN regulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in CRC cells. Conclusion: FASN enhanced CRC cell proliferation and metastasis potentially through AMPK/mTOR pathway, indicating that FASN/AMPK/mTOR signaling axis may serve as a potential target for the treatment of CRC. ? 2019 Lu et al.","fatty acid synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; cell migration; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; colorectal cancer cell line; controlled study; female; gene knockdown; human; human tissue; in vitro study; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; metastasis; protein expression; signal transduction; upregulation"
"Stem-Cell Therapy for Esophageal Anastomotic Leakage by Autografting Stromal Cells in Fibrin Scaffold",2019,"Esophageal anastomotic leakage (EAL) is a devastating complication for esophagectomy but the available therapies are unsatisfactory. Due to the healing effects of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and supporting capability of fibrin scaffold (FS), we evaluated the efficacy of a stem-cell therapy for EAL by engrafting adult and autologous MSCs (AAMSCs) in FS and investigated the potential mechanism. Twenty-one rabbits were assigned to AAMSC/FS group (n = 12) and control group (n = 9). After harvested, AAMSCs were identified and then labeled with lenti.GFP. To construct EAL model, a polyethylene tube was indwelled through the anastomosis for 1 week. A total of 2 × 106 AAMSCs in 0.2 ml FS were engrafted onto the EAL for the AAMSC/FS group, whereas FS was injected for control. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination was performed after 5 weeks. Esophageal tissues were harvested for macroscopic, histological analyses, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry at 8 weeks. The animal model of EAL was established successfully. MRI scanning revealed a decreased inflammation reaction in AAMSC/FS group. Accordingly, AAMSC/FS group presented a higher closure rate (83.3% vs. 11.1%, p =.02) and lower infection rate (33.3% vs. 88.9%, p =.02). Histological analyses showed the autografted MSCs resided in the injection site. Furthermore, milder inflammation responses and less collagen deposition were observed in AAMSC/FS group. Western blot and immunohistochemistry studies suggested that the therapeutic effect might be related to the secretions of IL-10 and MMP-9. Engrafting AAMSCs in FS could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EAL by suppressing inflammation response and alleviating fibrosis progression.

"Contribution of Human Hair in Solar UV Transmission in Skin: Implications for Melanoma Development",2019,"Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer with its prevalence on the rise. Recently, the melanocyte stem cells in hair follicles have been identified as the possible origin of melanoma upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) through skin. It is hypothesized that colourless vellus hair (predominant in childhood) can serve as an alternative pathway in transmitting these ultraviolet (UV) photons to the stem cells. To investigate this, we have used the CRAIC microspectrophotometer to investigate the optical properties of ‘vellus-like’ hairs and terminal hairs of different colours using UV–VIS–NIR light sources. It was found that the average attenuation coefficient of ‘vellus-like’ hair is significantly lower than that of terminal hair in the UVA (p < 0.0001) and UVB (p < 0.001) wavelength ranges. Next, the optical properties of hairs are applied to simulations for examining their influence on UV transmission into the skin. The results show that the presence of vellus hair would increase the solar UV transmission to the melanocyte stem cell layer significantly. The findings explain why children are particularly vulnerable to sun exposure and the positive correlation found between the incidence of melanoma in adults’ bodies and the number of vellus hairs in these areas. ? 2019, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Cytology; Dermatology; Diseases; Intelligent systems; Light sources; Monte Carlo methods; Oncology; Optical properties; Radiotherapy; Ultraviolet radiation; Attenuation coefficient; Medulla; Melanocyte stem cells; Melanoma; Microspectrophotometry; Skin cancers; Tissue optic; Vellus hair; Stem cells; adult; Article; child; female; hair; hair color; human; human tissue; infrared radiation; male; melanocyte; melanoma; microspectrophotometry; Monte Carlo method; optics; priority journal; radiation attenuation; solar radiation; stem cell; sun exposure; terminal hair; ultraviolet A radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; ultraviolet radiation; vellus hair"
"Hollow Cu2Se Nanozymes for Tumor Photothermal-Catalytic Therapy",2019,"Tumor microenvironment (TME)-mediated cancer therapy, such as chemodynamic therapy (CDT) based on Fenton reaction, has attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, efficient Fenton reactions usually require stringent reaction conditions (low pH value and sufficient H2O2). Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of Fenton reaction within the tumor for enhanced CDT in cancer treatment. Herein, Cu2Se hollow nanocubes (HNCs) are successfully prepared via an anion exchange method using Cu2O nanocubes (NCs) as the template. This method is also successfully used to synthesize Cu2S or CuSSe HNCs with the similar structure. By tuning the reaction time in the process of transforming Cu2O NCs into Cu2Se HNCs, Cu2Se HNCs with optimized performances in high NIR II photothermal conversion efficiency (50.89%) and good Fenton-like properties are obtained. After surface coating, PEGylated Cu2Se HNCs show good water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the significant synergistic effect of combining photothermal therapy (PTT) and CDT based on PEG-Cu2Se HNCs, achieving greatly enhanced efficacy than that obtained by PTT or CDT alone. Moreover, such PEG-Cu2Se HNCs appear to be rather safe for treated animals without noticeable long-term toxicity. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Biocompatibility; Copper oxides; Diseases; Efficiency; Oxidation; Tumors; Anion-exchange methods; Optimized performance; Photothermal conversion efficiencies; Photothermal therapy; Reaction conditions; Synergistic effect; Tumor microenvironment; Water dispersibility; Selenium compounds"
"The Value of Plasma-Based MicroRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Ovarian Cancer",2019,"Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most threatening diseases among women in the world. Plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) may serve as promising diagnostic biomarkers for patients with OC. Materials and Methods: Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based on Exiqon panel, we identified 27 differentially expressed miRNAs from 2 OC pool samples and 1 normal control (NC) pool in the initial screening phase. Then we further validated the identified miRNAs through the training (32 OC vs. 34 NCs) and validation stages (69 OC vs. 66 NCs) using qRT-PCR. The expression levels of the miRNAs were also assessed in tissues and exosomes. Results: Five plasma miRNAs (miR-205-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-10a-5p, miR-346 and miR-328-3p) were significantly overexpressed in OC in comparison with NCs. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the 5-miRNA panel were 0.788 for the training stage and 0.763 for the validation stage. The level of miR-205-5p has significantly different expression in patients with well-moderate histological grade compared with those with a poor grade (P = 0.012). The expression levels of the 5 miRNAs were also significantly upregulated in the exosomes of OC plasma samples (32 OC vs. 32 NCs). However, the expression of the 4 miRNAs (miR-145-5p, miR-10a-5p, miR-346 and miR-328-3p) was significantly lower in tumor samples than in normal tissues (22 OC vs. 22 NCs). Conclusions: The 5 plasma miRNAs may be noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers of OC. The plasma miR-205-5p level may reflect the change trend of the histological grade of OC patients. ? 2019 The Authors","microRNA; microRNA 10a 5p; microRNA 145 5p; microRNA 205 5p; microRNA 328 5p; microRNA 346; tumor marker; unclassified drug; adult; Article; bioinformatics; cancer growth; cancer screening; cancer staging; clinical article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; exosome; female; gene expression; gene identification; gene overexpression; genetic analysis; histology; human; human tissue; ovary cancer; quantitative analysis; receiver operating characteristic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation"
"Elevated SUV39H2 attributes to the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma via regulation of NRIP1",2019,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent tumor in southern China and southeast Asia. Recent studies have demonstrated that viral infection, somatic genetic changes, and epigenetic changes synergistically contribute to NPC pathogenesis. Genome-wide studies show that epigenetic aberrations likely drive nasopharyngeal carcinoma development and progression. This work is aimed at investigating the effect of histone methyltransferase SUV39H2 in NPC. The elevated expression of SUV39H2 in NPC is observed by analyzing GSE53819 and GSE12452 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. SUV39H2 knockdown inhibits NPC proliferation and induces the apoptosis of cancer cells. At last, RNaseq analysis identifies a variety of SUV39H2 downstream genes related with cancer, in which, NRIP1 is identified as a critical downstream target of SUV39H2 in NPC. Taken together, these findings provide a theoretical basis for understating the biological roles of SUV39H2 in NPC. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","histone methyltransferase; histone methyltransferase SUV39H2; receptor interacting protein 140; unclassified drug; histone lysine methyltransferase; NRIP1 protein, human; receptor interacting protein 140; SUV39H2 protein, human; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; carcinoma cell; cell proliferation; controlled study; downstream processing; gene; gene expression; gene knockdown; genetic database; human; human cell; human tissue; nasopharynx carcinoma; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein depletion; protein expression; protein targeting; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; cell survival; disease exacerbation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genome-wide association study; metabolism; nasopharynx carcinoma; nasopharynx tumor; tumor cell line; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Databases, Genetic; Disease Progression; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1; Sequence Analysis, RNA"
"MicroRNA-590-5p antagonizes the inhibitory effect of high glucose on osteoblast differentiation by suppressing Smad7 in MC3T3-E1 cells",2019,"Objective: MicroRNA-590-5p (miR-590-5p) has been reported to stimulate osteoblast differentiation; however, its effect in diabetic osteoporosis remains unknown. This study investigated the effect of miR-590-5p on high glucose (HG)-suppressed osteoblast differentiation. Methods: The effect of HG on MC3T3-E1 cell survival was assessed using the MTT assay. The expression levels and activities of osteoblastic proteins were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, and immunoblotting assay. Tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in MC3T3-E1 cells was assessed using luciferase assay, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting. Mineralized nodule formation in MC3T3-E1 cells was examined by using the mineralization assay. Results: When MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to HG conditions, there was significant downregulation of miR-590-5p and osteoblastic proteins (e.g., collagen I, Runx2, and ALP); in contrast, Smad7 was upregulated. Furthermore, miR-590-5p targeted Smad7 and inhibited its expression. Additionally, overexpression of miR-590-5p significantly promoted osteoblast growth and differentiation by upregulating TGF-β signaling in HG-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. Conclusions: Collectively, the results showed that miR-590-5p was involved in osteogenesis; moreover, miR-590-5p may represent a potential target for the treatment of diabetic osteoporosis. ?

"Association between blood microbiome and type 2 diabetes mellitus: A nested case-control study",2019,"Background: Although recent studies have indicated that gut microbiome dysbiosis was significantly associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), information on the role of blood microbiome in T2DM development is scarce. Methods: Fifty incident T2DM cases and 100 matched non-T2DM controls were selected from a prospective cohort study of “135.” The composition of the blood microbiome was characterized using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing from pre-diagnostic blood sample. The amplicons were normalized, pooled, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq instrument using a MiSeq Reagent Kit PE300 v3 kit. Results: Totally, 3?000?391 and 6?244?227 high-quality sequences were obtained from T2DM patients and non-T2DM controls, respectively. The mean diversity of the blood microbiome (Simpson, Chao1 and Shannon indices) was not different between two groups at baseline. At genus level, the Aquabacterium, Xanthomonas, and Pseudonocardia were presented with lower abundance, while Actinotalea, Alishewanella, Sediminibacterium, and Pseudoclavibacter were presented with higher abundance among T2DM cases compared to those in non-T2DM controls. As the results shown, participants carried the genus Bacteroides in blood were significantly associated with a decreased risk for T2DM development, with 74% vs 88% (adjusted OR: 0.367, 95% CI: 0.151-0.894). However, participants carried the genus Sediminibacterium have an increased risk for T2DM, with adjusted OR (95% CI) being 14.098 (1.358, 146.330). Conclusions: Blood microbiome may play an etiology role in the development of T2DM. These findings would be useful to develop microbiota-based strategies for T2DM prevention and control. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Systemic inflammation response index predicts prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma: A propensity score-matched analysis",2019,"Purpose: In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), which was defined based on peripheral blood counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, in patients with localized or locally advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). Patients and methods: The prognostic value of SIRI was evaluated in a primary cohort consisting of 414 patients with localized or locally advanced CCRCC and then further validated in an independent cohort composed of 168 patients. Results: Kaplan–Meier survival analyses of both cohorts revealed that CCRCC patients with high SIRI levels exhibited poorer overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) compared with those with low SIRI levels. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses identified SIRI as a significant independent predictor for both OS (HR: 4.853; 95% CI: 2.362–9.972; P<0.001) and CSS (HR: 5.913; 95% CI: 2.681–13.040; P<0.001). Following propensity score matching analysis, SIRI remained an excellent predictor for both OS and CSS. The area under the curve for SIRI was larger than that of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic score in both cohorts. Conclusion: SIRI might be a better prognostic predictor than PLR, NLR, MLR, and MSKCC score in patients with localized or locally advanced CCRCC. ? 2019 Chen et al.","adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer specific survival; cancer survival; cohort analysis; female; human; inflammation; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; monocyte count; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; overall survival; platelet lymphocyte ratio; prediction; renal cell carcinoma; scoring system; survival analysis; validation process"
"MicroRNA-221 regulates osteosarcoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion by targeting CDKN1B/p27",2019,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miR) are of critical importance in growth and metastasis of cancer cells; however, the underlying functions of miRNAs in osteosarcoma (OS) remain largely unknown. This study was aimed to elucidate the role of miR-221 in regulating the biological behavior of OS cells. The proliferation ability was examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell cycle assay. The abilities of cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis were monitored by transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The effect of miR-221 on cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) expression was evaluated by luciferase assays, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. We found that miR-221 was elevated in OS cell lines compared with the normal osteoblastic cell line. Transfection of the miR-221 inhibitor into MG63 and U-2OS cell lines obviously suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which is accompanied with cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays indicated that CDKN1B is directly targeted by miR-221 in OS cells. Knockdown of CDKN1B inhibited the effects of miR-221 inhibitor, along with decreased Bax and caspase-3 and increased cyclin E, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Snail, and Twist1 expression. The results suggested that miR-221 might act as a potentially useful target for treatment of OS. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","caspase 3; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cyclin E; microRNA 221; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; transcription factor Snail; Twist related protein 1; apoptosis; Article; cell migration; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene function; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; HOS cell line; human; human cell; MG-63 cell line; osteosarcoma; priority journal; protein targeting; regulatory mechanism; SaOS-2 cell line; tumor invasion; U2OS cell line; upregulation"
"NCR ? group 3 innate lymphoid cells orchestrate IL-23/IL-17 axis to promote hepatocellular carcinoma development",2019,"Background: Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a newly discovered family of immune cells that have similar cytokine-secreting profiles as T helper cell subsets. Although ILCs are critical for host defense against infections and tissue homeostasis, their roles in tumor development are not well established. Methods: We studied the function of ILC3 cells in the liver for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in murine HCC models using flow cytometry, adoptive transfer, and in vitro functional assays. Findings: We found that ILC3 lacking the natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor (NCR ? ILC3) promoted the development of HCC in response to interleukin 23 (IL-23). IL-23 serum level is elevated in HCC patients and its high expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We found that IL-23 could promote tumor development in murine HCC tumor models. IL-23 promoted the expansion of NCR ? ILC3 and its differentiation from group 1 ILCs (ILC1s). Furthermore, NCR ? ILC3 initiated IL-17 production upon IL-23 stimulation and directly inhibited CD8 + T cell immunity by promoting lymphocyte apoptosis and limiting their proliferation. Interpretation: Together, our findings suggest that NCR ? ILC3 initiates the IL-17-rich immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promotes the development of HCC, thus may serve as a promising target for future cancer immunotherapy.

"Nitroxoline induces cell apoptosis by inducing MDM2 degradation in small-cell lung cancer",2019,"The proto-oncogene MDM2 is a nuclear-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes tumor formation by targeting tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, for proteasomal degradation. In this study, the anti-infective drug nitroxoline (NXQ) was screened out to effectively inhibit cell survival of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, and induce SCLC cell apoptosis by suppressing antiapoptotic proteins (such as Bcl-2 and MCL1) and upregulating proapoptotic protein Bim. In the mechanistic study, NXQ was found to downregulate MDM2 expression by inducing its proteasomal degradation, and thus upregulated p53 expression, which was a substrate protein of MDM2. Moreover, overexpression of MDM2 decreased the cytotoxicity of NXQ on SCLC cells. These results demonstrated that NXQ displayed anti-SCLC activity by suppressing MDM2 expression, which suggested that anti-infective NXQ had potential for SCLC treatment by targeting the MDM2/p53 axis. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Recent advances in oncolytic virus-based cancer therapy",2019,"Administration of oncolytic viruses (OVs) is an emerging anticancer strategy that exploits the lytic nature of viral replication to enhance the killing of malignant cells. OVs can be used as tools to directly induce cancer cell death and to trigger local and/or systemic immune responses to metastatic cancer in vivo. The effectiveness of OV therapy was initially highlighted by the clinical use of the genetically modified herpes virus, talimogene laherparepvec, for melanoma therapy. A number of OVs are now being evaluated as potential treatments for cancer in clinical trials. In spite of being engineered to specifically target tumor cells, the safety and off-target effects of OV therapy are a concern. The potential safety concerns of OVs are highlighted by current clinical trial criteria, which exclude individuals harbouring other viral infections and people who are immunocompromised. Despite the potential for adverse effects, clinical trials to date revealed relatively minimal adverse immune-related effects, such as fever. With advances in our understanding of virus replication cycles, several novel OVs have emerged. Reverse genetic systems have facilitated the insertion of anticancer genes into a range of OVs to further enhance their tumor-killing capacity. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in OV therapy for a range of human cancers in in vitro and in in vivo animal studies. We further discuss the future of OVs as a therapeutic strategy for a range of life-threatening cancers. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","oncolytic virus; cancer therapy; glioblastoma; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer; melanoma; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; priority journal; Review; virotherapy"
"Dynasore Suppresses mTORC1 Activity and Induces Autophagy to Regulate the Clearance of Protein Aggregates in Neurodegenerative Diseases",2019,"Autophagy is an important cellular protein control process, which plays a key role in the regulation of cell homeostasis and pathogenesis of many human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. Reduced autophagic activity and abnormal protein aggregation are common features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’s disease. Therefore, pharmacological regulation of overall autophagy may be helpful for effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we find Dynasore, a potent inhibitor of dynamin, can repress the lysosomal localization of mTOR and block the activity of mTORC1, which in turn enhances the nuclear translocation of the master regulators of autophagy including TFE3 and TFEB. We find that autophagic flux is upregulated in Dynasore-treated cells. Moreover, treatment of Dynasore significantly promotes the clearance of protein aggregates formed by mutant huntingtin protein containing expanded polyglutamine (polyQ), but not damaged mitochondria. In contrast, treatment with Dynasore has no effect on the clearance of polyQ aggregates of mutant huntingtin in ATG5-depleted cells, in which autophagy is defective. Taken together, our results indicate that Dynasore affects autophagic degradation of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins by regulating mTORC1-TFEB signaling. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","autophagy related protein 5; dynasore; huntingtin; mammalian target of rapamycin; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; polyglutamine; protein TFE3; protein TFEB; transcription factor; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix leucine zipper transcription factor; dynamin; HTT protein, human; huntingtin; hydrazone derivative; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; N'-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-3-hydroxy-2-naphthahydrazide; TFEB protein, human; animal cell; Article; autophagy; cellular distribution; controlled study; degenerative disease; drug mechanism; embryo; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme localization; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; MEF cell line; metabolic clearance; mouse; neuropathology; nonhuman; nucleocytoplasmic transport; priority journal; protein degradation; protein depletion; protein protein interaction; proteinosis; signal transduction; autophagy; degenerative disease; drug effect; lysosome; metabolism; pathology; proteinosis; Autophagy; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Dynamins; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Huntingtin Protein; Hydrazones; Lysosomes; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Protein Aggregation, Pathological"
"Identification of an immune signature predicting prognosis risk of patients in lung adenocarcinoma",2019,"Background: Lung cancer has become the most common cancer type and caused the most cancer deaths. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the major type of lung cancer. This study aimed to establish a signature based on immune related genes that can predict patients' OS for LUAD. Methods: The expression data of 976 LUAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (training set) and the Gene Expression Omnibus database (four testing sets) and 1534 immune related genes from the ImmPort database were used for generation and validation of the signature. The glmnet Cox proportional hazards model was used to find the best gene model and construct the signature. To assess the independently prognostic ability of the signature, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox's proportional hazards model were performed. Results: A gene model consisting of 30 immune related genes with the highest frequency after 1000 iterations was used as our signature. The signature demonstrated robust prognostic ability in both training set and testing set and could serve as an independent predictor for LUAD patients in all datasets except GSE31210. Besides, the signature could predict the overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients in different subgroups. And this signature was strongly associated with important clinicopathological factors like recurrence and TNM stage. More importantly, patients with high risk score presented high tumor mutation burden. Conclusions: This signature could predict prognosis and reflect the tumor immune microenvironment of LUAD patients, which can promote individualized treatment and provide potential novel targets for immunotherapy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer staging; controlled study; female; gene mutation; human; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; overall survival; prediction; RNA sequence; tumor microenvironment; validation study"
"microRNA-181b suppresses the metastasis of lung cancer cells by targeting sex determining region Y-related high mobility group-box 6 (Sox6)",2019,"Background: The aim of the study was to measure the expression of microRNA (miR)-181b in patients with lung cancer, investigate its biological function and elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with the development of lung cancer. Methods: miR-181b expression in tissues was measured via RT-qPCR. After A549 cells were transfected with miR-181b mimic or si-Sox6, the proliferation, migration and cell cycle distribution of A549 were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. The levels of cell cycle-related proteins and Sox6 were analyzed by western blotting. Gene targets of miR-181b were predicted via bioinformatics analysis and verified using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Results: Expression of miR-181b was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues (P < 0.05), and was inversely correlated with the degree of cell differentiation and clinical stages of lung cancer (both P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of miR-181b was significantly lower in adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma in the lungs (P < 0.05). Overexpression of miR-181b significantly decreased the protein level of Sox6 and significantly suppressed the cell proliferation and metastasis (both P < 0.05); this effect was also observed in A549 cells transfected with si-Sox6. The luciferase activity of a Sox6 3′-untranslated region-based reporter construct was significantly lower when transfected with miR-181b (P < 0.05), which suggests that Sox6 is a direct target of miR-181b. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that miR-181b may function as a tumor inhibitor in the development of lung cancer via targeting Sox6 to decrease the proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer cells. ? 2018 The Authors","microRNA; microRNA 181b; transcription factor Sox6; unclassified drug; microRNA; MIrn181 microRNA, human; SOX6 protein, human; transcription factor Sox; 3' untranslated region; A-549 cell line; Article; cancer staging; cell differentiation; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; human; human cell; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; metastasis; oncogene; squamous cell lung carcinoma; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; small cell lung cancer; tumor invasion; A549 Cells; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; SOXD Transcription Factors"
"Relaxin gene delivery mitigates liver metastasis and synergizes with check point therapy",2019,"Activated hepatic stellate cell (aHSC)-mediated liver fibrosis is essential to the development of liver metastasis. Here, we discover intra-hepatic scale-up of relaxin (RLN, an anti-fibrotic peptide) in response to fibrosis along with the upregulation of its primary receptor (RXFP1) on aHSCs. The elevated expression of RLN serves as a natural regulator to deactivate aHSCs and resolve liver fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesize this endogenous liver fibrosis repair mechanism can be leveraged for liver metastasis treatment via enforced RLN expression. To validate the therapeutic potential, we utilize aminoethyl anisamide-conjugated lipid-calcium-phosphate nanoparticles to deliver plasmid DNA encoding RLN. The nanoparticles preferentially target metastatic tumor cells and aHSCs within the metastatic lesion and convert them as an in situ RLN depot. Expressed RLN reverses the stromal microenvironment, which makes it unfavorable for established liver metastasis to grow. In colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer liver metastasis models, we confirm the RLN gene therapy results in significant inhibition of metastatic progression and prolongs survival. In addition, enforced RLN expression reactivates intra-metastasis immune milieu. The combination of the RLN gene therapy with PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy further produces a synergistic anti-metastatic efficacy. Collectively, the targeted RLN gene therapy represents a highly efficient, safe, and versatile anti-metastatic modality, and is promising for clinical translation. ? 2019, The Author(s).","alpha smooth muscle actin; calcium phosphate; chaperone; fibroblast growth factor; nanoparticle; plasmid DNA; relaxin; retinoid X receptor alpha; stromal cell derived factor 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; carbon tetrachloride; Cd274 protein, mouse; G protein coupled receptor; Lgr7 protein, mouse; nanoparticle; programmed death 1 ligand 1; relaxin; Rln1 protein, mouse; cancer; cell component; DNA; gene; gene expression; immune system; inhibition; lesion; nanoparticle; plasmid; tumor; Article; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer immunotherapy; cancer survival; colorectal cancer; endoplasmic reticulum; gene expression; gene targeting; gene therapy; Kupffer cell; liver fibrosis; liver metastasis; microenvironment; off-target effect; pancreas cancer; real time polymerase chain reaction; scale up; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; chemistry; disease exacerbation; experimental liver cirrhosis; female; gene transfer; gene vector; genetics; hepatic stellate cell; human; immunology; liver; liver tumor; metabolism; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; pathology; plasmid; procedures; transplantation; treatment outcome; tumor cell line; tumor microenvironment; Animals; B7-H1 Antigen; Carbon Tetrachloride; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Humans; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Nanoparticles; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Plasmids; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Relaxin; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Microenvironment; Up-Regulation"
"Altered resting-state dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder",2019,"Objective: The brain functional alterations at regional and network levels in post-traumatic stress disorder patients are still unclear. This study explored brain functional alterations at regional and network levels in post-traumatic stress disorder patients with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and evaluated the relationship between brain function and clinical indices in post-traumatic stress disorder. Methods: Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were conducted among typhoon survivors with (n = 27) and without post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 30) to assess the spontaneous brain activity and network-level brain function. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to examine the association of brain function with clinical symptom and social support. Results: Both the post-traumatic stress disorder group and the trauma-exposed control group showed decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex relative to the healthy control group. The post-traumatic stress disorder group showed increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right paracentral lobule and bilateral precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus relative to both control groups. Both traumatized groups exhibited decreased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right hippocampus and left cerebellum relative to the healthy control group. More decreased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right hippocampus was found in the post-traumatic stress disorder group. The Checklist-Civilian Version score positively correlated with functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the right paracentral lobule as well as between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the right precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus. The social support was associated with functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus as well as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the left middle frontal gyrus. Conclusion: Trauma exposure may result in aberrant local and network-level functional connectivity in individuals with or without post-traumatic stress disorder. Altered amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may be a predisposing risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder development following trauma exposure. More prominent decreased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity with the right hippocampus might be specific in the post-traumatic stress disorder group. Improvement of social support might possibly be significant for post-traumatic stress disorder patients. ?

"Impact of intravascular ultrasound-guided drug-eluting stent implantation on patients with chronic kidney disease: Results from ULTIMATE trial",2019,"Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the impacts of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on the ULTIMATE trial. Background: IVUS-guided DES implantation improves clinical outcomes in complex lesions. However, routine IVUS guidance in patients with CKD remains controversial. Methods: CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL min?1 1.73 m?2. The primary end point was target vessel failure (TVF) at 12 months, including cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization. Results: eGFR was available in 1,443 patients, of whom 723 were in the IVUS guidance group, and 720 were in the angiography guidance group. Finally, CKD was present in 349 (24.2%) patients. At 12 months, TVF in the CKD group was 7.2%, which was significantly higher than 3.2% in the non-CKD group (p =.001). Moreover, there were 25 TVFs in the CKD patients, with 7 (3.9%) TVFs in the IVUS group and 18 (10.7%) TVFs in the angiography group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15–0.84; p =.01), whereas 35 TVFs occurred in patients without CKD, with 14 (2.6%) TVFs in the IVUS group and 21 (3.8%) TVFs in the angiography group (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.34–1.32; p =.25; p for interaction =.24). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that CKD patients undergoing DES implantations were associated with a higher risk of TVF at 12 months. More importantly, the risk of TVF in the CKD patients could be significantly decreased through IVUS guidance.

"Relationship between trait neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women in China: Testing a mediation model",2019,"Background: Suicidal ideation is a common phenomenon among postpartum women around the world. However, evidence of the relationship between neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women is still lacking. Methods: From March 2017 to December 2018, a total of 1027 postpartum women (assessed no later than one month post-birth) were recruited to complete questionnaires assessing neuroticism, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Results: Anxiety and depression fully mediated the association between neuroticism and suicidal ideation (Total indirect effects = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.15). The indirect effect of the pathway of EPQ (Neuroticism)-Anxiety-Suicidal ideation was more significant than other pathways (Indirect effects=0.04, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.07). Conclusion: Interventions for suicidal ideation in postpartum women need to target neuroticism and further research is necessary understand the mechanisms by which neuroticism affects suicidal ideation. ? 2019","adult; anxiety; Article; China; depression; Eysenck Personality Questionnaire; female; human; major clinical study; neurosis; priority journal; puerperium; questionnaire; suicidal ideation"
"PAR2 inhibition enhanced the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to 5-FU and reduced EMT signaling",2019,"The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms that transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b)-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells contributes to 5-FU resistance. A series of experiments involving cell viability and caspase activity analyses, siRNA transfection, RNA isolation, and quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assay, cell migration analysis, Western blotting analysis of total protein and membrane protein were performed in this study. Mouse xenograft model was used to determine the effect of the PAR2 inhibitor in vivo. In this study, we found that protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) induction in 5-FU therapy is correlated with TGF-b-mediated EMT and apoptosis resistance. PAR2 and TGF-b were both activated in response to 5-FU treatment in vivo and in vitro, and whereas TGF-b inhibition sensitized CRC cells to 5-FU and suppressed cell migration, PAR2 activation eliminated the effect of TGF-b inhibition. Conversely, siRNA-mediated PAR2 depletion or PAR2 inhibition with a specific inhibitor produced a similar phenotype as TGF-b signal inhibition: 5-FU sensitization and cell migration suppression. Moreover, the results of xenograft experiments indicated that the PAR2 inhibitor can enhance cell killing by 5-FU in vivo and suppress EMT signaling. Our results reveal that the TGF-b effects require the coordinating action of PAR2, suggesting that PAR2 inhibition could be a new therapeutic strategy to combat 5-FU resistance in CRC. ? 2019 Cognizant Communication Corporation.

"Comparative Study Between Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion with ROI-C Cage and Laminoplasty for Multilevel Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy without Spinal Stenosis",2019,"Background: Selection of anterior versus posterior surgery for multilevel (?3) cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM) continues to be controversial. A comparison between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with ROI-C cage and laminoplasty was made to determine the better treatment for MCSM. Methods: Between 2012 and 2017, 57 patients received either ACDF with ROI-C or laminoplasty (LMP) treatment. Clinical and radiologic outcomes between the 2 groups were compared. Results: In total, 24 patients underwent ACDF with ROI-C cage (ACDF group) and 33 patients underwent LMP (LMP group). They were studied with a median follow-up of 22 months. Less operative blood loss (136.7 ± 60.8 vs. 316.7 ± 139.6 mL, P < 0.001) and a shorter hospital stay (7.8 ± 1.6 vs. 9.9 ± 3.3 days, P < 0.01) were notable for ACDF. The Japanese Orthopedic Association score showed that ACDF and LMP improved similarly (recovery rate, 55.3 ± 19.2% vs. 58.9 ± 18.1%, P > 0.05). Preoperative occupying rate and JOA score significantly affected the operation result (P < 0.01). The cervical lordosis, segmental cervical lordosis, and T1 slope were all larger in the ACDF group. The cervical range of motion decreased 10.6° in the ACDF group and 4.8° in the LMP group (P = 0.01). No significant differences were found between complication rates. Conclusions: ACDF with ROI-C cage has a similar clinical efficacy to LMP for patients with MCSM. There was less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and improved sagittal balance when ACDF was used. However, a greater decrease in range of motion was observed after ACDF. Preoperative occupying ratio and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score are potential risk factors for different outcomes. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; anterior spine fusion; Article; cervical spondylotic myelopathy; clinical outcome; discectomy; female; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; laminoplasty; length of stay; lordosis; major clinical study; male; operative blood loss; postoperative complication; range of motion; surgical technique; cervical vertebra; comparative study; complication; diagnostic imaging; discectomy; laminoplasty; nonparametric test; outcome assessment; procedures; radiography; retrospective study; spinal cord disease; spine fusion; spondylosis; treatment outcome; Cervical Vertebrae; Diskectomy; Female; Humans; Laminoplasty; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Cord Diseases; Spinal Fusion; Spondylosis; Statistics, Nonparametric; Treatment Outcome"
"Physical activity and risk of diabetic retinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Aims: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an important microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness among people of working age. Physical activity (PA) or exercise is critical and beneficial for DM patients, whereas studies evaluating the relationship between PA and DR have yielded inconsistent and inconclusive results. The American Diabetes Association’s “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes” has also pointed out the indeterminate roles of PA in DR prevention. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the association between PA and DR risk. Methods: Medline (accessed by PubMed), EmBase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies up to June 2018, and the reference lists of the published articles were searched manually. The association between PA and DR risk was assessed using random-effect meta-analysis. Results: Twenty-two studies were included in this meta-analysis. PA was found to have a protective association with DR [risk ratio (RR) = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.90–0.98, p = 0.005] in diabetic patients, and the impact was more pronounced on vision-threatening DR (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.98, p = 0.02). Sedentary behavior could increase the risk of DR (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.01–1.37, p = 0.04). Moderate-intensity PA was likely to have a slight protective effect (RR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.58–1.00, p = 0.05). Conclusion: PA is associated with lower DR risk, and more studies should focus on the causality between them. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.","diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; disease association; evidence based medicine; exercise intensity; human; physical activity; priority journal; Review; risk factor; sedentary lifestyle; systematic review; diabetic retinopathy; exercise; meta analysis; Diabetic Retinopathy; Exercise; Humans; Sedentary Behavior"
"Chromogranin-a expression as a novel biomarker for early diagnosis of colon cancer patients",2019,"Colon cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death worldwide. The five-year survival rate for the early-stage patients is more than 90%, and only around 10% for the later stages. Moreover, half of the colon cancer patients have been clinically diagnosed at the later stages. It is; therefore, of importance to enhance the ability for the early diagnosis of colon cancer. Taking advantages from our previous studies, there are several potential biomarkers which have been associated with the early diagnosis of the colon cancer. In order to investigate these early diagnostic biomarkers for colon cancer, human chromogranin-A (CHGA) was further analyzed among the most powerful diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, we used a logistic regression-based meta-analysis to clarify associations of CHGA expression with colon cancer diagnosis. Both healthy populations and the normal mucosa from the colon cancer patients were selected as the double normal controls. The results showed decreased expression of CHGA in the early stages of colon cancer as compared to the normal controls. The decline of CHGA expression in the early stages of colon cancer is probably a new diagnostic biomarker for colon cancer diagnosis with high predicting possibility and verification performance. We have also compared the diagnostic powers of CHGA expression with the typical oncogene KRAS, classic tumor suppressor TP53, and well-known cellular proliferation index MKI67, and the CHGA showed stronger ability to predict early diagnosis for colon cancer than these other cancer biomarkers. In the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, CHGA was revealed to share some common pathways with KRAS and TP53. CHGA might be considered as a novel, promising, and powerful biomarker for early diagnosis of colon cancer. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Genetic basis of surfactant dysfunction in Chinese children: A retrospective study",2019,"Objective: To investigate the prevalence of surfactant dysfunction (SD) and the genotype distribution in Chinese childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD). Methods: From December 2013 to December 2016, whole exons and splicing regions of surfactant protein (SP)-B, SP-C, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3) were sequenced in chILD with unknown etiology in five children's medical centers of China. The sequencing was performed by Next-generation sequencing technique in a molecular genetics laboratory. The clinical and genetic data were reviewed retrospectively. Results: In total, 136 patients of age 3 months to 13 years (mean 12.5 ± 9.4 months) were recruited, among which 76 were males. Of the 136 cases of chILD, 13.2% (18 of 136) were diagnosed with SD. In these 18 SD cases, 15 had heterozygous SP-C deficiencies, two cases had compound heterozygous ABCA3 deficiencies, and no SP-B deficiency was identified. In SP-C deficiencies, there were six cases with p.I73T, 2 with p.I73N, 5 with p.V39L, 1 with c.417delA, and 1 case with IVS4, +1G>C. Two cases of ABCA3 mutation were heterozygous with c.1755delC and c.2890G>A; c.3913T>C (R1305W) and exon 13 to 18 deletion. One was negative by sequencing while diagnosed positive by pathology. Conclusion: The proportion of genetic mutation of SD in chILD is 13.2% in China, of which SP-C deficiency is predominant. The mutation, SP-C p.V39L, was found to be relatively prevalent in China and warrants further investigation. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ABC transporter subfamily A; ABC transporter subfamily A member 3; alanine; asparagine; cysteine; glycine; isoleucine; leucine; surfactant protein B; surfactant protein C; threonine; unclassified drug; valine; ABCA3 gene; adolescent; amino acid substitution; Article; child; China; Chinese; controlled study; exon; female; gene deletion; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic disorder; genotype; heterozygosity; histopathology; human; human tissue; infant; interstitial lung disease; lung biopsy; major clinical study; male; medical record review; molecular genetics; mutational analysis; next generation sequencing; pediatric hospital; pediatric patient; preschool child; priority journal; protein splicing; retrospective study; school child; surfactant dysfunction"
"Iron deposition in Parkinson's disease by quantitative susceptibility mapping",2019,"Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have elevated levels of brain iron, especially in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the iron deposition in the substantia nigra (SN) and other deep gray matter nuclei of PD patients using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and its clinical relationship, and to explore whether there is a gradient of iron deposition pattern in globus pallidus (GP)-fascicula nigrale (FN)-SN pathway. Methods: Thirty-three PD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) were included in this study. Subjects underwent brain MRI and constructed QSM data. The differences in iron accumulation in the deep gray matter nuclei of the subjects were compared, including the PD group and the control group, the early-stage PD (EPD) group and the late-stage PD (LPD) group. The iron deposition pattern of the GP-FN-SN pathway was analyzed. Results: The PD group showed increased susceptibility values in the FN, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), internal globus pallidus (GPi), red nucleus (RN), putamen and caudate nucleus compared with the HV group (P < 0.05). In both PD and HV group, iron deposition along the GP-FN-SN pathway did not show an increasing gradient pattern. The SNc, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and RN showed significantly increased susceptibility values in the LPD patients compared with the EPD patients. Conclusion: PD is closely related to iron deposition in the SNc. The condition of PD patients is related to the SNc and the SNr. There is not an increasing iron deposition gradient along the GP-FN-SN pathway. The source and mechanism of iron deposition in the SN need to be further explored, as does the relationship between the iron deposition in the RN and PD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","iron; iron; adult; Article; caudate nucleus; clinical article; controlled study; female; globus pallidus; gray matter; human; iron storage; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; putamen; quantitative susceptibility mapping; red nucleus; substantia nigra; substantia nigra pars compacta; substantia nigra pars reticulata; brain mapping; case control study; metabolism; nerve tract; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; procedures; severity of illness index; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Female; Globus Pallidus; Gray Matter; Humans; Iron; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Neuroimaging; Parkinson Disease; Severity of Illness Index; Substantia Nigra"
"Finding driver mutations in cancer: Elucidating the role of background mutational processes",2019,"Identifying driver mutations in cancer is notoriously difficult. To date, recurrence of a mutation in patients remains one of the most reliable markers of mutation driver status. However, some mutations are more likely to occur than others due to differences in background mutation rates arising from various forms of infidelity of DNA replication and repair machinery, endogenous, and exogenous mutagens. We calculated nucleotide and codon mutability to study the contribution of background processes in shaping the observed mutational spectrum in cancer. We developed and tested probabilistic pan-cancer and cancer-specific models that adjust the number of mutation recurrences in patients by background mutability in order to find mutations which may be under selection in cancer. We showed that mutations with higher mutability values had higher observed recurrence frequency, especially in tumor suppressor genes. This trend was prominent for nonsense and silent mutations or mutations with neutral functional impact. In oncogenes, however, highly recurring mutations were characterized by relatively low mutability, resulting in an inversed U-shaped trend. Mutations not yet observed in any tumor had relatively low mutability values, indicating that background mutability might limit mutation occurrence. We compiled a dataset of missense mutations from 58 genes with experimentally validated functional and transforming impacts from various studies. We found that mutability of driver mutations was lower than that of passengers and consequently adjusting mutation recurrence frequency by mutability significantly improved ranking of mutations and driver mutation prediction.

"Triptonide inhibits lung cancer cell tumorigenicity by selectively attenuating the Shh-Gli1 signaling pathway",2019,"Lung cancer is a leading lethal disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 16%. Inadequate potent anti-cancer drugs appear to be a bottleneck in the treatment of lung cancer; hence, how to develop effective anti-lung cancer therapeutics is an urgent problem. In this study, we aim to explore a novel compound with potent anti-lung cancer effect and study its anti-cancer mechanisms. We found that triptonide at very low concentrations of 5–10 nM caused a marked suppression of cell proliferation and colony formation of lung cancer cells. More interestingly, triptonide also robustly inhibited the lung cancer cell formation of tumor spheres, and reduced the stemness and tumorigenicity of the sphere-forming cells. In vivo studies showed that administration of triptonide significantly inhibited the tumor growth with low toxicity. Molecular mechanistic studies revealed that triptonide significantly decreased expression of the Gli1 at both mRNA and protein levels by repressing Gli1 gene promoter activity. Additionally, triptonide reduced the levels of cancer stem cell key signaling protein sonic hedgehog (Shh), but increased the amount of Ptch1, a protein binding to SMO to diminish the Shh signal transduction, thus inhibition of the Shh–Gli1 signaling pathway. Together, our findings show that triptonide effectively inhibits lung cancer cell growth, stemness, and tumorigenicity, and support the notion that triptonide is a new Shh–Gli1 signaling inhibitor and a novel anti-lung cancer drug candidate for further developing effective lung cancer therapeutics. ? 2019","antineoplastic agent; protein Patched 1; Smoothened protein; sonic hedgehog protein; transcription factor Gli1; triptonide; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; GLI1 protein, human; protein Patched 1; PTCH protein, human; SHH protein, human; sonic hedgehog protein; transcription factor Gli1; triptonide; triterpene; A-549 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cell proliferation; colony formation; controlled study; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; genetic transcription; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung cancer; mouse; NCI-H1299 cell line; nonhuman; promoter region; protein binding; protein expression; resazurin assay; signal transduction; tumor growth; tumor weight; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; animal; dose response; down regulation; drug effect; drug screening; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; phenotype; A549 Cells; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Down-Regulation; Female; Hedgehog Proteins; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice, Nude; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Patched-1 Receptor; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; Triterpenes; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Zinc Finger Protein GLI1"
"δ-Opioid Receptor Activation Attenuates the Oligomer Formation Induced by Hypoxia and/or α-Synuclein Overexpression/Mutation Through Dual Signaling Pathways",2019,"We have recently demonstrated that δ-opioid receptor (DOR) activation attenuates α-synuclein expression/aggregation induced by MPP(+) and/or severe hypoxia. Since α-synuclein plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease, DOR activation may trigger an antiparkinson pathway(s) against α-synuclein-induced injury. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown yet. In HEK293T and PC12 cells, we investigated the effects of DOR activation on the oligomer formation induced by α-synuclein overexpression and mutation in normoxic and hypoxic conditions and explored the potential signaling pathways for DOR protection. We found that (1) increased expression of both wild-type and A53T-mutant α-synuclein led to the formation of α-synuclein oligomers and cytotoxic injury; (2) DOR activation largely attenuated the formation of toxic α-synuclein oligomers induced by α-synuclein overexpression/mutation and/or hypoxia; (3) DOR activation attenuated α-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity through TORC1/SIK1/CREB, but not the phospho-CREB pathway, while DOR activation reduced hypoxic cell injury through the phospho-CREB mechanism; and (4) the interaction of α-synuclein and the DJ-1 was involved in the mechanisms for DOR-mediated protection against α-synuclein oligomer formation. Our findings suggest that DOR attenuates the formation of toxic α-synuclein oligomers through the phos-CREB pathway under hypoxic conditions, and through TORC1/SIK1/CREB pathways in the conditions of α-synuclein overexpression and mutation. The DJ-1 gene was involved in the DOR protection against parkinsonian injury. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","alpha synuclein; delta opiate receptor; oligomer; 2',6'-dimethyltyrosyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)(carboxymethyl)methylamide; alpha synuclein; benzimidazole derivative; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; delta opiate receptor; mutant protein; oligopeptide; PARK7 protein, rat; protein deglycase DJ-1; protein serine threonine kinase; serine; Sik1 protein, rat; Article; cell viability; controlled study; CREB gene; cytotoxicity; DJ 1 gene; down regulation; gene; gene mutation; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; hypoxia; PC12 cell line (pheochromocytoma); protein expression; protein function; signal transduction; SIK gene; TORC gene; upregulation; animal; biological model; cell hypoxia; cell survival; drug effect; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; mutation; PC12 cell line; phosphorylation; protein multimerization; rat; alpha-Synuclein; Animals; Benzimidazoles; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Survival; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Models, Biological; Mutant Proteins; Mutation; Oligopeptides; PC12 Cells; Phosphorylation; Protein Deglycase DJ-1; Protein Multimerization; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Rats; Receptors, Opioid, delta; Serine; Signal Transduction"
"IGF-2 Preprograms Maturing Macrophages to Acquire Oxidative Phosphorylation-Dependent Anti-inflammatory Properties",2019,"Recent investigations revealed that macrophages could be trained with an altered responsiveness, raising the possibility of combating autoimmune diseases by imparting anti-inflammatory capabilities to these cells. While investigating the effect of mesenchymal stem cells on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we found a critical role of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) in training macrophages to become anti-inflammatory during their maturation. IGF-2 exerts its effects by preprogramming maturing macrophages to commit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). IGF-2-preprogrammed macrophages maintained the mitochondrial complex V activities even upon pro-inflammation stimulation, thus enabling an elevated programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. PD-L1 neutralization abolished the beneficial effect of IGF-2 on EAE. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of IGF-2-preprogrammed macrophages to EAE mice increased Tregs and alleviated the diseases. Our results demonstrate that shaping macrophage responsiveness by IGF-2 is effective in managing inflammatory diseases, and the OXPHOS commitment can be preset to determine the anti-inflammatory fate of macrophages. Du and Lin et al. show that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) modulates the innate immune memory of macrophages during their maturation and enables macrophages to have persistent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Such metabolic commitment allows macrophages to highly express PD-L1 even upon pro-inflammation stimulation and determines their anti-inflammatory phenotype. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","mitochondrial complex V; mitochondrial protein; programmed death 1 ligand 1; somatomedin B; unclassified drug; adoptive transfer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell maturation; controlled study; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; female; human; human cell; immunological memory; immunomodulation; inflammation; inflammatory disease; macrophage; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; regulatory T lymphocyte; upregulation"
"FOXM1 promotes the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer via activation of β-catenin signaling pathway",2019,"Purpose: Our previous study proved that FOXM1 regulates colorectal cancer (CRC) cell metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition program. The aim of this study is to further explore the underlying mechanism of FOXM1 in CRC. Materials and methods: In this study, we detected the mRNA and protein expressions of FOXM1 and β-catenin in CRC tissues and their corresponding normal-appearing tissues (NATs) by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Then the potential link between FOXM1 and β-catenin in CRC tissues was analyzed. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the biological functions of FOXM1 in CRC cells after reconstitution of FOXM1 expression in vitro. Moreover, the mechanism of FOXM1-promoted CRC progression by improving β-catenin nuclear translocation was also discussed. Results: Our data demonstrated that FOXM1 and β-catenin were upregulated in CRC tissues compared with the corresponding NATs (P<0.05). Clinicopathologic analysis revealed that increased FOXM1 (or β-catenin) expression positively correlated with some clinicopathologic features, such as tumor size, TNM stage, lymphatic metastasis, and distant metastasis (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the possible relationships between FOXM1 and β-catenin in CRC samples were evaluated using SPSS software, and a significant positive correlation was found (P<0.05). In vitro data demonstrate that elevated FOXM1 expression exerted oncogenic effects on CRC via activation of β-catenin signaling pathway. The inhibition of β-catenin by siRNAs significantly attenuates FOXM1-induced malignant activities. Conclusion: The data suggested that FOXM1/β-catenin is critical for malignancy of CRC, which may constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC. ? 2019, Dove Medical Press Ltd.

"A review of arsenic exposure and lung cancer",2019,"As a well-established human carcinogen, arsenic has increased the risk of lung cancer over the past decades. Wide exposure to arsenic in the environment has attracted the attention of scientists. Its carcinogenicity at early life stages has been observed in certain animal studies already, yet current evidence is insufficient to extrapolate this to humans. Although the mechanisms of lung cancer induced by arsenic remain unclear, most of them are related to the biotransformation of arsenic, which would further provide target sites for precaution and therapy. This review comprehensively summarizes current studies associated to arsenic exposure and lung cancer and the mechanism of its carcinogenesis in lung cancer in three sections, namely, epidemiological studies, experimental studies, and mechanistic studies. In addition, prevention and treatment strategies as well as directions for future studies are discussed. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.","arsenic; histone; microRNA; autophagy; biotransformation; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer prevention; DNA repair; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; epigenetics; experimental study; gene expression; human; lung cancer; lung carcinogenesis; priority journal; Review; signal transduction"
"Sensitive detection of antibiotics using aptamer conformation cooperated enzyme-assisted SERS technology",2019,"Serious healthcare concerns have been raised on the issue of antibiotic residues after overuse, especially by accumulation in the human body through food webs. Here, we report a methodological development for sensitive detection of antibiotics with aptamer conformation cooperated enzyme-assisted SERS (ACCESS) technology. We design and integrate a set of nucleic acid oligos, realizing specific recognition of chloramphenicol (CAP) and efficient exonuclease III-assisted DNA amplification. It features a ""signal-on"" analysis of CAP with the limit of detection (15 fM), the lowest concentration detectable in the literature. Our method exhibits a high selectivity on the target analyte, free of interference of other potential antibiotic contaminants. The ACCESS assay promises an ultrasensitive and specific detection tool for trace amounts of antibiotic residues in samples of our daily life. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","antiinfective agent; aptamer; chloramphenicol; DNA; exodeoxyribonuclease; exodeoxyribonuclease III; gold; metal nanoparticle; silicon; animal; chemistry; conformation; DNA probe; food contamination; genetic procedures; genetics; limit of detection; milk; nucleic acid amplification; nucleic acid hybridization; nucleotide sequence; procedures; Raman spectrometry; reproducibility; water pollutant; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Base Sequence; Biosensing Techniques; Chloramphenicol; DNA; DNA Probes; Exodeoxyribonucleases; Food Contamination; Gold; Limit of Detection; Metal Nanoparticles; Milk; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Reproducibility of Results; Silicon; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"Somatic and germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PARK2 impair PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in lung cancer cells",2020,"PARK2, which encodes Parkin, is a disease-causing gene for both neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Parkin can function as a neuroprotector that plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitophagy, and germline mutations in PARK2 are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Intriguingly, recent studies suggest that Parkin can also function as a tumor suppressor and that somatic and germline mutations in PARK2 are associated with various human cancers, including lung cancer. However, it is presently unknown how the tumor suppressor activity of Parkin is affected by these mutations and whether it is associated with mitophagy. Herein, we show that wild-type (WT) Parkin can rapidly translocate onto mitochondria following mitochondrial damage and that Parkin promotes mitophagic clearance of mitochondria in lung cancer cells. However, lung cancer-linked mutations inhibit the mitochondrial translocation and ubiquitin-associated activity of Parkin. Among all lung cancer-linked mutants that we tested, A46T Parkin failed to translocate onto mitochondria and could not recruit downstream mitophagic regulators, including optineurin (OPTN) and TFEB, whereas N254S and R275W Parkin displayed slower mitochondrial translocation than WT Parkin. Moreover, we found that deferiprone (DFP), an iron chelator that can induce mitophagy, greatly increased the death of A46T Parkin-expressing lung cancer cells. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mitophagic mechanism in lung cancer, suggesting that lung cancer-linked mutations in PARK2 are associated with impaired mitophagy and identifying DFP as a novel therapeutic agent for PARK2-linked lung cancer and possibly other types of cancers driven by mitophagic dysregulation. ? 2019, CPS and SIMM.","deferiprone; optineurin; parkin; ubiquitin; Article; autophagy; cancer cell; controlled study; germline mutation; human; human cell; lung cancer; mitochondrion; mitophagy; protein expression; protein localization; somatic mutation; tumor suppressor gene"
"Exosomal FMR1-AS1 facilitates maintaining cancer stem-like cell dynamic equilibrium via TLR7/NFκB/c-Myc signaling in female esophageal carcinoma",2019,"Background: Though esophageal cancer is three to four times more common among males than females worldwide, this type of cancer still ranks in the top incidence among women, even more than the female specific cancer types. The occurrence is currently attributed to extrinsic factors, including tobacco use and alcohol consumption. However, limited attention has been given to gender-specific intrinsic genetic factors, especially in female. Methods: We re-annotated a large cohort of microarrays on 179 ESCC patients and identified female-specific differently expressed lncRNAs. The associations between FMR1-AS1 and the risk and prognosis of ESCC were examined in 206 diagnosed patients from eastern China and validated in 188 additional patients from southern China. The effects of FMR1-AS1 on the malignant phenotypes on female ESCC cells were detected in vitro and in vivo. ChIRP-MS, reporter gene assays and EMSA were conducted to identify the interaction and regulation among FMR1-AS1, TLR7 and NFκB. Results: We found FMR1-AS1 expression is exclusively altered and closely associated with the level of sXCI in female ESCC patients, and its overexpression may correlate to poor clinical outcome. ChIRP-MS data indicate that FMR1-AS1 could be packaged into exosomes and released into tumor microenvironment. Functional studies demonstrated that FMR1-AS1 could bind to endosomal toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and activate downstream TLR7-NFκB signaling, promoting the c-Myc expression, thus inducing ESCC cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis and invasion ability. Exosome incubation and co-xenograft assay indicate that FMR1-AS1 exosomes may secreted from ESCC CSCs, transferring stemness phenotypes to recipient non-CSCs in tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we also found a correlation between the serum levels of FMR1-AS1 and the overall survival (OS) of the female ESCC patients. Conclusions: Our results highlighted exosomal FMR1-AS1 in maintaining CSC dynamic interconversion state through the mechanism of activating TLR7-NFκB signaling, upregulating c-Myc level in recipient cells, which may be taken as an attractive target approach for advancing current precision cancer therapeutics in female patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; long untranslated RNA; Myc protein; toll like receptor 7; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; long untranslated RNA; Myc protein; MYC protein, human; oligoribonucleotide; TLR7 protein, human; toll like receptor 7; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer stem cell; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell proliferation; China; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; esophagus carcinoma; exosome; female; FMR1 AS1 gene; gel mobility shift assay; gene; gene control; gene function; gene interaction; gene overexpression; genetic association; genetic correlation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; major clinical study; mass spectrometry; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; overall survival; phenotype; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; reporter gene; TLR signaling; tumor growth; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; tumor xenograft; upregulation; validation study; agonists; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cancer stem cell; drug screening; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mortality; nude mouse; pathology; prognosis; signal transduction; survival analysis; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Exosomes; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice, Nude; Neoplastic Stem Cells; NF-kappa B; Oligoribonucleotides; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction; Survival Analysis; Toll-Like Receptor 7; Tumor Microenvironment; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
