"Sulfuretin prevents obesity and metabolic diseases in diet induced obese mice",2019,"The global obesity epidemic and associated metabolic diseases require alternative biological targets for new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we show that a phytochemical sulfuretin suppressed adipocyte differentiation of preadipocytes and administration of sulfuretin to high fat diet-fed obese mice prevented obesity and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects were associated with a suppressed expression of inflammatory markers, induced expression of adiponectin, and increased levels of phosphorylated ERK and AKT. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of sulfuretin in adipocytes, we performed microarray analysis and identified activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) as a sulfuretin-responsive gene. Sulfuretin elevated Atf3 mRNA and protein levels in white adipose tissue and adipocytes. Consistently, deficiency of Atf3 promoted lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte markers. Sulfuretin’s but not resveratrol’s anti-adipogenic effects were diminished in Atf3 deficient cells, indicating that Atf3 is an essential factor in the effects of sulfuretin. These results highlight the usefulness of sulfuretin as a new anti-obesity intervention for the prevention of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Applied Pharmacology.","activating transcription factor 3; adiponectin; fatty acid binding protein 4; mitogen activated protein kinase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phytochemical; protein kinase B; sulfuretin; transcription factor 3; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; 3T3 cell line; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; body weight; C3H/10T1/2 clone 8 cell line; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell differentiation; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diet induced obesity; electrospray; female; food intake; gene expression; glucose blood level; histology; in vivo study; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; lipid storage; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic disorder; microarray analysis; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; protein expression level; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; spectrophotometry; thin layer chromatography; total cholesterol level; Toxicodendron vernicifluum; triacylglycerol blood level; Western blotting"
"Clinical application of bone turnover markers in osteoporosis in Korea",2019,"Bone turnover markers (BTMs) have important role in the management of osteoporosis. Recently the clinical application of BTMs has achieved significant progress and measurement of BTMs give us better understanding of pathogenesis of osteoporosis. However, the use of BTMs is still insufficient in Korea. We summarized the available methods and standard interval of the BTMs in Korea. Also we reviewed published literatures on pre-analytical variability in the measurement of BTMs and provided recommendations for standardized sample handling and patient preparation for reducing those pre-analytical variabilities. The clinical application of BTMs in patients with chronic kidney disease who have a higher fracture risk than the general population is summarized.

"Gene expression pathways across multiple tissues in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis reveal core pathways of disease pathology",2019,"Objective. To identify commonalities in gene expression data across all antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) tissues thus far characterized. Methods. Gene expression data were collected from the 3 AAV tissues thus far characterized (orbit, peripheral leukocytes, and sinus brushings). These data were analyzed to identify commonly expressed genes and disease pathways. The pathways data were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a combined local false discovery rate, which estimates the probability of a false discovery of a given pathway in all 3 tissues analyzed. Results. Only 4 genes were upregulated in all 3 tissues - IL1RN, TLR2, SLC11A1, and MMP9. After multiple comparison adjustments, the network pathway analysis revealed 28 pathways associated with all 3 tissues. The most strongly associated pathway for all 3 tissues was the neutrophil degranulation pathway [multidimensional local false discovery (md-locfdr) = 1.05 × 10-12], followed by the osteoclast differentiation (md-locfdr = 3.8 × 10-05), cell surface interactions at the vascular wall (md-locfdr = 4.2 × 10-04), signaling by interleukins (md-locfdr = 6.1 × 10-04), and phagosome (md-locfdr = 0.003) pathways. There were no downregulated genes or pathways common to all 3 tissues. Conclusion. This analysis identified individual genes and pathways of disease common to all AAV tissues thus far characterized. The use of a network pathway analysis allowed us to identify pathologic mechanisms that were not readily apparent in the commonly expressed genes alone. Many of these pathways are consistent with current theories about infectious drivers and the crossroads of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. In addition, this analysis highlights novel pathways, such as vessel wall interactions and platelet activation, which require further investigation. ? 2019 Journal of Rheumatology.

"Evolution of acute lacunar lesions in terms of size and shape: a PICASSO sub-study",2019,"The imaging definition of lacunar infarcts is variable, particularly regarding their size and the presence of cavitation. We investigated the changes of diameter and evolution pattern of acute lacunar infarcts, and the factors associated with the evolution pattern. Patients with acute single subcortical hemispheric or brainstem ischemic lesions of penetrating arterial territories were included. Maximal diameters on initial diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (FLAIR), which performed > 12 months after initial DWI, were semi-automatically measured. Clinical characteristics were compared according to evolution patterns on follow-up FLAIR, classified as cavitated, focal lesion without cavitation, and disappeared. Five hundred nine patients were included. Mean time to follow-up was 31.3 ± 13.7 months. Mean diameter of acute lacunar lesions decreased from 12.9 ± 4.4 to 8.5 ± 4.8?mm during follow-up. Lesions of 58.2% patients remained as cavitated, 18.3% as focal lesion without cavitation, and 23.6% disappeared. Initial NIHSS score (p = 0.005), diameter of initial lesion (p < 0.001), number of slices showing acute lesion on DWI (p < 0.001), progression of white matter lesion (p < 0.001), number of acute lesions involving gray matter (p = 0.008) and lesion location (p < 0.001) were different among three groups. After adjustment for covariates, diameter of the acute lesion, initial number of old lacunes, and anterior lesion location were associated with the appearance of cavitation. Initial lesion diameter and posterior lesion location were associated with the disappearance. We observed reduction of the acute lacunar lesion diameter in 86%. There were predictive factors of disappearance and cavitation of acute lacunar infarction. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; brain infarction size; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; female; follow up; gray matter; human; lacunar stroke; major clinical study; male; middle aged; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; priority journal; prospective study; white matter lesion; aged; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; lacunar stroke; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; pathology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; severity of illness index; fibrinolytic agent; Aged; Disease Progression; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Severity of Illness Index; Stroke, Lacunar"
"Sequential emergence and wide spread of neutralization escape middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mutants, South Korea, 2015",2019,"The unexpectedly large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea in 2015 was initiated by an infected traveler and amplified by several “superspreading” events. Previously, we reported the emergence and spread of mutant Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus bearing spike mutations (I529T or D510G) with reduced affinity to human receptor CD26 during the outbreak. To assess the potential association of spike mutations with superspreading events, we collected virus genetic information reported during the outbreak and systemically analyzed the relationship of spike sequences and epidemiology. We found sequential emergence of the spike mutations in 2 superspreaders. In vivo virulence of the mutant viruses seems to decline in human patients, as assessed by fever duration in affected persons. In addition, neutralizing activity against these 2 mutant viruses in serum samples from mice immunized with wild-type spike antigen were gradually reduced, suggesting emergence and wide spread of neutralization escapers during the outbreak. ? 2019, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"Contribution of food groups to sodium and potassium intakes by their ratio in Korean adults",2019,"Background/Aims: Koreans have relatively high sodium intakes, and a higher sodium-to-potassium (Na/K) ratio is associated with increased mortality resulting from cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to analyze the dietary patterns and food groups that contribute to sodium and potassium intakes according to dietary Na/K ratio in Koreans. Methods: A 24-hour dietary recall was collected twice from 640 healthy adults (aged 19-69 years) in four Korean provinces. The subjects were divided into groups of Na/K<1 and Na/K?1, and their dietary pattern focused on sodium and potassium intakes and Na/K ratio of major food groups were analyzed and compared. Results: The average Na/K ratio of the subjects was 1.5; the highest ratio was in the twenties. Daily sodium and potassium intakes were significantly high in the Na/K?1 group and the Na/K<1 group, respectively. Sodium intake from grains, meat, fish, and seasonings of the Na/K?1 group and potassium intake from potatoes, beans, nuts, and fruits of the Na/K<1 group were significantly higher than the counterpart groups. Food groups with the lowest Na/K (0.1) were fruits, cooked rice, and beans, and a Na/K ratio greater than 10.0 included seasonings and salted seafood. The Na/K<1 group consumed more fruits and potatoes and the Na/K?1 group consumed more grains, beverages, meats, and seasonings. Conclusions: Dietary Na/K ratio of Koreans was significantly higher than Korean or WHO guidelines. Recommendation of reducing sodium intake from grains, meats, and seasonings and increasing potassium intake from fruits, potatoes, and beans may be suggested for lowering the Na/K ratio. ?Mattioli 1885.","potassium; sodium; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; dietary pattern; female; fish; grain; human; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; meat; metabolic ratio; middle aged; nut; potassium intake; potato; rice; sodium intake"
"Effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture for poststroke patients with shoulder pain: Study protocol for a double-center, randomized, patient- and assessor-blinded, sham-controlled, parallel, clinical trial",2019,"Background: Practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine have suggested that acupuncture could alleviate poststroke shoulder pain, based on the clinical evidence. This study protocol is aimed at showing the effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture therapy for stroke survivors with shoulder pain. Methods: After assessing their eligibility, 60 stroke survivors with shoulder pain will be enrolled from two traditional Korean medicine hospitals and randomly divided into either the verum or the sham electroacupuncture (EA) group with a 1:1 ratio. The participants will receive 9 sessions of EA procedures for 3 weeks. The verum EA consists of needling on 6 unilateral acupoints (LI4, LI15, TE14, SI9, SI11, and GB21) with electronic stimulation. A non-penetrating Park sham device and fake electronic stimulation will be used in the sham group on the same acupoints. Patients and outcome assessors will be blinded throughout the entire study. A visual analog scale will be used primarily for the evaluation, and pain rating scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity, modified Ashworth scale, manual muscle test, passive range of motion test, Korean version of a modified Barthel index, and Korean version of the Beck depression inventory will be also be measured. A blinding index will be assessed. For safety, adverse events will be recorded. Data will be statistically analyzed by two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for efficacy and a chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for safety, at 5% of significance level. Discussion: We expect this double-center, randomized, sham-controlled, patient- and assessor-blinded parallel trial to explore the effectiveness and safety of EA therapy, compared with sham EA, for poststroke shoulder pain.

"Registered Nurses (RNs)’ knowledge sharing and decision-making: the mediating role of organizational trust",2019,"Aim: This study study aimed to investigate the effects of explicit and tacit knowledge sharing on clinical decision-making abilities and the mediating role of trust among registered nurses at Korean hospitals. Background: Decision-making abilities comprise a key area of nursing practice and link nurses’ perceptions with behaviours. Introduction: Tacit knowledge is embedded within an individual and cannot be expressed or transmitted to other people in a specific form. Over time, new nurses gradually gain experience and tacit knowledge and become experts. Trust, an organizational characteristic, may serve as a potential mediator in the association between knowledge sharing and decision-making abilities among nurses. However, few studies have investigated the mediatory role of trust in this association. Method: The data were collected from 210 nurses selected via random sampling. The research instrument in the model included Knowledge-Sharing Behavior, Trust, and Clinical Decision-Making in Nursing Scale. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the collected data. Findings: The study findings showed that explicit knowledge sharing directly affects decision-making abilities, whereas tacit knowledge sharing is only associated with decision-making abilities when trust plays a mediating role. Discussion: A higher level of organizational trust can improve clinical decision-making abilities via tacit knowledge sharing. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that unlike explicit knowledge, which is shared more easily, tacit knowledge sharing does not directly lead to clinical decision-making abilities. A higher level of organizational trust leads to a stronger beneficial effect of tacit knowledge sharing on clinical decision-making abilities. Implications for nursing and health policy: These findings concerning the mediatory role of trust on the association between knowledge sharing and clinical decision-making abilities provide new knowledge that will allow nurses, managers, and researchers to support the clinical decision-making abilities of nurses. ? 2019 International Council of Nurses","article; capacity building; clinical decision making; health care policy; human; manager; mediator; nursing practice; perception; registered nurse; sampling; scientist; structural equation modeling; trust; cooperation; health personnel attitude; knowledge management; nursing staff; organization and management; organizational culture; psychology; public relations; trust; work engagement; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cooperative Behavior; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Knowledge Management; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Organizational Culture; Trust; Work Engagement"
"A high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with recovery from ramsay hunt syndrome",2019,"Background: Prediction of the severity and outcomes of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is difficult. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive power of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for the severity and outcomes of RHS. Material and Methods: From 2007 to 2017, a retrospective study of 102 hospitalized patients with RHS was conducted. The degree of paralysis was assessed by determining the House-Brackmann (H-B) grade. Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were assessed, and the blood NLR and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were determined. The patients received steroids and antivirals, and were followed in the outpatient department at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Results: The H-B grade of the high-NLR group was significantly higher than that of the normal-NLR group (p = 0.039), and the probability of complete recovery was significantly lower in the high-NLR group (p = 0.048). Conclusions: Patients with RHS who have an elevated NLR have poor outcomes in terms of the H-B grade. Therefore, the NLR may be useful for evaluating the prognosis of patients with RHS. ? 2019 S.

"Predicting risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Korean adults aged 40–69 by integrating clinical and genetic factors",2019,"Aims: The purpose of our investigation was to identify the genetic and clinical risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to predict the incidence of T2DM in Korean adults aged 40–69 at follow-up intervals of 5, 7, and 10 years. Methods: Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) cohort data (n = 10,030) were used to develop T2DM prediction models. Both clinical-only and integrated (clinical factors + genetic factors) models were derived using the Cox proportional hazards model. Internal validation was performed to evaluate the prediction capabilities of the clinical and integrated models. Results: The clinical model included 10 selected clinical risk factors. The selected SNPs for the integrated model were rs9311835 in PTPRG, rs10975266 in RIC1, rs11057302 in TMED2, rs17154562 in ADAM12, and rs8038172 in CGNL1. For the clinical model, validated c-indices with time points of 5, 7, and 10 years were 0.744, 0.732, and 0.732, respectively. Slightly higher validated c-indices were observed for the integrated model at 0.747, 0.736, and 0.738, respectively. The p-values of the survival net reclassification improvement (NRI) for the SNP point-based score were statistically significant. Conclusions: Clinical and integrated models can be effectively used to predict the incidence of T2DM in Koreans. ? 2018","adult; aged; biological model; female; genetic marker; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; incidence; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phenotype; prognosis; risk assessment; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; time factor; Adult; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors"
"A young woman with right upper quadrant pain",2019,"Patients with right upper quadrant pain are commonly encountered in the emergency department. The causes of right upper quadrant range from infection or inflammation to malignancy. Thus, prompt and accurate diagnoses are essential in the emergency department. However, vicarious excretion of contrast media via the gallbladder, presenting as right upper quadrant pain, has been rarely reported and is not well known. The present case is instructive because gallbladder opacification is often considered a pathologic condition in patients with right upper quadrant pain. Although vicarious excretion via the gallbladder is uncommon in patients with right upper quadrant pain, inaccurate or delayed diagnoses may prolong hospitalization and increase medical costs due to unnecessary and invasive diagnostic procedures. ?

"Effects of a gintonin-enriched fraction on hair growth: an in vitro and in vivo study",2020,"Background: Ginseng has been widely used as a health-promoting tonic. Gintonin present in ginseng acts as a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand that activates six LPA receptor subtypes. The LPA6 subtype plays a key role in normal hair growth, and mutations in the LPA6 receptor impair normal human hair growth. Currently, human hair loss and alopecia are concerning issues that affect peoples' social and day-to-day lives. Objective: We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of a gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) on mouse hair growth. Methods: Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used. The mice were divided into the four groups: control, 1% minoxidil, 0.75% GEF, and 1.5% GEF. The dorsal hair was removed to synchronize the telogen phase. Each group was treated topically, once a day, for 15 days. We analyzed hair growth activity and histological changes. Results: GEF induced transient [Ca2+]i, which stimulated HFDPC proliferation and caused 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner. GEF-mediated HFDPC proliferation was blocked by the LPA receptor antagonist and Ca2+ chelator. HFDPC treatment with GEF stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor release. Topical application of GEF and minoxidil promoted hair growth in a dose-dependent manner. Histological analysis showed that GEF and minoxidil increased the number of hair follicles and hair weight. Conclusion: Topical application of GEF promotes mouse hair growth through HFDPC proliferation. GEF could be one of the main components of ginseng that promote hair growth and could be used to treat human alopecia. ? 2019","1,2 bis(2 aminophenoxy)ethane n,n,n',n' tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); broxuridine; calcium chelating agent; ginseng saponin; gintonin enriched fraction; ki 16425; lysophosphatidic acid receptor; lysophospholipid receptor antagonist; minoxidil; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; animal experiment; anthropometric parameters; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; cell proliferation; controlled study; cutaneous parameters; drug effect; hair follicle; hair follicle cell; hair growth; hair weight; histopathology; human; human cell; human hair follicle dermal papilla cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal"

"Pleiotropic pharmacological actions of capsazepine, a synthetic analogue of capsaicin, against various cancers and inflammatory diseases",2019,"Capsazepine is a synthetic analogue of capsaicin that can function as an antagonist of TRPV1. Capsazepine can exhibit diverse effects on cancer (prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, oral cancer, and osteosarcoma) growth and survival, and can be therapeutically used against other major disorders such as colitis, pancreatitis, malaria, and epilepsy. Capsazepine has been reported to exhibit pleiotropic anti-cancer effects against numerous tumor cell lines. Capsazepine can modulate Janus activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription (STAT) pathway, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-JNK-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) pathways. It can inhibit cell proliferation, metastasis, and induce apoptosis. Moreover, capsazepine can exert anti-inflammatory effects through the downregulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB), as well as the blockage of activation of both transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, and member 1 (TRPA1). This review briefly summarizes the diverse pharmacological actions of capsazepine against various cancers and inflammatory conditions. ? 2019 by the authors.","antiinflammatory agent; antineoplastic agent; capsaicin; capsazepine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Janus kinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; vanilloid receptor; animal; drug effect; human; metabolism; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Capsaicin; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Janus Kinases; NF-kappa B; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; TRPV Cation Channels"
"Abnormal activation of motor cortical network during phasic REM sleep in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder",2019,"Study Objectives We investigated electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral density and functional connectivity during phasic and tonic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and examined any differences between patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and controls. Methods EEG data from 13 people with iRBD (mean age, 66.3 years; men, 84.6%) and 10 controls (mean age, 62.3 years; men, 70%) were analyzed. We selected thirty 3 s miniepochs of both tonic and phasic REM sleep. We estimated relative power for six frequency bands. For functional connectivity analysis, we calculated weighted phase lag index (wPLI) and conducted pairwise comparisons between the two groups. Results EEG power spectral analysis revealed significant interactions between the REM sleep state (phasic vs. tonic) and group at sigma (p = 0.009) and beta (p = 0.002) bands. Sigma- and beta-power decrease during phasic REM sleep was more pronounced and extensive in people with iRBD than in controls. Regarding functional connectivity, there were significant interactions between the REM sleep state and group at alpha (p = 0.029), sigma (p = 0.047), beta (p = 0.015), and gamma (p = 0.046) bands. The average wPLI was significantly higher during phasic REM sleep than during tonic REM sleep, which was observed in people with iRBD but not in controls. The altered functional connections mainly involved the frontal and parietal regions at beta and gamma bands. Conclusions Our findings provide neurophysiological evidence for pathological motor cortex activation during phasic REM sleep which may be associated with generation of dream-enacting behaviors in iRBD. ?

"Longitudinal analysis to better characterize Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: Findings from an adult asthma cohort in Korea (COREA)",2019,"Background: Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS), which has received much attention, has not been unanimously defined. Objective: In this study, we tried to demonstrate that longitudinally defined ACOS is more useful in the real world than blending patients with asthma and COPD. Methods: The study patients had undergone two consecutive pulmonary function tests measured at least 3?months apart (n?=?1889). We selected the patients who had positive bronchodilator response or methacholine provocation tests (n?=?959). Next, we defined ACOS as a patient with a persistent airflow obstruction [forced expiratory volume in 1?second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity <0.7] that was identified twice consecutively by an interval of at least 3?months (n?=?228). Results: The proportions of patients who were older, male and smokers were significantly higher, and baseline lung function was lower in patients with ACOS. In the longitudinal analysis, the mean change in lung function was high, and a greater decline in FEV1 was observed in patients with ACOS. In addition, we compared ACOS and severe asthma, and we also performed a cluster analysis and compared the results with our definition of ACOS. According to our definition, ACOS is an independent subtype with distinctive characteristics. Finally, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify genetic variations associated with ACOS, but no significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ACOS should be defined longitudinally and considered as an independent subgroup distinguished by inherited environmental factors rather than as a genetically distinct independent group. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bronchodilating agent; methacholine; adult; airway obstruction; Article; asthma; asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; chronic obstructive lung disease; cluster analysis; controlled study; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; human; Korea; longitudinal study; lung function test; major clinical study; male; priority journal; provocation test; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; treatment response"
"Label adherence for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in a prospective cohort of asian patients with atrial fibrillation",2019,"Purpose: Label adherence for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has not been well evaluated in Asian patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The present study aimed to assess label adherence for NOACs in a Korean AF population and to determine risk factors of off-label prescriptions of NOACs. Materials and Methods: In this COmparison study of Drugs for symptom control and complication prEvention of AF (CODE-AF) registry, patients with AF who were prescribed NOACs between June 2016 and May 2017 were included. Four NOAC doses were categorized as on-or off-label use according to Korea Food and Drug Regulations. Results: We evaluated 3080 AF patients treated with NOACs (dabigatran 27.2%, rivaroxaban 23.9%, apixaban 36.9%, and edoxaban 12.0%). The mean age was 70.5±9.2 years; 56.0% were men; and the mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 3.3±1.4. Only one-third of the patients (32.7%) was prescribed a standard dose of NOAC. More than one-third of the study population (n=1122, 36.4%) was prescribed an off-label reduced dose of NOAC. Compared to those with an on-label standard dosing, patients with an off-label reduced dose of NOAC were older (?75 years), women, and had a lower body weight (?60 kg), renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance ?50 mL/min), previous stroke, previous bleeding, hypertension, concomitant dronedarone use, and anti-platelet use. Conclusion: In real-world practice, more than one-third of patients with NOAC prescriptions received an off-label reduced dose, which could result in an increased risk of stroke. Considering the high risk of stroke in these patients, on-label use of NOAC is recommended. ?

"Substance P promotes liver sinusoidal endothelium-mediated hepatic regeneration by NO/HGF regulation",2019,"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly specialized and involved in hepatic regeneration by interacting with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatocytes in a paracrine manner. However, hepatic injury can impair cellular activity and lead to endothelial dysfunction, eventually inducing the development of critical hepatic disease, including cirrhosis. Because LSECs exert their effects through paracrine factors, maintenance of paracrine potentials and survival activity in LSECs under injury stress is a critical strategy for inhibiting disease progression. This study explored the effect of Substance-P (SP) on cell viability, proliferation, and nitric oxide (NO)/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) production in LSECs. Under noninjured conditions, SP treatment enhanced cell viability, cell proliferation, and HGF/NO secretion in LSECs. In the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced inflammatory stress, SP blocked TNF-α-induced endothelial dysfunction, accompanied by elevated cell viability and NO/HGF secretion. Interestingly, SP-primed LSEC-conditioned medium accelerated hepatocyte repopulation without causing morphological alterations. The primitive effect of SP was reversed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor or HGF/c-MET inhibitor, indicating the importance of the NO/HGF combination in hepatic regeneration by SP. Taken together, these results suggest SP can protect LSECs from inflammatory stress by NO/HGF, which contributes to hepatocyte repopulation. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","endothelial nitric oxide synthase; nitric oxide; oxygenase inhibitor; scatter factor; substance P; tumor necrosis factor; Article; cell population; cell proliferation; cell viability; endothelial dysfunction; endothelium cell; Hep-G2 cell line; hepatic stellate cell; human; human cell; human cell culture; inflammation; liver cell; liver regeneration; paracrine signaling; priority journal; protein secretion"
"Arthroscopic Findings and Clinical Outcomes in Patients 40 Years of Age and Older With Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation",2019,"Purpose: The present study investigates the intra-articular findings and clinical outcomes after arthroscopic surgery in patients after age 40 with chronic anterior shoulder instability. Methods: Fifty patients older than 40 years who underwent arthroscopic stabilization for recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation were analyzed. Results: The mean age at the time of surgery was 44.8 years (range, 40-72 years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 45 months (range, 28-150 months). The mean visual analog scale score for pain with motion significantly improved from 4.1 preoperatively to 1.7 at the last follow-up (P <.001). The range of motion in the affected shoulder revealed limitations of 9.4° in forward flexion and 17.8° in external rotation compared with the unaffected shoulder. Both the Constant and Rowe scores significantly improved (P <.001 and P <.001, respectively). Recurrence, which includes dislocation and subluxation, occurred in 14% postoperatively. Anteroinferior labral lesion was seen in 92% of patients. Associated lesions included superior labrum anterior to posterior lesion (22%), midsubstance capsular tear (10%), and Hill-Sachs lesion (92%). Rotator cuff tears were found in 18%—partial-thickness tear in 10% and full-thickness tear, which was repaired with suture anchor, in 8%. Among the intra-articular lesions, there was no significant relation with recurrent instability or functional outcome as a single factor. Conclusions: In patients with chronic anterior shoulder instability who were older than 40 years, the clinical results after arthroscopic surgery showed statistically significant improvement with good muscle strength recovery. The quality of labral lesion, size of the Hill-Sachs lesion, and glenoid defect showed positive correlation with the number of preoperative dislocation. The intra-articular pathologies were varied, however no single articular lesion had significant impact on the recurrence rate.

"Meta-analysis and systematic review on laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) and totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) for gastric cancer: Preliminary study for a multicenter prospective KLASS07 trial",2019,"Background: The curative surgical treatment of gastric cancer in the current laparoscopic surgical era relies on the surgeon's preference, technical difficulties, and concerns regarding outcome have led to the availability of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) and laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG). A consensus on which of the two procedures is preferable is necessary. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences between LADG and TLDG in terms of surgical outcomes, postoperative recovery, pain, and complications. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were explored up to 2017 to evaluate TLDG and LADG. Parameters including surgical outcomes, postoperative recovery, and postoperative complications were subjected to meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratio and weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (c.i.). Results: Twenty-five studies (24 non-RCT and 1 RCT) with a total of 4562 gastric cancer patients were included in the meta-analysis. Under reconstruction-matched analysis, overall complications and anastomotic complications were similar for TLDG and LADG. Nevertheless, short-term outcomes such as blood loss, time to first soft diet, hospital stay, analgesic use, and CRP level were favourable for TLDG, while all other surgical outcomes showed no difference. Conclusions: TLDG and LADG did not show significant differences in surgical outcomes and postoperative complications, including anastomotic-related morbidity. Therefore, decisive factors in selecting surgical procedures, which previously consisted of surgical outcomes, have been superseded by extra-surgical values such as cosmesis, economics, and patient's quality of life. These factors will be explored in a future multicentre prospective study (KLASS07 trial). ? 2019","analgesic agent; C reactive protein; abdominal abscess; abdominal bleeding; anastomosis leakage; anastomosis stenosis; cancer patient; cancer surgery; clinical outcome; duodenal stump leakage; flatulence; gastrectomy; gastrectomy Billroth I; gastrectomy Billroth II; gastric stasis; hospitalization; human; intermethod comparison; intestine obstruction; intra abdominal fluid collection; laparoscopic assisted distal gastrectomy; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; lung hemorrhage; lymph node metastasis; meta analysis; multicenter study (topic); operation duration; operative blood loss; pancreas hemorrhage; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative ileus; postoperative pain; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; soft diet; stomach cancer; stomach emptying; systematic review; totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy"
"Effect and neurophysiological mechanism of acupuncture in patients with chronic sciatica: Protocol for a randomized, patient-assessor blind, sham-controlled clinical trial",2019,"Background: Sciatica is a relatively frequent illness that easily becomes a chronic and relapsing condition. Although numerous systematic reviews have analyzed various therapies for sciatica, the validity of their included studies is limited. Considering the limitations of conventional treatment options for sciatica, acupuncture is a possible option; however, evidence supporting its efficacy and mechanism in patients with sciatica is lacking. The aim of this proposed protocol is to investigate the effect and neurophysiological mechanism of acupuncture in patients with chronic sciatica. Methods/design: This study is a randomized, patient-assessor blind, two-arm, parallel, non-penetrating, sham-controlled clinical trial. Eligible participants will include adults (aged 19-70 years old) with a clinical diagnosis of chronic sciatica (40 mm or more of a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) for bothersomeness) blinded to the treatment received. Patients will be randomly allocated into the acupuncture treatment group (manual acupuncture plus electroacupuncture (EA), n = 34) or the sham acupuncture control group (sham acupuncture plus placebo EA without electrical stimulation, n = 34). Groups will receive treatment twice a week for a total of eight sessions over 4 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be implemented at baseline and endpoint to investigate the mechanism of acupuncture. The primary outcome measure is the VAS for bothersomeness and secondary outcomes include the VAS for pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index, EuroQol 5-Dimension, Coping Strategy Questionnaire, Beck's Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Adverse events will be assessed at every visit. Discussion: The results of this trial (which will be available in 2020) should provide important clinical evidence for the effect of acupuncture and demonstrate how acupuncture can be helpful for the treatment of chronic sciatica.

"Dairy food consumption is inversely associated with the prevalence of periodontal disease in Korean adults",2019,"Dairy food consumption is known to be inversely associated with periodontal disease. However, there are conflicting results depending on the type of dairy foods. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between individual dairy food consumption and periodontal disease. A total of 9798 Korean adults, aged ?30 years, who participated in the fifth and sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were included in this study’s analysis. Dairy food consumption was measured by the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Periodontal disease was defined as Community Periodontal Index score ?3 in more than one of six sextants. Frequent intake of dairy foods (?7 servings/week) was associated with a 24% lower prevalence of periodontal disease compared with never consumers after adjustment for age, gender, income, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, diabetes mellitus status, calcium intake, tooth brushing frequency, and use of dental floss (Odds ratio (OR)= 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63-0.91, p for trend = 0.052). Also, frequent intake of milk (?7 servings/week) was associated with a 26% lower prevalence of periodontal disease after adjustment for potential confounders (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61-0.89, p for trend = 0.022). Frequent consumption of dairy food including milk may have a bene?cial e?ect on periodontal disease in the Korean adult population. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by a timosaponin A3 from Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge on AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells",2019,"Background: Timosaponin A3 (TA3), one of the active components of spirostanol saponin isolated from A. asphodeloides, is widely used as an anticancer agent in a variety of cancer cell lines. However, the research on the anticancer efficacy is very limited in human pancreatic cancer models. Purpose: In this study, we investigated the molecular targets in the active components of A. asphodeloides, which showed anti-cancer effects in human pancreatic cancer cells, and confirmed the pathways involved. Study design: The apoptotic effects of five solvent extracts of A. asphodeloides in human pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1) was studied, and the phytochemical leading to their effects identified. Next, we determined whether the phytochemical inhibit STAT3 and ERK1/2, and investigated the pathways involved. Methods: Five solvent extracts of A. asphodeloides (100 ?g/ml, 24 h) was investigated for their cytotoxicity against AsPC-1 cells. The active ingredient of the extract exhibiting the highest toxicity were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Next, we studied the mechanism of action of the phytochemical in pancreatic cancer. Cell cycle and annexin V/FITC assays were performed to assess cell growth and apoptosis capacity. The effects on apoptosis and proliferation-related pathways, STAT3, and MAPKs were confirmed at the protein level using immunoblotting. The factors regulated in the pathways were investigated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: The results showed that the ethyl acetate extract of A. asphodeloides (EAA) induced apoptotic and anti-proliferative activities through the STAT3 and MAPKs pathways. We found that TA3, an active component of EAA, inhibits constitutive STAT3 and ERK1/2 proteins. EAA and TA3 decreased the viability of AsPC-1 cells, leading to cell cycle arrest at the sub-G1 and G2/M phases. Moreover, TA3 inhibited the expression of various genes encoding anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl), proliferative (Cyclin D1), metastatic (MMP-9), and angiogenic (VEGF-1) proteins. Conclusion: The results indicated that TA3, an active phytochemical from A. asphodeloides, could induce apoptosis and suppress cell proliferation by inhibiting the STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways. Thus, TA3 is a candidate cancer chemotherapeutic agent instead to treat human pancreatic cancer. ? 2018","Anemarrhena asphodeloides bunge extract; antineoplastic agent; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; dasatinib; gelatinase B; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; plant extract; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; saponin; STAT3 protein; timosaponin a3; unclassified drug; vasculotropin receptor 1; antineoplastic agent; saponin; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; steroid; timosaponin AIII; Anemarrhena asphodeloides; Anemarrhena asphodeloides bunge; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; AsPC-1 cell line; cancer cell line; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle S phase; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell viability; comparative study; concentration response; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug mechanism; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression; gene overexpression; human; human cell; immunoblotting; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; phytochemistry; prediction; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; Anemarrhena; apoptosis; cell cycle checkpoint; chemistry; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; MAPK signaling; metabolism; pancreas tumor; pathology; tumor cell line; Anemarrhena; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Saponins; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Steroids"
"Intra-Articular Injection of Autologous Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Phase IIb, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial",2019,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been the focus of an emerging treatment for osteoarthritis. However, few studies reported about outcomes of an intra-articular injection of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intra-articular injection of AD-MSCs for patients with knee osteoarthritis. It was a prospective double-blinded, randomized controlled, phase IIb clinical trial. AD-MSCs were administered for 12 patients (MSC group), and the group was compared with 12 knees with injection of normal saline (control group) up to 6 months. All procedures were performed in the outpatient clinic. Primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) score. Secondary outcome measure included various clinical and radiologic examination, and safety after injection. Change of cartilage defect after injection was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Single injection of AD-MSCs led to a significant improvement of the WOMAC score at 6 months. In the control group, there was no significant change in the WOMAC score at 6 months. No serious adverse events were observed in both groups during the follow-up period. In MRI, there was no significant change of cartilage defect at 6 months in MSC group whereas the defect in the control group was increased. An intra-articular injection of autologous AD-MSCs provided satisfactory functional improvement and pain relief for patients with knee osteoarthritis in the outpatient setting, without causing adverse events at 6 months' follow-up.

"Semantic preservation of standardized healthcare documents in big data",2019,"Background: Standardized healthcare documents have a high adoption rate in today's hospital setup. This brings several challenges as processing the documents on a large scale takes a toll on the infrastructure. The complexity of these documents compounds the issue of handling them which is why applying big data techniques is necessary. The nature of big data techniques can trigger accuracy/semantic loss in health documents when they are partitioned for processing. This semantic loss is critical with respect to clinical use as well as insurance, or medical education. Methods: In this paper we propose a novel technique to avoid any semantic loss that happens during the conventional partitioning of healthcare documents in big data through a constraint model based on the conformance of clinical document standard and user based use cases. We used clinical document architecture (CDAR) datasets on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) through uniquely configured setup. We identified the affected documents with respect to semantic loss after partitioning and separated them into two sets: conflict free documents and conflicted documents. The resolution for conflicted documents was done based on different resolution strategies that were mapped according to CDAR specification. The first part of the technique is focused in identifying the type of conflict in the blocks that arises after partitioning. The second part focuses on the resolution mapping of the conflicts based on the constraints applied depending on the validation and user scenario. Results: We used a publicly available dataset of CDAR documents, identified all conflicted documents and resolved all the them successfully to avoid any semantic loss. In our experiment we tested up to 87,000 CDAR documents and successfully identified the conflicts and resolved the semantic issues. Conclusion: We have presented a novel study that focuses on the semantics of big data which did not compromise the performance and resolved the semantic issues risen during the processing of clinical documents. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; File organization; Health care; Medical education; Clinical document architectures; Clinical documents; Different resolutions; Document handling; Document standards; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Novel techniques; Semantic preservation; Semantics; article; big data; human; human experiment; insurance; medical education; semantics; validation process; health care delivery; Big Data; Delivery of Health Care; Semantics"
"Panax ginseng (Korea Red Ginseng) repairs diabetic sensorineural damage through promotion of the nerve growth factor pathway in diabetic zebrafish",2019,"Background: Diabetic sensorineural damage is a complication of the sensory neural system, resulting from long-term hyperglycemia. Red ginseng (RG) has shown efficacy for treatment of various diseases, including diabetes mellitus; however, there is little research about its benefit for treating sensorineural damage. Therefore, we aim to evaluate RG efficacy in alloxan-induced diabetic neuromast (AIDN) zebrafish. Methods: In this study, we developed and validated an AIDN zebrafish model. To assess RG effectiveness, we observed morphological changes in live neuromast zebrafish. Also, zebrafish has been observed to have an ultrastructure of hair-cell cilia under scanning electron microscopy. Thus, we recorded these physiological traits to assess hair cell function. Finally, we confirmed that RG promoted neuromast recovery via nerve growth factor signaling pathway markers. Results: First, we established an AIDN zebrafish model. Using this model, we showed via live neuromast imaging that RG fostered recovery of sensorineural damage. Damaged hair cell cilia were recovered in AIDN zebrafish. Furthermore, RG rescued damaged hair cell function through cell membrane ion balance. Conclusion: Our data suggest that RG potentially facilitates recovery in AIDN zebrafish, and its mechanism seems to be promotion of the nerve growth factor pathway through increased expression of topomyosin receptor kinase A, transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily type 1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. ? 2018","ginseng extract; nerve growth factor; adult; alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell membrane; cilium; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic sensorineural damage; diabetic sensorineural damage; drug efficacy; ginseng; hair cell; neuromast; nonhuman; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy"
"Effectiveness and safety of polydioxanone thread embedding acupuncture compared to physical therapy in the treatment of patients with non-specific chronic neck pain: Study protocol for an assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled, clinical trial",2019,"As the number of patients who suffer from non-specific chronic neck pain (CNP) is increasing in the Republic of Korea, conservative treatments for patients with CNP have been spotlighted. Although several studies on thread embedding acupuncture (TEA) treatment have been published for the treatment of such patients, no randomized controlled trial has been reported that investigates the effectiveness and safety of the TEA treatment compared with other conservative treatments for the treatment of patients with CNP. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of TEA to those of physical therapy (PT) for the treatment of patients with CNP.Methods/design:This study is planned as a parallel design, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, clinical study. One hundred twenty-eight patients diagnosed with CNP will be randomly assigned to either the TEA group or the PT group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the TEA group will receive 4 sessions of TEA treatment, while those in the PT group will receive 8 sessions of PT treatment over 4 weeks. An assessment of effectiveness based on the outcomes of the Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPDS), cervical spinal angle, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), EuroQol-Five Dimension 3 level version (EQ-5D-3L), and Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) will be conducted at baseline, and at 5, 9, and 13 weeks.

"MiR-200c downregulates HIF-1α and inhibits migration of lung cancer cells",2019,"Background: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor with a pivotal role in physiological and pathological responses to hypoxia. While HIF-1α is known to be involved in hypoxia-induced upregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression, HIF-1α is also targeted by miRNAs. In this study, miRNAs targeting HIF-1α were identified and their effects on its expression and downstream target genes under hypoxic conditions were investigated. Cell migration under the same conditions was also assessed. Methods: microRNAs that target HIF-1α were screened using 3′-untranslated region luciferase (3′-UTR-luciferase) reporter assays. The expression levels of HIF-1α and its downstream target genes after transfection with miRNA were assessed using quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses. The effect of the miRNAs on the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α was determined using hypoxia-responsive element luciferase (HRE-luciferase) assays. Cell migration under hypoxia was examined using the wound-healing assay. Results: Several of the 19 screened miRNAs considerably decreased the luciferase activity. Transfection with miR-200c had substantial impact on the expression level and transcription activity of HIF-1α. The mRNA level of HIF-1α downstream genes decreased in response to miR-200c overexpression. MiR-200c inhibited cell migration in normoxia and, to a greater extent, in hypoxia. These effects were partly reversed by HIF-1α expression under hypoxic conditions. Conclusion: miR-200c negatively affects hypoxia-induced responses by downregulating HIF-1α, a key regulator of hypoxia. Therefore, overexpression of miR-200c might have therapeutic potential as an anticancer agent that inhibits tumor hypoxia. ? 2019, The Author(s).","carbonate dehydratase IX; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; microRNA; microRNA 155; microRNA 18; microRNA 200c; microRNA 549; pyruvate kinase; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; luciferase; messenger RNA; microRNA; MIRN200 microRNA, human; 3' untranslated region; A-549 cell line; ALDOA gene; amino acid sequence; antineoplastic activity; Article; CA9 gene; cell migration; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; down regulation; gene; gene amplification; human; human cell; LDHA gene; lung cancer cell line; MCF-7 cell line; NCI-H460 cell line; open reading frame; PGK1 gene; PKM gene; protein degradation; protein expression; protein stability; transcription initiation; ubiquitination; upregulation; cell hypoxia; cell motion; down regulation; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; pathology; reporter gene; tumor cell line; wound healing; 3' Untranslated Regions; Base Sequence; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; DNA Methylation; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Luciferases; Lung Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; RNA, Messenger; Transcription, Genetic; Up-Regulation; Wound Healing"
"Associations among daytime sleepiness, depression and suicidal ideation in Korean adolescents",2019,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of daytime sleepiness on depression and suicidal ideation in adolescent high-school students. A survey of 538 high school students aged 16-17 years attending two academic schools was conducted. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Beck Depression Inventory and the Scale for Suicide Ideation were used to assess subjects' daytime sleepiness, depression and suicidal ideation. The mean score for daytime sleepiness was 8.52, which indicates a sleep deficit. Significant positive correlations were found between daytime sleepiness and depression, between daytime sleepiness and suicidal ideation and between depression and suicidal ideation. Gender and depression were significant predictors of suicidal ideation, accounting for 48% of the variance in this measure. Depression acts as a mediator of the relationship between daytime sleepiness and suicidal ideation. High school students in Korea generally have insufficient sleep time and feel sleepy during the day; insufficient sleep during adolescence may be associated with depression and suicidal ideation. ? 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.","adolescent; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; behavior disorder assessment; child psychiatry; cross-sectional study; daytime somnolence; depression; disease association; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; high school student; human; Korea; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; religion; Scale for Suicide Ideation; self report; sleep debt; sleep deprivation; sleep pattern; sleep time; South Korea; suicidal ideation"

"Improvement in the survival rates of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported respiratory failure patients: A multicenter retrospective study in Korean patients 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1103 Clinical Sciences",2019,"Background: Although the utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasing and its technology is evolving, only a few epidemiologic reports have described the uses and outcomes of ECMO. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in utilization and survival rate in patients supported with ECMO for severe respiratory failure in Korea. Methods: This was a multicenter study on consecutive patients who underwent ECMO across 16 hospitals in Korea. The records of all patients who required ECMO for acute respiratory failure between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed, and the utilization of ECMO was analyzed over time. Results: During the study period, 5552 patients received ECMO in Korea as a whole, and a total of 2472 patients received ECMO at the participating 16 hospitals. We analyzed 487 (19.7%) patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure. The number of ECMO procedures provided for respiratory failure increased from 104 to 153 during the study period. The in-hospital survival rate increased from 30.8% to 35.9%. The use of prone positioning increased from 6.8% to 49.0% (p < 0.001), and the use of neuromuscular blockers also increased from 28.2% to 58.2% (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that old age (OR 1.038 (95% CI 1.022, 1.054)), use of corticosteroid (OR 2.251 (95% CI 1.153, 4.397)), continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 2.196 (95% CI 1.135, 4.247)), driving pressure (OR 1.072 (95% CI 1.031, 1.114)), and prolonged ECMO duration (OR 1.020 (95% CI 1.003, 1.038)) were associated with increased odds of mortality. Conclusions: Utilization of ECMO and survival rates of patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure increased over time in Korea. The use of pre-ECMO prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers also increased during the same period. ? 2019 The Author(s).","bicarbonate; corticosteroid; hypertensive factor; neuromuscular blocking agent; nitric oxide; acute respiratory failure; adult; age; aged; Article; continuous renal replacement therapy; controlled study; disease severity; drug megadose; drug use; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; health care utilization; high risk patient; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; priority journal; prone position; retrospective study; South Korean; survival rate; therapy effect; treatment duration; APACHE; chi square distribution; clinical trial; extracorporeal oxygenation; middle aged; multicenter study; nonparametric test; procedures; respiratory failure; South Korea; standards; statistics and numerical data; survival rate; treatment outcome; trends; Aged; APACHE; Chi-Square Distribution; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Respiratory Insufficiency; Retrospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"
"Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure on intraocular pressure and optic nerve sheath diameter in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A randomized, clinical trial",2019,"BACKGROUND: There has been no study of the effect of post end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on intraocular or intracranial pressure during pneumoperitoneum with steep Trendelenburg positioning. We investigated the effects of 5?cmH2O of PEEP on intraocular pressure and optic nerve sheath diameter as a surrogate for intracranial pressure in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were divided into a zero-PEEP (ZEEP) group and a 5?cmH2O of PEEP (PEEP) group. Intraocular pressure, optic nerve sheath diameter, and respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were measured before induction (T0), 10?minutes after induction of general anesthesia in the supine position before CO2 insufflation (T1), 5?minutes (T2), and 30?minutes (T3) after steep Trendelenburg positioning with pneumoperitoneum, after desufflation of pneumoperitoneum in the supine position (T4), and after 30?minutes in the recovery room postoperatively (T5). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in intraocular pressure or optic nerve sheath diameter between the groups during the study. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen and dynamic lung compliance at T1, T2, T3, and T4 were significantly higher in the PEEP than in the ZEEP group. There was no difference in mean arterial pressure or heart rate between groups at any time. CONCLUSION: Applying 5?cmH2O of PEEP did not increase intraocular pressure or optic nerve sheath diameter during pneumoperitoneum with steep Trendelenburg positioning in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. These results suggest that low PEEP can be safely applied during surgery with pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positioning in patients without preexisting eye disease and brain pathology.","carbon dioxide; aged; anatomy and histology; artificial pneumoperitoneum; controlled study; head-down tilt; human; intracranial pressure; intraocular pressure; laparoscopy; male; middle aged; myelin sheath; optic nerve; positive end expiratory pressure; procedures; prostatectomy; randomized controlled trial; robotic surgical procedure; Aged; Carbon Dioxide; Head-Down Tilt; Humans; Intracranial Pressure; Intraocular Pressure; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Myelin Sheath; Optic Nerve; Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Prostatectomy; Robotic Surgical Procedures"
"Willow-like portable triboelectric respiration sensor based on polyethylenimine-assisted CO2 capture",2019,"Real-time bio-signal detecting devices are critical for obtaining important physiological signals and recognizing respiratory diseases; the respiration sensor is one such important device. In this paper, human respiration is measured by using the triboelectric effect that converts the ambient mechanical energy into electrical energy by using a three-dimensional printed triboelectric respiration sensor (TRS). This TRS has a willow-like fluorinated ethylene propylene film between the right and left electrode plates; it generates electricity using a simple contact-separation motion. A 10 wt% solution of polyethylenimine, which enables carbon dioxide capturing, is coated and evaporated only on the right electrode of the TRS to distinguish the inspiration and expiration conditions. The distances between the adjacent electrodes, the air gap between the electrodes, and the top of the container in the TRS were systematically optimized by using the finite element method. The sensitivity to the air flow rate is characterized by different gradients of the output voltage. Analyzing the output voltage allows the TRS to identify four types of respirations: strong, weak, long, and short. This portable and self-powered respiration sensor will open new horizons for portable TRS devices because of its low cost and facile fabrication that uses three-dimensional printing technology. This device will also reduce the distress experienced by patients who are recovering from their respiratory disorders. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Electrodes; Energy harvesting; Ethylene; Patient rehabilitation; Signal processing; Triboelectricity; Contact separation; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; Mechanical energies; Nanogenerator; Physiological signals; Polyethylenimines; Pulmonary rehabilitations; Respiratory disorders; 3D printers"
"Treadmill exercise ameliorates chemotherapy-induced muscle weakness and central fatigue by enhancing mitochondrial function and inhibiting apoptosis",2019,"Purpose: Chemotherapy is associated with the side effects including damage to the mitochondrial DNA. Doxorubicin (DOX) serves as a chemotherapeutic agent for the patients with breast cancer or prostate cancer. DOX causes muscle weakness and fatigue. We investigated the effects of treadmill exercise on DOX-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in relation to central fatigue. For this study, we used the rat model of DOX-induced muscle damage. Methods: DOX (2 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 1 time per week for 4 weeks. Treadmill running continued 5 days per week for 4 weeks. Muscle strength and fatigue index in the gastrocnemius were measured. Immunohistochemistry for the expressions of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the dorsal raphe was conducted. We used western blot analysis for the expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspases-3 in the gastrocnemius. Mitochondrial function in the gastrocnemius was also evaluated. Results: DOX treatment decreased muscle strength with increase of fatigue index in the gastrocnemius. Mitochondria function was deteriorated and apoptosis in the gastrocnemius was enhanced by DOX treatment. Expressions of TPH and 5-HT in the dorsal raphe were increased by DOX treatment. Treadmill exercise attenuated DOX-induced muscle fatigue and impairment of mitochondria function. Apoptosis in the gastrocnemius was inhibited and over-expression of TPH and 5-HT was suppressed by treadmill exercise. Conclusions: Apoptosis was enhanced and mitochondria function was deteriorated by DOX treatment, resulting in muscle weakness and central fatigue. Treadmill exercise suppressed apoptosis and prevented deterioration of mitochondria function in muscle, resulting in alleviation of muscle weakness and central fatigue during DOX therapy. ? 2019 Korean Continence Society","caspase 3; doxorubicin; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; serotonin; tryptophan hydroxylase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cell function; controlled study; dorsal raphe nucleus; gastrocnemius muscle; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; mitochondrion; muscle fatigue; muscle strength; muscle weakness; nonhuman; rat; treadmill exercise; Western blotting"
"Effects of Smartphone-Based Mobile Learning in Nursing Education: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",2019,"Purpose: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of smartphone-based mobile learning for nurses and nursing students. Methods: Electronic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ProQuest Central, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Educational Resource Information Center (ERIC) was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed empirical studies for inclusion and extracted the design, sample size, intervention method, outcome variables, and statistical values of them. Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool. To estimate the effect size, meta-analysis was performed using R meta program. Results: Authors identified 11 randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials of a total of 3,419 studies. Overall effect sizes by random-effects model was large [Hedges'g (g) = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–1.52], with learning attitude (g = 1.69), skills (g = 1.41), knowledge (g = 1.47), and confidence in performance (g = 1.54). For heterogeneity, subgroup analyses using meta-analysis of variance were performed, but no significant difference was found. Finally, a funnel plot and Egger's regression test along with trim-and-fill analysis and fail-safe N were conducted to check for publication bias, but no significant bias was detected. Conclusion: Smartphone-based mobile learning had significantly positive influence on nursing students' knowledge, skills, confidence in performance, and learning attitude. Smartphone-based mobile learning may be an alternative or supportive method for better education in nursing fields. ? 2019","human; knowledge; learning; meta analysis; nurse; nursing education; nursing student; outcome assessment; priority journal; Review; satisfaction; skill; systematic review; education; learning; nursing education; organization and management; smartphone; Education, Distance; Education, Nursing; Humans; Learning; Smartphone; Students, Nursing"
"Prolonged–release melatonin in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder",2019,"Objective: We investigated the effects of prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) on idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). Methods: In this 4-week, randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled pilot study, 30 participants with polysomnography–confirmed iRBD were assigned to receive PRM 2?mg per day, PRM 6?mg per day, or placebo. Medication was administered orally 30?min before bedtime. Primary outcomes included scores from the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and the Korean version of the RBD questionnaire-Hong Kong (RBDQ-KR). The secondary outcomes included RBDQ-KR factor 1 and factor 2 subscores, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, the Short Form Health Survey version 2 score, and the frequency of dream–enacting behaviors assessed using a sleep diary. Results: After 4?weeks, there were no differences in the proportions of patients with a CGI-I score of much improved or very much improved among the study groups. In addition, RBDQ-KR scores and secondary outcomes were not improved in all groups at 4?weeks, and there were no differences between the groups. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PRM may not be effective in treating RBD–related symptoms within the dose range used in this study.

"Development and Validation of a Deep Learning-Based Automated Detection Algorithm for Major Thoracic Diseases on Chest Radiographs",2019,"Importance: Interpretation of chest radiographs is a challenging task prone to errors, requiring expert readers. An automated system that can accurately classify chest radiographs may help streamline the clinical workflow. Objectives: To develop a deep learning-based algorithm that can classify normal and abnormal results from chest radiographs with major thoracic diseases including pulmonary malignant neoplasm, active tuberculosis, pneumonia, and pneumothorax and to validate the algorithm's performance using independent data sets. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study developed a deep learning-based algorithm using single-center data collected between November 1, 2016, and January 31, 2017. The algorithm was externally validated with multicenter data collected between May 1 and July 31, 2018. A total of 54?221 chest radiographs with normal findings from 47?917 individuals (21?556 men and 26?361 women; mean [SD] age, 51 [16] years) and 35?613 chest radiographs with abnormal findings from 14?102 individuals (8373 men and 5729 women; mean [SD] age, 62 [15] years) were used to develop the algorithm. A total of 486 chest radiographs with normal results and 529 with abnormal results (1 from each participant; 628 men and 387 women; mean [SD] age, 53 [18] years) from 5 institutions were used for external validation. Fifteen physicians, including nonradiology physicians, board-certified radiologists, and thoracic radiologists, participated in observer performance testing. Data were analyzed in August 2018. Exposures: Deep learning-based algorithm. Main Outcomes and Measures: Image-wise classification performances measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; lesion-wise localization performances measured by area under the alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The algorithm demonstrated a median (range) area under the curve of 0.979 (0.973-1.000) for image-wise classification and 0.972 (0.923-0.985) for lesion-wise localization; the algorithm demonstrated significantly higher performance than all 3 physician groups in both image-wise classification (0.983 vs 0.814-0.932; all P?<?.005) and lesion-wise localization (0.985 vs 0.781-0.907; all P?<?.001). Significant improvements in both image-wise classification (0.814-0.932 to 0.904-0.958; all P?<?.005) and lesion-wise localization (0.781-0.907 to 0.873-0.938; all P?<?.001) were observed in all 3 physician groups with assistance of the algorithm.

"Anti-obesity effect of taurine through inhibition of adipogenesis in white fat tissue but not in brown fat tissue in a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model",2019,"This study was conducted to evaluate the anti-obesity effects of long-term taurine supplementation in a mild obese ICR mouse model and to study the mechanism by which taurine induces weight loss. Three groups of male ICR mice were fed a normal chow diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), or an HFD supplemented with 2% taurine in drinking water for 28?weeks. Body weight was measured every week. Metabolic, behavioral, and physiological monitoring were carried out using PhenoMaster at 28?weeks. Interscapular brown fat (BAT), inguinal white fat tissue (WAT), and quadriceps muscle were analyzed and compared to assess the change of gene expression related to adipogenesis. Taurine supplementation showed the trend of anti-obesity effect in ICR mice fed an HFD for 28?weeks. HFD-fed mice did not show significant difference of oxygen consumption (VO 2 ), energy expenditure (EE), respiratory exchange rate (RER), and locomotive activity compared with those of normal chow diet fed mice. The expression of adipogenesis-related genes such as PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, and AP2 increased in BAT and WAT, but not in muscle tissue. Taurine supplementation showed the downregulation of these genes in WAT but not in BAT or muscle. Consistently, the expression of taurine transporter (TauT) and adipocyte-specific genes such as adiponectin, leptin, and IL-6 was regulated in a similar pattern by taurine supplementation. Long-term taurine supplementation causes weight loss, most likely by inhibiting adipogenesis in WAT. TauT expression may be involved in the expression of various genes regulated by taurine supplementation. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","adaptor protein; adiponectin; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; interleukin 6; leptin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; taurine; taurine transporter; antiobesity agent; carrier protein; membrane protein; taurine; taurine transporter; transcription factor; adipogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; body weight; body weight loss; brown adipose tissue; chow diet; controlled study; diet induced obesity; down regulation; drug mechanism; energy expenditure; gene expression; locomotion; lung gas exchange; male; metabolic inhibition; mouse; mouse model; muscle tissue; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; physiologic monitoring; priority journal; protein expression; quadriceps femoris muscle; supplementation; white adipose tissue; adipogenesis; animal; brown adipose tissue; diet therapy; dietary supplement; drug effect; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetics; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; lipid diet; metabolism; mouse mutant; obesity; white adipose tissue; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Supplements; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mice, Obese; Obesity; Taurine; Transcription Factors; Weight Loss"
"Nonsurgical integrative Korean Medicine treatment of discal cyst: A case report and a retrospective chart review analysis",2019,"RATIONALE: Discal cysts are rare lesions characterized by pain caused by neurogenic compression with similar symptoms as those of disc herniation. This study aims to report the spontaneous regression of discal cyst achieved through nonsurgical integrative Korean Medicine treatment and the clinical epidemiological features of discal cyst cases collected from 4 institutions. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old woman had low back pain and radiating pain equivalent to a numeral rating scale (NRS) of 8 and had limitations in daily work and activities. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed as having discal cysts that compressed the left S1 based on findings of L-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at our hospital. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received nonsurgical Korean Medicine treatment and after 24 days of treatment in the hospital, she underwent 16 additional treatments as an outpatient. OUTCOMES: Spontaneous regression was confirmed in the L-spine MRI follow-up at 36 days and 99 days after the initial test, and the patient underwent once-a-week follow up to examine NRS, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) after 4 weeks, and 2, 3, and 6-month follow-ups after that. The patient was discharged in a painless condition, and she was able to carry on for 5 months without increased pain. LESSONS: Discal cysts are more rapid progress than disc herniation, it seems valid to attempt nonsurgical treatment. Epidemiologically, this is the first study to present the clinical epidemiological characteristics of discal cysts, it would provide valuable information to clinicians who treat and study discal cysts.","acupuncture; adult; case report; cyst; diagnostic imaging; female; human; integrative medicine; lumbar vertebra; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oriental medicine; pain measurement; physiotherapy; procedures; retrospective study; South Korea; treatment outcome; Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Cysts; Female; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Medicine, East Asian Traditional; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Physical Therapy Modalities; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"
"Shear wave elastography for the diagnosis of small (?2 cm) breast lesions: Added value and factors associated with false results",2019,"Objective: We compared the diagnostic performance of B-mode ultrasound, shear wave elastography (SWE), and combined B-mode ultrasound and SWE in small breast lesions (? 2 cm), and evaluated the factors associated with false SWE results. Methods: A total of 428 small breast lesions (? 2 cm) of 415 consecutive patients between August 2013 and February 2017 were included. The diagnostic performance of each set was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Histologic diagnosis was used as reference standard. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified the factors associated with false SWE results. Results: Of 428 lesions, 142 (33.2%) were malignant and 286 (66.8%) were benign. The AUC of the combined modality was higher than that of B-mode ultrasound (0.792 vs 0.572, p < 0.001) and that of SWE was higher than that of B-mode ultrasound (0.718 vs 0.572, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the smaller lesion size and in situ cancer were associated with false negative, and patient's age, high-risk lesion, shorter distance from the skin or chest wall, and deeper breast thickness were associated with false positive (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The addition of SWE to B-mode ultrasound could improve the diagnostic performance in ? 2 cm lesions. However, ultrasound lesion size, pathology, and lesion location are likely to affect the SWE value and result in false results. ? 2019 The Authors.","adult; area under the curve; Article; B scan; breast cancer; breast carcinoma in situ; breast density; breast lesion; breast tumor; cancer diagnosis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; false negative result; false positive result; female; human; human tissue; image analysis; major clinical study; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; shear wave elastography; thickness; breast tumor; cancer staging; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; echography; elastography; false negative result; false positive result; middle aged; pathology; tumor volume; Adult; Area Under Curve; Breast Neoplasms; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; False Negative Reactions; False Positive Reactions; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Tumor Burden; Ultrasonography"
"Submandibular gland is a suitable site for alpha synuclein pathology in Parkinson disease",2019,"Objective: To validate the role of α-synuclein (AS) pathology in submandibular gland (SMG) as a biomarker for Parkinson disease (PD). Methods: We performed ultrasonography (USG) guided core needle biopsy of SMG in PD patients and procured SMG biopsy tissues or surgical excision specimens from non-PD patients as controls. Then, we compared AS deposition in the SMG tissues between the PD patients and the controls. We recruited 16 PD patients in this study. In each individual, two core needle biopsy tissues were obtained from the left submandibular gland under USG guidance. Fourteen sex and age-matched controls who did not have PD and dementia but received a core needle biopsy or surgical resection of the SMG due to SMG diseases were procured from the pathology archive. Biopsy tissues and surgical specimens were immuno-stained with serine 129 phosphorylated AS (pAS) antibody for microscopic examination. pAS deposition in neural structures such as ganglion cells and neurites was considered as positive. Results: No serious complication occurred during and after the SMG biopsy. We found glandular parenchyma and neural structures in all biopsied SMG tissues from the patients and the controls. Nine out of 16 PD patients (56.2%) were positive for pAS staining, while none of the controls were positive (0%). Conclusions: SMG core needle biopsy can reliably and safely obtain sufficient glandular parenchyma and neural structures to evaluate the α-synuclein pathology. AS pathology in SMG has high specificity and good sensitivity as a biomarker for PD. ? 2018","alpha synuclein; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; male; middle aged; needle biopsy; nerve cell; neurite; Parkinson disease; priority journal; salivary gland biopsy; submandibular gland"
"Diagnostic outcome of image-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy of sclerotic bone lesions: A meta-analysis",2019,"OBJECTIVE. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic outcome (diagnostic yield and accuracy) of image-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy (CNB) of sclerotic bone lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A computerized search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed to identify relevant original articles on the use of image-guided percutaneous CNB of sclerotic bone lesions. The pooled proportions of the diagnostic yield and pooled accuracy estimates were assessed using random-effects modeling. We also performed subgroup analyses of the diagnostic yield according to the drill systems (battery-powered vs manual). Heterogeneity among studies was determined using the inconsistency index (I 2 ). Meta-regression analyses were performed to evaluate the potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS. Fifteen eligible studies, involving 969 sclerotic bone lesions for diagnostic yield, and 242 sclerotic bone lesions for diagnostic accuracy, were included. The pooled proportion of the diagnostic yield of image-guided percutaneous CNB of sclerotic bone lesions was 74% (95% CI, 62–84%), and the pooled accuracy estimate for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions was 87% (95% CI, 77–93%). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled proportion of the diagnostic yield of the battery-powered drill system (76.7% [95% CI, 64.0–85.8%]) was higher than that of the manual drill system (65.2% [95% CI, 58.0–71.8%]). In the meta-regression analyses, no variables were significantly different (p = 0.13–0.93). CONCLUSION. In conclusion, we determined that image-guided percutaneous CNB of sclerotic bone lesions is an accurate diagnostic technique with good diagnostic yield, particularly when the battery-powered bone biopsy system is used. ?

Method: Of 5376 patients with RA enrolled in the Korean observational study network for arthritis (KORONA) registry, 400 patients with disease duration of <2?years who had Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of >2.8 at baseline, biologic-na?ve, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) drawn at both baseline and 2-year follow-up visits were identified. Patients were grouped according to baseline APR levels: normal APRs, one APR elevated, and both APRs elevated. Results: Baseline tender and swollen joint counts, mean CDAI and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores were significantly lower in the normal APRs group compared with APR-elevated groups (P?<?0.0001). At 2-year follow-up, mean CDAI scores, HAQ-DI, and percentage of the patient achieving remission were not significantly different between the normal APRs group compared with the APR-elevated groups regardless of the baseline disease activity. However, in patients with baseline CDAI moderate to high disease activity, the normal APRs group less frequently required initiation of the biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs compared with the APR-elevated groups (P?=?0.044). Conclusion: Active RA patients with normal APR values have milder disease presentation, but similar clinical outcomes to those with elevated APRs. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","acute phase protein; C reactive protein; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; acute phase protein; antirheumatic agent; biological marker; biological product; adult; Article; Clinical Disease Activity Index; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease activity; disease duration; disease registry; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; follow up; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score; human; joint swelling; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; priority journal; remission; rheumatoid arthritis; scoring system; blood; comparative study; disability; register; rheumatoid arthritis; severity of illness index; South Korea; time factor; treatment outcome; Acute-Phase Proteins; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biological Products; Biomarkers; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Republic of Korea; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Diagnostic performance of optic nerve sheath diameter for predicting neurologic outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Aims: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) for prediction of neurologic outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients and relative prediction performance according to ONSD measurement modality. Data sources: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for diagnostic accuracy studies that used ocular ultrasound or brain computed tomography (CT) for prediction of neurologic outcome. Bivariate modelling and hierarchical-summary and receiver-operating-characteristic modelling were performed to evaluate diagnostic performance. A pooled diagnostic odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval not including 1 was considered informative. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the modality (ocular US vs. brain CT). Methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies?2 tool. We performed meta-regression analyses for heterogeneity exploration. Results: Eight studies including 766 patients were included. For prediction of poor neurologic outcome, ONSD showed pooled sensitivity 0.41, pooled specificity 0.99, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve 0.86. According to the pooled diagnostic odds ratios, ONSD was informative for prediction of neurologic outcome. In subgroup analysis, ONSD on ocular ultrasound showed significantly higher sensitivity and similar specificity than that on brain CT. On meta-regression analysis, locale, time to examination after return of spontaneous circulation, cause of cardiac arrest, and reference standard were sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion: ONSD may be useful for predicting neurologic outcomes in post-cardiac arrest patients. Measuring the ONSD specifically using ocular ultrasound, application in patients with cardiac-origin cardiac arrest, and using the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories for neurologic outcome evaluation are recommended for more accurately predicting neurologic outcomes. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; Glasgow outcome scale; heart arrest; human; meta analysis; nerve sheath; neuroimaging; neurologic disease; optic nerve; outcome assessment; postoperative complication; priority journal; prognosis; Rankin scale; Review; sensitivity and specificity; South Korean; systematic review"
"Efficacy and Tolerability of Telmisartan/Amlodipine and Rosuvastatin Coadministration in Hypertensive Patients with Hyperlipidemia: A Phase III, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind Study",2019,"Purpose: Dyslipidemia and hypertension increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. Combination therapy improves patient compliance. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the combination therapies telmisartan/amlodipine + rosuvastatin, telmisartan/amlodipine, and telmisartan + rosuvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Methods: In this Phase III, multicenter, 8-week randomized, double-blind study, participants with hypertension and dyslipidemia (defined as a sitting systolic blood pressure [sitSBP] of ?140 mm Hg, a low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C] level of ?250 mg/dL, and a triglyceride level of ?400 mg/dL) were screened. After a 4-week washout/run-in period involving therapeutic lifestyle changes and telmisartan 80 mg once a day, eligible patients had a sitSBP of ?140 mm Hg and met the LDL-C level criteria according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III cardiovascular disease risk category. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) telmisartan/amlodipine 80/10 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg (TAR group); (2) telmisartan/amlodipine 80/10 mg (TA group); or (3) telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg (TR group). The primary efficacy end points were the percentage changes from baseline in LDL-C in the TAR and TA groups and the mean changes in sitSBP in the TAR and TR groups at week 8 compared to baseline. Continuous variables were compared using the unpaired t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum model, and categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 or Fisher exact test. Tolerability was assessed based on adverse events found on physical examination including vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead ECG. Findings: A total of 134 patients were enrolled. The least squares mean percentage changes in LDL-C at 8 weeks after administration of the drug compared to baseline were ?51.9% (3.0%) in the TAR group and ?3.2% (2.9%) in the TA group (P &lt; 0.001). At 8 weeks after baseline, the least squares mean (SE) changes sitSBP were ?28.3 (2.4) mm Hg in the TAR group and ?10.7 (2.1) mm Hg in the TR group (P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 15.0%, 25.0%, and 12.2% in the TAR, TA, and TR groups, respectively; those of adverse drug reactions were 15.0%, 22.7%, and 10.2%. None of the differences in rates were significant among 3 groups. Implications: Triple therapy with TAR can be an effective treatment in patients with dyslipidemia and hypertension. The TAR combination has value for hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia in terms of convenience, tolerability, and efficacy.

"Lower sympathetic nervous system density and β-adrenoreceptor expression are involved in gastric cancer progression",2019,"Background/Aim: Identifying the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in tumor progression is among the most important challenges in cancer research. This study aimed to investigate the role of the SNS and β-adrenoreceptor in gastric cancer progression. Materials and Methods: The density of SNS was quantified by immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase in 115 surgically-resected gastric cancer specimens. Immunostaining for β1- and β2-adrenoreceptor was also performed to examine the β-adrenoreceptor expression status in gastric cancer. Then the association of protein expression status with histological grade, pathological tumor stage (pT), and pathological node stage of gastric cancer was investigated. Results: The SNS density of pT4 tumors was significantly lower than that of pT1-3 tumors. The SNS density was positively correlated with β1-adrenoreceptor expression status. In addition, lower β1-adrenoreceptor expression was significantly associated with increased lymph node metastasis. Reduced β2-adrenoreceptor staining proportion was significantly associated with worse histological grade. Furthermore, the proportion of β2- adrenoreceptor staining was significantly lower in tumors with diffuse-type histology, than those with intestinal-type histology. Conclusion: A lower SNS density and β- adrenoreceptor expression was associated with an aggressive oncogenic behavior including worse histological grade, advanced pT, and increased lymph node metastasis. SNS and β-adrenergic pathway are involved in the negative regulation of gastric cancer progression. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Tumor Homing Reactive Oxygen Species Nanoparticle for Enhanced Cancer Therapy",2019,"Multifunctional nanoparticles that carry chemotherapeutic agents can be innovative anticancer therapeutic options owing to their tumor-targeting ability and high drug-loading capacity. However, the nonspecific release of toxic DNA-intercalating anticancer drugs from the nanoparticles has significant side effects on healthy cells surrounding the tumors. Herein, we report a tumor homing reactive oxygen species nanoparticle (THoR-NP) platform that is highly effective and selective for ablating malignant tumors. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) were selected as an exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator and a superoxide dismutase 1 inhibitor, respectively. DDC-loaded THoR-NP, in combination with SNP treatment, eliminated multiple cancer cell lines effectively by the generation of peroxynitrite in the cells (&gt;95% cell death), as compared to control drug treatments of the same concentration of DDC or SNP alone (0% cell death). Moreover, the magnetic core (ZnFe2O4) of the THoR-NP can specifically ablate tumor cells (breast cancer cells) via magnetic hyperthermia, in conjunction with DDC, even in the absence of any exogenous RS supplements. Finally, by incorporating iRGD peptide moieties in the THoR-NP, integrin-enriched cancer cells (malignant tumors, MDA-MB-231) were effectively and selectively killed, as opposed to nonmetastatic tumors (MCF-7), as confirmed in a mouse xenograft model. Hence, our strategy of using nanoparticles embedded with ROS-scavenger-inhibitor with an exogenous ROS supplement is highly selective and effective cancer therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell culture; Cell death; Controlled drug delivery; Core shell nanoparticles; Diseases; Drug interactions; Enzymes; Holmium compounds; Iron compounds; Magnetic cores; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Oncology; Oxygen; Tumors; Zinc compounds; Cancer therapy; Chemotherapeutic agents; Diethyldithiocarbamate; Multi-functional nanoparticles; Reactive oxygen species; Reactive species; Super oxide dismutase; Tumor targeting; Targeted drug delivery; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; diethyldithiocarbamic acid; nanoparticle; nitroprusside sodium; reactive oxygen metabolite; SOD1 protein, human; animal; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; drug screening; economics; experimental neoplasm; female; human; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; Animals; Ditiocarb; Female; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms, Experimental; Nitroprusside; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase-1; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"

"T98G Cell Death Induced by Photothermal Treatment with Hollow Gold Nanoshell-Coupled Silica Microrods Prepared from Escherichia Coli",2019,"As an alternative to traditional cancer treatment, photothermal therapy is a promising method with advantages such as noninvasiveness and high efficiency. Herein, we synthesized armored golden Escherichia coli (AGE) microrods as photothermal agents to evaluate the viability of cancer cell. The hollow gold nanoshell (HAuNS) was synthesized for photothermal effects under the near-infrared (NIR) region using unicellular E. coli as a framework. Coupling HAuNS onto the surface of E. coli@SiO2 enhanced temperature elevation and resulted in high conversion efficiency. The synthesized AGE microrods had excellent photothermal stability under NIR laser irradiation in the five-times recycling experiment. The temperature elevation of AGE microrod solution reached 43.7 °C, which induced hyperthermia-mediated killing of tumor cells. The results of the cytotoxicity test revealed the AGE microrod-induced T98G cell death mediated via apoptosis. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell death; Diseases; Efficiency; Escherichia coli; Gold; Infrared devices; Irradiation; Nanostructured materials; Silica; Tumors; Gold nanoshells; High conversion efficiency; Near Infrared; NIR laser irradiation; Photo-thermal; Photothermal stability; Recycling experiments; Tumor cells; Nanoshells; gold; nanoshell; silicon dioxide; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; Escherichia coli; human; infrared radiation; metabolism; phototherapy; radiation response; temperature; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Escherichia coli; Gold; Humans; Infrared Rays; Nanoshells; Phototherapy; Silicon Dioxide; Temperature"
"Association of potent P2Y12 blockers with ischemic and bleeding outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction",2019,"Background: Potent P2Y12 blockers are preferred in patients with acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the risk of bleeding remains a major concern. We assessed the association of potent P2Y12 blockers with ischemic and bleeding outcomes in patients with NSTEMI. Methods: From the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institute of Health database, 4927 patients with NSTEMI receiving drug-eluting stents (DES) were divided into potent P2Y12 blocker (ticagrelor or prasugrel, n = 901) and clopidogrel (n = 3180) groups. Propensity-matched 12-month ischemic and bleeding events were compared. Patients who received anticoagulants or who discontinued P2Y12 blockers or switched between potent P2Y12 blockers and clopidogrel were excluded. Results: In the overall population, patients at higher ischemic and bleeding risks more often received clopidogrel. After propensity matching (n = 901 in each group), 12-month rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events were lower (7.3% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.038), but Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor bleeding rates were higher (5.9% vs. 2.2%, p < 0.001) with potent P2Y12 blockers. Twelve-month rates of death from any cause, MI, stroke, or TIMI major bleeding were not different. On multivariate analysis, 12-month risk of TIMI major or minor bleeding was higher with B2 or C lesion, potent P2Y12 blocker use, body weight <60 kg, and lower with time to PCI <12 h and radial artery access. Conclusions: In patients with NSTEMI receiving DES, potent P2Y12 blockers were associated with reduced ischemic but increased bleeding risk with similar net clinical benefits. ? 2018","clopidogrel; fibrinogen receptor; hemoglobin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; prasugrel; ticagrelor; adult; age; angina pectoris; anticoagulant therapy; Article; bleeding; blood clot lysis; body weight; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; clinical outcome; diabetes mellitus; female; heart infarction; heart rate; hospitalization; human; hypertension; ischemia; leukocyte count; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; radial artery; risk assessment; sex difference; smoking; thorax pain; treatment outcome"
"Substance P accelerates wound repair by promoting neovascularization and preventing inflammation in an ischemia mouse model",2019,"Aims: Arterial insufficiency ulcers are frequent complications of peripheral artery disease and infection or long-term neglect of the ulcer can eventually lead to amputation of the affected body part. An ischemic environment, caused by interrupted blood flow, affects the supply of nutrients and elongates the inflammation period, inducing tissue degeneration. Thus, the modulation of neovascularization and inflammation could be an ideal therapeutic strategy for ischemic wound healing. This study aimed to elucidate whether systemically administered substance P (SP) could promote ischemic wound repair in mice by restoring blood perfusion and suppressing inflammation. Main methods: The effects of SP were assessed by analyzing wound size, blood flow, epidermal and dermal layer regeneration, vessel formation, and the inflammatory cytokine profiles in a hind-limb ischemia non-clinical mouse model. Key findings: SP-treated mice exhibited dramatically rapid wound healing and restoration of blood flow within the ischemic zone, compared with saline-treated mice. Notably, SP-treated mice showed enhanced pericyte-covered vasculature compared to saline-treated mice. Moreover, anti-inflammatory effects were detected in mice in the SP-treated group, including suppression of inflammation-mediated spleen enlargement, reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and promotion of circulatory interleukin-10 levels. Significance: These results suggest that SP could be a possible therapeutic candidate for patients with peripheral artery disease, including those with ischemic ulcers. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","interleukin 10; substance P; tumor necrosis factor; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; autacoid; substance P; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; blood flow; cell growth; clinical assessment; controlled study; drug effect; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence activated cell sorting; human; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; limb ischemia; male; mouse; neovascularization (pathology); nonhuman; pericyte; splenomegaly; wound healing; angiogenesis; animal; Bagg albino mouse; complication; disease model; drug effect; inflammation; ischemia; metabolism; pathology; skin; wound healing; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Ischemia; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Neurotransmitter Agents; Skin; Substance P; Wound Healing"
"Patient-centeredness during in-depth consultation in the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Korea: Paradigm shift from disease to patient",2019,"Background: Patient-centered care (PCC) and integrative care approach are widely advocated. However, their implementation usually requires an extended consultation time. Despite significant advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness in Korea. Methods: We conducted a ""15-Minute Consultation"" for first-time patients in outpatient clinics of 13 departments. A control group was selected from the same physicians' first-time patients, adjusting for age and gender. A total of 275 patients were selected for receiving in-depth consultation and 141 control patients were selected for regular consultation. Data were collected from patients using a questionnaire comprising a patient-centeredness scale and items on potential predictors such as socio-demographic and clinical factors. We also investigated the participating physician's professionalism. Results: As compared to the control group, the in-depth consultation group scored higher on 5 variables associated with PCC, including (patients' perception of) medical professionals, wait and consultation times, treatment, patient advocacy, and patient satisfaction. While 92.4% of patients in the in-depth consultation group reported that the consultation time was sufficient, only 69.0% of those in the control group reported the same (P < 0.01). In the in-depth consultation group, scores on satisfaction level were the highest for the department of internal medicine, followed by departments of surgery and pediatrics. Participating physicians' improved satisfaction following the intervention proved that in-depth consultation facilitated building a rapport with patients. Conclusion: This study illustrated that the provision of sufficiently long consultation for serious and rare diseases could improve PCC and physicians' professionalism. Health authorities should reshuffle the healthcare delivery system and provide sufficient consultation time to ensure PCC and medical professionalism. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","adolescent; adult; case control study; female; human; male; middle aged; outpatient department; patient advocacy; patient care; patient referral; patient satisfaction; professionalism; questionnaire; South Korea; tertiary care center; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Advocacy; Patient Satisfaction; Patient-Centered Care; Professionalism; Referral and Consultation; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult"

"Anticancer activity and underlying mechanism of phytochemicals against multiple myeloma",2019,"Multiple myeloma (MM)—a common hematologic malignancy of plasma cells—accounts for substantial mortality and morbidity rates. Due to the advent of novel therapies such as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), response rates were increased and free survival and overall survival have been elevated. However, adverse events including toxicity, neuropathy or continuous relapse are still problems. Thus, development of novel drugs which have less side effects and more effective is needed. This review aims to recapitulate the pharmacologic anti-MM mechanisms of various phytochemicals, elucidating their molecular targets. Keywords related to MM and natural products were searched in PUBMED/MEDLINE. Phytochemicals have been reported to display a variety of anti-MM activities, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, antiangiogenesis, and miRNA modulation. Some phytochemicals sensitize the conventional therapies such as dexamethasone. Also, there are clinical trials with phytochemicals such as agaricus, curcumin, and Neovastat regarding MM treatment. Taken together, this review elucidated and categorized the evidences that natural products and their bioactive compounds could be potent drugs in treating MM. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Virus-like particles containing multiple antigenic proteins of Toxoplasma gondii induce memory T cell and B cell responses",2019,"Although the efforts to develop vaccine against Toxoplasma gondii infection were made for decades, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for humans. Upon discovering a number of T or B cell epitope regions from T. gondii IMC, ROP18 and MIC8, multi-antigen VLPs or combination VLPs were generated. Mice immunized with multi-antigen VLPs or combination VLPs were challenge infected with T. gondii (ME49). T. gondii-specific IgG, IgG isotypes and IgA antibody responses, memory T and B cell responses and protection were evaluated. All the mice survived upon T. gondii challenge infection by multi-antigen VLPs vaccination. Vaccinated mice elicited higher levels of parasite-specific IgG and IgG2a antibody responses in sera, IgA antibody responses in feces, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-10) responses compared to combination VLPs. In particular, the multi-antigen VLPs vaccination showed significantly higher levels of antibody secreting cell (ASC) responses, CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells, and memory B cells than combination VLPs. Multi-antigen VLPs vaccination showed significant reduction of brain cyst counts and size, and all mice survived. Prediction and analysis of epitopes have indicated that IMC, ROP18 and MIC8 showed partially overlapping epitopes for T and B cells. Our results indicated that antibody responses, memory T and B cells induced by multi-antigen VLPs vaccination might contribute to the complete protection upon T. gondii (ME49) challenge infection. ? 2019 Lee et al.

"Toward long-term implantable glucose biosensors for clinical use",2019,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors have led a paradigm shift to painless, continuous, zero-finger pricking measurement in blood glucose monitoring. Recent electrochemical CGM sensors have reached two-week lifespans and no calibration with clinically acceptable accuracy. The system with the recent CGM sensors is identified as an ""integrated glucose monitoring system,"" which can replace finger-pricking glucose-testing for diabetes treatment decisions. Although such innovation has brought CGM technology closer to realizing the artificial pancreas, discomfort and infection problems have arisen from short lifespans and open wounds. A fully implantable sensor with a longer-term lifespan (90 days) is considered as an alternative CGM sensor with high comfort and low running cost. However, it still has barriers, including surgery for applying and replacing and frequent calibration. If technical refinement is conducted (e.g., stability and reproducibility of sensor fabrication), fully implantable, long-term CGM sensors can open the new era of continuous glucose monitoring. ? 2019 by the authors.",""
"The Korean national burden of disease study: From evidence to policy",2019,"Following the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have been widely used as a summary measure of population health.

"Soy isoflavones reduce asthma exacerbation in asthmatic patients with high PAI-1–producing genotypes",2019,"Background: The 4G4G genotype of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is associated with increased plasma PAI-1 levels and poor asthma control. Previous studies suggest that soy isoflavones can reduce PAI-1 levels. Objective: We sought to investigate PAI-1 genotype-specific differences of the soy isoflavone response in asthma outcomes. Methods: A PAI-1 functional polymorphism (rs1799768, 4G5G) was characterized in subjects with poorly controlled asthma enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of soy isoflavones (n = 265). Genotype-specific treatment responses on asthma outcomes were compared between soy isoflavones and placebo. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured with or without TGF-β1, genistein, or both, and PAI-1 levels were measured. Results: The 4G4G/4G5G genotype was associated with a greater risk for allergy-related worsened asthma symptoms and eczema at baseline compared with the 5G5G genotype. There was a significant interaction between the genotype and soy isoflavone intervention on oral corticosteroid use for asthma exacerbation (P = .005). In a subgroup analysis soy isoflavones significantly reduced the use of oral corticosteroids (number of events/person-year) by 4-fold compared with placebo in the 4G4G/4G5G genotype (0.2 vs 0.8; relative risk, 0.28; P < .001) but not in the 5G5G genotype. Soy isoflavones reduced plasma PAI-1 levels compared with placebo. Genistein treatment reduced TGF-β1–induced PAI-1 production in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that soy isoflavone treatment provides a significant benefit in reducing the number of severe asthma exacerbations in asthmatic patients with the high PAI-1–producing genotype. PAI-1 polymorphisms can be used as a genetic biomarker for soy isoflavone–responsive patients with asthma. ? 2019","antiasthmatic agent; corticosteroid; genistein; isoflavone derivative; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; transforming growth factor beta1; adolescent; airway epithelium cell; Article; Asian; asthma; Asthma Control Test; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease exacerbation; DNA polymorphism; drug mechanism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epithelium cell; female; forced expiratory volume; genotype; human; human cell; infant; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; real time polymerase chain reaction; soybean; United States"

Methods: Patients from India and East Asia (Korea and Taiwan) with T2DM who were insulin na?ve (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ? 7.0% and ? 11.0%) or on basal insulin (HbA1c ? 11.0%) were randomized to receive LY IGlar or IGlar along with oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs) for 24?weeks. Patients were instructed to self-titrate from the starting dose by 1?unit/day until fasting blood glucose (FBG) ? 5.6?mmol/L (100?mg/dL) was achieved. The key outcome was HbA1c change from baseline to Week 24. Results: Within-group least-squares mean (LSM) decrease (baseline to Week 24) in HbA1c was similar between treatments. The upper limit of confidence interval (CI) for treatment difference was below the defined 0.4% noninferiority margin in India (LY IGlar: ? 0.83%; IGlar: ? 0.62%; difference [95% CI] ? 0.21 [? 0.70, 0.28]) and East Asia (LY IGlar: ? 1.28%; IGlar: ? 1.26%; difference [95% CI] ? 0.02 [? 0.34, 0.30]) subpopulations. Results of other efficacy and safety endpoints at Week 24 were similar between treatments in both subpopulations. LSM self-monitored FBG levels were similar between treatments at all visits in both subpopulations except at Week 24 in the India subpopulation (LY IGlar: 5.65 [0.10] mmol/L or 101.8?[1.86] mg/dL; IGlar: 5.18 [0.10] mmol/L or 93.3 [1.75] mg/dL; p = 0.002). Conclusion: Efficacy and safety profiles of LY IGlar and IGlar, in combination with OAMs, were similar in India and East Asia subpopulations. This was consistent with the ELEMENT 5 total population.

"Cross-sectional study of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with atopic dermatitis and nonatopic eczema, urticaria, and psoriasis",2019,"Background: Recent data suggest depression has been linked to chronic skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), urticaria, and psoriasis. This study compared mental illnesses in patients with AD with those of patients with nonatopic eczema, urticaria, and psoriasis in Korea. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used, analyzing data from the 2015 Korean National Health Insurance Research Database, a survey of 42,641 AD and 139,486 non-AD (nonatopic eczema, urticaria, and psoriasis) patients (103,938 males, 78,189 females) classified by age: infant, aged 0–3 years; early childhood, aged 4–8 years; late childhood, aged 9–12 years; adolescent, aged 13–18 years; adult, aged 19–64 years; elderly, aged above 65 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed, and the odds ratio (OR) of various mental illnesses – attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, schizophrenia, and sleep disorder – were calculated for patients with and without AD. Results: The incidence of depression was not significantly different between AD and non-AD patients. Severe AD showed a high OR of depression (moderate AD OR=1.75; severe AD OR=3.15, P<0.0001). Patients with AD had significantly higher incidence of ADHD (OR=1.48; 95% CI=1.27–1.72), ASD (OR=1.54; 95% CI=1.19–1.99), and conduct disorder (OR=2.88; 95% CI=1.52–5.45). Conclusion: Patients with AD were not found to have higher incidence of depression than non-AD patients. However, severe AD patients were determined to have a significantly higher incidence of depression. Therefore, the severity of dermatitis is thought to contribute to depression. Mental illnesses found to be significantly higher in AD patients were ADHD, ASD, and conduct disorder. ? 2019 Ahn et al.","adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; anxiety; Article; atopic dermatitis; attention deficit disorder; autism; child; comorbidity; conduct disorder; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; disease severity; eczema; female; human; incidence; infant; Korea; major clinical study; male; mental disease; prevalence; psoriasis; schizophrenia; sleep disorder; suicidal ideation; urticaria"
"Comprehensive proteome and phosphoproteome profiling shows negligible influence of RNAlater on protein abundance and phosphorylation",2019,"Certain tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are known to contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes including RNases and proteases that may lead to degradation of RNA and proteins during sample processing. For such tumor tissues with RNA instability, RNAlater containing a high concentration of quaternary ammonium sulfates that denature RNA-hydrolyzing enzymes is often used to protect RNAs from hydrolysis. Although a few studies have been carried out to determine the effect of RNAlater on DNA and RNA, whether RNAlater influences the proteome and phosphoproteome is largely unknown. In this study we carried out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the effect of RNAlater on the proteome and phosphoproteome using high-resolution mass spectrometry. PDAC tissues from three patients were individually pulverized and the tissue powders of each patient were divided into two portions, one of which was incubated in RNAlater at 4 °C for 24 h (RNAlater tissue) while the other was kept at - 80 °C (frozen tissue). Comprehensive quantitative profiling experiments on the RNAlater tissues and the frozen tissues resulted in the identification of 99,136 distinct peptides of 8803 protein groups and 17,345 phosphopeptides of 16,436 phosphosites. The data exhibited no significant quantitative changes in both proteins and phosphorylation between the RNAlater tissues and the frozen tissue. In addition, the phosphoproteome data showed heterogeneously activated pathways among the three patients that were not altered by RNAlater. These results indicate that the tissue preservation method using RNAlater can be effectively used on PDAC tissues for proteogenomic studies where preservation of intact DNA, RNA and proteins is prerequisite. Data from this study are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD010710. ? 2019 The Author(s).","epidermal growth factor receptor; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphopeptide; proteome; ribonuclease; Article; carcinogenesis; endocytosis; focal adhesion; gene expression; human; human tissue; mass spectrometry; pancreas cancer; priority journal; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; proteomics; retrospective study; RNA sequence; RNA transport; spliceosome; tandem mass spectrometry; tight junction"
"Antitumor effect of pyrogallol via miR-134 mediated s phase arrest and inhibition of PI3K/AKT/Skp2/cMYC signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Though Pyrogallol, one of the natural polyphenols, was known to have anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects in breast and colon cancers, the underlying antitumor mechanisms of Pyrogallol, still remain unclear so far. Here, the antitumor mechanisms of Pyrogallol were elucidated in Hep3B and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Pyrogallol showed significant cytotoxicity and reduced the number of colonies in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Interestingly, Pyrogallol induced S-phase arrest and attenuated the protein expression of CyclinD1, Cyclin E, Cyclin A, c-Myc, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), p-AKT, PI3K, increased the protein expression of p27, and also reduced the fluorescent expression of Cyclin E in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Furthermore, Pyrogallol disturbed the interaction between Skp2, p27, and c-Myc in Huh7 cells. Notably, Pyrogallol upregulated miRNA levels of miR-134, and conversely, miR-134 inhibition rescued the decreased expression levels of c-Myc, Cyclin E, and Cyclin D1 and increased the expression of p27 by Pyrogallol in Huh7 cells. Taken together, our findings provide insight that Pyrogallol exerts antitumor effects in HCCs via miR-134 activation-mediated S-phase arrest and inhibition of PI3K/AKT/Skp2/cMyc signaling as a potent anticancer candidate. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Upregulation of SLC2A3 gene and prognosis in colorectal carcinoma: Analysis of TCGA data",2019,"Background: Upregulation of SLC2A genes that encode glucose transporter (GLUT) protein is associated with poor prognosis in many cancers. In colorectal cancer, studies reporting the association between overexpression of GLUT and poor clinical outcomes were flawed by small sample sizes or subjective interpretation of immunohistochemical staining. Here, we analyzed mRNA expressions in all 14 SLC2A genes and evaluated the association with prognosis in colorectal cancer using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Methods: In the present study, we analyzed the expression of SLC2A genes in colorectal cancer and their association with prognosis using data obtained from the TCGA for the discovery sample, and a dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus for the validation sample. Results: SLC2A3 was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in both the discovery sample (345 patients) and validation sample (501 patients). High SLC2A3 expression resulted in shorter OS and DFS. In multivariate analyses, high SLC2A3 levels predicted unfavorable OS (adjusted HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.22-3.11; P = 0.005) and were associated with poor DFS (adjusted HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.10-3.12; P = 0.02). Similar results were found in the discovery set. Conclusion: Upregulation of the SLC2A3 genes is associated with decreased OS and DFS in colorectal cancer patients. Therefore, assessment of SLC2A3 gene expression may useful for predicting prognosis in these patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).","glucose transporter 3; glucose transporter 3; SLC2A3 protein, human; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease free survival; female; gene control; gene expression; genetic association; genetic database; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; overall survival; prediction; predictive value; reference value; SLC2A3 gene; survival time; upregulation; validation study; cancer staging; colorectal tumor; gene expression regulation; genetics; middle aged; pathology; prognosis; survival analysis; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Databases, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glucose Transporter Type 3; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Survival Analysis; Up-Regulation"
"Mass spectrometry-based proteome profiling of extracellular vesicles and their roles in cancer biology",2019,"Over the past three decades, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have arisen as important mediators of intercellular communication that are involved in the transmission of biological signals between cells to regulate various biological processes. EVs are largely responsible for intercellular communication through the delivery of bioactive molecules, such as proteins, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), DNAs, lipids, and metabolites. EVs released from cancer cells play a significant role in signal transduction between cancer cells and the surrounding cells, which contributes to the formation of tumors and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, EVs released from cancer cells migrate to blood vessels and flow into various biological fluids, including blood and urine. EVs and EV-loaded functional cargoes, including proteins and miRNAs, found in these biological fluids are important biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Therefore, EV proteomics greatly contributes to the understanding of carcinogenesis and tumor progression and is critical for the development of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cancer. To explore the potential use of EVs as a gateway to understanding cancer biology and to develop cancer biomarkers, we discuss the mass spectrometric identification and characterization of EV proteins from different cancers. Information provided in this review may help in understanding recent progress regarding EV biology and the potential roles of EVs as new noninvasive biomarkers and therapeutic targets. ? 2019, The Author(s).","proteome; tumor marker; cancer growth; cancer research; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; exosome; genomics; human; intracellular signaling; mass spectrometry; protein analysis; protein expression; proteomics; Review; signal transduction"
"Traditional oriental medicine for sensorineural hearing loss: Can ethnopharmacology contribute to potential drug discovery?",2019,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: In Traditional Oriental Medicine (TOM), the development of hearing pathologies is related to an inadequate nourishment of the ears by the kidney and other organs involved in regulation of bodily fluids and nutrients. Several herbal species have historically been prescribed for promoting the production of bodily fluids or as antiaging agents to treat deficiencies in hearing. Aim of review: The prevalence of hearing loss has been increasing in the last decade and is projected to grow considerably in the coming years. Recently, several herbal-derived products prescribed in TOM have demonstrated a therapeutic potential for acquired sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. Therefore, the aims of this review are to provide a comprehensive overview of the current known efficacy of the herbs used in TOM for preventing different forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, and associate the traditional principle with the demonstrated pharmacological mechanisms to establish a solid foundation for directing future research. Methods: The present review collected the literature related to herbs used in TOM or related compounds on hearing from Chinese, Korean, and Japanese herbal classics; library catalogs; and scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar; and Science Direct). Results: This review shows that approximately 25 herbal species and 40 active compounds prescribed in TOM for hearing loss and tinnitus have shown in vitro or in vivo beneficial effects for acquired sensorineural hearing loss produced by noise, aging, ototoxic drugs or diabetes. The inner ear is highly vulnerable to ischemia and oxidative damage, where several TOM agents have revealed a direct effect on the auditory system by normalizing the blood supply to the cochlea and increasing the antioxidant defense in sensory hair cells. These strategies have shown a positive impact on maintaining the inner ear potential, sustaining the production of endolymph, reducing the accumulation of toxic and inflammatory substances, preventing sensory cell death and preserving sensory transmission. There are still several herbal species with demonstrated therapeutic efficacy whose mechanisms have not been deeply studied and others that have been traditionally used in hearing loss but have not been tested experimentally. In clinical studies, Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, and Astragalus propinquus have demonstrated to improve hearing thresholds in patients with sensorineural hearing loss and alleviated the symptoms of tinnitus. However, some of these clinical studies have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of an adequate control group or contradictory results. Conclusions: Current therapeutic strategies have proven that the goal of the traditional oriental medicine principle of increasing bodily fluids is a relevant approach for reducing the development of hearing loss by improving microcirculation in the blood-labyrinth barrier and increasing cochlear blood flow. The potential benefits of TOM agents expand to a multi-target approach on different auditory structures of the inner ear related to increased cochlear blood flow, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities. However, more research is required, given the evidence is very limited in terms of the mechanism of action at the preclinical in vivo level and the scarce number of clinical studies published. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","herbaceous agent; Alpinia officinarum; Astragalus propinquus; auditory threshold; Camellia sinensis; cell death; cell survival; Chrysanthemum indicum; Chrysanthemum morifolium; cochlea blood flow; Cornus officinalis; Curculigo orchioides; Curcuma longa; Dioscorea japonica; Dioscorea nipponica; drug efficacy; Drynaria roosii; Ecklonia cava; ethnopharmacology; Fallopia multiflora; garlic; Ginkgo biloba; ginseng; herb; herbal medicine; homeostasis; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; incidence; inflammation; Lycium barbarum; mandarin; Medline; Morus alba; nonhuman; oriental medicine; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; perception deafness; Pradeep; Pueraria montana; Rehmannia glutinosa; Review; Salvia miltiorrhiza; Sanjappa; ScienceDirect; Scopus; Scutellaria baicalensis; sensory nerve cell; Silybum marianum; sour orange; soybean; tinnitus; Tripterygium wilfordii; vascularization; Zucc; animal; drug development; ethnopharmacology; metabolism; perception deafness; Animals; Drug Discovery; Ethnopharmacology; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Humans; Medicine, East Asian Traditional"
"Improved Stability of Polyglycerol Polyricinoleate-Substituted Nanostructured Lipid Carrier Cholecalciferol Emulsions with Different Carrier Oils",2019,"Abstract: Cholecalciferol, also known as vitamin D 3 , is a recognized therapeutic agent for treatment of bone diseases and cancer. However, instability and poor bioavailability have been major challenges for delivering Vitamin D 3 . The objective of this study was to formulate improved nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) vitamin D 3 emulsions. We tested the effect of different carrier oils and the use of a solid lipid nanoparticle emulsifier, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) on the stability of the vitamin D 3 emulsions. In contrast to the control that used glyceryl monostearate (GMS) the PGPR substitution resulted in relatively small particle sizes (0.30 to 0.43 μm), with high absolute value of zeta potentials (39.5 to 67.8 mV) and high encapsulation efficiency (85.2% to 90.4%). The stability of the NLC emulsions against environmental stresses was evaluated under varying conditions of ionic strength, pH, freeze–thaw cycles, and storage at different temperatures. Although NLC emulsions were stable at high ionic strengths, they were found to be unstable at low pH (&lt;3), which led to aggregation and coalescence of emulsion droplets. In case of freeze–thaw stress, although relatively stable compared to control NLC, the PGPR substituted groups exhibited a slight increase in particle size and a decrease in zeta potential when the cycle was repeated five times. Additionally, we found that PGPR-substituted emulsions showed higher liquid dispersion stability than controls at 25 and 65 °C. Thus, we have formulated a modified NLC vitamin D 3 emulsion that can be widely used in the food industry. Practical Application: Vitamin D 3 , an essential micronutrient, is often added as supplements in food products and beverages for added health benefits. However, the stability of vitamin D 3 emulsions that are used in the preparation of such products has been a major concern. We have developed a modified emulsion that has improved stability against environmental stresses. We believe, in future, this formulation can be efficiently used in the food industry. ? 2019 Institute of Food Technologists?","colecalciferol; emulsifying agent; glyceran polyricinoleic acid ester; glycerol; nanomaterial; ricinoleic acid; analogs and derivatives; chemistry; drug formulation; emulsion; osmolarity; particle size; Cholecalciferol; Drug Compounding; Emulsifying Agents; Emulsions; Glycerol; Nanostructures; Osmolar Concentration; Particle Size; Ricinoleic Acids"
"Social-ecological modelling of the spatial distribution of dengue fever and its temporal dynamics in Guayaquil, Ecuador for climate change adaption",2019,"Researchers have showed that climatic, population, economic, and social characteristics contribute to the proliferation of Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue fever (DF) in Ecuador. In this study, we identified the factors with the greatest influence on dengue virus spread using a spatio-temporal analysis. We applied the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to determine the spatial distribution of DF and identify areas with high probability of presence of A. aegypti by analyzing monthly climatic conditions, locations of reported dengue cases during 2012, and social factors in Guayaquil. Social variables showed greater influence on the presence and spread of disease during dengue outbreak season. The best model performance was obtained when the most important social variables were grouped based on components of the population's unsatisfied basic needs (UBN). Head of the household was a woman, the household was unoccupied, and UBN related to housing conditions at the household level were the most significant social risk factors. The final spatial distribution shows that the districts with the highest risks of infection are located mainly in the southern portion of the city, therefore these areas must take priority when integrated vector-control interventions and prevention protocols are carried out. ? 2018","adaptive management; climate change; dengue fever; disease spread; disease vector; maximum entropy analysis; model; modeling; mosquito; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; virus; Ecuador; Guayaquil; Guayas; Aedes aegypti; Dengue virus"
"NIR Biosensing of Neurotransmitters in Stem Cell-Derived Neural Interface Using Advanced Core–Shell Upconversion Nanoparticles",2019,"Nondestructive neurotransmitter detection and real-time monitoring of stem cell differentiation are both of great significance in the field of neurodegenerative disease and regenerative medicine. Although luminescent biosensing nanoprobes have been developed to address this need, they have intrinsic limitations such as autofluorescence, scattering, and phototoxicity. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have gained increasing attention for various biomedical applications due to their high photostability, low auto-fluorescent background, and deep tissue penetration; however, UCNPs also suffer from low emission intensities due to undesirable energy migration pathways. To address the aforementioned issue, a single-crystal core–shell–shell “sandwich” structured UCNP is developed that is designed to minimize deleterious energy back-transfer to yield bright visible emissions using low power density excitations. These UCNPs show a remarkable enhancement of luminescent output relative to conventional β-NaYF4:Yb,Er codoped UCNPs and β-NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4:Yb “active shell” alike. Moreover, this advanced core–shell–shell UCNP is subsequently used to develop a highly sensitive biosensor for the ultrasensitive detection of dopamine released from stem cell-derived dopaminergic-neurons. Given the challenges of in situ detection of neurotransmitters, the developed NIR-based biosensing of neurotransmitters in stem cell-derived neural interfaces present a unique tool for investigating single-cell mechanisms associated with dopamine, or other neurotransmitters, and their roles in neurological processes. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"15-Keto prostaglandin E2 suppresses STAT3 signaling and inhibits breast cancer cell growth and progression",2019,"Overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been linked to enhanced tumor cell proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis as well as resistance to apoptosis. 15-Keto prostaglandin E2 (15-keto PGE2), a product formed from 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of PGE2, has recently been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities. In this study, we observed that 15-keto PGE2 suppressed the phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in human mammary epithelial cells transfected with H-ras (MCF10A-ras). 15-Keto PGE2 inhibited the migration and clonogenicity of MCF10A-ras cells. In addition, subcutaneous injection of 15-keto PGE2 attenuated xenograft tumor growth and phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. However, a non-electrophilic analogue, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2 failed to inhibit STAT3 signaling and was unable to suppress the growth and transformation of MCF10A-ras cells. These findings suggest that the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety of 15-keto PGE2 is essential for its suppression of STAT3 signaling. We observed that the thiol reducing agent, dithiothreitol abrogated 15-keto PGE2-induced STAT3 inactivation and disrupted the direct interaction between 15-keto PGE2 and STAT3. Furthermore, a molecular docking analysis suggested that Cys251 and Cys259 residues of STAT3 could be preferential binding sites for this lipid mediator. Mass spectral analysis revealed the covalent modification of recombinant STAT3 by 15-keto PGE2 at Cys259. Taken together, thiol modification of STAT3 by 15-keto PGE2 inactivates STAT3 which may account for its suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation and progression. ? 2019 The Authors","13,14 dihydro 15 oxoprostaglandin E2; 15 ketoprostaglandin E2; antineoplastic agent; cysteine; dithiothreitol; prostaglandin E2; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; Bagg albino mouse; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; cell transformation; clonogenesis; controlled study; drug binding site; drug mechanism; female; human; human cell; mass spectrometry; MCF-10AT cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; migration inhibition; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; priority journal; protein interaction; protein phosphorylation; protein polymerization; protein synthesis inhibition; signal transduction"
"Anti-inflammatory effect of Chunkoongkeigi-tang on IL-1β-induced inflamed A549 by the inhibition of COX-2 expression",2019,"Backgrounds: Inflammatory lung disease can arise due to the immoderate expression of pro-inflammatory genes and the disharmony of complex cytokines. Chunkoongkeigi-tang (CKT) has been prescribed to patients with asthmatic symptoms in herbal medicine clinics. However, the effects of CKT on the inflamed human lung cell line A549 have yet to be revealed. Thus we investigate whether CKT can suppress inflammatory response on interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced inflamed A549. Methods: In an effort to understand the inhibitory activity of CKT on inflamed A549, we use IL-1β to induce inflammatory gene COX-2 expressions on A549. Inhibition of COX-2 expression and inflammatory cytokine secretion through blocking mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and transcriptional nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity was confimed by western blot and real-time PCR. Compounds in CKT were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results: CKT inhibited increased COX-2 in an IL-1β-induced inflammatory state of A549. We confirmed that CKT regulated the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and transcriptional nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Additionally, a suppressive effect of CKT on the mRNA expression levels of cytokine-related asthma ((IL-5, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α) was noted in IL-1β-induced inflamed A549. According to LC-MS analysis, we identified several components in CKT which can be expected to be the active compounds of the anti-inflammatory effect of CKT. Conclusion: We verify the anti-inflammatory effect of CKT via the reduction of the IL-1β-induced increased COX-2 expression through the MAPK and NF-κB pathways, suggesting useful anti-asthmatic potential by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines, especially in patients with asthma. ? 2019, The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics and Springer Nature B.V.","antiasthmatic agent; antiinflammatory agent; chunkoongkeigi tang; cyclooxygenase 2; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; antiinflammatory activity; Article; asthma; Atractylodes; Atractylodes lancea; Cinnamomum cassia; Cnidium; Cnidium officinale; cytokine release; enzyme inhibition; Fraxinus; Fraxinus rhynchophylla; gene overexpression; ginger; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; human; human cell; jujube; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MAPK signaling; mRNA expression level; Paeonia lactiflora; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting; Zizyphus jujuba var. inermis"
"Pneumothorax after minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis for midshaft clavicle fracture: A case report",2019,"Rationale:Isolated fracture of clavicle is usually treated with nonoperative conservative treatment. However, surgical treatment, customized for individual patient's need, is increasingly done. With regard to the surgery of the clavicle fracture, pneumothorax is a possible, but rare complication.Patient concerns:We report the case of a 32-year-old healthy female patient who underwent minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) due to a clavicle fracture. To avoid direct exposure of fracture site, the pre-contoured plate was inserted through the lateral incisional port to reach the medial incisional port. There was no problem during the surgery, but the patient complained of dyspnea in the post-anesthesia care unit.Diagnoses:A chest radiograph was taken immediately, and a definitive finding of pneumothorax was revealed.Interventions:A tube was inserted at the right chest.Outcomes:The patient's dyspnea was resolved. On the 6th day after the surgery, the chest radiograph revealed that pneumothorax was nearly resolved, enabling to remove the chest tube.

"Role of natural products in modulating histone deacetylases in cancer",2019,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that can control transcription by modifying chromatin conformation, molecular interactions between the DNA and the proteins as well as the histone tail, through the catalysis of the acetyl functional sites removal of proteins from the lysine residues. Also, HDACs have been implicated in the post transcriptional process through the regulation of the proteins acetylation, and it has been found that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) constitute a promising class of pharmacological drugs to treat various chronic diseases, including cancer. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that in several cancers, elevated HDAC enzyme activities may be associated with aberrant proliferation, survival and metastasis. Hence, the discovery and development of novel HDACi from natural products, which are known to affect the activation of various oncogenic molecules, has attracted significant attention over the last decade. This review will briefly emphasize the potential of natural products in modifying HDAC activity and thereby attenuating initiation, progression and promotion of tumors. ? 2019 by the authors.","biological product; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; acetylation; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; human; metastasis; neoplasm; Acetylation; Biological Products; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms"
"Survey of echinococcoses in southeastern Qinghai Province, China, and serodiagnostic insights of recombinant Echinococcus granulosus antigen B isoforms",2019,"Background: Echinococcoses, caused by metacestodes of Echinococcus granulosus (cystic echinococcosis; CE) and E. multilocularis (alveolar echinococcosis; AE), represent major emerging parasitic diseases. These enzootic helminthiases invoke significant public health concerns and social burdens in endemic areas. The diseases are prevalent in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, while community-based epidemiological studies have been scarcely reported. We surveyed echinococcosis patients in the southeastern Qinghai Province, China, to better understand the concurrent epidemiological situation in this area. Methods: During July and August of 2013 and 2014, we screened echinococcosis patients at Yushu and Golog Prefectures, Qinghai Province, China, in a diagnostic campaign. A total of 2856 people (male:female ratio, 1:1.12; mean age, 34.6 years; age range, 6-88 years) were ultrasonographically examined for the presence of hepatic echinococcal cysts. We also collected serum samples from patients and analyzed antibody reactivity against recombinant forms of diverse E. granulosus antigen Bs (rEgAgB1-5) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We detected 134 patients whose imaging scans were compatible with CE (115 cases) and AE (20 patients). One patient might have been infected with both CE and AE. The overall incidence was 4.7% (CE, 4.0%; AE, 0.7%). A large proportion (67.5%) of CE patients was diagnosed at active and transitional CE1-CE3 stages in their late 30s. The AE cases were generally detected at advanced stage in patients at early 20s (60%). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve and Youden's index indicated that rEgAgB2 was the most promising biomarker, followed by rEgAgB3 and rEgAgB1. Overall, sensitivity and specificity of rEgAgB1-3 were 84.5-92.7% and 91.9-94.6%, respectively. rEgAgB4 and 5 showed low sensitivity with high cross-reactivity. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that disability-adjusted life years related to echinococcoses in Qinghai-Tibetan areas might be more serious than previously considered. Control and prevention strategy against CE and AE are highly required in these areas. In addition to ultrasonography, serological tests might provide supportive data. However, serological data should be carefully interpreted for differential diagnosis, especially in areas where both CE and AE are co-endemic. ? 2019 The Author(s).","blood group B antigen; antigen B, Echinococcus granulosus; helminth antibody; isoprotein; lipoprotein; adolescent; adult; aged; antigen antibody reaction; antigen detection; Article; child; China; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disability-adjusted life year; echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus; echography; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; geographic distribution; health survey; human; immunoreactivity; major clinical study; male; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; serodiagnosis; Youden index; animal; blood; echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus; genetics; immunology; isolation and purification; middle aged; serology; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Antibodies, Helminth; Child; China; Echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Lipoproteins; Male; Middle Aged; Protein Isoforms; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Young Adult"
"Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation",2019,"Background and Objectives: Rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin for preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared to adjusted-dose warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Methods: We built a Markov model using the Korean Health Insurance Review &amp; Assessment Service database. The base-case analysis assumed a cohort of patients with prevalent AF who were aged 18 years or older without contraindications to anticoagulation. Results: Number of patients with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores 0, 1 and ?2 were 56 (0.2%), 1,944 (6.3%) and 28,650 (93.5%), respectively. In patients with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores ?2, the incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 3.11% and 3.76% in warfarin and rivaroxaban groups, respectively. The incidence rates of ICH were 0.42% and 0.15%, and those of gastrointestinal bleeding were 0.32% and 0.15% in warfarin and rivaroxaban, respectively. Patients with AF treated with rivaroxaban lived an average of 11.8 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a lifetime treatment cost of $20,886. Those receiving warfarin lived an average of 11.4 QALYs and incurred costs of $17,151. Patients with rivaroxaban gained an additional 0.4 QALYs over a lifetime with an additional cost of $3,735, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $9,707 per QALY. Conclusions: Patients who had been treated with rivaroxaban may be a cost-effective alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in Korean patients with AF. Copyright ? 2019.

"Z-ligustilide and n-Butylidenephthalide Isolated from the Aerial Parts of Angelica tenuissima Inhibit Lipid Accumulation in Vitro and in Vivo",2019,"Abnormal lipid metabolism, such as increased fatty acid uptake and esterification, is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aqueous extract of the aerial part of Angelica tenuissima Nakai (ATX) inhibited high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice as well as oleic acid-induced neutral lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. ATX decreased the mRNA and protein levels of CD36 and diglyceride acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), and the expression of the lipogenic target genes fasn and scd1. The ATX components, Z-ligustilide and n-butylidenephthalide, inhibited the expression of FATP5 and DGAT2 and thus oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that ATX and its active components Z-ligustilide and n-butylidenephthalide inhibit fatty acid uptake and esterification in mice and have potential as therapeutics for NAFLD. ? 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","acyl coenzyme A desaturase 1; CD36 antigen; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; fatty acid synthase; fatty acid transporter; ligustilide; messenger RNA; n butylidenephthalide; oleic acid; plant medicinal product; sterol regulatory element binding protein; unclassified drug; butylidenephthalide; gamma butyrolactone; ligustilide; oleic acid; phthalic anhydride; plant extract; SREBF1 protein, human; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; aerial plant part; Angelica; Angelica tenuissima; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aqueous solution; Article; controlled study; drug effect; esterification; fasn gene; fatty acid transport; fatty liver; gene; gene expression; gene targeting; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; male; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; protein expression; protein processing; scd1 gene; aerial plant part; analogs and derivatives; Angelica; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; gene expression regulation; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; nonalcoholic fatty liver; preclinical study; procedures; 4-Butyrolactone; Angelica; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Gene Expression Regulation; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipogenesis; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Oleic Acid; Phthalic Anhydrides; Plant Components, Aerial; Plant Extracts; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1"
"Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool to assess the efficacy of acute treatment",2019,"Background and objective: The Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Tool-Patient-Reported Outcomes (EXACT-PRO) has been suggested as a reliable and valid measure for early assessment of COPD exacerbations and perceived recovery. However, there has been no evidence for EXACT-PRO efficacy in assessing recovery from treatment in a randomized controlled trial. The study evaluated the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of EXACT-PRO for the evaluation of the efficacy of acute treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation. Methods: In a Phase III randomized controlled study for assessing the efficacy of antibiotic treatment on COPD exacerbation, EXACT-PRO was evaluated in the responders and non-responders. Results: A total of 295 patients were analyzed (259 responders and 37 non-responders). Cronbach’s α was 0.96 for EXACT total, 0.96 for the breathlessness domain, 0.89 for the cough and sputum domain, and 0.93 for the chest symptoms domain. The EXACT score correlated with the COPD assessment test (CAT) score (r=0.8, P,0.01). A stronger decrease in the EXACT score was found in the responder group than in the non-responder group from the fifth day after treatment. The difference in the EXACT score from exacerbation onset to recovery was -6.3 in responders and -1.9 in non-responders (P=0.01). Conclusion: EXACT-PRO is a comprehensive and sensitive method for assessing symptomatic resolution of COPD exacerbations during treatment. ? 2019 Choi et al.","antibiotic agent; moxifloxacin; zabofloxacin; antiinfective agent; quinolone derivative; zabofloxacin; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; disease exacerbation; double blind procedure; Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Tool; female; forced expiratory volume; human; language; major clinical study; male; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; phase 3 clinical trial; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; reliability; respiratory tract disease assessment; sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; treatment planning; validation study; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial; convalescence; drug effect; dyspnea; lung; microbiology; middle aged; multicenter study; pathophysiology; patient-reported outcome; predictive value; reproducibility; South Korea; sputum; time factor; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Disease Progression; Double-Blind Method; Dyspnea; Female; Fluoroquinolones; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Recovery of Function; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Sputum; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Fermented dried Citrus unshiu peel extracts exert anti-inflammatory activities in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages and improve skin moisturizing efficacy in immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes",2019,"Context:Citrus unshiu Markovich (Rutaceae) peel is known to contain high concentrations of flavonoids and exerts pharmacological effects on antioxidant, anti-inflammation, allergies, diabetes and viral infections. Objective: Very little is known about potential activity of fermented dried Citrus unshiu peel extracts (FCU) using Bacillus subtilis, as well as its mechanism of action. We investigated the effects of FCU on the anti-inflammatory activities in murine macrophages and moisturizing effects in human keratinocytes. Materials and methods: We isolated the Bacillus subtilis from Cheonggukjang and FCU using these Bacillus subtilis to prepare samples. The cells were pre-treated with various extracts for 2 h and then induced with LPS for 22 h. We determined the NO assay, TNF-α, IL-6 and PGE2 in RAW 264.7 ells. The expression of SPT and Filaggrin by FCU treatment was measured in HaCaT cells. Result: We found that two types of FCU highly suppressed LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) without exerting cytotoxic effects on RAW 264.7 cells (21.9 and 15.4% reduction). FCU inhibited the expression of LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 proteins and their mRNAs in a concentration-dependent manner. TNF-α (59 and 30.9% reduction), IL-6 (39.1 and 65.6% reduction), and PGE2 secretion (78.6 and 82.5% reduction) were suppressed by FCU in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, FCU can induce the production of hyaluronic acid (38 and 38.9% induction) and expression of Filaggrin and SPT in HaCaT keratinocyte cells. Discussion and conclusion: FCU potentially inhibits inflammation, improves skin moisturizing efficacy, and it may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammation and dry skin. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Exercise during adjuvant treatment for colorectal cancer: Treatment completion, treatment-related toxicities, body composition, and serum level of adipokines",2019,"Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effect of exercise on completion rates of adjuvant treatment, which is one of the major prognostic factors among patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer after undergoing curative resection followed by adjuvant treatment. Design: Prospective pilot study Methods: We assigned patients who were scheduled to undergo adjuvant treatment (N=39) to the exercise group or the control group in a 2:1 ratio in the order of enrollment. Patients completed questionnaires and underwent assessment of the outcome variables at the start of chemotherapy and upon completion of treatment. Results: A fivefold lower possibility of dose adjustment in the exercise group compared to the control group was demonstrated (OR, 0.188; p=0.023; 95% CI, 0.044–0.793). A significantly smaller proportion of the exercise group had grade 3 or 4 nausea (p=0.018) and neurotoxicity (P=0.024) symptoms. Muscle to fat ratios were significantly reduced in the control group (p=0.039), but not in the exercise group (p=0.742). Serum levels of leptin were significantly increased in the control group (p=0.038), but not in the exercise group (p=0.073). Serum levels of adiponectin were significantly increased in the exercise group (p=0.026) but tended to be decreased in the control group with no statistical significance (p=0.418). Conclusions: Exercise training among patients with colorectal cancer was found to have a beneficial impact on adjuvant treatment completion rates and treatment-associated toxicities. This program was also shown to be beneficial to patients’ body compositions and serum levels of adipokines. ? 2019 Shim et al.","adipocytokine; adiponectin; fluorouracil; folinic acid; leptin; oxaliplatin; adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adult; advanced cancer; aged; anorexia; Article; body composition; body fat; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer prognosis; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; colorectal cancer; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; exercise; female; human; male; mucosa inflammation; muscle; nausea; neurotoxicity; neutropenia; outcome assessment; pilot study; prospective study; protein blood level; questionnaire; thrombocytopenia"
"Scutellaria baicalensis alleviates insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice by modulating inflammation",2019,"Insulin resistance is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, and chronic inflammation is known to be a major mechanism of insulin resistance and is a therapeutic target. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Scutellaria baicalensis (SB) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin-resistant mice and to investigate its mechanism based on inflammatory responses. Mice were fed a HFD to induce insulin resistance and then administered SB for nine weeks. Body weight, glucose, lipid, insulin, epididymal fat pad and liver weights, and histologic characteristics were evaluated to determine the effect on insulin resistance. In order to evaluate the effects on the inflammatory process, we analyzed the proportions of macrophages in liver and epididymal fat and measured inflammatory gene expression. Fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased by SB administration. The epididymal fat and liver showed significant weight decreases and histological improvements. Total adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) decreased (27.71 ± 3.47% vs. 45.26 ± 7.26%, p < 0.05), M2 ATMs increased (47.02 ± 6.63% vs. 24.28 ± 8.00%, p < 0.05), and CD11b+ Kupffer cells decreased. The expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and F4/80 in the liver were significantly decreased (12.03 ± 1.47% vs. 25.88 ± 4.57%, p < 0.05) compared to HFD group. These results suggest that SB improved insulin resistance through inhibition of macrophage-mediated inflammation. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Dehydroabietic Acid Induces Regeneration of Collagen Fibers in Ultraviolet B-Irradiated Human Dermal Fibroblasts and Skin Equivalents",2019,"Background/Aims: Dehydroabietic acid (DAA) is a natural phytochemical found in red pine trees and herbal plants. While DAA and its derivatives are known for improving diabetes and hyperlipidemia, the antiaging effect and its underlying mechanisms of DAA on skin have not been fully examined. Here, we assessed the antiaging effects of DAA on human dermal fibroblasts and skin equivalents. Methods: We investigated the effect of DAA on the secretion of type I procollagen and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated neonatal normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFn). Using nonlinear optical imaging techniques, we visualized quantitative and qualitative changes of collagen fibers by DAA treatment in human skin equivalent models. Results: DAA induces increases in type I procollagen secretion when treated on UVB-irradiated NHDFn. DAA also downregulates secretion of MMP-1 through the inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway. In human skin equivalent models, we successfully visualized the spatial distribution of collagen fibers in the dermis and found that quantity, diameter, and arrangement of collagen fibers in the dermis were significantly improved by DAA treatment. Conclusion: Our results suggest that DAA could be a useful agent for improving skin photoaging through the protection and regeneration of collagen fibers in skin. ? 2019 S.

"Combined exposure of emotional labor and job insecurity on depressive symptoms among female call-center workers: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Call-center workers work under unfavorable psychosocial working conditions, including, emotional labor and job insecurity, which might be linked to depressive symptoms.The purpose of this study was to explore the link between emotional labor and depressive symptoms and to investigate the influence of combined exposure to emotional labor and job insecurity on depressive symptoms.A health survey was conducted among female call-center workers in Geumcheon-gu (a district in Seoul), South Korea, in November 2012. The short form of the Korean occupational stress scale was used to measure occupational stressors. A questionnaire with 8 items was employed to assess emotional labor. Depressive symptoms were estimated using the Korean Version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The association of emotional labor and occupational stressors with depressive symptoms was assessed using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression.Overall, 699 female call-center workers were enrolled into this study. The odds ratios of experiencing depressive symptoms in workers exposed to emotional labor and job insecurity were 5.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.38-8.80) and 2.37 (95% CI: 0.86-6.50), respectively. When workers were simultaneously exposed to excessive emotional labor and high job insecurity levels, the odds ratio of experiencing depressive symptoms was 10.13 (95% CI: 3.51-29.23). The Relative Excess Risk due to the Interaction (RERI) of job insecurity and emotional labor was 3.30 (95% CI: -5.50 to 12.11); however, this was not statistically significant (P?=?.46).Although a causal relationship could not be established due to the cross-sectional study design, the combined effect of emotional labor and job insecurity might have a serious influence on behavioral health among call-center female workers.","adult; cross-sectional study; depression; emotion; female; human; job satisfaction; job stress; middle aged; socioeconomics; South Korea; statistical model; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Emotions; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Occupational Stress; Republic of Korea; Socioeconomic Factors"
"Comparative Efficacy of Bariatric Surgery in the Treatment of Morbid Obesity and Diabetes Mellitus: a Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis",2019,"Introduction: The comparative efficacy of various bariatric procedures has not been completely elucidated. We aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of various bariatric procedures comprehensively. Methods: We searched for randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of bariatric surgery. Network meta-analyses were performed to determine the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and remission of diabetes mellitus (DM). Results: Of 45 studies, 33 and 24 provided the data for %EWL and DM remission rates, respectively. Six months after surgery, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) showed superior efficacy for %EWL compared to the standard-of-care (mean difference [MD], [95% confidence interval [CI]]: BPD-DS, 38.2% [7.3%, 69.1%]; RYGB, 32.1% [3.1%, 61.1%]; SG, 32.5% [5.5%, 59.5%]). However, adjustable gastric banding was not superior to standard-of-care (MD [95% CI] = ? 0.2% [? 19.6%, 19.2%]). At 1?year, all bariatric procedures were superior to standard-of-care. At 3?years, RYGB and SG showed superior efficacy when compared to standard-of-care (MD [95% CI]: RYGB, 45.0% [21.8%, 68.2%]; SG, 39.2% [15.2%, 63.3%]). With respect to DM remission 3–5?years after surgery, BPD-DS, RYGB, and SG were superior to standard-of-care. Hernias, obstruction/stricture, bleeding, and ulcers were less common in patients who underwent SG than in those who underwent RYGB. Conclusions: RYGB and SG had excellent long-term outcomes for both the %EWL and DM remission rates. Additionally, SG had a relatively lower risk of adverse events than RYGB. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article; bariatric surgery; biliopancreatic bypass; body weight loss; diabetes mellitus; gastric banding; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; health care quality; hernia; human; meta analysis; morbid obesity; network meta-analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obstruction; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); remission; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; systematic review; ulcer"
"Platycodin D, a novel activator of AMP-activated protein kinase, attenuates obesity in db/db mice via regulation of adipogenesis and thermogenesis",2019,"Background: Platycodi Radix (root of Platycodon grandiflorum) and its active compound platycodin D (PD) has been previously shown to possess anti-obesity properties, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Purpose: The present study was aimed to evaluate the anti-obese effect of PD and reveal its mechanism of action. Study Design/Methods: Genetically obese db/db mice were orally treated with PD for 4 weeks, and body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, serum parameters were measured. Then, assays on adipogenic factors, thermogenic factors, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway were performed in PD-treated 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs), and primary cultured brown adipocytes. Results: PD treatment attenuated body weight gain, suppressed white adipose tissue weight and improved obesity-related serum parameters in db/db mice. Two major adipogenic factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) were decreased by PD treatment in WAT of db/db mice, 3T3-L1 adipocytes and hAMSCs. In BAT of db/db mice and primary cultured brown adipocytes, PD treatment elevated the expressions of uncoupled protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α (PCG1α), the key regulators of BAT-associated thermogenesis. In addition, PD activated AMPKα both in vivo and in vitro. However, when AMPK was inhibited by compound C, PD treatment failed to suppress adipogenic factors and increase thermogenic factors. Conclusions: PD improved obesity in db/db mice by AMPK-associated decrease of adipogenic markers including PPARγ and C/EBPα. PD increased thermogenic factors such as UCP1 and PGC1α in db/db mice and primary cultured brown adipocytes. AMPK inhibition nullified the effects of PD, suggesting its anti-adipogenic and thermogenic actions were dependent on AMPK pathway activation. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","adiponectin; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; fatty acid binding protein 4; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase activator; lipin1 protein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; platycodin d; protein; resistin; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; platycodin D; saponin; triterpene; Ucp1 protein, mouse; uncoupling protein 1; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; adipose tissue weight; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; body weight gain; brown adipocyte; controlled study; cytotoxicity; db/db mouse; drug mechanism; embryo; energy expenditure; food intake; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid storage; liver weight; male; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; MTS assay; nonhuman; obesity; polymerase chain reaction; primary cell culture; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; thermogenesis; total cholesterol level; weight, mass and size; white adipose tissue; wild type; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; animal; brown adipose tissue; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; knockout mouse; metabolism; obesity; Platycodon; thermogenesis; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes, Brown; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Obesity; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Platycodon; PPAR gamma; Saponins; Thermogenesis; Triterpenes; Uncoupling Protein 1"

Methods: The Jeil Telmisartan, Amlodipine, and Rosuvastatin Randomized Clinical Trial (J-TAROS-RCT) was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, Phase III clinical trial conducted at 9 hospitals in Korea. After a run-in period of >4 weeks, patients who fulfilled the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were eligible for randomization to receive 1 of 3 treatments for 8 weeks: (1) telmisartan/amlodipine 80 mg/10 mg plus rosuvastatin 20 mg, (2) telmisartan/amlodipine 80 mg/10 mg, or (3) telmisartan 80 mg plus rosuvastatin 20 mg. The primary end point was efficacy evaluation of combination therapy with telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin by comparing the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) and mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment. Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data, and vital signs were assessed in all patients. Findings: Among 148 patients, the changes in msSBP from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment were a mean (SD) of ?24.41 (2.38) versus ?9.31 (2.36) mm Hg in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin and telmisartan/rosuvastatin groups, respectively. Significantly more participants achieved the target BP at week 8 in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin group (41 patients [87.2%]) than in the telmisartan/rosuvastatin group (24 [50.0%], P < 0.001). The changes in mean (SD) LDL-C at 8 weeks compared with baseline values were ?57.59% (11.59%) versus 6.08% (20.98%) in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin and telmisartan/amlodipine groups, respectively. The percentages of patients who achieved the target LDL-C according to their risk factors after 8 weeks of treatment were 97.87% vs 6.12% in the telmisartan/amlodipine/rosuvastatin and the telmisartan/amlodipine groups (P < 0.0001), respectively. No significant differences were found in the incidence of overall AEs and adverse drug reactions, and serious AEs were comparable among 3 groups. Implications: Fixed-dose combinations of telmisartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin decreased BP and LDL-C in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. The safety and tolerability profiles of fixed-dose telmisartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin combination therapy were comparable with those of telmisartan plus amlodipine or telmisartan plus rosuvastatin.

"Sleep hygiene-related conditions in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea",2019,"Objective: Sleep hygiene-related conditions are factors that affect the symptoms experienced by patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, very few studies have investigated the association between sleep hygiene and sleep symptoms, especially in patients with mild or moderate OSA. This study evaluated the relationship between factors related to sleep hygiene and clinical symptoms in patients with mild to moderate OSA. Methods: One hundred and seventy-four patients who visited the Sleep Breathing Disorder Center at a tertiary academic center to evaluate suspected OSA were included. All patients underwent standard polysomnography (PSG) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and questionnaires related to daytime and nighttime symptoms and sleep hygiene. Medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and PSG parameters. Correlation analysis between sleep hygiene-related conditions and clinical symptoms in patients with mild to moderate OSA was performed. Results: The correlation analysis between the nine categories of sleep hygiene and the three categories of clinical symptoms showed that, in the case of inadequate temperature and humidity conditions, the three categories of clinical symptoms were more severe (daytime symptoms r = 0.382, nighttime symptoms r = 0.568, ESS score r = 0.321). Drinking alcohol before sleep (daytime symptoms r = 0.457, nighttime symptoms r = 0.649, ESS score r = 0.301) and emotional excitement or arousal (daytime symptoms r = 0.378, nighttime symptoms r = 0.545, ESS score r = 0.341) were correlated with greater severity of each of the clinical symptoms (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Among the factors of sleep hygiene-related conditions, inadequate temperature and humidity, drinking alcohol before sleep, and emotional excitement or arousal were associated with symptoms of mild to moderate OSA. This study supports the hypothesis that patients with mild to moderate OSA can experience symptom relief if they are trained to correct lifestyle habits to maintain adequate sleep hygiene-related conditions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","alcohol; adult; apnea hypopnea index; arousal; Article; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drinking behavior; emotion; Epworth sleepiness scale; excitement; female; human; humidity; major clinical study; male; polysomnography; sleep disordered breathing; sleep hygiene; temperature; arousal; drinking behavior; emotion; humidity; middle aged; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; sleep disordered breathing; somnolence; temperature; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Arousal; Emotions; Female; Humans; Humidity; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Sleep Hygiene; Sleepiness; Temperature"
"Development and Validation of a Deep Learning-based Automatic Detection Algorithm for Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis on Chest Radiographs",2019,"Background: Detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis on chest radiographs (CRs) is critical for the diagnosis and screening of tuberculosis. An automated system may help streamline the tuberculosis screening process and improve diagnostic performance. Methods: We developed a deep learning-based automatic detection (DLAD) algorithm using 54c221 normal CRs and 6768 CRs with active pulmonary tuberculosis that were labeled and annotated by 13 board-certified radiologists. The performance of DLAD was validated using 6 external multicenter, multinational datasets. To compare the performances of DLAD with physicians, an observer performance test was conducted by 15 physicians including nonradiology physicians, board-certified radiologists, and thoracic radiologists. Image-wise classification and lesion-wise localization performances were measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the alternative free-response ROC curves, respectively. Sensitivities and specificities of DLAD were calculated using 2 cutoffs (high sensitivity [98%] and high specificity [98%]) obtained through in-house validation. Results: DLAD demonstrated classification performance of 0.977-1.000 and localization performance of 0.973-1.000. Sensitivities and specificities for classification were 94.3%-100% and 91.1%-100% using the high-sensitivity cutoff and 84.1%-99.0% and 99.1%-100% using the high-specificity cutoff. DLAD showed significantly higher performance in both classification (0.993 vs 0.746-0.971) and localization (0.993 vs 0.664-0.925) compared to all groups of physicians. Conclusions: Our DLAD demonstrated excellent and consistent performance in the detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis on CR, outperforming physicians, including thoracic radiologists. ? 2018 The Author(s) 2018.","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; certification; computer assisted tomography; deep learning; deep learning based automatic detection algorithm; female; human; learning algorithm; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; priority journal; radiologist; sensitivity and specificity; task performance; thorax radiography; validation study"
"Egg phospholipids exert an inhibitory effect on intestinal cholesterol absorption in mice",2019,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Consumption of cholesterol-rich foods, such as eggs, has a minimal effect on circulating cholesterol levels in healthy humans. To gain insight, we investigated whether phospholipids rich in eggs (EPL) interfere with intestinal cholesterol absorption in vivo. MATERIALS/METHODS: To investigate the acute effect of EPL on intestinal cholesterol absorption, male C57BL/6J mice were orally administered with 6, 11, or 19 mg of EPL for three days. We also tested the effect of chronic EPL consumption on cholesterol metabolism in the small intestine and the liver in mice with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat/high cholesterol (HF/HC; 35% fat, 0.25% cholesterol, w/w) diet for 4 weeks to induce hypercholesterolemia, and subsequently the mice were either fed 0, 0.4 or 0.8% (w/w) of EPL for 6 weeks. RESULTS: Intestinal cholesterol absorption was significantly decreased by the highest dose of acute EPL administration compared to control. Chronic EPL supplementation did not significantly alter intestinal cholesterol absorption nor plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In the small intestine and the liver, EPL supplementation minimally altered the expression of genes which regulate cellular cholesterol levels. CONCLUSION: Although chronic EPL consumption was not able to counteract hypercholesterolemia in HF/HC-fed mice, acute EPL administration decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption. This study provides in vivo evidence that acute administration of PLs in eggs prevent cholesterol absorption in the intestine, suggesting a mechanism for a minimal effect of egg consumption on circulating cholesterol levels.

"High-efficiency enzymatic production of α-isoquercitrin glucosides by amylosucrase from Deinococcus geothermalis",2019,"Isoquercitrin (IQ, quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) has diverse biological functions, such as anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activity, but its use is limited by poor solubility and bioavailability. Enzymatically modified IQ (EMIQ) is a mixture of transglycosylated IQs that have better solubility and bioavailability than do quercetin and IQ. Two different enzymes, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) and amylosucrase (ASase), have the transglycosylation activity to produce EMIQ. Both enzymes produce a variety of EMIQs including IQ, IQ-glucoside (IQ-G1), IQ-diglucoside (IQ-G2), and IQ-triglucoside (IQ-G3). ASase had a higher bioconversion yield from IQ to EMIQ (97.6%) than did CGTase (76.8%). In addition, the yield of IQ-G3, which was the most bioavailable form, was higher with ASase (46%) than with CGTases (8%). Taken together, these results suggest that ASase can be used to synthesize EMIQ in a simple and specific process. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Enzymes; Flavonoids; Glycosylation; Phenols; Solubility; Amylosucrase; CGTase; Deinococcus geothermalis; Isoquercitrin; Transglycosylation; Carbohydrates; alpha isoquercitrin glucoside derivative; amylosucrase; beta amylase; cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase; glucoside; glycosyltransferase; isoquercitrin; sucrose; unclassified drug; amylosucrase; glucoside; glucosyltransferase; isoquercitrin; quercetin; Article; biotransformation; chemical structure; comparative study; cyclization; Deinococcus; Deinococcus geothermalis; enzyme activity; enzyme isolation; enzyme synthesis; enzyme therapy; glycosylation; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrolysis; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; molecular weight; nonhuman; pH; productivity; protein determination; reaction temperature; analogs and derivatives; biosynthesis; chemistry; Deinococcus; enzymology; metabolism; solubility; Deinococcus; Glucosides; Glucosyltransferases; Glycosylation; Quercetin; Solubility"

"Autotransplantation of premolars and space closure in a patient with inflamed sinuses",2019,"Congenital absence of permanent teeth can be treated by means of dental implants and prosthetics. Tooth autotransplantation is an alternative in growing patients because continued eruption of the transplanted tooth and associated alveolar bone growth can be expected. This clinical report presents tooth autotransplantation in a 10-year-old boy with chronic maxillary rhinosinusitis, diagnosed by the department of otorhinolaryngology. The patient's mandibular second premolars were transplanted to a congenitally edentulous maxillary premolar region. There was insufficient alveolar bone during transplantation because of pneumatization, but normal root development with vertical alveolar bone growth was observed during a 3-year follow-up. Healing of the transplant in the right side without closing of the apex and without signs of obliteration after 4 years is exceptional. ? 2018","abnormalities; autotransplantation; case report; child; chronic disease; complication; human; male; mandible; maxilla sinusitis; orthodontic space closure; premolar tooth; rhinitis; transplantation; Bicuspid; Child; Chronic Disease; Humans; Male; Mandible; Maxillary Sinusitis; Orthodontic Space Closure; Rhinitis; Transplantation, Autologous"
"Involvement of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in pollution-induced skin damage",2019,"The effects of environmental insults on human health are a major global concern. Some of the most noxious pollutants that humans are exposed to include ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and cigarette smoke (CS). Since the skin is the first line of defense against environmental insults, it is considered one of the main target organs for the harmful insults of air pollution. Thus, there is solid evidence that skin pathologies such as premature aging, atopic dermatitis (AD), and psoriasis are associated with pollutant exposure; all of these skin conditions are also associated with an altered redox status. Therefore, although the mechanisms of action and concentrations of O3, PM, and CS that we are exposed to differ, exposure to all of these pollutants is associated with the development of similar skin conditions due to the fact that all of these pollutants alter redox homeostasis, increasing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress. A main product of oxidative stress, induced by exposure to the aforementioned pollutants, is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which derives from the oxidation of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. HNE is a highly reactive compound that can form adducts with cellular proteins and even DNA; it is also an efficient cell signaling molecule able to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and the activity of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as Nrf2, AP1, and NFκB. Therefore, increased levels of HNE in the skin, in response to pollutants, likely accelerates skin aging and exacerbates existing skin inflammatory conditions; thus, targeting HNE formation could be an innovative cosmeceutical approach for topical applications. ? 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","4 hydroxynonenal; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; omega 6 fatty acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor AP 1; transcription factor Nrf2; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; aldehyde; mitogen activated protein kinase; ozone; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor; air pollution; atopic dermatitis; dermatitis; homeostasis; human; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; premature aging; priority journal; psoriasis; Review; skin defect; toxicity; adverse event; air pollutant; cutaneous parameters; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; particulate matter; passive smoking; pathology; signal transduction; skin; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Aldehydes; Dermatitis, Atopic; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Psoriasis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Skin; Skin Aging; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Transcription Factors"
"Serum ferritin level is associated with liver steatosis and fibrosis in Korean general population",2019,"Background: Elevation of serum ferritin levels is frequently observed in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Our study aims to examine the association between serum ferritin levels and NAFLD in Korean population. Methods and results: A total of 25,597 participants were selected from Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys 2007–2012. The NAFLD liver fat score (NLFS) was used to define NAFLD. Elevation of ALT levels was defined as ALT level > 40?IU/L for male and ALT level > 31?IU/L for female. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association of serum ferritin levels and NAFLD by sex. After adjusting for multiple covariates, the ORs (95% CI) of the elevated ALT levels were 1.56 (95% CI: 1.17–2.07), 1.84 (95% CI: 1.39–2.45), and 4.08 (95% CI: 3.08–5.40) for the second, third and fourth serum ferritin quartiles in male (p for trend < 0.01), 1.67 (95% CI: 1.24–2.23), 2.23 (95% CI: 1.68–2.96), and 5.72 (95% CI: 4.32–7.60) for the second, third and fourth serum ferritin quartiles in female (p for trend < 0.01). Serum ferritin levels were also significantly associated with NAFLD and liver fibrosis both in male and female.

"Neutrophil-to-Monocyte-Plus-Lymphocyte Ratio as a Potential Marker for Discriminating Pulmonary Tuberculosis from Nontuberculosis Infectious Lung Diseases",2019,"Objective: To determine whether NMLR has more statistical strength than NLR in discriminating TB from non-TB infectious lung diseases. Methods: Among patients who underwent 3 or more TB culture tests with molecular study between January 2016 and December 2017, 110 patients with TB, and 159 patients diagnosed with non-TB infectious lung diseases were enrolled. The original complete blood count (CBC) parameters and modified CBC indices, including NLR and NMLR, were analyzed. Results: The NLR and NMLR were significantly lower in TB patients than in patients with other infectious lung diseases. However, the area under the curve (AUC) for NMLR (0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.93) was significantly greater than that for NLR (0.88 [0.84-0.92]). Conclusions: The neutrophil-to-monocyte-plus-lymphocyte ratio (NMLR) can be used as a new index that is more powerful than neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in discriminating tuberculosis (TB) from non-TB infectious lung diseases.

"Biomechanical properties of red blood cells infected by Plasmodium berghei ANKA",2019,"Malaria is a pathogenic disease in mammal species and typically causes destruction of red blood cells (RBCs). The malaria-infected RBCs undergoes alterations in morphology and its rheological properties, and the altered rheological properties of RBCs have a significant impact on disease pathophysiology. In this study, we investigated detailed topological and biomechanical properties of RBCs infected with malaria Plasmodium berghei ANKA using atomic force microscopy. Mouse (BALB/c) RBCs were obtained on Days 4, 10, and 14 after infection. We found that malaria-infected RBCs changed significantly in shape. The RBCs maintained a biconcave disk shape until Day 4 after infection and then became lopsided on Day 7 after infection. The central region of RBCs began to swell beginning on Day 10 after infection. More schizont stages were present on Days 10 and 14 compared with on Day 4. The malaria-infected RBCs also showed changes in mechanical properties and the cytoskeleton. The stiffness of infected RBCs increased 4.4–4.6-fold and their cytoskeletal F-actin level increased 18.99–67.85% compared with the control cells. The increase in F-actin depending on infection time was in good agreement with the increased stiffness of infected RBCs. Because more schizont stages were found at a late period of infection at Days 10 and 14, the significant changes in biomechanical properties might contribute to the destruction of RBCs, possibly resulting in the release of merozoites into the blood circulation. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","F actin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; atomic force microscopy; circulation; comparative study; controlled study; cytoskeleton; elasticity; erythrocyte; erythrocyte deformability; erythrocyte function and characteristics; erythrocyte membrane; erythrocyte structure; mouse; nonhuman; Plasmodium berghei infection; priority journal; schizont"
"Ultrasound-guided sialo-irrigation with a saline–air mixture as the contrast medium",2019,"Ultrasound (US)-guided salivary gland irrigation is a popular conservative treatment method that improves the success rate and reduces complications of the sialo-irrigation procedure. US is routinely used for evaluation of various salivary gland diseases because of its easy accessibility and absence of ionizing radiation. US also allows dynamic studies with real-time imaging during diagnostic or surgical procedures. However, conventional US images have limitations in salivary duct visualization. Although US images acquired with saline irrigation have improved visualization because of ductal system dilation by the pulling effect, the resultant image quality remains insufficient for diagnosis. Therefore, contrast agents are required during US-guided sialo-irrigation procedures to produce diagnostic image quality. Air bubbles in saline solution have high echogenicity and enhance image quality by acting as a US contrast agent. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of US-guided sialo-irrigation with a saline–air contrast medium, to estimate its diagnostic and treatment efficacy, and to examine the procedure in two patients. In the study, two patients underwent US-guided salivary gland irrigation with air-bubble mixed saline solution. During the procedure, we were able to visualize the salivary gland duct and subsequently irrigate and clean the inside of the duct. As a result, the patients’ symptoms were relieved and saline solution mixed with air bubbles was confirmed to be an effective contrast agent. ? 2018, Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","contrast medium; sodium chloride; adult; aged; air; Article; case report; clinical article; contrast enhancement; female; human; hydrostatic pressure; interventional ultrasonography; lavage; male; salivation; sialo irrigation; sialoadenitis"
"Genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for diabetic nephropathy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus",2019,"Genetic factors are considered to be important in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Despite several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) demonstrating that specific polymorphisms of candidate genes were associated with DN, there were some limitations in previous studies. We conducted a GWAS using customized DNA chips to identify novel susceptibility loci for DN in Korean. We analyzed a total of 414 DN cases and 474 normoalbuminuric diabetic hyper-controls across two stages using customized DNA chips containing 98 667 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We explored the associations between SNPs and DN in samples from 87 DN cases, mostly confirmed by renal biopsy, and 104 diabetic hyper-controls, and replicated these associations in independent cohort samples with 327 DN cases and 370 diabetic hyper-controls. The top significant SNPs from the discovery samples were selected for replication in the independent cohort. rs3765156 in PIK3C2B was significantly associated with DN in the replication cohort after multiple test. The SNPs identified in our study provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DN in the Korean population. Additional studies are needed to determine biological effects and clinical utility of our findings. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Present and future incidence of dengue fever in Ecuador nationwide and coast region scale using species distribution modeling for climate variability's effect",2019,"Dengue fever, a vector-borne disease, represents a priority public health problem in Ecuador. Previous studies indicated that the ecology of the transmitter vector (Aedes aegypti) is influenced by environmental parameters and human behavior; however, the effects of those variables on mosquito population dynamics depend on local environmental features. In this study, we identified the most important factors influencing the risk of dengue virus infection in Ecuador. The maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) was used to determine the areas with a high probability of the presence of Aedes aegypti under current and future (2050) climatic conditions, using the location of reported dengue cases and potential environmental factors. The model performance was quantified based on an accuracy assessment. Additionally, we used meteorological data from the study period in a partial least square regression (PLS-R) to predict the number of total dengue cases (TDC) and then estimated the future number of cases using the equation obtained with the PLS-R. Population density, elevation, and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were found to be the most important variables influencing the mosquito's geographical distribution. Maximum temperature and minimum temperature were the climatic factors with the best projecting capacity in predicting the TDC in the Ecuadorian coast region. The results show a greater mosquito presence probability in populated areas, with a considerable expansion of suitable habitat across the central and southern provinces by 2050. The temporal analysis revealed that the regional dengue outbreak season goes from March to June, and the future estimation predicted that the next large outbreak would occur in 2018. These results present a good intel for solutions of reduction of dengue cases in the country. This further will allow the responsible authorities to pinpoint proper vector control measurements by province. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral research; Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Geographical distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Viruses; Aedes aegypti; Dengue fevers; Ecological modeling; Ecuador; Habitat suitability; Population distribution; accuracy assessment; climate change; climate effect; dengue fever; disease incidence; disease vector; ecological modeling; environmental factor; geographical distribution; habitat structure; infectious disease; mosquito; population dynamics; population outbreak; risk assessment; scale effect; Ecuador; Aedes aegypti; Dengue virus"
"Microsurgical treatment strategy for large and giant aneurysms of the internal carotid artery",2019,"Objective: We aimed to summarize our microsurgical treatment results for large (10–25 mm) and giant (?25 mm) intradural internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms over a 7-year period at a single institution and to describe our detailed strategy. Patients and methods: We reviewed the records of 68 patients with 69 aneurysms, including large and giant intradural ICA aneurysms, treated using microsurgical techniques from January 2008 to December 2014. We used adenosine-induced cardiac standstill or retrograde suction decompression for some aneurysm clipping cases and performed bypass surgery if needed. Results: Fifty-eight large and giant ICA aneurysms (84%) were treated with direct clipping, including 6 aneurysms (9%) clipped using adenosine-induced cardiac standstill and 10 aneurysms (14%) clipped using suction decompression. Eleven unclippable aneurysms (16%) were trapped with extracranial-intracranial bypass. Good or excellent results (modified Rankin Scale scores 0–2) were obtained in 47 patients with unruptured aneurysms (92%) and in 14 patients with ruptured aneurysms (82%) at the 6-month follow-up. Of 17 patients with visual disturbances before treatment, 11 (65%) had improved vision after surgical treatment. A remnant sac was found in 20 cases (29%) on digital subtraction angiography performed immediately postoperatively. At the median follow-up of 22 months, we encountered 3 recurrent aneurysm cases (5%) among the 58 aneurysms that were followed up. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that microsurgical treatment of large and giant intradural ICA aneurysms remains competitive to flow-diverting treatment, if the surgeon is prepared to perform multifarious surgical methods, including adenosine administration, retrograde suction decompression, and bypass vascular anastomosis. ? 2018","adenosine; adult; aged; aneurysm clipping; Article; brain artery aneurysm rupture; clinical outcome; decompression surgery; digital subtraction angiography; extraintracranial anastomosis; female; human; internal carotid artery aneurysm; major clinical study; male; microsurgery; recurrent disease; visual disorder"
"Comparison of three congruent patient-specific cell types for the modelling of a human genetic Schwann-cell disorder",2019,"Patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold great promise for the modelling of genetic disorders. However, these cells display wide intra- and interindividual variations in gene expression, which makes distinguishing true-positive and false-positive phenotypes challenging. Data from hiPSC phenotypes and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harbouring the same disease mutation are also lacking. Here, we report a comparison of the molecular, cellular and functional characteristics of three congruent patient-specific cell types—hiPSCs, hESCs and direct-lineage-converted cells—derived from currently available differentiation and direct-reprogramming technologies for use in the modelling of Charcot?Marie?Tooth 1A, a human genetic Schwann-cell disorder featuring a 1.4 Mb chromosomal duplication. We find that the chemokines C?X?C motif ligand chemokine-1 (CXCL1) and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) are commonly upregulated in all three congruent models and in clinical patient samples. The development of congruent models of a single genetic disease using somatic cells from a common patient will facilitate the search for convergent phenotypes. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Gene expression; Neurons; Stem cells; Chemoattractants; Direct reprogramming; Functional characteristics; Genetic disease; Genetic disorders; Human embryonic stem cells; Human-induced pluripotent stem cells; Patient specific; Cytology; CXCL1 chemokine; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; octamer transcription factor 4; RNA; transcription factor Sox10; Article; cell differentiation; cell lineage; chromosome duplication; comparative study; embryo; false positive result; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; gene expression; genetic disorder; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; human; human cell; human embryonic stem cell; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; in vitro study; induced pluripotent stem cell; macrophage; nerve biopsy; neural crest; phenotype; RNA sequence; Schwann cell; somatic cell; upregulation"

This suggests that the potential long-run economic impacts of agritourism may not have been empirically investigated yet, leading to underestimation of its net impact. Meanwhile, theories on mere exposure and product familiarity suggest that agritourism may lead tourists to change their agriproduct purchasing patterns after the experience. Thus, this study examines the effect of agritourism experience on consumers’ future grocery purchase patterns. Household-level consumer panel data on grocery expenditure is estimated through the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) approach. The results indicate that agritourism experience significantly alters consumers’ expenditure patterns in the food categories of grain, vegetable, fruit, meat, and fish. Implications for research and practice are discussed along with the findings of the study. ? 2018","demand analysis; economic impact; expenditure; farm; food consumption; nonlinearity; panel data; tourism; tourist behavior"
"Clinical effectiveness of traditional and complementary medicine interventions in combination with nicotine replacement therapy on smoking cessation: A randomized controlled pilot trial",2019,"Background: Smoking is associated with many preventable diseases and deaths. Globally, more than 6 million deaths per year are related to smoking. This study aimed to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) interventions for the smoking cessation treatment and to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of these interventions. Methods: The study design was a pragmatic, open-label randomized trial. The hypothesis of this trial was that the smoking cessation success rate increases with the addition of T&CM methods. The intervention group was provided T&CM interventions in addition to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counseling, whereas the control group was treated with only NRT and counseling. Individuals received treatment for 4 weeks, then follow-up care for 20 weeks. Results: Forty-one participants were enrolled and assigned to either an intervention group or a control group at a ratio of 1:1. The odds ratio values at 4 weeks were 1.96 (0.51-8.51) in intention-to-treat analysis and 3.27 (0.75-17.75) in per-protocol analysis. The amount of smoking (cigarettes) decreased in both groups: from 17.2 ± 10.31 (baseline) to 1.7 ± 3.02 (4 weeks) in the intervention group and from 12.9 ± 5.47 (baseline) to 3.3 ± 5.96 (4 weeks) in the control group. The total medical costs per patient were $212.20 USD in the intervention group and $170.80 in the control group. The adjusted ICER of T&CM interventions was $13,355. Conclusions: This pilot study evaluated the clinical feasibility of T&CM used in conjunction with NRT and counseling for the smoking cessation treatment. However, there was no statistically significant effectiveness of T&CM interventions to raise cessation success rate. This study demonstrates the necessity for further studies based on large-scale randomized controlled trials. ?

"Implementation of Six-axis Inertial Measurement Unit on a Stretchable Platform Using “Cut-and-Paste” Method for Biomedical Applications",2019,"Wearable devices that can process and transmit signals from the human body have the potential to provide valuable biometric data for mobile health (mHealth) and human–machine interface (HMI). Among recent advancements in flexible and stretchable electronics, epidermal electronic devices have shown major breakthroughs in wearable device research fields. Epidermal systems, such as tattoo- and patch-type stretchable systems, have conformity to the human skin, which can be deformed with the skin without detachment for fracture. In this paper, the implementation of a six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) on a stretchable platform for applications in wearable electronics is presented. The proposed device is implemented using circuit elements on a patchlike substrate to collect accurate data from the human body. To achieve flexible and stretchable characteristics of the device, a serpentine interconnection is adopted between the circuit elements. Instead of a microfabrication process, a low-cost, dry, and freeform “cut-and-paste” method that uses a thin metal sheet and a cutting tool to fabricate complex serpentine interconnections is used to fabricate the substrate. The performance characteristics of the IMU using the proposed method are demonstrated for future application in highly accurate biosensors. ?

"Macrophage-dependent neutrophil recruitment is impaired under conditions of increased intestinal permeability in JAM-A-deficient mice",2019,"Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on leukocytes, endothelia, and epithelia that regulates biological processes including barrier function and immune responses. While JAM-A has been reported to facilitate tissue infiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions, the contributions of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in vivo remain unresolved. We investigated the role of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in acute peritonitis induced by zymosan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or TNFα using mice with selective loss of JAM-A in myelomonocytic cells (LysM-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl ). Surprisingly, in LysM-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice, loss of JAM-A did not affect neutrophil (PMN) recruitment into the peritoneum in response to zymosan, LPS, or TNFα although it was significantly reduced in Jam-a KO mice. In parallel, Jam-a KO peritoneal macrophages exhibited diminished CXCL1 chemokine production and decreased activation of NF-kB, whereas those from LysM-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice were unaffected. Using Villin-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice, targeted loss of JAM-A on intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased intestinal permeability along with reduced peritoneal PMN migration as well as lower levels of CXCL1 and active NF-kB similar to that observed in Jam-a KO animals. Interestingly, in germ-free Villin-Cre;Jam-a fl/fl mice, PMN recruitment was unaffected suggesting dependence on gut microbiota. Such observations highlight the functional link between a leaky gut and regulation of innate immune responses. ? 2019, Society for Mucosal Immunology.","CXCL1 chemokine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; junctional adhesion molecule A; lipopolysaccharide; tumor necrosis factor; zymosan; cell adhesion molecule; cell surface receptor; CXCL1 chemokine; F11R protein, human; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; female; hematopoietic stem cell; immunoregulation; innate immunity; intestine epithelium cell; intestine flora; intestine mucosa permeability; leukocyte; macrophage migration; male; mouse; myelomonocytic cell; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; peritoneum; peritoneum macrophage; peritonitis; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein depletion; protein expression; protein induction; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; chemically induced; disease model; genetics; human; immunology; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; macrophage; metabolism; neutrophil; neutrophil chemotaxis; pathology; permeability; tight junction; transgenic mouse; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cells, Cultured; Chemokine CXCL1; Disease Models, Animal; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Neutrophil Infiltration; Neutrophils; NF-kappa B; Peritonitis; Permeability; Receptors, Cell Surface; Tight Junctions; Zymosan"
"Brassinin represses invasive potential of lung carcinoma cells through deactivation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade",2019,"The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a phenomenon that facilitates epithelial cells to acquire invasive potential to induce the initiation the metastatic spread of tumor cells. Here, we determined if brassinin (BSN) can affect the EMT process and deciphered its anti-cancer effects. BSN attenuated the levels of EMT linked genes and suppressed transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-mediated regulation of diverse mesenchymal markers. Additionally, BSN did increase the expression of various epithelial marker proteins in lung cancer cells. TGF-β-induced morphological changes and induction of invasive ability of tumor cells was also found to be abrogated by BSN treatment. Finally, BSN not only suppressed constitutive, but also inducible phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation in tumor cells. ? 2019 by the authors.","brassinin; indole derivative; MTOR protein, human; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; target of rapamycin kinase; thiocarbamic acid derivative; A-549 cell line; drug effect; epithelial mesenchymal transition; human; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction; A549 Cells; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Indoles; Lung Neoplasms; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Thiocarbamates; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"
"Malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia into angiosarcoma",2020,"Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is generally considered to be a benign disease that affects the bones, but it has potential to become malignant over time, generally several decades after its initial diagnosis. Radiation therapy can induce malignant transformation of FD; however, reports have indicated a few cases of malignant transformation of FD in the absence of radiation therapy. Angiosarcoma is a particularly rare type of cancer in the oral region, which accounts for less than 1% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. Herein, we reported a case of a 62-year-old man with monostotic FD of the left maxilla of over 50?years’ duration that underwent malignant transformation into an epithelioid-type angiosarcoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such case. ? 2019, Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; gadolinium; adult; angiosarcoma; Article; case report; clinical article; clinical examination; computer assisted tomography; fibrous dysplasia; histology; human; human tissue; inflammation; male; malignant transformation; maxillary sinus; maximum standardized uptake value; middle aged; panoramic radiography; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; tooth extraction; wound healing impairment"

"Anti-psoriatic effect of myeloid-derived suppressor cells on imiquimod-induced skin inflammation in mice",2019,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play an important role in controlling the immune response against cancer and in suppression of autoimmunity and allergic inflammation. However, the beneficial effects of MDSCs on the experimental mouse model of psoriasis have not been reported. Therefore, we investigated the anti-psoriatic effect of MDSCs on IMQ-induced skin inflammation in mice and explored the mechanisms involved. Our results showed that administration of MDSCs (1?×?106 or 2?×?106?cells) suppressed the development of IMQ-induced skin inflammation in mice as exemplified by a significant reduction in clinical severity scores and was associated with a reduction of histopathological changes, including inflammatory infiltration, epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. The immunosuppressive effect of MDSCs (1?×?106 or 2?×?106?cells) corresponded to the production of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23) in the serum and dorsal skin. Administration of MDSCs (1?×?106 or 2?×?106?cells) also inhibited splenomegaly. Moreover, an increased percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and decreased percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells were found in mice treated with MDSCs. Taken together, these results imply that MDSCs have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects on disease progression in a murine model of psoriasis and that MDSCs could be used in preventive or therapeutic strategies for the management of autoimmune inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis. ? 2018 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology","CD4 antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 17; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; interleukin 23; transcription factor FOXP3; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; imiquimod; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autoimmune skin disease; controlled study; cytokine production; dermatitis; disease severity; epidermis hyperplasia; female; histopathology; hyperkeratosis; imiquimod-induced psoriasis; immune response; immunomodulation; inflammatory infiltrate; mouse; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; splenomegaly; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; immunology; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; pathology; physiology; psoriasis; Animals; Cytokines; Dermatitis; Female; Imiquimod; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells; Psoriasis; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Th1 Cells; Th17 Cells"
"Five-year follow-up outcomes of comprehensive rehabilitation in Korean siblings with cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, skeletal anomalies (CODAS) syndrome: A case report",2019,"Rationale:Cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, skeletal anomalies (CODAS) syndrome is a very rare multisystem disorder, which shows malformations of the central nervous system, ears, eyes, teeth, and skeleton that was first reported in 1991. Only a few cases that sporadically occurred have been reported worldwide. The research investigating the pathogenesis and patterns of CODAS inheritance is still ongoing. There is no satisfactory treatment for this rare genetic disease yet. Due to the lack of curative medical treatment, rehabilitation could play a major role in treatment for genetic disease.Patient concerns:To our best knowledge, the 2 children described in this study are the only CODAS syndromes siblings reported in the world so far. These Korean siblings show highly distinctive features consisting of developmental delay, cataracts, vulnerability to tooth decay, epiphyseal dysplasia, and anomalous ears.Diagnoses:CODAS syndrome.Interventions:Comprehensive long-term rehabilitation treatment during 5 years.Outcomes:We report on the progress of the comprehensive long-term rehabilitation treatment at 5-year follow-up. Their fine motor and language skills development improved similarly to that of same-aged children. We observed the positive effect of rehabilitation on the quality of life.Lessons:The therapy of genetic disorders is challenging for pediatric neurologists and pediatric physiatrists. We suggest that rehabilitation is the best treatment currently available for this genetic disease that yields satisfactory therapeutic effect. ? 2019 Oxford University Press.

"Drp1-Zip1 Interaction Regulates Mitochondrial Quality Surveillance System",2019,"Cho et al. report that Drp1 that is the executioner for mitochondrial fission can reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) during the mitochondrial division, and this new action helps identify bad sectors in the interconnected mitochondria. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.Mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control process for eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria, can be induced by a response of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial division. However, the coordination between MMP and mitochondrial division for selecting the damaged portion of the mitochondrial network is less understood. Here, we found that MMP is reduced focally at a fission site by the Drp1 recruitment, which is initiated by the interaction of Drp1 with mitochondrial zinc transporter Zip1 and Zn 2+ entry through the Zip1-MCU complex. After division, healthy mitochondria restore MMP levels and participate in the fusion-fission cycle again, but mitochondria that fail to restore MMP undergo mitophagy. Thus, interfering with the interaction between Drp1 and Zip1 blocks the reduction of MMP and the subsequent mitophagic selection of damaged mitochondria. These results suggest that Drp1-dependent fission provides selective pressure for eliminating “bad sectors” in the mitochondrial network, serving as a mitochondrial quality surveillance system. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","dynamin; dynamin related protein 1; guanosine triphosphatase; unclassified drug; zinc ion; zinc transporter; Zip1 protein; adenosine triphosphate; calcium channel; cation transport protein; DNM1L protein, human; guanosine triphosphatase; microtubule associated protein; mitochondrial calcium uniporter; mitochondrial protein; protein binding; SLC39A1 protein, human; zinc; Article; hyperglycemia; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitophagy; outer membrane; protein protein interaction; regulatory mechanism; animal; brain cortex; energy metabolism; genetics; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; human; metabolism; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; mitophagy; mutation; nerve cell; pathology; protein domain; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; time factor; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Calcium Channels; Cation Transport Proteins; Cerebral Cortex; Energy Metabolism; GTP Phosphohydrolases; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Degradation; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mutation; Neurons; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Zinc"
"Results from South Korea's 2018 Report Card on physical activity for children and youth",2019,"Background/Objective: South Korea's 2018 Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth is the second comprehensive evaluation of physical activity and the sources of influence based on the 10 core indicators provided by the Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance. It will serve as an advocacy tool to promote physical activity among children and youth. Methods: Three national surveillance data (i.e., 2017 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2016 Physical Activity Promotion System) were used as main sources to evaluate the indicators. Descriptive statistics were performed to obtain prevalence estimates of physical activity-related indicators. In addition, expert opinions as well as the most recently available published or unpublished relevant sources were synthesized. Results: South Korea's 2018 Report Card, compared to the 2016 Report Card, showed favourable changes in the Active Transportation (B+), Organized Sports Participation (C), Sedentary Behaviours (D), and School (D+) indicators, while unfavourable changes were shown in Overall Physical Activity (F) and Government (D). Physical Fitness was graded as D+. In parallel with the 2016 Report Card, Active Play, Family and Peers, and Community and Environment remain ungraded due to insufficient data. Conclusions: Successes as well as gaps and research needs were identified in the 2018 Report Card. Though some indicators have shown improvement, most children and youth continue to be insufficiently physically active with overall poor grades (Average of D+). To achieve substantial improvement in all grades in future Report Cards, more institutional and governmental support and investment is needed to promote physical activity. Furthermore, effort should be made to generate data pertaining to the indicators that were ungraded. ? 2018","article; child; clinical article; controlled study; female; fitness; government; health promotion; human; investment; juvenile; male; nutrition; physical activity; prevalence; public health; South Korea; statistics"
"High circulating follistatin-like protein 1 as a biomarker of a metabolically unhealthy state",2019,"The inflammatory biomarkers that fully characterize the metabolically unhealthy (MU) state-which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-remain unclear. Recent studies suggest follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) could be used as a biomarker for inflammation and CVD, however there is little information on FSTL1 levels in the MU state. We aimed to evaluate the associations between FSTL1, the presence of MU state and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated FSTL1 levels and their relationship with the presence of MU state and coronary artery plaques in 230 Korean patients. Significant increase in FSTL1 levels was observed in subjects with MU state (p = 0.020), but not those with obesity state according to body mass index criteria (p = 0.790). After adjusting for confounders, the odd ratio (OR) for the MU state among patients in the highest FSTL1 tertile (T3) was higher in comparison with the lowest tertile (T1) (OR = 3.60, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.20-10.83). In a subgroup (n = 66), FSTL1 levels were also marginally higher in patients with plaques (p = 0.098). The OR for plaque presence in patients with T3 was significantly higher in comparison with T1 after adjusting for confounders (OR = 12.51, 95% CI = 1.15-135.73). Plasma FSTL1 may be a useful biomarker for the risk of MU state and CVD. ?

"Longitudinal Effects of Body Mass Index and Self-Esteem on Adjustment From Early to Late Adolescence: A Latent Growth Model",2019,"Background: Mental and physical development during adolescence is a factor that may affect quality of life in adulthood. Purpose: The aims of this study were to investigate the developmental trajectories of body mass index (BMI), self-esteem, and adjustment among students from early to late adolescence and to examine the longitudinal relationships among these variables. Methods: Data from 2006 to 2012 were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study. Of the initial sample of 521 students, 487 completed a validated questionnaire measuring BMI, self-esteem, and adjustment. Latent growth curve modeling analyses were conducted to examine the relationships among the variables. Results: Univariate linear growth models showed a significant increase in BMI and significant declines in both self-esteem and adjustment across three time points from childhood to adolescence. The goodness of fit of the multivariate conditioned model supported the validity of the proposed longitudinal model (comparative fit index =.93, root mean square error of approximation =.08). Change in BMI was significantly linked with change in adjustment (β =.18, p <.05) but not with change in self-esteem, whereas change in self-esteem exerted a statistically significant effect on change in adjustment (β =.47, p <.001). Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Our findings indicate that BMI and self-esteem are key determinants of student adjustment in school settings. Therefore, future health education interventions should focus on enhancing the positive physical and mental self-concepts of students, which should improve health and social behavior among students and subsequently afford a better quality of life for these students in adulthood.

"Herbal medicine for post-stroke anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2019,"The study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine (HM) for post-stroke anxiety (PSA). Through comprehensive searches, twenty randomized controlled trials were included. Meta-analysis showed that compared to the HM group, the conventional pharmacotherapy group showed significantly lower Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA) score after 1 week of treatment, but not after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment, and higher HAMA score after 8 weeks and 3 months of treatment. Meanwhile, compared to the conventional pharmacotherapy alone group, the HM plus conventional pharmacotherapy group showed significantly better results in HAMA score after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment. HM group was associated with lower incidence of adverse events. Current evidence suggests that HM or HM plus conventional pharmacotherapy may be safe and effective in PSA patients within a certain time period. However, due to limited strength of evidence, definite conclusions are not possible. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","herbaceous agent; anxiety; cerebrovascular accident; chemistry; herbal medicine; human; medicinal plant; meta analysis; phytotherapy; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); therapy; Anxiety; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke"
"Pathogenetic implications of early growth response 1 in Ewing sarcoma",2019,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most common primary malignant bone tumour, mainly occurs in children and adolescents, and has an overwhelming mortality. Despite extensive studies, few effective oncogenic signals have been described. Therefore, it is crucial to exploit novel pathognomonic factors and targetable biomarkers for ES patients. Based on previous studies, we speculate that insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), which is upregulated by early growth response 1 (EGR1), may play a pivotal role in strengthening the downward transmission of IGF1 cascades. Therefore, in this study, we concentrated on determining the pathogenetic contribution of EGR1 in diverse ES cells. This report is the first to study the pathogenic role of EGR1 in ES. ES cells were cultured and transfected with Stealth RNAi human EGR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or negative control. Cell proliferation and invasion potential were measured. mRNA and protein expression of EGR1, IGF1R, and EWS-FLI1 also were assessed. In all EGR1 siRNA-transfected cells (SK-ES-1, RD-ES, and HS863.T), cell proliferation and invasive potential decreased significantly in EGR1 siRNA-transfected ES cells. mRNA and protein expression for EGR1, IGF1R, and EWS-FLI1 were also significantly reduced. In conclusion, EGR1 upregulated IGF1R expression and enhanced the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. The EWS-FLI1/EGR1/IGF1R cascade combined with the previously confirmed pathways can form a speculative circuit, implicating positive feedback for tumourigenesis in ES. Therefore, EGR1 inhibitors are expected to be useful for the treatment of ES by preventing oncogenic IGF1/IGF1R expression. ? 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia","early growth response factor 1; fusion protein; messenger RNA; small interfering RNA; early growth response factor 1; EGR1 protein, human; IGF1R protein, human; somatomedin C receptor; Article; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; embryonic stem cell; Ewing sarcoma; Ewing sarcoma cell line; genetic transfection; HS863.T cell line; priority journal; protein expression; RD-ES cell line; SK-ES-1 cell line; upregulation; bone tumor; cell motion; cell survival; Ewing sarcoma; female; fibroblast; gene expression regulation; human; male; metabolism; pathology; physiology; tumor cell line; Bone Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Female; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Sarcoma, Ewing"

"BMP-4 enhances epithelial mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell properties of breast cancer cells via Notch signaling",2019,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and Notch signaling play important roles in tumorigenesis in various organs and tissues, including the breast. BMP-4 enhanced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell properties in both mammary epithelial cell line and breast carcinoma cell line. BMP-4 increased the expression of EMT biomarkers, such as fibronectin, laminin, N-cadherin, and Slug. BMP-4 also activated Notch signaling in these cells and increased the sphere forming efficiency of the non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. In addition, BMP-4 upregulated the sphere forming efficiency, colony formation efficiency, and the expression of cancer stem cell markers, such as Nanog and CD44, in the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. Inhibition of Notch signaling downregulated EMT and stem cell properties induced by BMP-4. Down-regulation of Smad4 using siRNA impaired the BMP-4-induced activation of Notch signaling, as well as the BMP-4-mediated EMT. These results suggest that EMT and stem cell properties are increased in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells through the activation of Notch signaling in a Smad4-dependent manner in response to BMP-4. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Effect of aruncus dioicus var. Kamtschaticus extract on neurodegeneration improvement: Ameliorating role in cognitive disorder caused by high-fat diet induced obesity",2019,"This study was performed to estimate the possibility of using an ethyl acetate fraction from Aruncus dioicus var. kamtschaticus (EFAD) on metabolic syndrome that is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). It was demonstrated that EFAD suppresses lipid accumulation and improves insulin resistance (IR) caused by Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in in-vitro experiments using the 3T3- L1 cell. In in-vivo tests, C57BL/6 mice were fed EFAD at 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight (BW) for four weeks after the mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce obesity. EFAD significantly suppressed the elevation of BW and improved impaired glucose tolerance in obese mice. Additionally, this study showed that EFAD has an ameliorating effect on obesity-induced cognitive disorder with behavioral tests. The effect of EFAD on peripheral-IR improvement was confirmed by serum analysis and western blotting in peripheral tissues. Additionally, EFAD showed an ameliorating effect on HFD-induced oxidative stress, impaired cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are interrelated symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer’s disease and central nervous system (CNS)-IR in brain tissue. Furthermore, we confirmed that EFAD improves CNS-IR by confirming the IR-related factors in brain tissue. Consequently, this study suggests the possibility of using EFAD for the prevention of neurodegeneration by improving metabolic syndrome that is caused by HFD. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Carrier-free nanoparticles of cathepsin B-cleavable peptide-conjugated doxorubicin prodrug for cancer targeting therapy",2019,"Cancer nanomedicine using nanoparticle-based delivery systems has shown outstanding promise in recent decades for improving anticancer treatment. However, limited targeting efficiency, low drug loading efficiency and innate toxicity of nanoparticles have caused severe problems, leaving only a few available in the clinic. Here, we newly developed carrier-free nanoparticles of cathepsin B-cleavable peptide (Phe-Arg-Arg-Gly; FRRG)-conjugated doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug (FRRG-DOX) that formed a stable nanoparticle structure with an average diameter of 213 nm in aqueous condition. The carrier-free nanoparticles of FRRG-DOX induced cytotoxicity against cathepsin B-overexpressed tumor cells whereas the toxicity was minimized in normal cells. In particular, the FRRG-DOX nanoparticles showed the successful tumor-targeting ability and enhanced therapeutic efficiency in human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) tumor-bearing mice via enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Furthermore, FRRG-DOX nanoparticles did not present any severe toxicity, such as non-specific cell death and cardiac toxicity, in normal tissues due to minimal expression of cathepsin B. This carrier-free nanoparticles of FRRG-DOX can solve the unavoidable problems of current nanomedicine, such as lower targeting efficiency, toxicity of nanoparticles themselves, and difficulty in mass production that are fatally caused by natural and synthetic nano-sized carriers. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cell death; Cytotoxicity; Diseases; Efficiency; Mammals; Medical nanotechnology; Nanoparticles; Peptides; Toxicity; Tumors; Anticancer treatment; Aqueous condition; Drug-loading efficiency; Enhanced permeation and retentions; Nanoparticle structures; Prodrugs; Therapeutic efficiency; Tumor targeting; Targeted drug delivery; cathepsin B; chlormethine; creatine kinase; doxorubicin; nanoparticle; peptide; prodrug; troponin I; troponin T; A-549 cell line; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood sampling; cancer therapy; cardiotoxicity; cell death; cell surface; colon adenocarcinoma; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; disease severity; DNA helix; DNA structure; drug conjugation; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug synthesis; drug targeting; fluorescence imaging; HT-29 cell line; in vitro study; in vivo study; induced pluripotent stem cell; male; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; nanomedicine; nonhuman; priority journal; survival rate; transmission electron microscopy; tumor cell; tumor model; tumor volume; Western blotting"
"Diffusion tensor imaging of the sciatic nerve in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type I patients: a prospective case–control study",2019,"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and cross-sectional area (CSA) can differentiate between the sciatic nerve of Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease type I (demyelinating form) patients and that of controls. Methods: This prospective comparison study included 18 CMT type I patients and 18 age/sex-matched volunteers. Magnetic resonance imaging including DTI and axial T2-weighted Dixon sequence was performed for each subject. Region of interest analysis was independently performed by two radiologists on each side of the sciatic nerve at four levels: hamstring tendon origin (level 1), lesser trochanter of the femur (level 2), gluteus maximus tendon insertion (level 3), and mid-femur (level 4). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated. The CSA of the sciatic nerve bundle was measured using axial water-only image at each level. Comparisons of DTI parameters between the two groups were performed using the two-sample t test and Mann–Whitney U test. Interobserver agreement analysis was also conducted. Results: Interobserver agreement was excellent for all DTI parameter analyses. FA was significantly lower at all four levels in CMT patients than controls. RD, MD, and CSA were significantly higher at all four levels in CMT patients. AD was significantly higher at level 2 in CMT patients. Conclusion: DTI assessment of the sciatic nerve is reproducible and can discriminate the demyelinating nerve pathology of CMT type I patients from normal nerves. The CSA of the sciatic nerve is also a potential parameter for diagnosing nerve abnormality in CMT type I patients. Key Points: ? Diffusion tensor imaging parameters of the sciatic nerve at proximal to mid-femur level revealed significant differences between the Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease patients and controls. ? The cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve was significantly larger in the Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease patients. ? Interobserver agreement was excellent (intraclass coefficient > 0.8) for all diffusion tensor imaging parameter analyses. ? 2019, European Society of Radiology.","peripheral myelin protein 22; adult; Article; axial diffusivity; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; echo planar imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; genetic analysis; hamstring tendon; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; human; image quality; interrater reliability; lesser trochanter; male; mean diffusivity; physical examination; priority journal; prospective study; radial diffusivity; sciatic nerve; signal noise ratio; anisotropy; case control study; diagnostic imaging; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; observer variation; sciatic nerve; young adult; Adult; Anisotropy; Case-Control Studies; Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Male; Observer Variation; Prospective Studies; Sciatic Nerve; Young Adult"
"Factors affecting Korean physician job satisfaction",2019,"This study examines job satisfaction of physicians in Korea and investigates factors affecting their satisfaction. The majority of the past studies tend to cover few minor factors— including stress and occupation professionality or insufficient scale of respondents in particular regions—thus leading to restricted explanations on job satisfaction of the overall physician pool in Korea. This study examines the level of job satisfaction of physicians in Korea and factors affecting their satisfaction by using the ‘2016 Korean Physician Survey (KPS)’ data which included all physicians in Korea. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted in this study in order to identify the factors affecting job satisfaction of physicians in terms of care environment attributes. These attributes included autonomy for care delivery, colleagues/staff/patient relations, income, healthcare resources, social reputation, personal leisure time, administration, restrictions and regulations, and work hours and loads. For the ordinal logistic regression analysis, general socio-demographic attributes, such as gender, age, specialty, job position, type of affiliated healthcare organization, working region, and length of service were controlled beforehand. The result of our measures, the affecting factors of job satisfaction for physicians, include being able to; maintain positive relations with patients through adequate time for consultation and necessary healthcare, have the autonomy to make clinical decisions, have healthy relations with peers and staff, obtain respect from family and society, work in an environment with desirable income and have adequate health resources, and have appropriate work hours and loads for those who facilitate high-quality care. Creating an environment in which physicians can focus on patient-oriented healthcare will contribute to promoting national healthcare. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Cancer upregulated gene 2 (CUG2), a novel oncogene, promotes stemness-like properties via the NPM1-TGF-β signaling axis",2019,"Our previous study reported that cancer upregulated gene (CUG)2, a novel oncogene, induces both faster cell migration and anti-cancer drug resistance. We thus wonder whether CUG2 also induces stemness, a characteristic of cancer stem cells (CSCs)and further examine the molecular mechanism of this phenotype. To test that CUG2 induces stemness, we examined expression of stemness-related factors. Overexpression of CUG2 enhanced expression levels of stemness-related factors in human lung carcinoma A549 and immortalized bronchial BEAS-2B cells. Consequently, CUG2 increased cellular spherical cluster forming ability. Overexpression of CUG2 also induced tumor formation in xenotransplanted nude mice whereas transplantation of control cells failed to, implying that CUG2 possesses malignant tumorigenic potential. We paid attention to nucleophosmin (NPM1)for its known interaction with CUG2. Suppression of NPM1 hindered the CUG2-mediated stemness-like phenotypes and diminished TGF-β transcriptional activity and signaling. TGF-β increased stemness-like phenotypes in the control cells whereas TGF-β inhibitor blocked induction of the phenotypes, indicating that NPM1 is required for CUG2-mediated stemness-like phenotypes through TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, the suppression of Smad- and non-Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling pathways also prevented CUG2 from inducing stemness-like phenotypes. Altogether, we suggest that the novel CUG2 oncogene promotes cellular transformation and stemness, mediated by nuclear NPM1 protein and TGF-β signaling. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","nucleophosmin; Smad protein; transforming growth factor beta; A-549 cell line; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; BEAS-2B cell line; cancer stem cell; cancer upregulated gene 2; carcinogenesis; cell transformation; colony forming unit; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme repression; gene overexpression; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein interaction; TGF beta signaling; tumor xenograft"
"Eight-year results of transtibial nonanatomic single-bundle versus double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Clinical, radiologic outcomes and survivorship",2019,"Purpose: To compare the long term outcomes of transtibial nonanatomic single-bundle (SB) and double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: Between January 2008 and September 2010, we retrospectively evaluated 377 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction and who were available at 8 years of follow-up. Patients who received transtibial nonanatomic SB ACL reconstruction (n = 263) were assigned to group SB and DB ACL reconstruction (n = 114) to group DB. The patients were assessed with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Lysholm scores, Tegner activity score, knee joint stability tests, and patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) findings using the Kellgren–Lawrence (K-L) classification. Contralateral ACL (CACL) injury was also evaluated. Results: Thirteen patients underwent revision ACL surgery during the follow-up. Ultimately, 256 patients in group SB and 108 patients in group DB were available at the 8-year follow-up. At final follow-up, the IKDC subjective score (p = 0.04) and Lysholm score (p = 0.02) showed significantly superior results in group DB compared to group SB. However, there was no significant difference of Tegner activity score (p = 0.30), range of motion (p = 0.81), and knee joint stability tests. There was significant progression of patellofemoral OA between preoperative and final follow-up in ipsilateral knee of both groups but not significant progression in contralateral knee. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups at the follow-up. There were 2.7% ipsilateral ACL graft failure in group SB, compared with 5.2% in group DB (p = 0.12) and 6.4% CACL tear in group SB, compared with 5.2% in group DB (p = 0.65). The mean survivorship of ACL graft was 9.47 ± 0.05 years (95% confidence interval (CI), 9.36–9.58) in group SB and 9.87 ± 0.16 years (95% CI, 9.54–10.20) in group DB, and there was no significant difference (p = 0.25). Conclusion: DB ACL reconstruction resulted in significantly better clinical IKDC subjective scores and Lysholm scores. However, most of the differences in clinical scores were small, and the clinical relevance of this difference is unknown. In addition, there was no significant difference in Tegner activity score, knee joint stability tests, patellofemoral OA, and survivor rate of the ACL graft and CACL after reconstruction after a minimum of 8-year follow-up.

"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients enrolled in clinical trials compared with those of patients outside clinical trials in advanced gastric cancer",2019,"Aims: Participating in clinical trials could give cancer patients potential benefits such as experimental treatment, meticulous follow-up, and management of toxicities. We hypothesized that patients participating in clinical trials would achieve better survival outcomes than those not enrolled in trials. We assessed whether the trial effect can improve survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer patients who received palliative chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2012. All patients in this study received fluoropyrimidine and platinum as the first-line palliative chemotherapy. Patients participating in clinical trials were matched 1:1 with patients not enrolled in trial based on propensity-score. Results: A total of 229 patients were identified, 83 (36.2%) among them participated in 14 clinical trials for advanced gastric cancer. The number of patients enrolled in phase I, II and III trials were 10, 54 and 19, respectively. The median overall survival of the total study patients was 13.0?months (95% confidence interval, 10.7–15.3 months). In the propensity-score matched population, a total of 78 matched pairs of patients were generated. The median overall survival of the 78 patients who participated in the clinical trials was 6 months longer than that of patients not enrolled in trials, although this benefit was marginally significant (15 months vs 9 months, hazard ratio, 0.709; p?=?0.068). Participation in clinical trials was a significant factor to predict better overall survival in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.533, p?=?0.001). Conclusion: Trial effect may contribute to prolongation of overall survival in patients who participate in clinical trials for advanced gastric cancer. Physicians may discuss trial effect to encourage participation in clinical trials. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","capecitabine; fluoropyrimidine; fluorouracil; platinum; antineoplastic agent; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; clinical feature; clinical outcome; clinical study; confidence interval; controlled study; female; hazard ratio; human; major clinical study; male; metastasis; multivariate analysis; overall survival; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; stomach cancer; clinical trial (topic); comparative study; middle aged; mortality; pathology; patient participation; patient selection; proportional hazards model; stomach tumor; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Participation; Patient Selection; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Stomach Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome"
"Infliximab treatment for intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant kawasaki disease: A multicenter study in Korea",2019,"Background and Objectives: We investigated the status of infliximab use in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)-resistant Kawasaki disease (KD) patients and the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) according to treatment regimens. Methods: Between March 2010 and February 2017, 16 hospitals participated in this study. A total of 102 (32.3±19.9 months, 72 males) who received infliximab at any time after first IVIG treatment failure were enrolled. Data were retrospectively collected using a questionnaire. Results: Subjects were divided into two groups according to the timing of infliximab administration. Early treatment (group 1) had shorter fever duration (10.5±4.4 days) until infliximab infusion than that in late treatment (group 2) (16.4±4.5 days; p<0.001). We investigated the response rate to infliximab and the incidence of significant CAA (z-score >5). Overall response rate to infliximab was 89/102 (87.3%) and the incidence of significant CAA was lower in group 1 than in group 2 (1/42 [2.4%] vs. 17/60 [28.3%], p<0.001). Conclusions: This study suggests that the early administration of infliximab may reduce the incidence of significant CAA in patients with IVIG-resistant KD. However, further prospective randomized studies with larger sample sizes are required. Copyright ? 2019.

"Prospective cohort study of patients with early gastric cancer to detect prodromal Parkinson disease (EGC-PPD): A study protocol and baseline characteristics",2019,"The aim of the current study is to determine the predictive value of alpha-synuclein (AS) aggregation in stomach surgical specimens in combination with selected clinical prodromal markers (CPMs) for development of Parkinson disease (PD) in a normal population. We organized a prospective, long-term, clinicopathologic cohort of patients without neurological diseases who received a radical operation for early gastric cancer (EGC) between ages 50 and 65 years. The participants will be followed for up to 10 years and screened for CPMs and motor symptoms by annual telephone interview. If a participant reports one or more positive answers to screening questions about motor symptoms, they will be regarded as having possible parkinsonism. A movement disorder specialist will then evaluate whether that participant has PD. The primary outcome is the development of PD during the 10-year follow-up. The recruitment period has been completed, and the baseline clinical characteristics are compared between participants with and without possible parkinsonism. A total of 718 participants (mean age: 60.1 ± 5.9) was recruited. The motor symptom screening questionnaire revealed 65 patients with possible parkinsonism (9.0%) at baseline. Patients with possible parkinsonism answered that they had subjective loss of smell more than those without parkinsonism at the time of recruitment (18.5% vs 8.3%) and operation (15.4% vs 6.3%). However, the objective odor discrimination test showed no difference between patients with and without possible parkinsonism. Baseline assessments revealed a sufficient number of patients with possible parkinsonism, which will be confirmed as PD or not in subsequent follow-up visits. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","alpha synuclein; adult; Article; cohort analysis; constipation; controlled study; disease association; early cancer; female; gastrectomy; high risk patient; human; human tissue; hyposmia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; protein aggregation; protein function; risk assessment; risk factor; stomach cancer; aged; early cancer diagnosis; follow up; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; procedures; prodromal symptom; stomach tumor; Aged; Cohort Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Prodromal Symptoms; Prospective Studies; Stomach Neoplasms"
"Effects of eleutherococcus extract mixture on endochondral bone formation in rats",2019,"Eleutherococcus extract mixture (EEM) is an herbal mixture of dried stem of Eleutherococcus sessiliflorus and germinated barley, which has been highly effective, in previous screening and among the traditional medicines to tonify innate qi and acquired qi, respectively. In this study, we investigate the effects of EEM on endochondral bone formation. Female adolescent rats were given EEM, growth hormone or vehicle for 10 days. Tetracycline was intraperitoneally injected to light the fluorescent band 72 h before sacrifice to determine endochondral bone formation. In order to evaluate endocrine or paracrine/autocrine mechanisms, expressions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), or bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) were evaluated after EEM administration in liver or growth plate (GP). EEM oral administration significantly increased endochondral bone formation and proliferative and hypertrophic zonal heights of tibial GP. EEM also upregulated hepatic IGF1 and IGFBP3 mRNA expressions, and IGF1 and BMP2 expressions in GP. Taken together, EEM increases endochondral bone formation through stimulating proliferation and hypertrophy with upregulation of hepatic IGF1 and IGFBP3 expressions. Considering immunohistochemical studies, the effect of EEM may be due to increased local IGF1 and BMP2 expression in GP, which may be considered growth hormone (GH)-dependent endocrine and autocrine/paracrine pathways. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Comparative evaluation of the polynomial and spline fitting methods for the B0 correction of CEST MRI data acquired from human brains",2019,"To compare the magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) values calculated with polynomial and spline fitting methods for B0 correction of the full Z-spectrum images, full Z-spectrum data was obtained from 12 elderly healthy subjects by using a 3D segmented EPI sequence, as well as from 17 other subjects by using a 3D GRASE sequence with two different 3 T MRI systems. The full Z-spectra were analyzed to map MTRasym with three different fitting methods, namely the 10th and 14th polynomial and spline methods, for B0 correction. The MTRasym values for each offset frequency were compared among the three fitting methods. For the 3D segmented EPI sequence, the MTRasym values significantly differed among the three fitting methods at 0.86, 2.14, 3.00, and 3.43 ppm offset frequencies. For the 3D GRASE sequence, the MTRasym values obtained by 14th polynomial and spline fitting methods significantly differed at arbitrary offset frequencies. The MTRasym values are sensitive to the fitting methods of B0 correction and to the type of acquisition sequence for the full Z-spectrum. Therefore, an appropriate fitting method should be used to analyze the full Z-spectrum obtained from the brain. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Magnetic resonance imaging; full Z-spectrum; MTR asymmetry; Polynomial fittings; sequence type; Spline fitting; Polynomials"
"Data-driven prognostic features of cognitive trajectories in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairments 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1103 Clinical Sciences 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences 1701 Psychology",2019,"Background: Although amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is generally considered to be a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease, patients with aMCI show heterogeneous patterns of progression. Moreover, there are few studies investigating data-driven cognitive trajectory in aMCI. We therefore classified patients with aMCI based on their cognitive trajectory, measured by clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SOB). Then, we compared the clinical and neuroimaging features among groups classified by cognitive trajectory. Methods: We retrospectively recruited 278 patients with aMCI who underwent three or more timepoints of neuropsychological testing. They also had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including structured three-dimensional volume images. Cortical thickness was measured using surface-based methods. We performed trajectory analyses to classify our aMCI patients according to their progression and investigate their cognitive trajectory using CDR-SOB. Results: Trajectory analyses showed that patients with aMCI were divided into three groups: stable (61.8%), slow decliner (31.7%), and fast decliner (6.5%). Changes throughout a mean follow-up duration of 3.7 years in the CDR-SOB for the subgroups of stable/slow/fast decliners were 1.3-, 6.4-, and 12-point increases, respectively. Decliners were older and carried apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotypes more frequently than stable patients. Compared with the stable group, decliners showed a higher frequency of aMCI patients with both visual and verbal memory dysfunction, late stage aMCI, and multiple domain dysfunction. In addition, compared with the stable group, the slow decliners showed cortical thinning predominantly in bilateral parietotemporal areas, while the fast decliners showed cortical thinning predominantly in bilateral frontotemporal areas. Both decliner groups showed worse cognitive function in attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal/executive domains than the stable group. Conclusions: Our data-driven trajectory analysis provides new insights into heterogeneous cognitive trajectories of aMCI and further suggests that baseline clinical and neuroimaging profiles might predict aMCI patients with poor prognosis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","apolipoprotein E4; aged; Article; attention; brain region; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognition; comparative study; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); disease classification; disease course; disease duration; female; follow up; genotype; human; illness trajectory; language ability; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; verbal memory; visual memory"
"Characterization of H2S releasing properties of various H2S donors utilizing microplate cover-based colorimetric assay",2019,"In this study, we characterized the potential H 2 S-releasing properties of seven different H 2 S donors, including sodium sulfide (Na 2 S), sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), diallyl trisulfide (DATS), sodium thiosulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 3 ), morpholin-4-ium 4-methoxyphenyl-morpholino-phosphinodithioate (GYY4137), and Lawesson's reagent, in three assay solutions, phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffered saline (HBS, pH 7.6), and cell growth media (GM), utilizing our microplate cover-based colorimetric assay. For quantitative analyses of H 2 S-releasing characteristics of the various donors, we evaluated four parameters, maximum concentration of H 2 S at the steady state (C max ), the time required to reach half of C max (t 1/2 ), maximum releasing rate of H 2 S (R max ), and time at H 2 S (t r-max ). The results showed that the H 2 S-releasing kinetics of each H 2 S donor were dependent on the type of assay solution. In particular, the addition of GSH to DATS in GM released the fastest and highest amounts of H 2 S among the four H 2 S donors in the following order: DATS &gt; DADS &gt; Na 2 S ~ NaHS. The H 2 S-releasing characteristics of the H 2 S donors were well-matched with cell viability results of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Therefore, the microplate cover-based colorimetric assay will be a useful tool for accurate and efficient measurements of H 2 S-releasing dynamics. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","4 (2 hydroxyethyl) 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid; diallyl disulfide; diallyl trisulfide; hydrogen sulfide; sodium hydrosulfide; sodium sulfide; sodium thiosulfate; unclassified drug; antiproliferative activity; Article; cell viability; colorimetry; controlled study; cytotoxicity assay; human; human cell; kinetics; maximum concentration; MTT assay; pH; priority journal; quantitative analysis; steady state"
"The impact of primary tumor location in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: A korean cancer study group co12-04 study",2019,"Background/Aims: Colorectal cancer is associated with different anatomical, biological, and clinical characteristics. We determined the impact of the primary tumor location in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: Demographic data and clinical information were collected from 1,115 patients from the Republic of Korea, who presented with mCRC between January 2009 and December 2011, using web-based electronic case report forms. Associations between the primary tumor location and the patient’s clinical characteristics were assessed, and factors inf luencing overall survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: Of the 1,115 patients recruited to the study, 244 (21.9%) had right colon cancer, 483 (43.3%) had left colon cancer, and 388 (34.8%) had rectal cancer. Liver and lung metastases occurred more frequently in patients with left colon and rectal cancer (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively), while peritoneal and ovarian metastases occurred more frequently in patients with right and left colon cancer (p < 0.001 and p = 0.031, respec-tively). The median overall survival of patients with tumors originating in the right colon was significantly shorter than that of patients whose tumors had originated in the left colon or rectum (13.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.0 to 15.5] vs. 18.0 months [95% CI, 16.3 to 19.7] or 19.9 months [95% CI, 18.5 to 21.3], respectively; p = 0.003). Tumor resection, the number of metastatic sites, and primary tumor location correlated with overall survival in the univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Primary tumor location influences the metastatic sites and prognosis of patients with mCRC. ? 2019, Korean Association of Internal Medicine.

This paper aims to implement a multiple sequences prediction of a comprehensive indoor air quality index (CIAI) traced by indoor PM2.5, utilizing different structures of recurrent neural networks (RNN). A standard RNN (SRNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) structures were implemented due to their capability of managing sequential, and time-dependent data. Hourly indoor PM2.5 concentration data collected in the D-subway station, South Korea, were utilized for the validation of the proposed method. For the selection of the most suitable predictive model (i.e. SRNN, LSTM, GRU), a point-by-point prediction on the PM2.5 was conducted, demonstrating that the GRU structure outperforms the other RNN structures (RMSE = 21.04 ?g/m3, MAPE = 32.92%, R2 = 0.65). Then, this model is utilized to sequentially predict the concentration and quantify the health risk (i.e. CIAI) at different time lags. For a 6-h time lag, the proposed model exhibited the best performance metric (RMSE = 29.73 ?g/m3, MAPE = 29.52%). Additionally, for the rest of the time lags including 12, 18 and 24 h, achieved an acceptable performance (MAPE = 29–37%). ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","air quality; artificial neural network; concentration (composition); health risk; indoor air; particulate matter; prediction; risk assessment; ambient air; article; health hazard; human; particulate matter; prediction; quantitative analysis; rest; risk assessment; short term memory; South Korea; validation process; air pollutant; analysis; artificial neural network; environmental monitoring; forecasting; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; procedures; railway; risk assessment; standards; South Korea; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Particulate Matter; Railroads; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment"
"Comparison of Vascular Response to Statin Therapy in Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus",2019,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A statin is routinely prescribed to patients with DM. However, whether a statin therapy is equally effective in plaque stabilization in DM patients compared with non-DM patients is unknown. A total of 117 lipid-rich plaques were imaged in 90 patients (54 plaques in 41 DM patients and 63 plaques in 49 non-DM patients) with coronary artery disease, those who were treated with a statin and underwent serial optical coherence tomography imaging were included in this study (mean follow-up period, 362 ± 38 days). The changes in minimum fibrous cap thickness (FCT) and lipid index between baseline and 1-year follow-up were compared between the 2 groups. Minimum FCT increased and lipid index decreased with statin therapy in both groups. No significant differences were observed in percent changes of minimum FCT (p = 0.796) and lipid index (p = 0.336) between DM and non-DM patients. Statin therapy induced a significant increase in FCT and a significant decrease in lipid index in both groups. Vascular response to statin therapy was similar between the 2 groups irrespective of DM status. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","hemoglobin A1c; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; biological marker; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipid; adult; Article; blood vessel parameters; blood vessel reactivity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; female; fibrous cap thickness; follow up; human; intravascular ultrasound; major clinical study; male; optical coherence tomography; priority journal; prospective study; reproducibility; smoking; volumetry; blood; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; coronary blood vessel; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic imaging; dose response; drug effect; interventional ultrasonography; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; three dimensional imaging; treatment outcome; vascular resistance; Biomarkers; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Diabetes Mellitus; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Vascular Resistance"
"Natural products and acute myeloid leukemia: A review highlighting mechanisms of action",2019,"Recent findings have shown great potential of alternative interventions such as immunotherapy and natural products for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to review the anti-AML effect of various natural compounds. Natural compounds were classified into five groups: alkaloids, carotenoids, nitrogen-containing compounds, organosulfur compounds or phenolics based on each compound’s chemical properties. Fifty-eight studies were collected and reviewed in this article. Phenolics are the most abundant group to have an apoptotic effect over AML cells, while other groups have also shown significant apoptotic effects. Some compounds induced apoptosis by regulating unique mechanism like human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) or laminin receptor (67LR), while others modified caspases, poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and p53. Further study is required to identify side-effects of potent compounds and the synergistic effects of combination of two or more natural compounds or existing conventional anti- AML drugs to treat this dreadful disease. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The use of pattern differentiation in WHO-registered traditional Chinese medicine trials – A systematic review",2019,"Introduction: Pattern differentiation is a critical component for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis and treatment. However, the issue of whether pattern differentiation is appropriately applied in TCM interventional trials, including Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) interventions and non-herbal TCM interventions, is unclear. The aim of this study was to i) systematically review the current status of pattern differentiation used in WHO-registered clinical trials for different types of TCM interventions; and ii) provide suggestions for improving the use of pattern differentiation in future clinical trial design. Methods: The World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) database was searched for all TCM interventional trials registered up to 31 December 2017. In this systematic review trials with a TCM pattern differentiation in their design were included. Descriptive statistics were collated to demonstrate the characteristics of pattern differentiation applied for different TCM interventional trials. Results: Among 2955 TCM interventional trials registered during 1999–2017, 376 (12.7%) trials included pattern differentiation. Of 376 trials, the use of pattern differentiation was identified in; –the title (30.6%), objective (50.5%), participants inclusion (100%), outcomes (43.6%) and study background (12.5%). Further, 85.4% reported the specific name of the TCM intervention, 10.6% provided the intervention's targeted pattern, 83.8% reported the specific name of the TCM pattern, 7.2% presented diagnostic criteria for the pattern studied, and 19.1% adopted a pattern-related outcome as primary outcome for evaluation. Conclusion: The reporting and application of pattern differentiation in TCM trials were inadequate and confusing, which was mainly due to lack of clarity regarding study design, objectives, diagnostic criteria and outcomes. ? 2019","adult; article; Chinese medicine; clinical trial (topic); diagnostic test accuracy study; differentiation; female; human; human experiment; intervention study; male; outcome assessment; statistics; systematic review; World Health Organization"
"Ammonium lauryl sulfate-induced apoptotic cell death may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by caveolin-1",2019,"A recent epidemiological study suggested that chronic exposure to cleaning detergents significantly reduced lung function in consumers. In this study, we identified the toxic mechanism of ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), the most common detergent in consumer products, using alveolar macrophage cells. In preliminary tests, cell viability sharply decreased between 40 and 200 μg/mL, thus we determined doses of 10, 20, and 50 μg/mL for further study. When treated at a 50 μg/mL for 24 h, cell viability was 67.7 ± 3.4% of the control, and autophagosome-like vacuoles and a number of double membranes surrounding damaged mitochondria were observed in the cytosol. Intracellular ROS, the ATP amount, ER volume, acid cell compartments and mitochondrial potential rapidly reduced with dose, whereas the release of LDH and apoptotic bodies dramatically increased. Additionally, multiple cell death pathways were activated following exposure to ALS, and the expression of caveolin-1, p-Acetyl CoA carboxylase, p21, and p-ERK were greatly inhibited. Moreover, the secretion of inflammatory mediators and expression of innate- and adaptive-immune response-related proteins were remarkably reduced. Meanwhile, the secretion of TGF-β was enhanced. Therefore, we conclude that ALS-induced apoptosis may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by the inhibition of caveolin-1, and that chronic pulmonary exposure to ALS may cause adverse health effects such as cancer and fibrosis by impairing the host's pulmonary immune system. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; adenosine triphosphate; caveolin 1; dodecylsulfate ammonium; lactate dehydrogenase; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein p21; reactive oxygen metabolite; transforming growth factor beta; Cav1 protein, mouse; caveolin 1; detergent; dodecyl sulfate; dodecyl sulfate sodium; adaptive immunity; animal cell; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; cell compartmentalization; cell count; cell culture; cell vacuole; cell viability; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug exposure; enzyme inhibition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; innate immunity; lung alveolus macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein secretion; RNA isolation; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; apoptosis; cell line; cell survival; drug effect; metabolism; mitochondrion; pathology; Animals; Apoptosis; Caveolin 1; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Detergents; Mice; Mitochondria; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate"
"Cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation programs for hospitalized patients: a systematic review",2019,"Objective: This systematic review examined the characteristics of published cost-effectiveness analyses of inpatient smoking cessation programs and assessed the methodological quality of the selected studies, to provide policymakers with economic evidence for this type of program. Methods: A literature search was undertaken using a relevant database by three investigators. Only full economic evaluations with results in the form of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were included. Costs were adjusted to 2016 US dollars using the Gross Domestic Product deflator and purchasing power parities. The British Medical Journal checklist was utilized to appraise the methodological quality of the included studies. Results: Nine articles were ultimately selected. The inpatient smoking cessation programs appeared to be a highly cost-effective intervention according to the recommended cost-effectiveness thresholds by the World Health Organization or individual studies. The highest ICERs among the selected studies were $5593 per additional quit, $10,550 per life year gained, and $5680 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Conclusions: This study provides robust evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation programs for hospitalized patients. In addition, the results indicated that the degree of cost-effectiveness of the inpatient smoking cessation program might not be related to either the components of the program or methodological variations in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Policymakers should provide hospitals with resources and strong incentives to promote wider implementation of the smoking cessation program. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; checklist; cost effectiveness analysis; female; gross national product; hospital patient; human; male; medical literature; parity; purchasing; quality adjusted life year; smoking cessation program; systematic review; World Health Organization"

"Symptom distress and depression in patients with recurrent gynecologic cancer undergoing chemotherapy: Mediating effect of resilience [??????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??: ???? ????]",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate resilience and its mediating effect on the association between symptom distress and depression among recurrent gynecologic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A purposive sample of 113 patients diagnosed with recurrent gynecologic cancer was recruited. A cross-sectional survey design was used. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire from September to November 2014. Results: There was a positive correlation between symptom distress and depression. Negative correlational relationships were found between symptom distress and resilience and between resilience and depression. Resilience showed a partial mediating effect between symptom distress and depression (Z=2.34, p=.019). Conclusion: The results suggest that the negative effects of symptom distress on depression can be reduced by improving the resilience. Further, it is necessary to explore the multidimensional constructs of resilience and develop intervention programs that can improve the resilience among recurrent gynecologic cancer patients. ? 2019 Korean Society of Adult Nursing.",""
"Protective immunity induced by incorporating multiple antigenic proteins of Toxoplasma gondii into influenza virus-like particles",2019,"Virus-like particle (VLP) as a highly efficient vaccine platform has been used to present single or multiple antigenic protein. In this study, we generated VLPs (multi-antigen VLPs, TG146) in insect cells co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses presenting IMC, ROP18, and MIC8 of Toxoplasma gondii together with influenza matrix protein 1 (M1) as a core protein. We also generated three VLPs expressing IMC, ROP18, or MIC8 together with M1 for combination VLPs (TG1/TG4/TG6). A total of four kinds of VLPs generated were characterized by TEM. Higher number of VLPs particles per μm2 were observed in multi-antigen VLPs compared to combination VLPs. Mice (BALB/c) were intranasually immunized with multi-antigen VLPs or combination VLPs and challenged with T. gondii tachyzoites (GT1) intraperitoneally. Compared to combination VLPs, multi-antigen VLPs showed significantly higher levels of CD4+ T cell, and germinal center B cell responses with reduced apoptosis responses, resulting in significant reduction on parasite burden. These results indicate that higher efficacy of VLPs generated by multi-antigen VLPs can induce significant reduction of parasite burden and better survival of mice than that by combination VLPs, providing important insights into vaccine design strategy for VLPs vaccine expressing multiple antigenic proteins. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"A dietary vegetable, Moringa oleifera leaves (drumstick tree) induced fat cell apoptosis by inhibiting adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes",2019,"M. oleifera belonging to the family Moringaceae is an effective remedy for malnutrition and it's often referred as panacea because it cures more than 300 diseases. It's widely been used by Indians and Africans. In our present study, Moringa oleifera leaf extract (MLE) has been explored for the ability to alleviate adipogenesis and promote apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells. Iso-quercetin was a major component isolated from the leaves of M. oleifera. The anti-obesity and apoptotic effect of iso-quercetin was identified by performing molecular docking studies. The iso-quercetin and MLE showed anti-proliferative activity at the concentration of 4.95 ?g/mL and 280.5 ?g/mL respectively. The expression of adipogenesis related genes were downregulated with increased concentration of MLE treatment and caused the decreased accumulation of triglyceride content. Furthermore, MLE induced apoptosis in adipocyte cells were confirmed by TUNEL, Hoechst and PI staining. The apoptosis pathway related pathway genes such as BAX, BCL2 were also studied. Upon MLE treatment, BAX, a pro-apoptotic protein was up-regulated and BCL2, an anti-apoptotic protein was down-regulated and showed increased activity of caspase 3 indicating that apoptosis of adipocyte cells. Overall, we have demonstrated that the leaves of M. oleifera may reduce adipocyte formation by promoting apoptosis and thus can be considered as functional food for controlling obesity. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Anti-obesity effects of combined extracts of terminalia chebula and phyllanthus emblica (FBF-TC) in matured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and high fat diet-induced obese mice",2019,"Abnormal fat accumulation on the body causes chronic disease known as obesity and is a serious problem in today’s society. We investigated the anti-obesity effects of combined extracts of Terminalia chebula (T) and Phylan-thus emblica (P) (TP; FBF-TC) in vitro and in vivo. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated for 9 days. On the last day of differentiation, Oil red O staining, glycerol release, intracellular cAMP levels, and lipolytic enzymes were measured. Compared to the control, lipid accumulation, and mRNA expressions of PDE3B and Perilipin were significantly decreased in the presence of TP 80 μg/mL. The levels of free glycerol, intracellular cAMP, and mRNA expressions of HSL and ATGL were significantly increased by 139%, 99.5%, 65.6%, and 100.8%, respectively, in the presence of TP 80 μg/mL. In the animal study, C57BL/6J mice were tested for 12 weeks after being separated into eight groups: Normal diet group (ND), high fat diet (HFD) group (C, Control), HFD with 1 g/kg b.w. of catechin group (PC, positive control), HFD with 600 mg/kg b.w. of T or P groups, and HFD with 150, 300, 600 mg/kg b.w. of TP groups. Feeding of HFD for 12 weeks resulted in significant increases in body weight compared to the ND group. FBF-TC groups showed reduced body weight, weight gain, mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, subcutaneous WAT weight, serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels compared to the C group. In conclusion, this study suggests that TP is a novel anti-obesity candidate through its stimulation of lipolysis. ? 2019, Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition. All rights reserved.",""
"Polyphenol-enriched fraction of Vaccinium uliginosum L. Protects selenite-induced cataract formation in the lens of Sprague-Dawley rat pups",2019,"Purpose: As the aging population is increasing, the incidence of age-related cataract is expected to increase globally. The surgical intervention, a treatment for cataract, still has complications and is limited to developed countries. In this study, we investigated whether the polyphenol-enriched fraction of Vaccinium uliginosum L. (FH) prevents cataract formation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat pups. Methods: Sixty rat pups were randomly divided into six groups: CTL, Se, FH40, FH80, FH120, and Cur80. The cataract was induced with subcutaneous injection of sodium selenite (18 μmol/kg bodyweight) on postnatal (P) day 10. All groups, except CTL, were injected with sodium selenite, and the FH40, FH80, and FH120 groups were given gastric intubation with FH40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, and 120 mg/kg on P9, P10, and P11. The Cur80 group was also given gastric intubation with curcumin 80 mg/kg on P9, P10, and P11. All rat pups were euthanized on P30. Results: Lens morphological analysis showed that FH dose-dependently inhibited cataract formation. In the Se group, soluble proteins were insolubilized, and the gene expression of the α-, β-, and γ-crystallins was downregulated. However, FH treatment statistically significantly inhibited insolubilization of soluble proteins and downregulation of the gene expression of the α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. In the Se group, the gene and protein levels of m-calpain were downregulated, which were attenuated with FH treatment. In addition, sodium selenite injection caused reduced antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), glutathione (GSH) depletion, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production in the lens. The administration of FH inhibited sodium selenite–induced oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism of protection against oxidative stress by FH involves NF-E2-related factor (Nrf-2) and hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1). FH treatment inhibited decrease of Nrf-2 in the nucleus fraction and HO-1 in the cytosol fraction. Finally, the FH treatment protected poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) from cleavage, determined with western blotting. Conclusions: FH showed a preventive effect against cataract formation by inhibiting m-calpain-mediated proteolysis and oxidative stress in the lens. These results suggest that FH could be a potential anticataract agent in age-related cataract. ? 2019 Molecular Vision.","alpha crystallin; beta crystallin; bog bilberry extract; calpain; curcumin; gamma crystallin; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; heme oxygenase 1; malonaldehyde; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; plant extract; polyphenol; protein; sodium selenite; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; alpha crystallin; antioxidant; beta crystallin; calpain; eye protein; gamma crystallin; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; heme oxygenase 1; m-calpain; malonaldehyde; Nfe2l2 protein, rat; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; polyphenol; sodium selenite; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biosynthesis; bog bilberry; cataract; cell fractionation; cell nucleus; controlled study; cytosol; dose response; down regulation; enzyme deficiency; eye protection; gene expression regulation; morphology; nonhuman; oxidative stress; perinatal period; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein degradation; protein depletion; rat; solubilization; Sprague Dawley rat; stomach intubation; Western blotting; animal; blueberry; cataract; chemically induced; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; isolation and purification; lens; metabolism; newborn; pathology; alpha-Crystallins; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Antioxidants; beta-Crystallins; Blueberry Plants; Calpain; Cataract; Eye Proteins; gamma-Crystallins; Gene Expression Regulation; Glutathione; Glutathione Peroxidase; Heme Oxygenase-1; Lens, Crystalline; Malondialdehyde; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Oxidative Stress; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; Polyphenols; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium Selenite; Superoxide Dismutase"
"Autophagy in crotonaldehyde-induced endothelial toxicity",2019,"Crotonaldehyde is an extremely toxic α,β-unsaturated aldehyde found in cigarette smoke, and it causes inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Autophagy has been reported to play a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. However, the precise mechanism underlying the role of acute exposure crotonaldehyde in vascular disease development remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of crotonaldehyde-induced autophagy in endothelial cells. Acute exposure to crotonaldehyde decreased cell viability and induced autophagy followed by cell death. In addition, inhibiting the autophagic flux markedly promoted the viability of endothelial cells exposed to high concentrations of crotonaldehyde. Crotonaldehyde activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and pretreatment with inhibitors specific to these kinases showed autophagy inhibition and partial improvement in cell viability. These data show that acute exposure to high concentrations of crotonaldehyde induces autophagy-mediated cell death. These results might be helpful to elucidate the mechanisms underlying crotonaldehyde toxicity in the vascular system and contribute to environmental risk assessment. ? 2019 by the authors.","2-butenal; aldehyde; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; reactive oxygen metabolite; apoptosis; autophagy; cell culture; cell survival; drug effect; endothelium cell; human; metabolism; oxidative stress; signal transduction; Aldehydes; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Oxidative Stress; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction"
"Topological data analysis can extract sub-groups with high incidence rates of Type 2 diabetes",2019,"Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is now a rapidly increasing, worldwide scourge, and the identification of genetic contributors is vital. However, current analyses of multiple, disease-contributing factors, and their combined interactions, remains quite difficult, using traditional approaches. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) shows what shape a data set can have, facilitating clustering analysis, by determining which components are close to each other. Thus, TDA can generate a network, using Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data, revealing the genetic relatedness of specific individuals, and can derive multiple ordered sub-groups, from one with a low patient concentration, to one with a high patient concentration. Since it is widely accepted that T2D pathogenesis is affected by multiple genetic factors, we performed TDA on T2D data from the Korea Association REsource (KARE) project, a population-based, genome-wide association study of the Korean adult population. Since KARE data contains follow-up information about the incidence of T2D, we compared the T2D status of each individual, at baseline, with that of ten years later. For the TDA network-driven sub-groups, ordered by prevalence, we compared the T2D incidence rate, after ten years, for individuals initially without T2D. As a result, we found that the TDA network-driven, ordered subgroups had significantly increased incidence rates, linearly correlated with prevalence (p-value = 0.006914). Our results demonstrate the usefulness of TDA in both identifying genetic contributors (e.g., SNPs), and their interrelationships, in the pathology of complex diseases. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"Factors Causing Prolonged Postoperative Symptoms Despite Absence of Complications After A1 Pulley Release for Trigger Finger",2019,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the incidence and prognostic factors for prolonged postoperative symptoms after open A1 pulley release in patients with trigger finger, despite absence of any complications. Methods: We reviewed 109 patients (78 single-finger involvement, 31 multiple-finger involvement) who underwent open A1 pulley release for trigger finger from 2010 to 2016, with 8 weeks or longer postsurgical follow-up and without postoperative complications. The group had 16 men and 93 women, with mean age of 56 years (range, 21–81 years), and average follow-up period of 24.8 weeks (range, 8.0–127.4 weeks). Prolonged postoperative symptoms were defined as symptoms persisting for longer than 8 weeks after surgery. Factors analyzed for delay in recovery included duration of preoperative symptoms; number of preoperative local corticosteroid injections; preoperative flexion contracture of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint; multiplicity of trigger finger lesions; occupation; presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, other hand disorders like carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain disease, or Dupuytren contracture; and fraying or partial tear of the flexor tendon. Results: Twenty-six fingers (19.3%) showed prolonged postoperative symptoms, with mean time until complete relief being 14.0 ± 6.4 weeks (range, 9–34 weeks). Risk factors associated with prolonged postoperative symptoms included duration of preoperative symptoms, preoperative flexion contracture of the PIP joint, and fraying or partial tear of the flexor tendon. Conclusions: Physicians should consider the duration of preoperative symptoms and preoperative flexion contracture of the PIP joint when deciding timing of surgery for trigger finger patients. In addition, they should explain to patients with a positive history of these factors and in whom flexor tendon injury is found during surgery about the possibility of prolonged postoperative symptoms.

"5-Oxo-1-[(2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9-phenanthrenyl)methyl]-L-proline Inhibits Hepatitis C Virus Entry",2019,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major causative agent of chronic liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The recent development of highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionized the treatment of HCV patients. However, these DAAs are exorbitantly expensive for the majority of HCV patients worldwide. Moreover, these drugs still show genotypic difference in cure rate and have some resistant-associated variants. Tylophorine, a natural compound derived from Tylophora indica plants, is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous growth activities. In the present study, we showed that two tylophorine intermediates, 5-Oxo-1-[(2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9-phenanthrenyl) methyl]-L-proline (O859585) and 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9-phenanthrenecarboxylic acid (T298875), displayed anti-HCV activity with an EC 50 of 38.25 ?M for T298875 and 29.11~35.3 ?M for O859585 in various HCV genotypes. We demonstrated that O859585 efficiently blocked HCV attachment by neutralizing free viral particles without affecting other stages of the HCV life cycle and interferon stimulation. O859585 interrupted binding between HCV E2 and CD81. Of note, co-treatment of O859585 with either interferon alpha (IFNα) or sofosbuvir exerted either an additive or synergistic antiviral activity in HCV-infected cells with no measurable effect on cell viability. Most importantly, O859585 in combination with IFNα and sofosbuvir exhibited synergistic effects on anti-HCV activity in primary human hepatocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that O859585 may be a novel antiviral agent for HCV therapy. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Acupotomy for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Introduction: This systematic review protocol describes the methods that will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupotomy for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Methods and analysis: The following electronic databases will be searched until December 2018 without language or publication status restrictions: five English databases, that is Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); three Korean databases, that is Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), Research Information Service System (RISS), and Korea Citation Index (KCI); and three Chinese databases, that is China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and VIP. Any clinical, randomized controlled trials using acupotomy for lumbar spinal stenosis treatment will be included. Changes in the degrees of pain and function will be assessed as primary outcomes. The total effective rate, changes in quality of life, adverse events, and amount of rescue medication used will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Two independent researchers will perform study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. If applicable, a meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan version 5.3, with the results expressed as risk ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. According to a heterogeneity test or the number of studies included, fixed effects or random effects model will be used. The risk of bias tool from the Cochrane group will be used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies.

"Effect of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract on hard exudates in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy",2019,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). METHODS: In this randomized (1:2:2), multicentre, double-blind trial, patients (n?=?124; age: 40-78 years) were administered placebo, calcium dobesilate (CD; 750?mg/d), or GSPE (150?mg/d) orally for up to 12 months. All patients had retinal thickening with hard exudates (HEs) that met predefined criteria; the median best-corrected visual acuity was 0.8, as assessed using the Snellen visual acuity card. The main outcome measure was an improvement in HEs by at least 1 grade on a 10-grade severity scale. This was evaluated using fundus photography over 1 year. RESULTS: The rate of improvement in the HE severity was higher in the GSPE group than in the CD group. No statistically significant difference existed among the study groups in optical coherence tomography parameters, such as central subfield macular thickness and total macular volume (TMV). However, in the GSPE group, TMV after 9 months of treatment was significantly decreased compared with that at baseline. The GSPE group showed a significantly greater improvement in HE severity than did the placebo or CD group. Four cases in the GSPE group and 2 in the CD group were determined to have developed potential treatment-related adverse reactions, which were all gastrointestinal in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GSPE therapy for 1 year improved HEs in patients with NPDR. The efficacy of GSPE for HEs was higher than that of oral CD in the study patients.","dobesilate calcium; grape seed extract; Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins; hemostatic agent; proanthocyanidin; aged; clinical trial; controlled study; diabetic retinopathy; double blind procedure; drug effect; exudate; female; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; optical coherence tomography; oral drug administration; pathology; randomized controlled trial; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; visual acuity; Administration, Oral; Aged; Calcium Dobesilate; Diabetic Retinopathy; Double-Blind Method; Exudates and Transudates; Female; Grape Seed Extract; Hemostatics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proanthocyanidins; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Treatment Outcome; Visual Acuity"

"Inhibitory Effects of Vanadium-Binding Proteins Purified from the Sea Squirt Halocynthia roretzi on Adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes",2019,"The inhibitory effects of vanadium-binding proteins (VBPs) from the blood plasma and the intestine of sea squirt on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were examined. 3T3L-1 cells treated with VBP blood plasma decreased markedly the lipid content in maturing pre-adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, whereas VBP intestine did not show significant effects on lipid accumulation. Both VBPs did not have significant effect on cell viability. In order to demonstrate the anti-adipogenic effects of VBP blood plasma, the expressions of several adipogenic transcription factors and enzymes were investigated by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction. VBP blood plasma down-regulated the expressions of transcription factors; PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, SREBP1, and FAS, but did not have significant effects on the expressions of lipolytic enzymes; HSL and LPL. Both the crude and purified VBPs significantly increased the mRNA levels of Wnt10b, FZ1, LRP6, and β-catenin, while decreased the expression of GSK-3β. Hence, VBP blood plasma inhibited adipogenesis by activating WNT/β-catenin pathway via the activation of Wnt10b. Based on the findings, VBP blood plasma decreased lipid accumulation which was mediated by decreasing adipogenesis, not by lipolysis. Therefore, VBP blood plasma could be used to treat obesity. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chemical activation; Enzymes; Purification; Transcription; Transcription factors; Vanadium; Adipogenesis; Binding proteins; Dose-dependent manner; Halocynthia roretzi; Lipid accumulations; Lipolytic enzymes; Reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction; Sea squirt; Polymerase chain reaction; antiobesity agent; beta catenin; binding protein; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; unclassified drug; vanadium binding protein; Wnt10b protein; beta catenin; protein; vanadium; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; antiobesity activity; Article; Ascidiacea; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; halocynthia roretzi; lipid storage; lipolysis; nonhuman; proadipocyte; protein expression; protein purification; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Wnt signaling; adipocyte; animal; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mouse; Urochordata; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; beta Catenin; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Proteins; Urochordata; Vanadium; Wnt Signaling Pathway"
"Comparison of Resolute zotarolimus-eluting and Xience everolimus-eluting stents in patients with de novo long coronary artery lesions: A randomized LONG-DES VI trial",2019,"Background Outcomes for stent-based coronary intervention of lesions with long diseased segments remain relatively unfavorable. This study sought to compare the efficacy of Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (R-ZES) and Xience everolimus-eluting stents (EES) for very long coronary lesions. Methods and results This randomized, multicenter, prospective trial compared the use of R-ZES with EES for very long (?50 mm) native coronary lesions. The primary end point was in-segment late luminal loss at 12-month angiographic follow-up. A total of 400 patients were needed to assess the primary end point. However, owing to very slow enrollment of patients, this trial was early terminated (302 patients were enrolled), and thus, this report provides descriptive information on primary and secondary end points. The R-ZES and EES groups had similar baseline characteristics. Lesion length was 49.6±10.2 and 50.6±13.3 mm in the R-ZES and EES groups, respectively (P=0.47). The number of stents used at the target lesion was 2.1±0.3 and 2.2±0.5, respectively. Twelve-month angiographic follow-up was performed in 50% of eligible patients. In-segment late luminal loss did not significantly differ between the R-ZES and EES groups (0.17±0.57 vs. 0.09±0.43 mm, P=0.32). In-segment binary restenosis rates were 8.1 and 5.3% in the R-ZES and EES groups, respectively (P=0.49). There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, target lesion revascularization, and composite outcomes). Conclusion For patients with very long native coronary artery disease, R-ZES and EES implantation showed comparable angiographic and clinical outcomes through 1 year of follow-up. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"In-Depth Proteomic Analysis of Human Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid toward the Biomarker Discovery for Lung Cancers",2019,"Purpose: Lung cancer is among the most common cancers. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) can be easily obtained from patients with lung cancers. The aim is to develop a novel proteomic method of the molecule-based sensitive detection of biomarkers from BALF. Experimental Design: BALF samples are collected from segmental bronchus of 14 patients with lung cancers from Kyung Hee University Hospital. First, BALF proteome is depleted using a depletion column, and then peptides are prepared from the enriched low abundant proteins and fractionated by high pH reverse phase liquid chromatography prior to LC-MS/MS. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012645. Results: A novel method is developed for in-depth proteomic analysis of BALF by combining antibody-based depletion of high abundant proteins from BALF with high pH peptide fractionation. Peptides are analyzed on a high resolution Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. MaxQuant search result in the identification of 4615 protein groups mapped to 4534 genes. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: It is found that the method outperformed conventional BALF proteomic methods and it is believed that this method will facilitate the biomarker research for lung cancer. In addition, it is shown that BALF will be a great source of biomarkers of lung diseases. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Peroxiredoxin 6 Inhibits Osteogenic Differentiation and Bone Formation Through Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells and Induces Delayed Bone Development",2019,"Aims: Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are thiol-specific antioxidant enzymes that regulate redox balance that are critical for maintaining the cellular potential for self-renewal and stemness. Stem cell-based regenerative medicine is a promising approach in tissue reconstruction. However, to obtain functional cells for use in clinical applications, stem cell technology still requires improvements. Results: In this study, we found that PRDX6 levels were decreased during osteogenic differentiation in human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). hDPSCs stably expressing Myc-PRDX6 (hDPSC/myc-PRDX6) inhibited cell growth in hDPSCs during osteogenic differentiation and impaired osteogenic phenotypes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralized nodule formation, and osteogenic marker genes [ALP and osteocalcin (OCN)]. hDPSC cell lines stably expressing mutant glutathione peroxidase (PRDX6(C47S)) and independent phospholipase A2 (PRDX6(S32A)) were also generated. Each mutant form of PRDX6 abolished the impaired osteogenic phenotypes, the transforming growth factor-β-mediated Smad2 and p38 pathways, and RUNX2 expression. Furthermore, in vivo experiments revealed that hDPSC/myc-PRDX6 suppressed hDPSC-based bone regeneration in calvarial defect mice, and newborn PRDX6 transgenic mice exhibited delayed bone development and reduced RUNX2 expression. Innovation and Conclusion: These findings illuminate the effects of PRDX6 during osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs, and also suggest that regulating PRDX6 may improve the clinical utility of stem cell-based regenerative medicine for the treatment of bone diseases.

"Microbial Community Enhances Biodegradation of Bisphenol A Through Selection of Sphingomonadaceae",2019,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a common ingredient in plastic wares and epoxy resins that are essential for our daily life. Despite the obvious benefits, BPA may act as an environmental endocrine disruptor, causing metabolic, reproductive, and/or developmental consequences and diseases in humans and other organisms. Although previous studies have yielded progress toward the microbial breakdown of BPA, the work has primarily been focused on pure cultures rather than complex microbial communities. In this study, we examined microbial communities in bioreactors that control the fate of BPA at various levels (up to 5000?μg?L ?1 ). Microbial communities rapidly increased removal rates of 500–5000?μg?L ?1 BPA from 23–29 to 89–99% during the first 2?weeks of the acclimation period, after which &gt; 90% stable removal rates were maintained over 3?months. Biochemical assays demonstrated that BPA was removed by biodegradation, rather than other abiotic removal routes (e.g., adsorption and volatilization). The 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis revealed that 50–5000?μg?L ?1 of BPA exposure systematically selected for three Sphingomonadaceae species (Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, and Sphingopyxis). The Sphingomonadaceae-enriched communities acclimated to BPA showed a 7.0-L?gVSS ?1 ?day ?1 BPA degradation rate constant, which is comparable to that (4.1–6.3) of Sphingomonadaceae isolates and is higher than other potential BPA degraders. Taken together, our results advanced the understanding of how microbial communities acclimate to environmentally relevant levels of BPA, gradually enhancing BPA degradation via selective enrichment of a few Sphingomonadaceae populations with higher BPA metabolic activity. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; phenol derivative; bioreactor; bioremediation; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; Sphingomonadaceae; Benzhydryl Compounds; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Microbiota; Phenols; Sphingomonadaceae"
"Suppression of lung inflammation by the ethanol extract of Chung-Sang and the possible role of Nrf2",2019,"Background: Asian traditional herbal remedies are typically a concoction of a major and several complementary herbs. While balancing out any adverse effect of the major herb, the complementary herbs could dilute the efficacy of the major herb, resulting in a suboptimal therapeutic effect of an herbal remedy. Here, we formulated Chung-Sang (CS) by collating five major herbs, which are used against inflammatory diseases, and tested whether an experimental formula composed of only major herbs is effective in suppressing inflammation without significant side effects. Methods: The 50% ethanol extract of CS (eCS) was fingerprinted by HPLC. Cytotoxicity to RAW 264.7 cells was determined by an MTT assay and a flow cytometer. Nuclear NF-κB and Nrf2 were analyzed by western blot. Ubiquitinated Nrf2 was similarly analyzed following immunoprecipitation of Nrf2. Acute lung inflammation and sepsis were induced in C57BL/6 mice. The effects of eCS on lung disease were measured by HE staining of lung sections, a differential cell counting of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay, a real-time qPCR, and Kaplan-Meier survival of mice. Results: eCS neither elicited cytotoxicity nor reactive oxygen species. While not suppressing NF-κB, eCS activated Nrf2, reduced the ubiquitination of Nrf2, and consequently induced the expression of Nrf2-dependent genes. In an acute lung inflammation mouse model, an intratracheal (i.t.) eCS suppressed neutrophil infiltration, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes, and MPO activity. In a sepsis mouse model, a single i.t. eCS was sufficient to significantly decrease mouse mortality. Conclusions: eCS could suppress severe lung inflammation in mice. This effect seemed to associate with eCS activating Nrf2. Our findings suggest that herbal remedies consisting of only major herbs are worth considering. ? 2019 The Author(s).","alcohol; chung sang; Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide; herbaceous agent; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; myeloperoxidase; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; plant extract; transcription factor Nrf2; acute lung injury; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; Asarum; Asarum sieboldii; clove; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; embryo; enzyme activity; gene expression; human; human cell; Magnolia; Magnolia biondii; Mentha; Mentha haplocalyx; mouse; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; sepsis; single drug dose; ubiquitination; Xanthium; Xanthium sibiricum; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; drug effect; drug formulation; genetics; immunology; isolation and purification; lung; pneumonia; RAW 264.7 cell line; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Drug Compounding; Humans; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neutrophil Infiltration; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; NF-kappa B; Plant Extracts; Pneumonia; RAW 264.7 Cells"
"Casticin-induced inhibition of cell growth and survival are mediated through the dual modulation of Akt/mTOR signaling cascade",2019,"The Akt/mTOR signaling cascade is a critical pathway involved in various physiological and pathological conditions, including regulation of cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the anti-neoplastic effects of casticin (CTC), identified from the plant Vitex rotundifolia L., alone and/or in combination with BEZ-235, a dual Akt/mTOR inhibitor in human tumor cells. We found that CTC exerted a significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity and reduced cell proliferation in a variety of human tumor cells. Also, CTC effectively blocked the phosphorylation levels of Akt (Ser473) and mTOR (Ser2448) proteins as well as induced substantial apoptosis. Additionally treatment with CTC and BEZ-235 in conjunction resulted in a greater apoptotic effect than caused by either agent alone thus implicating the anti-neoplastic effects of this novel combination. Overall, the findings suggest that CTC can interfere with Akt/mTOR signaling cascade involved in tumorigenesis and can be used together with pharmacological agents targeting Akt/mTOR pathway. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Increased plasticity of bodily self-experience in individuals who may carry latent liability for schizophrenia",2019,"Self-disturbances such as altered perception of one's own body boundary are central to the lived-in experience of schizophrenia. Bodily self-disturbances are also prevalent in healthy individuals who may carry latent liability for schizophrenia. Much of the research on self-disturbances rely on clinical interviews but these experiences are often difficult to verbalize, conceptualize and quantify. Furthermore, experimental evidence for plasticity of bodily self-experience in the schizophrenia-spectrum is scarce. We sought to quantify body boundary experience in healthy young adults who might be at an increased risk for schizophrenia with a multisensory paradigm known as the Pinocchio Illusion (PI) task that engenders the feeling that one's nose is changing, and has previously been used to demonstrate increased plasticity of bodily self-boundary in schizophrenia. 62 college students participated in the PI task that assessed bodily self-disturbances, and a tactile discrimination task. We administered the Prodromal Questionnaire Brief (PQ-B) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) to assess latent liability for schizophrenia. We found that PI was enhanced in individuals with elevated PQ-B scores but their tactile sensitivity was intact. PI was associated with the positive syndrome of schizotypy, but not with negative or disorganized factors. Increased PQ-B and SPQ scores were associated with loneliness. To conclude, these results highlight the importance of bodily self-disturbances in the broader context of the schizophrenia spectrum. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; college student; exteroception; female; human; illusion; loneliness; male; perception; perception disorder; positive syndrome; priority journal; Prodromal Questionnaire Brief; prodromal symptom; schizophrenia; schizophrenia assessment; schizotypal personality disorder; Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire; tactile discrimination"
"β -Lapachone Regulates Obesity through Modulating Thermogenesis in Brown Adipose Tissue and Adipocytes: Role of AMPK Signaling Pathway",2019,"Activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been proposed as a promising target against obesity due to its increased capacity for thermogenesis. In this study, we explored the effect of β-Lapachone (βL), a compound obtained from the bark of the lapacho tree, against obesity. In vivo administration of βL into either high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL6 mice and genetically obese Lepr- mice prevented body weight gain, which was associated with tissue weight loss of white adipose tissue (WAT). In addition, βL elevated thermogenic proteins including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and mitochondrial count in BAT and human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). βL also induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, subsequent upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and UCP1, and these effects were diminished by AMPK inhibitor compound C, suggesting that AMPK underlies the effects of βL. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways participated in the thermogenesis of βL, specifically p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were activated by βL treatment in hAMSCs. Additionally, inhibitors of p38/JNK/ERK1/2 abrogated the activity of βL. Taken together, βL exerts anti-obese effects by inducing thermogenesis mediated by AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that βL may have a potential therapeutic implication of obesity. Taken together, βL exerts anti-obese effects by not only inducing thermogenesis on brown adipocytes but also inducing the browning of white adipocytes. The anti-obese effect of βL is mediated by AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that βL may have potential therapeutic implication of obesity. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; beta lapachone; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; stress activated protein kinase; synaptophysin; uncoupling protein 1; antiobesity agent; beta-lapachone; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; naphthoquinone; Ucp1 protein, mouse; uncoupling protein 1; adipose tissue cell; AMPK signaling; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; bark; body weight gain; body weight loss; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cell; in vivo study; lipid diet; male; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nonhuman; nonshivering thermogenesis; obesity; upregulation; white adipocyte; white adipose tissue; adipocyte; adverse event; animal; brown adipose tissue; C57BL mouse; cell culture; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; mitochondrion; obesity; pathology; phosphorylation; physiology; phytotherapy; signal transduction; Tabebuia; thermogenesis; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue, Brown; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Cells, Cultured; Diet, High-Fat; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria; Naphthoquinones; Obesity; Phosphorylation; Phytotherapy; Signal Transduction; Tabebuia; Thermogenesis; Uncoupling Protein 1; Weight Gain"
"Serum promotes vasculogenic mimicry through the EphA2/VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells",2019,"Aims: Serum is widely used for in vitro cell culture of eukaryotic cells. Although serum is well known to affect various biological activities in cancer cells, its effect in vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is not yet fully defined. Thus, this study investigated the role of serum in VM in human prostate cancer (PCa) PC-3 cells. Main methods: Invasion assay and 3D culture VM tube formation assay are performed. VM-related molecules are checked by western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Nuclear twist is detected by confocal after twist-FITC/DAPI double staining. Key findings: Serum dramatically induced not only invasion but also VM. Serum increased the phosphorylation of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A2 (EphA2) without affecting EphA2 expression. Both the protein and mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) are up-regulated by serum. Twist expression was increased in the nucleus by serum. Serum activated AKT through phosphorylation, despite the unchanged AKT expression. Serum caused an increase in matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and laminin subunit 5 gamma-2 (LAMC2) protein expressions. Wortmannin, a phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor, significantly decreased serum-induced invasion and VM. Significance: These results demonstrated that serum activates EphA2 and up-regulates twist/VE-cadherin, which in turn activate AKT that up-regulates MMP-2 and LAMC2, thereby inducing the invasion and VM of human PCa PC-3 cells. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","ephrin receptor A2; gelatinase A; laminin subunit 5 gamma 2; membrane protein; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; vascular endothelial cadherin; wortmannin; cadherin; ephrin receptor A2; gelatinase A; LAMC2 protein, human; laminin; leukocyte antigen; protein kinase B; Twist related protein 1; vascular endothelial cadherin; Article; blood; blood vessel function; cancer cell culture; controlled study; gene expression; human; human cell; PC-3 [Human lung carcinoma] cell line; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; staining; upregulation; vasculogenic mimicry; VE cadherin gene; Western blotting; angiogenesis; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; male; metabolism; microvasculature; neovascularization (pathology); physiology; prostate tumor; serum; tumor cell line; Antigens, CD; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Laminin; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Microvessels; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Prostatic Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptor, EphA2; Serum; Twist-Related Protein 1"
"Promoter Polymorphism (-308G/A) of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α) Gene and Asthma Risk: An Updated Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background and Aims: The relationship between the promoter polymorphism (-308G/A) of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene and the susceptibility to asthma has been tested in several studies. However, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between this promoter polymorphism of the TNF-α gene and the risk of asthma. Methods: Fifty case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis which provided 17,937 controls and 9961 asthma patients. The pooled p-value, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to investigate the strength of the association of this polymorphism of the TNF-α gene with the risk of asthma. The meta-analysis was carried out by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results: The results of our meta-analysis revealed that the TNF-α polymorphism (-308, G/A) was strongly associated with the risk of asthma (p < 0.05 in the allelic, dominant, and recessive models, respectively). In further analyses, based on age group and ethnicity, we observed this association for all subpopulations examined (p < 0.05 in allelic, dominant, and recessive models, respectively). Conclusion: This large-scale meta-analysis supports a strong association between the TNF-α gene promoter polymorphism (-308G/A) and the development to asthma in both children and adults. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor; age; Article; asthma; case control study; controlled study; ethnicity; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; human; meta analysis (topic); promoter region; risk assessment; adolescent; adult; asthma; child; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; male; meta analysis; metabolism; middle aged; odds ratio; promoter region; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Case-Control Studies; Child; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Risk Factors; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
"Tumor-specific macrophage targeting through recognition of retinoid X receptor beta",2019,"Macrophages play important and diverse roles during cancer progression. However, cancer therapies based on macrophage modulation are lacking in tools that can recognize and deliver therapeutic payloads to macrophages in a tumor-specific manner. As a result, treatments tend to interfere with normal macrophage functions in healthy organs. We previously identified a macrophage-binding peptide, termed CRV. Here, we show that upon systemic administration into tumor-bearing mice, CRV selectively homes to tumors, extravasates, and preferentially binds to macrophages within. CRV exhibits a higher affinity for tumor macrophages than for other cells in tumors or for other macrophage types elsewhere in the body. We further identified and validated retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB) as the CRV receptor. Intriguingly, although it is known as a nuclear receptor, RXRB shows a prominent cell surface localization that is largely restricted to tumor macrophages. Systemic administration of anti-RXRB antibodies also results in tumor-selective binding to macrophages similar to CRV. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of CRV to improve the delivery of nano-carriers into solid tumors and macrophages within. In summary, we describe here a novel cell surface marker and targeting tools for tumor macrophages that may aid in future development of macrophage-modulatory cancer therapies. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cell membranes; Diseases; Mammals; Oncology; Tumors; Cancer progression; Cargo delivery; Cell surface marker; Macrophage targeting; Retinoid X receptor; RXR beta targeting; Systemic administration; Tumor associated macrophages; Macrophages; CD11b antigen; CD68 antigen; cell nucleus receptor; cell surface marker; crv protein; fluorescein; peptide; protein; retinoid X receptor beta; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer therapy; cell surface; controlled study; female; human; human cell; macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein localization; protein transport; solid malignant neoplasm"
"Comparative analysis of differentially secreted proteins in serum-free and serum-containing media by using BONCAT and pulsed SILAC",2019,"Despite the increased interest in secretomes associated with paracrine/autocrine mechanisms, the majority of mass spectrometric cell secretome studies have been performed using serum-free medium (SFM). On the other hand, serum-containing medium (SCM) is not recommended very much because the secretome obtained with SCM is easily contaminated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) proteins. In this study, through the combination of bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and pulsed-SILAC (pSILAC), we analyzed differentially secreted proteins between SFM and SCM in a cancer-derived human cell, U87MG, and a mesenchymal stem cell derived from human Wharton’s jelly (hWJ-MSCs). In most cases, the bioinformatic tools predicted a protein to be truly secretory when the secretion level of the protein was more in SCM than in SFM. In the case of hWJ-MSCs, the amount of proteins secreted in SCM for 24 hours was larger than that of SFM (log 2 fold change = 0.96), even considering different cell proliferation rates. hWJ-MSCs proteins secreted more in SCM included several positive markers of MSC paracrine factors implicated in angiogenesis, neurogenesis and osteogenesis, and upstream regulators of cell proliferation. Our study suggests the analysis of the secretome should be processed in SCM that promotes cell proliferation and secretion. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Gender differences in the impact of retirement on depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults: A propensity score matching approach",2019,"Background Retirement is one of the most important later-life status transitions related to changes in workforce participation, lifestyle, and social roles among older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of retirement on depressive symptoms by gender in middle-aged and older adult Koreans, using a large, nationally representative sample. Methods Using year 2010 and 2012 data from the Korea Longitudinal Study of Aging, we investigated the relationship between adults’ retirement status and depressive symptoms measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression (CES-D10) scale. A series of propensity score matching models were calculated to test the potential retirement effect on adults’ depressive symptoms. Results Overall, the level of depressive symptoms of the retired group was not different from that of the employed counterpart. In gender-stratified models, the gain of CES-D10 scores in the retired group was higher than that of the employed group for males, which was in the opposite direction among females. However, the propensity score matching model showed that the relationship between retirement status and CES-D10 score gain was significant for males but not for females. Conclusions Our study reinforces the assertion that retirement could worsen depressive symptoms and could differ by gender. Intervention programs focused on the mental health of retired men need to be actively developed and widely implemented. ? 2019 Noh et al.

"Anti-colitic effects of ethanol extract of Persea americana Mill. Through suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators via NF-κB/STAT3 inactivation in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice",2019,"Persea americana Mill, cv. Hass, also known as avocado, has been reported to possess hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, cardioprotective, and photoprotective potencies. However, few studies have reported its anti-colitic effects. In this study, we investigated anti-colitic effects of ethanol extract of P. americana (EEP) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitic mice and the involved molecular mechanisms. EEP effectively improved clinical signs and histological characteristics of DSS-induced colitis mice. In DSS-exposed colonic tissues, EEP reduced expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Moreover, EEP suppressed DSS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Consistent with in vivo results, EEP also suppressed protein and mRNA expression levels of iNOS, COX-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB and STAT3 inactivation in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Taken together, our data indicate that ethanol extract of avocado may be used as a promising therapeutic against inflammatory bowel diseases by suppressing the NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathway. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Genetic diversity of zoonotic malaria parasites from mosquito vector and vertebrate hosts",2019,"We explored and constructed haplotype network for simian malaria species: Plasmodium knowlesi, P. cynomolgi and P. inui aiming to understand the transmission dynamics between mosquitoes, humans and macaques. Mosquitoes were collected from villages in an area where zoonotic malaria is prevalent. PCR analysis confirmed Anopheles balabacensis as the main vector for macaque parasites, moreover nearly 60% of the mosquitoes harboured more than one Plasmodium species. Fragments of the A-type small subunit ribosomal RNA (SS rRNA) amplified from salivary gland sporozoites, and equivalent sequences obtained from GenBank were used to construct haplotype networks. The patterns were consistent with the presence of geographically distinct populations for P. inui and P. cynomolgi, and with three discrete P. knowlesi populations. This study provides a preliminary snapshot of the structure of these populations, that was insufficient to answer our aim. Thus, collection of parasites from their various hosts and over time, associated with a systematic analysis of a set of genetical loci is strongly advocated in order to obtain a clear picture of the parasite population and the flow between different hosts. This is important to devise measures that will minimise the risk of transmission to humans, because zoonotic malaria impedes malaria elimination. ? 2019","small subunit ribosomal RNA; adult; Anopheles; Anopheles balabacensis; Article; controlled study; disease transmission; DNA sequence; genetic variability; haplotype; host parasite interaction; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Plasmodium; Plasmodium cynomolgi; Plasmodium inui; Plasmodium knowlesi; population structure; priority journal; salivary gland; sporozoite"
"Gene–environment interactions related to blood pressure traits in two community-based Korean cohorts",2019,"Hypertension is a complex disorder caused by genetic and environmental risk factors. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified more than 100 genetic variants for blood pressure traits and hypertension. However, the interactions between these genetic variants and environmental factors have not been systematically investigated. Therefore, we examined the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors in blood pressure traits using the genetic risk score (GRS). Two Korean community-based cohorts, Cohort I (KARE; N = 8,840) and Cohort II (CAVAS; N = 9,599), were used for this study, and GRSs were calculated from 42 GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were validated for their association in these cohorts. We calculated GRSs in both ways by considering the effect sizes of each SNP (weighted GRS) and not considering the effect sizes (unweighted GRS). The unweighted GRS was strongly associated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and hypertension (p = 9.03 × 10 –47, p = 9.41 × 10 –48, and p = 3.22 × 10 –55 by meta-analysis, respectively) and the weighted GRS showed the similar results. The environmental factors of body mass index, waist circumference, and drinking status were significantly associated with blood pressure traits, and the interaction between these factors and GRSs were examined. However, no interactions were found with?either the GRS or the individual SNPs considered for the GRS. Our findings show that it is challenging to find GRS–environment interactions regarding blood pressure traits. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; Article; blood pressure; body mass; caloric intake; case control study; cohort analysis; community; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; drinking; environmental factor; female; genetic risk; genetic trait; genome-wide association study; genotype environment interaction; heredity; human; hypertension; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; middle aged; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; blood pressure; demography; epidemiology; ethnology; genetic predisposition; genetics; meta analysis; quantitative trait; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Republic of Korea; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors"
"Tumor-Targeting, MicroRNA-Silencing Porous Silicon Nanoparticles for Ovarian Cancer Therapy",2019,"Silencing of aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) has emerged as one of the strategies for molecular targeted cancer therapeutics. In particular, miR-21 is an oncogenic miRNA overexpressed in many tumors, including ovarian cancer. To achieve efficient administration of anti-miR therapeutics, delivery systems are needed that can ensure local accumulation in the tumor environment, low systemic toxicity, and reduced adverse side effects. In order to develop an improved anti-miR therapeutic agent for the treatment of ovarian cancer, a nanoformulation is engineered that leverages biodegradable porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) encapsulating an anti-miR-21 locked nucleic acid payload and displaying a tumor-homing peptide for targeted distribution. Targeting efficacy, miR-21 silencing, and anticancer activity are optimized in vitro on a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, and a formulation of anti-miR-21 in a pSiNP displaying the targeting peptide CGKRK is identified for in vivo evaluation. When this nanoparticulate agent is delivered to mice bearing tumor xenografts, a substantial inhibition of tumor growth is achieved through silencing of miR-21. This study presents the first successful application of tumor-targeted anti-miR porous silicon nanoparticles for the treatment of ovarian cancer in a mouse xenograft model. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cell culture; Diseases; Locks (fasteners); Mammals; Medical nanotechnology; Nanoparticles; Oncology; Peptides; RNA; Tumors; Cancer therapy; In-vivo; Locked nucleic acid; MicroRNAs; miR-21; Ovarian cancers; Porous silicon; drug carrier; microRNA; MIRN21 microRNA, human; nanoparticle; silicon; animal; chemistry; drug screening; female; genetics; human; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; ovary tumor; pathology; porosity; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Carriers; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Nanoparticles; Ovarian Neoplasms; Porosity; Silicon; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Safety and efficacy of low-volume preparation in the elderly: Oral sulfate solution on the day before and split-dose regimens (SEE SAFE) study",2019,"Background/Aims: The use of a low-volume bowel cleansing agent is associated with a greater willingness to undergo repeat colonoscopy. Oral sulfate solution (OSS) is a recently approved low-volume agent; however, its efficacy and safety in the elderly population remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the OSS preparation, in comparison to those of a standard polyethylene glycol (PEG; 4 L) preparation, in elderly patients. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded study was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive OSS or 4-L PEG with a split-dose regimen. Bowel cleansing efficacy was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Acceptance, satisfaction, and preparation-related symptoms were recorded. Additionally, blood parameters were analyzed for electrolyte abnormalities and nephrotoxicity. Results: A total of 193 patients were analyzed. No group differences in overall bowel cleansing efficacy were observed, with “adequate” preparations achieved in 95.9% (93/97) and 94.8% (91/96) of patients in the OSS and 4L PEG groups, respectively (p=0.747). However, mean BBPS scores for the entire (p=0.010) and right colon (p=0.001) were significantly higher in the OSS group than in the 4-L PEG group. The severity of clinical adverse events and frequency of acute kidney injury were similarly low, and no clinically meaningful electrolyte changes were identified. Self-reported scores regarding amount (p<0.001) and feeling (p=0.007), as well as overall satisfaction (p=0.001) and willingness to repeat the preparation (92.8% vs 67.7%, p<0.001), were significantly better in the OSS group than in the 4-L PEG group. Conclusions: In elderly individuals, OSS with a split-dose regimen has greater acceptability and comparable efficacy in bowel cleansing compared to 4-L PEG. ? 2019 Editorial Office of Gut and Liver.

"Fomes fomentarius ethanol extract exerts inhibition of cell growth and motility induction of apoptosis via targeting AKT in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells",2019,"Fomes fomentarius, an edible mushroom, is known to have anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetes effects. However, the underlying anti-cancer mechanism of F. fomentarius is unknown. To determine the molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer effects of F. fomentarius, various methods were used including fluorescence-activated cell sorting, Western blotting, migration, and crystal violet assays. F. fomentarius ethanol extract (FFE) decreased cell viability in six cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, A549, H460, DU145, and PC-3). FFE decreased the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells without causing cell toxicity. Furthermore, FFE attenuated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and phosphorylation of Akt as well as increased E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells. FFE arrested the S and G2/M populations by inhibiting the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cyclin A/E, and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2. FFE increased the sub-G1 population and expression of cleaved caspase-9, -3, and cleaved poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP-ribose) polymerase at 72 h and suppressed B-cell lymphoma 2. Interestingly, FFE and AKT inhibitors showed similar effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, FFE contained betulin which inhibited p-AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our findings demonstrate that FFE inhibits cell motility and growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting the phsphoinositide 3- kinase /AKT pathway and caspase activation. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Recovery effect of lignans and fermented extracts from Forsythia koreana flowers on pancreatic islets damaged by alloxan in zebrafish (Danio rerio)",2019,"Repeated column separation yielded four enterolactone type lignans from Forsythia koreana flowers (FKF), whose chemical structures were identified using several spectral technics. FKF MeOH extract (FKFM) and four lignans significantly recovered aloxan induced pancreatic islet in zebrafish. Especially, aglycones, 1 and 3, exhibited relatively higher activity than the lignan glycosides, 2 and 4. Therefore, FKFM was fermented using a Microbacterium esteraromaticum, BGP1, to yield the fermented FKFM (FKFM-BGP1). FKFM and FKFM-BGP1 were extracted using n-butanol to give n-BuOH fraction of each, FKFM-nB and FKFM-BGP1-nB, respectively. FKFM-BGP1-nB showed higher activity than FKFM-nB, as well the content of the aglycones, 1 and 3, in FKFM-BGP1-nB, 2.42 ± 0.01% and 1.15 ± 0.01%, was revealed to be much higher than that in FKFM-nB, 0.01 ± 0.01% and 0.01 ± 0.01%, respectively. In conclusion, the lignan aglycones 1 and 3 as well FKFM-BGP1-nB from F. koreana flowers were proved to be potential anti-diabetic agents. Furthermore, we suggest that antidiabetic efficacy of FKFM-BGP1-nB might be related to lignan aglycones 1 and 3. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The preventive and curative effects of lactobacillus reuteri NK33 and bifidobacterium adolescentis NK98 on immobilization stress-induced anxiety/depression and colitis in mice",2019,"The gut dysbiosis by stressors such as immobilization deteriorates psychiatric disorders through microbiota-gut-brain axis activation. To understand whether probiotics could simultaneously alleviate anxiety/depression and colitis, we examined their effects on immobilization stress (IS)-induced anxiety/depression and colitis in mice. The probiotics Lactobacillus reuteri NK33 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis NK98 were isolated from healthy human feces. Mice with anxiety/depression and colitis were prepared by IS treatment. NK33 and NK98 potently suppressed NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells. Treatment with NK33 and/or NK98, which were orally gavaged in mice before or after IS treatment, significantly suppressed the occurrence and development of anxiety/depression, infiltration of Iba1+ and LPS+/CD11b+ cells (activated microglia) into the hippocampus, and corticosterone, IL-6, and LPS levels in the blood. Furthermore, they induced hippocampal BDNF expression while NF-κB activation was suppressed. NK33 and/or NK98 treatments suppressed IS-induced colon shortening, myeloperoxidase activity, infiltration of CD11b+/CD11c+ cells, and IL-6 expression in the colon. Their treatments also suppressed the IS-induced fecal Proteobacteria population and excessive LPS production. They also induced BDNF expression in LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. In conclusion, NK33 and NK98 synergistically alleviated the occurrence and development of anxiety/depression and colitis through the regulation of gut immune responses and microbiota composition. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Development of a three-dimensionally printed scaffold grafted with bone forming peptide-1 for enhanced bone regeneration with in vitro and in vivo evaluations",2019,"Defects in bone are some of the most difficult injuries to treat. Biomimetic scaffolds represent a promising approach for successful bone tissue regeneration. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold with osteo-inductive functionality was designed and assayed both in-vitro and in-vivo. Bone formation peptide-1 (BFP1), an osteo-promoting specific peptide, was covalently bound to a 3D printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold using polydopamine (DOPA). The amount of BFP1 immobilized on the surface was found to increase depending on the BFP1 concentration of the loading solution. To observe the biological effects of the 3D scaffolds, human tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hTMSCs) were isolated. The cells were cultured on the scaffolds and observed to rapidly differentiate into osteoblast-like cells with osteo-promoting capabilities. The scaffolds were implanted in a rabbit calvarial defect model for 8 weeks and successfully stimulated both vessel and bone regeneration. Osteo-promoting 3D scaffolds may provide a safer and more efficient approach for bone repair and remodelling in regenerative medicine. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Biomimetics; Bone; Cell culture; Peptides; Polycaprolactone; Regenerative Medicine; Scaffolds (biology); Stem cells; Tissue regeneration; 3-D printing; Bone regeneration; Bone tissue regeneration; Mesenchymal stem cell; Osteoblast-like cells; Osteogenesis; Polycaprolactone scaffolds; Three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds; 3D printers; bone forming peptide 1; DOPA; peptide; polycaprolactone; unclassified drug; bone forming peptide-1; osteogenic protein 1; peptide fragment; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone development; bone regeneration; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell isolation; chemical modification; controlled study; covalent bond; human; human cell; human tissue; immobilization; implantation; in vitro study; in vivo study; Leporidae; male; material coating; mesenchymal stem cell; nonhuman; ossification; osteoblast; priority journal; skull defect; three dimensional printing; tonsil; animal; bone development; bone regeneration; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; synthesis; tissue scaffold; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7; Bone Regeneration; Cells, Cultured; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteogenesis; Peptide Fragments; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Rabbits; Tissue Scaffolds"
"Progressive retinal neurodegeneration and microvascular change in diabetic retinopathy: longitudinal study using OCT angiography",2019,"Aims: To investigate the association between progressive macular ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) thinning and change of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)-derived microvascular parameters in early-stage diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods: A retrospective cohort study involved 40 eyes presenting with no DR or mild non-proliferative DR at baseline, and 30 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent spectral-domain OCT and OCTA at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24?months. Change of mGCIPL thickness and OCTA metrics including foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and FAZ circularity, vessel density (VD), and perfusion index (PI) was measured. Correlations between mGCIPL thickness and OCTA metrics were explored using regression models. Results: Average progressive mGCIPL loss was 0.45??m per year. Three microvascular parameters were significantly impaired at 24?months compared to baseline (FAZ area: 0.34–0.36?mm2, VD: 18.9–18.5/mm, PI: 0.35–0.34). A strong positive correlation was found between loss of mGCIPL and VD from baseline to 24?months (r = 0.817, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that thinner baseline mGCIPL and greater loss of mGCIPL thickness (B = 0.658, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with change of VD. Conclusions: In the early stage of DR, progressive structural retinal neurodegeneration and parafoveal microvascular change seem to be highly linked. Advanced mGCIPL thinning might precede microvascular impairment in early DR. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.","biological marker; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlational study; diabetic retinopathy; female; foveal avascular zone area; foveal avascular zone circularity; human; human cell; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; nerve degeneration; observational study; optical coherence tomography angiography; pathogenesis; perfusion index; pilot study; priority journal; retina blood vessel; retina ganglion cell; retinal inner plexiform layer; retinal thickness; retrospective study; risk factor; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; vessel density; visual system parameters"
"Orthogonal co-cultivation of smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell layers to construct in vivo-like vasculature",2019,"Development of a three-dimensional (3D) vascular co-cultivation system is one of the major challenges to provide an advanced analytical platform for studying blood vessel related diseases. To date, however, the in vivo-like vessel system has not been fully realized due to the difficulty of co-cultivation of the cells with orthogonal alignment. In this study, we report the utilization of microfabrication technology to construct biomimetic 3D co-cultured vasculature. First, microwrinkle patterns whose direction was perpendicular to the axis of a circular microfluidic channel were fabricated, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were cultured inside the microchannel, leading to an in vivo-like circumferential VSMC layer. Then, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured on the circumferentially aligned VSMC, and the success of double layer formation of HUVEC-VSMC in the circular microchannel could be monitored. After HUVEC cultivation, we applied shear flow in order to induce the orientation of HUVEC parallel to the axis, and the analysis of orientation angle and spreading area of HUVECs indicated that they were changed by shear stress to be aligned to the direction of flow. Thus, the HUVEC and VSMC layer could be aligned with a distinct direction. The expression level of VE-Cadherin located at the boundary of HUVECs implies in vivo-like vascular behavior. The proposed in vitro microfluidic vascular assay platform would be valuable for studying vascular diseases with high reliability due to in vivo-likeness. ? 2019 Author(s).","Advanced Analytics; Biomimetic processes; Blood vessels; Cytology; Microchannels; Microfluidics; Muscle; Shear flow; Shear stress; Circular microchannel; Double layer formation; Human umbilical vein endothelial cells; Micro-fabrication technology; Microwrinkle patterns; Orthogonal alignment; Threedimensional (3-d); Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells; Endothelial cells"
"Reduction of non-point source contaminants associated with road-deposited sediments by sweeping",2019,"Road-deposited sediments (RDS) on an expressway, residual RDS collected after sweeping, and RDS removed by means of sweeping were analyzed to evaluate the degree to which sweeping removed various non-point source contaminants. The total RDS load was 393.1?±?80.3?kg/km and the RDS, residual RDS, and swept RDS were all highly polluted with organics, nutrients, and metals. Among the metals studied, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Ca, and Fe were significantly enriched, and most of the contaminants were associated with particles within the size range from 63?μm to 2?mm. Sweeping reduced RDS and its associated contaminants by 33.3–49.1% on average. We also measured the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of RDS in the present work, representing to our knowledge the first time that this has been done; we found that RDS contains a significant amount of biodegradable organics and that the reduction of BOD by sweeping was higher than that of other contaminants. Significant correlations were found between the contaminants measured, indicating that the organics and the metals originated from both exhaust and non-exhaust particles. Meanwhile, the concentrations of Cu and Ni were higher in 63?μm–2?mm particles than in smaller particles, suggesting that some metals in RDS likely exist intrinsically in particles, rather than only as adsorbates on particle surfaces. Overall, the results in this study showed that sweeping to collect RDS can be a good alternative for reduction of contaminants in runoff. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","biodegradation; motorway; nonpoint source pollution; organic pollutant; pollutant source; reduction; runoff; sediment pollution; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; human; nonpoint source pollution; occupational health; prevention and control; procedures; sediment; statistics and numerical data; traffic and transport; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Non-Point Source Pollution; Occupational Health; Transportation"

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old woman with stage IVB ovarian cancer who underwent optimal surgical cytoreduction, but whose disease persisted after adjuvant platinum-based combination chemotherapy and 2nd-line chemotherapy. DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTIONS: The patient discontinued chemotherapy due to her septic condition and acute kidney injury accompanied by acute pyelonephritis, and opted for adjuvant treatment with mistletoe extract. OUTCOMES: The patient has achieved good health without progression of cancer or ascites over the 42 months since the 1st diagnosis and 24 months since the last relapse. LESSIONS: Our case suggests that mistletoe extract can produce favorable outcomes in patients with platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.","antineoplastic agent; platinum derivative; adjuvant chemotherapy; case report; cytoreductive surgery; drug effect; female; human; middle aged; mistletoe; ovary; ovary tumor; pathology; phytotherapy; procedures; tumor recurrence; x-ray computed tomography; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Mistletoe; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Ovary; Phytotherapy; Platinum Compounds; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"Use of Insulin Glargine 100?U/mL for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in East Asians: A Review",2019,"Abstract: Insulin glargine (IGlar) 100?U/mL (IGlar-100) is widely used in East Asian countries for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is the gold standard of basal insulin treatment. In this review we summarize key information about clinical experience with IGlar-100 in East Asian patients with T2DM, including findings from clinical trials and postmarketing studies. We also provide recommendations and opinions on the optimal use of IGlar-100 in this population. The findings from the studies highlighted in our review indicate that IGlar-100 can be a suitable treatment option for East Asians with T2DM, from initial therapy in combination with oral antihyperglycemic medications through to different combinations and intensification models.

"Synergistic Effect of Two Major Components of Malva verticillata in the Recovery of Alloxan-Damaged Pancreatic Islet Cells in Zebrafish",2019,"Malva verticillata (Chinese mallow) has long been used in traditional medicines and herbal teas in Asia. The n-BuOH fraction (Fr) from M. verticillata promoted significant recovery of alloxan-damaged (AXD) pancreatic islets (PIs) in zebrafish (ZF). Two major components were isolated from M. verticillata through repeated-column chromatography. Based on several spectroscopic methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), the chemical structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined. In addition, the quantity of both compounds in the n-BuOH Fr was investigated through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the quantities of compounds 1 and 2 in the n-BuOH Fr were determined to be 5.58% ± 0.16% and 2.85% ± 0.13%, respectively. The n-BuOH Fr, compounds 1 and 2, and the mixture of compounds 1 and 2 (MX, 1 and 2, the ratio of both compounds in n-BuOH Fr, 1.96:1) were evaluated for their ability to recover AXD PIs and for their K ATP channel-blocking mechanism using diazoxide in ZF. The n-BuOH Fr (10 μg/mL) and compounds 1 and MX (1 μg/mL) exhibited a recovery effect on AXD PIs. The n-BuOH Fr (10 μg/mL) and MX (1 μg/mL) were also confirmed to be useful K ATP channel activators. A synergistic effect of MX in the recovery of AXD PIs was first confirmed in ZF, and it was discovered that 2 acted as an insulin sensitivity activator that increased the activity of compound 1. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","3,5,6,9 tetrahydroxy 7 megastigmene; alloxan; antidiabetic agent; diazoxide; glimepiride; glucose; plant extract; tryptophan; unclassified drug; adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium channel; alloxan; insulin; plant extract; alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; chemical composition; column chromatography; comparative study; controlled study; drug isolation; drug structure; fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry; glucose transport; high performance liquid chromatography; infrared spectroscopy; insulin release; larva; Malva; Malva verticillata; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pancreas islet cell; priority journal; repeated column chromatography; synergistic effect; zebra fish; animal; chemical structure; chemically induced; chemistry; drug effect; drug potentiation; experimental diabetes mellitus; infrared spectrophotometry; insulin resistance; Malva; metabolism; pancreas disease; pancreas islet; pathology; phytotherapy; Alloxan; Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Drug Synergism; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Islets of Langerhans; KATP Channels; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Malva; Molecular Structure; Pancreatic Diseases; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Zebrafish"
"Post-exposure prophylaxis for Middle East respiratory syndrome in healthcare workers",2019,"An effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy may limit the spread of infection. However, there is no consensus regarding PEP for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. This study assessed the efficacy of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP for healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia. The safety of the PEP regimen was assessed. HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled. HCWs who received PEP therapy were classified into the PEP group. PEP therapy was associated with a 40% decrease in the risk of infection.

"Role of hydrogen sulfide in cerebrovascular alteration during aging",2019,"Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), a gasotransmitter molecule, has attracted attention as an endogenous signaling molecule because of its various pathological and physiological effects, including pathologies related to aging. In this review, we aimed to discuss the morphological changes in each vessel following aging, and to evaluate the possible role of H 2 S in the cerebrovascular alteration, such as arterial stiffness, microvessel loss, and blood–brain barrier disruption, with advancing age. Additionally, the review outlines the therapeutic efficacy of the H 2 S-releasing compounds on the cerebrovasculature. In the central nervous system, cerebrovascular aging can lead to the loss of blood–brain integrity, which causes cognitive impairment. The findings discussed in this review strongly support the notion that H 2 S has a potential therapeutic role in cerebrovascular alteration in aging. ? 2019, The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea.","hydrogen sulfide; neuroprotective agent; aging; animal; apoptosis; arterial stiffness; brain; brain circulation; cell aging; cognitive defect; disease model; drug effect; human; metabolism; microvasculature; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; vascular endothelium; vascularization; Aging; Animals; Apoptosis; Brain; Cellular Senescence; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Models, Animal; Endothelium, Vascular; Humans; Hydrogen Sulfide; Microvessels; Neuroprotective Agents; Signal Transduction; Vascular Stiffness"
"Black raspberry (Rubus coreanus miquel) promotes browning of preadipocytes and inguinal white adipose tissue in cold-induced mice",2019,"The alteration of white adipose tissue (WAT) “browning”, a change of white into beige fat, has been considered as a new therapeutic strategy to treat obesity. In this study, we investigated the browning effect of black raspberry (Rubus coreanus Miquel) using in vitro and in vivo models. Black raspberry water extract (BRWE) treatment inhibited lipid accumulation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and zebrafish. To evaluate the thermogenic activity, BRWE was orally administered for 2 weeks, and then, the mice were placed in a 4 °C environment. As a result, BRWE treatment increased rectal temperature and inguinalWAT (iWAT) thermogenesis by inducing the expression of beige fat specific markers such as PR domain zinc-finger protein 16 (PRDM16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), and t-box protein 1 (TBX1) in cold-exposed mice. Furthermore, ellagic acid (EA), a constituent of BRWE, markedly promoted beige specific markers: UCP1, PGC1α, TBX1, and nuclear respiratory factor 1 in beige differentiation media (DM)-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our findings indicate that BRWE can promote beige differentiation/activation, and EA is the active compound responsible for such effect. Thus, we suggest the nature-derived agents BRWE and EA as potential agents for obesity treatment. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Clinical significance of rituximab infusion-related reaction in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients receiving R-CHOP",2019,"Background/Aims: This study was to evaluate the clinical significance of infusion-related reaction (IRR) of rituximab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLB-CL) patients who received R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) as a first-line chemotherapy. Methods: The medical records of 326 patients diagnosed with DLBCL were re trospectively analyzed. Both doctor’s progress records and nursing records were reviewed. IRR was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria. Results: IRR was not associated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) of DLBCL patients as compared to those who did not have IRR (OS: median 78.0 months vs. 69.0 months, p = 0.700; PFS: median 65.4 months vs. 64.0 months, p = 0.901). IRR grade did not affect OS or PFS. B symptoms was independently associated with IRR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.850; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.041 to 3.290; p = 0.036). Further, bone marrow involvement was independently associated with re-IRR (HR, 4.904; 95% CI, 0.767 to 3.118; p = 0.029). Conclusions: Our study shows that IRR of rituximab is not associated with OS or PFS of DLBCL patients who received R-CHOP. Furthermore, our study suggests a need for more careful observation for IRR in patients with B symptoms or bone marrow involvement. ? 2019 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.","cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; prednisolone; rituximab; vincristine; antineoplastic agent; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; prednisone; R-CHOP protocol; rituximab; vincristine; adolescent; adult; aged; angioneurotic edema; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cause of death; chill; conjunctival hemorrhage; controlled study; coughing; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; disease course; dizziness; drug safety; dyspnea; electronic medical record; female; fever; follow up; hazard ratio; headache; heart arrhythmia; hot flush; human; hypotension; hypoxia; infusion related reaction; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; myalgia; nausea; neurologic disease; nose obstruction; overall survival; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; respiratory tract disease; skin tingling; subconjunctival hemorrhage; thorax pain; urticaria; vomiting; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; injection site reaction; intravenous drug administration; middle aged; mortality; retrospective study; risk factor; time factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Cyclophosphamide; Doxorubicin; Female; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Injection Site Reaction; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Male; Middle Aged; Prednisone; Progression-Free Survival; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rituximab; Time Factors; Vincristine; Young Adult"
"Effects of fermented Sorghum bicolor L. Moench extract on inflammation and thickness in a vascular cell and atherosclerotic mice model",2019,"Atherosclerosis is a major cause of coronary heart disease. As a result of the development of atherosclerotic lesions, the walls of blood vessels become thicker and inhibit blood circulation. Atherosclerosis is caused by a high-fat diet and vascular injury. Chronic arterial inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In particular, secretion of the pro-atherogenic cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α induces expression of endothelial adhesion molecules including P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which mediate attachment of circulating monocytes and lymphocytes. In this study, we examined the anti-atherosclerotic effect of sorghum, which is known to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. A 50% ethanol extract of Sorghum bicolor L. Moench fermented with Aspergillus oryzae NK (fSBE) was used for experiments. In vitro expression of endothelial adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and pro-inflammatory factor cyclooxygenase-2 was significantly decreased and that of the anti-atherogenic factor heme oxygenase-1 significantly increased by fSBE (P < 0.05). At the in vivo level, we examined fat droplets of liver tissue, and aortic thickness via histological analysis, and determined the blood lipid profile through chemical analysis. fSBE at a dose of 200?mg/kg significantly improved blood and vascular health (P < 0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrate that fSBE has potential as a therapeutic anti-atherosclerotic agent. ? 2018, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","alcohol; antiinflammatory agent; cardiovascular agent; cyclooxygenase 2; fenofibrate; heme oxygenase 1; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; plant extract; simvastatin; sorghum extract; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; arterial wall thickness; Article; Aspergillus oryzae; atherosclerosis; controlled study; drug effect; fermentation; histology; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid blood level; liver tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; sorghum; vasculitis; animal; atherosclerosis; chemistry; disease model; inflammation; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Inflammation; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Male; Mice; Sorghum"
"High-fat diet causes psychiatric disorders in mice by increasing Proteobacteria population",2019,"The excessive intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) leads to obesity, including metabolic syndromes, disturbs gut microbiota composition, causes colitis, and increases the plasma concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the present study, we examined the role of gut microbiota in the occurrence of HFD-induced psychiatric disorders in mice. C57BL/6 J male mice fed a HFD for 9 weeks were led to obesity; their memory impairment was assessed by the Y-maze and novel object recognition test, and anxiety-like behaviors by the elevated plus maze. The intake of a HFD suppressed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus and increased blood TNF-α and LPS levels. HFD treatment more potently increased NF-κB activation and Iba1 + (microglial) cell populations in the hippocampus. Furthermore, HFD feeding increased TNF-α expression, myeloperoxidase activity, and CD11b + /CD11c + cell (macrophages and dendritic cells) populations in the colon and altered gut microbiota composition including increases in the Proteobacteria population, and increases in fecal LPS levels. The stool lysates of HFD-treated mice suppressed BDNF expression and CREB phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells and increased NF-κB activation in BV-2 microglial cells compared to those of low-fat diet-treated mice while these effects were attenuated by treatment with anti-LPS antibody. These findings suggest that excessive intake of HFD can simultaneously cause obesity and psychiatric disorders by suppressing hippocampal BDNF expression with the disturbance of gut microbiota composition, particularly the increase in Proteobacteria population and LPS production. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","brain derived neurotrophic factor; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipopolysaccharide; myeloperoxidase; tumor necrosis factor; Bdnf protein, mouse; brain derived neurotrophic factor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety disorder; Article; cell population; colitis; controlled study; dendritic cell; embryo; enzyme activity; feces; hippocampus; intestine flora; lipid diet; lipid storage; low fat diet; male; maze test; memory disorder; mental disease; microglia; mouse; nonhuman; novel object recognition test; obesity; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; Proteobacteria; SH-SY5Y cell line; adverse event; animal; anxiety; C57BL mouse; cell line; cognitive defect; colon disease; germfree animal; inflammation; lipid diet; memory disorder; mental disease; metabolism; microbiology; obesity; physiology; Proteobacteria; psychology; Animals; Anxiety; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cell Line; Cognition Disorders; Colonic Diseases; Diet, High-Fat; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Hippocampus; Inflammation; Memory Disorders; Mental Disorders; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; NF-kappa B; Obesity; Proteobacteria; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"
"Optimizing Outcome Prediction Scores in Patients Undergoing Endovascular Thrombectomy for Large Vessel Occlusions Using Collateral Grade on Computed Tomography Angiography",2019,"BACKGROUND: Although several outcome prediction scores incorporated with pretreatment variables have been developed for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, there is not currently a prediction score that includes pretreatment imaging that can show salvageable brain tissue. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether addition of the collateral grade on computed tomography angiography to previously published prediction scores could increase accuracy of clinical outcome prediction in endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for AIS. METHODS: This study used a retrospective multicenter registry for patients undergoing EVT for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Three previously published outcome prediction scores (Houston intra-Arterial therapy 2, HIAT2; totaled health risks in vascular events, THRIVE; and Pittsburgh response to endovascular therapy, PRE scores) were tested in this study. Using 482 deprivation cohorts, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC-ROCs) were compared between prediction scores with/without collateral grades in predicting the poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 4-6 at 3-mo follow-up) after EVT. We developed modified prediction scores by adding the collateral grade, and their advancement of outcome prediction was validated using 208 independent validation cohorts. RESULTS: AUC-ROCs of HIAT2, THRIVE, and PRE scores that incorporated with collateral grade were superior in predicting poor outcomes when compared to that of the unmodified scores (P < 0.001). In modified prediction models, 3, 3, and 10 points were added for poor collateral grade to HIAT2, THRIVE, and PRE score. Modified models outperformed unmodified models in testing of the validation cohorts (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The addition of the collateral grade to outcome prediction scores resulted in better prediction of poor outcome after EVT for AIS compared to the prediction scores alone. ?

"Screening capacity and cost-effectiveness of the human papillomavirus test versus cervicography as an adjunctive test to Pap cytology to detect high-grade cervical dysplasia",2019,"Objective: This study compared the screening capacities and cost-effectiveness of the human papillomavirus (HPV) test versus cervicography as an adjunctive test to Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology to detect high-grade cervical neoplasia in Korea, a country with a high prevalence of cervical cancer. Study design: Of 33,531 Korean women who underwent cervicography as a screening test for cervical cancer between January 2015 and December 2016, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 4117 women who simultaneously or subsequently underwent Pap cytology, an HPV test, cervicography, and colposcopically directed biopsy. At a threshold of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), based on colposcopic biopsy, we compared the diagnostic capacities and cost-effectiveness of these screening tools. Results: The CIN2+ prevalence was 10.8% (446 of 4117 women) and the positive rate of high-risk HPV was 61.0% (2511 of 4117 women). Cervicography as an adjunctive to Pap cytology was a more sensitive test (97.5% vs 93.7%) with a higher odds ratio (15.65 vs 5.86) than the HPV test for detection of CIN2+ (P-value = 0.003). Moreover, the cost of cervicography co-testing was 23% less than that of HPV co-testing, decreasing the cost per patient with CIN2+ lesions from $1474 to $1135. Conclusion: Cervicography and Pap co-testing had superior screening capacity and cost-effectiveness for detection of preinvasive cervical lesions than HPV and Pap co-testing and may be an effective and cost-saving screening strategy in clinical practice in country with a high prevalence of cervical cancer. ? 2019","adult; Article; cervicography; cost effectiveness analysis; DNA sequence; female; gynecological examination; health care cost; health care system; human; human papillomavirus test; human tissue; Korea; major clinical study; Papanicolaou test; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix dysplasia; virus detection; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; diagnostic imaging; economics; mass screening; middle aged; odds ratio; Papanicolaou test; Papillomaviridae; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; South Korea; uterine cervix; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix tumor; vagina smear; virology; Adult; Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Cervix Uteri; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Papanicolaou Test; Papillomaviridae; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Smears"
"Radiologic serosal invasion sign as a new criterion of T4a gastric cancer on computed tomography: diagnostic performance and prognostic significance in patients with advanced gastric cancer",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic performance and prognostic significance of a new criterion for radiologic T4a staging on computed tomography (CT) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Methods: Between January 2010 and April 2019, 101 patients with pathologically confirmed gastric cancer were collected. Among them, 53 patients with pathologic T3 and T4a cancers were included in this study. Three reviewers assessed preoperative CT scans for radiologic T staging in two sessions, independently and in consensus at a 2-week interval, while blinded about the pathologic T stage. The radiologic serosal invasion sign was defined as a nodular extension from the outer gastric wall reaching beyond the perigastric vascular plane and adopted as a new CT criterion for T4a cancer. We evaluated the diagnostic performance, interobserver agreement, and prognostic significance of this sign for the postoperative recurrence. Results: There were 46 pathologic T3 cancers (86.7%) and seven pathologic T4a cancers (13.2%). The diagnostic performance of the radiologic serosal invasion sign in the differentiation between T3 and T4a cancers was as follows: sensitivity, 91.3%; specificity, 71.43%; and accuracy, 88.68% for R1 and sensitivity, 78.26%; specificity, 85.71%; and accuracy, 79.25% for R2. The k-value was 0.64. Among the clinical and pathologic variables, radiologic T4a sign [hazard ratio (HR): 7.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36–26.86, p = 0.001], pathologic T4a (HR 9.82, 95% CI 2.35–40.95, p = 0.002), tumor size (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02–1.35, p = 0.026), and lymphovascular invasion (HR 6.39, 95% CI 1.42–28.75, p = 0.015) were the significant factors for postoperative recurrence. Conclusions: Radiologic serosal invasion sign is reliable as a new CT criterion for T4a cancer staging in patients with advanced gastric cancer, demonstrating 80% to 88% accuracy. Radiologic serosal invasion sign can also serve as a prognostic factor for postoperative recurrence as well as pathologic T4a stage. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Decellularized human periodontal ligament for periodontium regeneration",2019,"Regenerating the periodontal ligament (PDL) is a crucial factor for periodontal tissue regeneration in the presence of traumatized and periodontally damaged teeth. Various methods have been applied for periodontal regeneration, including tissue substitutes, bioactive materials, and synthetic scaffolds. However, all of these treatments have had limited success in structural and functional periodontal tissue regeneration. To achieve the goal of complete periodontal regeneration, many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of decellularized scaffolds fabricated via tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to fabricate a decellularized periodontal scaffold of human tooth slices and determine its regeneration potential. We evaluated two different protocols applied to tooth slices obtained from human healthy third molars. The extracellular matrix scaffold decellularized using sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100, which are effective in removing nuclear components, was demonstrated to preserve an intact structure and composition. Furthermore, the decellularized scaffold could support repopulation of PDL stem cells near the cementum and expressed cementum and periodontal-ligament-related genes. These results show that decellularized PDL scaffolds of human teeth are capable of inducing the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, thus having regeneration potential for use in future periodontal regenerative tissue engineering. ? 2019 Son et al.

"Diagnostic performance of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasonography for acute appendicitis: A meta-analysis",2019,"Objective: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasonography (EP-POCUS) for diagnosing acute appendicitis (AA). Material and methods: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched, and the diagnostic performance of EP-POCUS was evaluated using bivariate modeling and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Subgroup analysis was performed for pediatric patients to compare EP-POCUS and radiologist-performed ultrasonography (RADUS). Meta-regression analyses were performed according to patient and study characteristics. Results: In 17 studies (2385 patients), EP-POCUS for diagnosing AA exhibited a pooled sensitivity of 84% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 72%–92%) and a pooled specificity of 91% (95% CI: 85%–95%), with even better diagnostic performance for pediatric AA (sensitivity: 95%, 95% CI: 75%–99%; specificity: 95%, 95% CI: 85%–98%). A direct comparison revealed no significant differences (p = 0.18–0.85) between the diagnostic performances of EP-POCUS (sensitivity: 81%, 95% CI: 61%–90%; specificity: 89%, 95% CI: 77%–95%) and RADUS (sensitivity: 74%, 95% CI: 65%–81%; specificity: 97%, 95% CI: 93%–98%). The meta-regression analyses revealed that study location, AA proportion, and mean age were sources of heterogeneity. Higher sensitivity and specificity tended to be associated with an appendix diameter cut-off value of 7 mm and the EP as the initial operator. Conclusion: The diagnostic performances of EP-POCUS and RADUS were excellent for AA, with EP-POCUS having even better performance for pediatric AA. Accurate diagnoses may be achieved when the attending EP is the initial POCUS operator and uses a 7-mm cut-off value. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","acute appendicitis; age; appendix; Article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease association; echography; emergency physician; human; meta analysis; point of care testing; practice guideline; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; acute disease; appendicitis; diagnostic imaging; hospital emergency service; pathology; point of care system; Acute Disease; Appendicitis; Appendix; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Point-of-Care Systems; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography"
"Natural products hybrids: 3,5,4′-Trimethoxystilbene-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone chimeric analogs as potential cytotoxic agents against diverse human cancer cells",2019,"Cancer still represents a major global health problem. All currently available anticancer agents have disadvantages like resistance or side effects. Therefore, introduction of novel anticancer agents is needed. Intrigued by the high success rate for natural products-based drug discovery, we designed and synthesized antiproliferative chemical entities as hybrids of two natural products; 3,5,4′-trimethoxystilbene and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone. To probe the spectrum of the synthesized compounds, in vitro evaluation was conducted against nine panels representing major cancer diseases. The results revealed the hybrid analogs 4f, 4h, 4k and 4q as promising broad-spectrum anticancer lead compounds eliciting high growth inhibition of several cell lines representing multiple cancers diseases.

"Machine learning based hierarchical classification of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease",2019,"Background: In a clinical setting, an individual subject classification model rather than a group analysis would be more informative. Specifically, the subtlety of cortical atrophy in some frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients and overlapping patterns of atrophy among three FTD clinical syndromes including behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and semantic variant PPA (svPPA) give rise to the need for classification models at the individual level. In this study, we aimed to classify each individual subject into one of the diagnostic categories in a hierarchical manner by employing a machine learning-based classification method. Methods: We recruited 143 patients with FTD, 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and 146 cognitively normal subjects. All subjects underwent a three-dimensional volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer. We applied the Laplace Beltrami operator to reduce noise in the cortical thickness data and to reduce the dimension of the feature vector. Classifiers were constructed by applying both principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to the cortical thickness data. For the hierarchical classification, we trained four classifiers using different pairs of groups: Step 1 - CN vs. FTD + AD, Step 2 - FTD vs. AD, Step 3 - bvFTD vs. PPA, Step 4 - svPPA vs. nfvPPA. To evaluate the classification performance for each step, we used a10-fold cross-validation approach, performed 1000 times for reliability. Results: The classification accuracy of the entire hierarchical classification tree was 75.8%, which was higher than that of the non-hierarchical classifier (73.0%). The classification accuracies of steps 1–4 were 86.1%, 90.8%, 86.9%, and 92.1%, respectively. Changes in the right frontotemporal area were critical for discriminating behavioral variant FTD from PPA. The left frontal lobe discriminated nfvPPA from svPPA, while the bilateral anterior temporal regions were critical for identifying svPPA. Conclusions: In the present study, our automated classifier successfully classified FTD clinical subtypes with good to excellent accuracy. Our classifier may help clinicians diagnose FTD subtypes with subtle cortical atrophy and facilitate appropriate specific interventions. ? 2019","florbetaben; flutemetamol f 18; adult; aged; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain cortex atrophy; clinical assessment; controlled study; corpus striatum; cortical thickness (brain); dementia; diagnostic accuracy; discriminant analysis; disease classification; female; frontal lobe; frontal variant frontotemporal dementia; frontotemporal dementia; functional neuroimaging; human; image analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; posterior cingulate; precuneus; primary progressive aphasia; principal component analysis; priority journal; temporal lobe"
"Clinical usefulness of bioavailable Vitamin D and impact of GC genotyping on the determination of bioavailable Vitamin D in a Korean population",2019,"Background. Bioavailable 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) has been suggested for the accurate determination of vitamin D status. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of bioavailable 25(OH)D in assessing vitamin D status when vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) was significantly altered by pregnancy and liver cirrhosis (LC). The role of genotyping of GC, a gene encoding VDBP, in the determination of bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration in a Korean population was also evaluated. Methods. This prospective study enrolled a total of 136 subjects (53 healthy controls, 45 patients with LC, and 38 pregnant women) from 2017 to 2018. The concentrations of total 25(OH)D and VDBP were measured, and bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations were calculated. GC genotyping was performed to determine rs4588 and rs7041 polymorphisms. Clinical and laboratory data were compared among the three groups of subjects. Results. Median VDBP and total 25(OH)D concentrations were 165.2 μg/ml and 18.5 ng/ml in healthy controls, 76.9 μg/ml and 10.5 ng/ml in patients with LC, and 368.9 μg/ml and 17.7 ng/ml in pregnant women, respectively. Compared with controls, patients diagnosed with LC had significantly lower VDBP and total 25(OH)D concentrations (all P < 0 001) while pregnant women had significantly higher VDBP concentrations (P < 0 001). Although total 25(OH)D concentrations in pregnant women were similar to those in controls (P = 0 394), their bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower (1.2 vs. 3.0 ng/ml; P < 0 001). Among all the three groups combined, the genotype-specific bioavailable 25(OH)D and the genotype-independent bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations did not differ significantly (P = 0 299). Conclusions. Our study has demonstrated that bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration reflects vitamin D status more accurately than the total 25(OH)D concentration, especially in pregnant women. In addition, GC genotyping did not significantly affect bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration. Therefore, if VDBP concentration is significantly altered, the measurement of bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration might facilitate the accurate determination of vitamin D status. However, GC genotyping might be unnecessary. ? 2019 Hyun-Young Kim et al.

"Slow heart rate recovery is associated with increased exercise-induced arterial stiffness in normotensive patients without overt atherosclerosis",2019,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether blunted autonomic activity as measured by heart rate recovery (HRR) was associated with increased arterial stiffness, especially increased exercise-induced arterial stiffness, in normotensive patients without overt atherosclerosis. METHODS: One hundred fifty-four normotensive patients without overt atherosclerosis who had undergone a treadmill exercise test were consecutively enrolled. HRR was measured at one minute after exercise. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) at rest was measured, and carotid arterial stiffness indices at rest (CSI at rest) and after exercise (CSI after exercise) were assessed. RESULTS: Patients with slow HRR were older and tended to be male, and they had diabetes, higher resting and peak systolic blood pressures, higher resting heart rate, lower peak heart rate, lower metabolic equivalents, increased baPWV, and increased CSIs at rest and after exercise. HRR was inversely associated with baPWV and CSI after exercise when established cardiovascular risk factors were adjusted as confounding factors, and HRR was associated with CSI after exercise when resting systolic blood pressure and metabolic equivalent of tasks on cardiovascular risk factors were added as confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Sympathovagal imbalance demonstrated by slow HRR was associated with increased arterial stiffness and, above all, was closely associated with exercise-induced arterial stiffness in normotensive patients without overt atherosclerosis. This phenomenon might have been observed because blunt carotid arterial vasomotion following exercise results from autonomic dysfunction as well as vascular endothelial dysfunction. ? 2019 Korean Society of Echocardiography.","adult; ankle brachial index; arterial stiffness; arterial stiffness index; Article; atherosclerosis; autonomic dysfunction; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular parameters; cardiovascular risk; diastolic blood pressure; dyspnea; echography; exercise; female; heart rate; human; major clinical study; male; metabolic equivalent; middle aged; plethysmography; pulse wave; stress echocardiography; sympathovagal imbalance; systolic blood pressure; thorax pain; treadmill exercise"

"Effect of Dehydrocostus Lactone Isolated from the Roots of Aucklandia lappa on the Apoptosis of Endometriotic Cells and the Alternative Activation of Endometriosis-Associated Macrophages",2019,"The roots of Aucklandia lappa have been used in traditional medicine in Asia to treat inflammation and diseases associated with pain, including endometriosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-endometriotic effect of dehydrocostus lactone, an active compound in A. lappa roots, using human endometriotic cells and macrophages stimulated by these cells. Dehydrocostus lactone induced apoptotic cell death in 12Z human endometriotic cells. Dehydrocostus lactone stimulated the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, while caspase inhibitors significantly reversed the dehydrocostus lactone-induced cell death in 12Z cells. In addition, dehydrocostus lactone decreased the production of PGE2 and neurotrophins (BDNF, NGF, NT3, and NT4/5), which are regarded as endometriosis-associated pain factors in human endometriotic cells. Moreover, dehydrocostus lactone inhibited the expression of M2 markers (CD206, and Trem-2), IL-10, VEGF, and MMP-2/-9 in endometriosis-associated macrophages (EAMs). Furthermore, dehydrocostus lactone inhibited the Akt and NFκB pathways in both endometriotic cells and EAMs. Taken together, our findings suggest that dehydrocostus lactone, an active compound of A, lappa, has anti-endometriotic activities via induction of apoptosis and downregulation of pain factors in endometriotic cells and inhibition of the alternative activation of EAMs. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","antiinflammatory agent; brain derived neurotrophic factor; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; caspase inhibitor; dehydrocostus lactone; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 10; nerve growth factor; neurotrophin 3; neurotrophin 4; prostaglandin E2; protein kinase B; Saussurea lappa extract; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; vasculotropin; caspase; cell surface receptor; dehydrocostus lactone; interleukin 10; lactone; lectin; mannose binding lectin; mannose receptor; nerve growth factor; prostaglandin E2; sesquiterpene; 12Z cell line; Akt signaling; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; drug isolation; drug synthesis; endometriosis; enzyme activation; female; human; human cell; macrophage; macrophage activation; plant root; prostaglandin synthesis; protein expression; apoptosis; cell line; chemical stimulation; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; endometriosis; endometrium; immunology; isolation and purification; metabolism; phytotherapy; Saussurea; traditional medicine; Apoptosis; Caspases; Cell Line; Dinoprostone; Endometriosis; Endometrium; Female; Humans; Interleukin-10; Lactones; Lectins, C-Type; Macrophage Activation; Mannose-Binding Lectins; Medicine, Traditional; Nerve Growth Factors; Phytotherapy; Plant Roots; Receptors, Cell Surface; Saussurea; Sesquiterpenes; Stimulation, Chemical"
"Conditioned media from adipocytes promote proliferation, migration, and invasion in melanoma and colorectal cancer cells",2019,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that obesity can significantly increase the risk of various cancers, although the mechanisms underlying this link are completely unknown. Here, we analyzed the effect of adipocytes on melanoma and colon cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. The potential effects of conditioned media (CM) obtained from differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 cells and human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSC) on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of B16BL6 melanoma and colon 26-L5 cancer cells were investigated. The 3T3-L1 and hAMSC CM increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in both the cell lines. In addition, adipocytes CM increased matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 activity in both B16BL6 and colon 26-L5 cells. These effects were found to be associated with an increased expression of various oncogenic proteins in B16BL6 and colon 26-L5 cells. Also, adipocyte CM induced Akt and mTOR activation in both tumor cell lines, and the pharmacological inhibition of Akt and mTOR blocked the CM induced Akt as well as mTOR activation and CM-stimulated melanoma and colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These data suggest that adipocyte promotes melanoma and colon cancer progression through modulating the expression of diverse proteins associated with cancer growth and metastasis as well as modulation of the Akt/mTOR signaling. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","gelatinase A; gelatinase B; mammalian target of rapamycin; oncoprotein; protein kinase B; 26 l5 cell line; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; adipose tissue; Akt/mTOR signaling; animal cell; Article; B16-BL6 cell line; cancer growth; cell differentiation; cell migration; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; colorectal cancer cell line; enzyme activity; human; human cell; human tissue; melanoma; mesenchymal stem cell; metastasis; nonhuman; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein expression; tumor invasion"
"Metabolic syndrome is associated with hearing disturbance",2019,"Background: Although metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been associated with various diseases, few studies to date have addressed the association between MetS and hearing loss. Aims/Objectives: This cross-sectional review of health examination center data sought to determine the association between MetS and hearing disturbance. Material and methods: This study involved 28,866 subjects. Height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured, and basic blood tests and pure-tone audiometry (PTA) were performed. Other factors analyzed included body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Results: Age and gender did not differ between subjects with and without MetS. PTA was slightly higher in subjects with than without MetS, but the difference was not statistically significant (p =.47). The incidence of hearing loss was no higher in subjects who met three of the five diagnostic criteria of MetS than in those who met 0–2 criteria, but was significantly higher in subjects who met four (p =.04) and five (p <.01) criteria. Conclusions and Significance: MetS may be associated with hearing loss, especially in subjects who meet four or five of the diagnostic criteria for MetS. ? 2019, ? 2019 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd).","adult; age distribution; aged; Article; blood examination; blood pressure measurement; body height; body mass; body weight; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; hearing impairment; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; priority journal; pure tone audiometry; retrospective study; sex difference; waist circumference; adolescent; complication; hearing impairment; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; South Korea; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Hearing Loss; Humans; Incidence; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult"
"Integrated transcriptome and in vitro analysis revealed anti-proliferative effect of citral in human stomach cancer through apoptosis",2019,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, particularly stomach cancer is third most common causes of cancer death worldwide. Citral possesses anti-tumor activity in various cancer cell lines, However its effect toward stomach cancer and its mechanism of action is have yet to be elucidated. The goal of the present study is to elucidate the role of citral in stomach cancer using transcriptome and in vitro approaches. We performed transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq and explored its capability to persuade apoptosis in AGS human stomach cancer cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, the enrichment and KEGG pathway results suggested that there are several genes involved to induce apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, our study also demonstrated that citral arrested colony formation and migration of cancer cells significantly than that of untreated cells. RNA-seq revealed a total of 125 million trimmed reads obtained from both control and citral treated groups respectively. A total number of 612 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified which includes 216 genes up-regulated and 396 genes down-regulated genes after treatment. The enrichment analysis identified DEGs genes from transcriptome libraries including cell death, cell cycle, apoptosis and cell growth. The present study showed the significant inhibition effect upon citral by regulating various genes involved in signaling pathways, inhibits metastasis, colony formation and induced apoptosis both in silico and in vitro. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Effect of remifentanil and midazolam on ED95 of propofol for loss of consciousness in elderly patients: A randomized, clinical trial",2019,"BACKGROUND: Older people are more vulnerable to hemodynamic instability caused by propofol due to their decreased initial distribution volume and increased sensitivity to propofol. Midazolam or remifentanil can often be coadministered because of their synergistic or additive effects with propofol as well as amnesic properties and the blockade of sympathetic stimulation. However, no study has confirmed the appropriate dose of propofol for loss of consciousness in aged patients when administered with other drugs, including opioids or benzodiazepines. METHODS: Patients >65 years scheduled for general anesthesia were enrolled. The patients were randomized into 3 groups using a computer-generated randomization table. Patients in group P (propofol) received only propofol for loss of consciousness, those in group PR (propofol-remifentanil) received remifentanil before propofol, and those in group PMR (propofol-midazolam-remifentanil) received remifentanil and midazolam before propofol. After propofol administration, loss of both eyelash reflex and verbal response represented success. The 95% effective dose of propofol for loss of consciousness in each group, which was the primary outcome, was determined using a modified biased coin up-and-down method. RESULTS: In total, 120 patients were randomized into the 3 groups (n?=?40). The 95% effective dose of propofol for loss of consciousness was 1.13, 0.87, and 0.72?mg/kg in groups P, PR, and PMR, respectively. The mean blood pressure (MBP) in group PMR was more significantly decreased before propofol injection (P?=?.041) as well as 2 minutes (P?=?.005) and 3 minutes after propofol administration (P<.001), compared with group P, but there were no intergroup differences at other time points. CONCLUSIONS: The effective dose of propofol for loss of consciousness in elderly patients could be decreased by 23% and 36% when remifentanil pretreatment was used without and with midazolam, respectively. However, the decrease in MBP was greater with remifentanil and midazolam pretreatment than with propofol alone. These findings suggest that pretreatment with midazolam for propofol infusions with remifentanil in elderly patients should be cautiously used, due to hemodynamic instability during induction.","intravenous anesthetic agent; midazolam; propofol; remifentanil; aged; combination drug therapy; consciousness; controlled study; dose response; drug effect; elderly care; female; general anesthesia; human; male; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Aged; Anesthesia, General; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Consciousness; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Health Services for the Aged; Humans; Male; Midazolam; Propofol; Remifentanil; Treatment Outcome"

"Didymin, a dietary citrus flavonoid exhibits anti-diabetic complications and promotes glucose uptake through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells",2019,"Didymin is a naturally occurring orally active flavonoid glycoside (isosakuranetin 7-O-rutinoside) found in various citrus fruits, which has been previously reported to possess a wide variety of pharmacological activities including anticancer, antioxidant, antinociceptive, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, inflammatory, and cardiovascular. However, there have not been any reports concerning its anti-diabetic potential until now. Therefore, we evaluated the anti-diabetic potential of didymin via inhibition of α-glucosidase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant AR (HRAR), and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation inhibitory assays. Didymin strongly inhibited PTP1B, α-glucosidase, HRAR, RLAR, and AGE in the corresponding assays. Kinetic study revealed that didymin exhibited a mixed type inhibition against α-glucosidase and HRAR, while it competitively inhibited PTP1B and RLAR. Docking simulations of didymin demonstrated negative binding energies and close proximity to residues in the binding pocket of HRAR, RLAR, PTP1B and α-glucosidase, indicating that didymin have high affinity and tight binding capacity towards the active site of these enzymes. Furthermore, we also examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of didymin in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells which significantly increased glucose uptake and decreased the expression of PTP1B in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. In addition, didymin activated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 by increasing phosphorylation at tyrosine 895 and enhanced the phosphorylations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and glycogen synthasekinase-3(GSK-3). Interestingly, didymin reduced the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase, two key enzymes involved in the gluconeogenesis and leading to a diminished glucose production. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that didymin will be useful for developing multiple target-oriented therapeutic modalities for treatment of diabetes, and diabetes-associated complications. ? 2019","advanced glycation end product; aldehyde reductase; alpha glucosidase; antidiabetic agent; bioflavonoid; didymin; glucose; glucose 6 phosphatase; glycogen synthase kinase 3; insulin receptor substrate 1; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); protein kinase B; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; reactive oxygen metabolite; recombinant aldehyde reductase; recombinant enzyme; tyrosine; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; didymin; flavonoid; glucose; glucose 6 phosphatase; glycogen synthase kinase 3; glycoside; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; binding affinity; competitive inhibition; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug structure; drug targeting; enzyme activation; enzyme active site; enzyme inhibition; enzyme kinetics; gluconeogenesis; glucose transport; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; insulin resistance; molecular docking; nonhuman; Pi3K/Akt signaling; protein analysis; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; rat; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; chemistry; Citrus; drug effect; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; insulin resistance; metabolism; signal transduction; alpha-Glucosidases; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Citrus; Flavonoids; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Glucose-6-Phosphatase; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Glycosides; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Molecular Docking Simulation; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction"
"Verification of low risk for perihippocampal recurrence in patients with brain metastases who received whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance",2019,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze the patterns of failure and survival outcome in patients with brain metastases who received whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance (HA) using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) on metastatic brain tumors. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients treated with HA-WBRT for brain metastases. A total of 25 Gy for whole brain and 35-55 Gy for gross tumors were delivered with 10 fractionations. Local tumor and intracranial progression were defined as a recurrence or tumor progression in SIB field and any recurrence or tumor progression within whole brain, respectively. Progression in HA zone was defined as the recurrence within the area expanded 5 mm from HA zone. Results Median follow-up duration was 10.0 months (range, 4.1 to 56.4 months). Intracranial progression was observed in 13 patients (31.0%) and the median duration from the start of HA-WBRT to progression was 10.6 months (range, 0.9 to 33.0 months). Local tumor progression and new metastasis outside SIB field occurred in 10 patients (23.8%) and nine patients (21.4%), respectively. There was no isolated hippocampal metastasis, except only one patient (2.4%) with multiple metastases inside and outside HA zone simultaneously. Median survival time and intracranial progression-free survival rate at 1 year were 19.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6 to 29.2) and 71.5%, respectively, and those for overall survival were 26.5 months (95% CI, 15.4 to 37.5) and 67.9%, respectively. Conclusion HA-WBRT was associated with low risk of new metastasis in HA region in the patients with brain metastases. These findings would serve as useful guidance on applying HA-WBRT in clinical practice.

Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards assumption, hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident MetS (adjusted HRs [95% CI]) were calculated according to baseline fasting glucose and HbA1c. In individuals with normal fasting glucose, subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate an association of HbA1c levels with MetS. Results: The risk for MetS significantly increased proportionally to fasting glucose ? 80?mg/dL and HbA1c ? 5.5%, compared with fating glucose < 80?mg/dL and HbA1c < 5.3%, respectively. In subgroups of normal fasting glucose, HbA1c ? 5.7% had the increased risk of MetS in fasting glucose < 80?mg/dL (5.7–5.9%: 1.41 [1.07–1.86] and 6.0–6.4%: 2.20 [1.40–2.92]), and HbA1c ? 5.5% had the increased risk of MetS in fasting glucose of 80–99?mg/dL (5.5–5.6%: 1.33 [1.08–1.64], 5.7–5.9%: 1.57 (1.27–1.93), and 6.0–6.4%: 2.37 [1.87–3.00]). Conclusions: Both elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c were significantly associated with the increased risk of MetS even within normal range. HbA1c is effective in identifying high-risk group for MetS in individuals with normal fasting glucose. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.","glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; analysis; blood; cohort analysis; diet restriction; female; glucose blood level; human; male; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; proportional hazards model; risk factor; South Korea; Adult; Blood Glucose; Cohort Studies; Fasting; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors"
"Usefulness of the psoriatic arthritis screening and evaluation questionnaire to monitor disease activity in management of patients with psoriasis: Findings from the EPI-PSODE study",2019,"Background: Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are included in the group of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) caused by systemic inflammation; however, indicators for monitoring inflammatory activity in patients with psoriasis, such as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), are limited. Objective: To determine whether the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation (PASE) questionnaire can be used to monitor disease activity in patients with psoriasis. Methods: This was a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Demographic factors and PASI and PASE scores were collected to investigate associations between each. Results: PASE data were available for 1,255 patients, of whom 498 (39.7%) had a score of ?37. Compared with the group with PASE score ＜37, the group with score ?37 had a higher proportion of women (34.9% vs. 48.8%, p＜0.0001), older mean age at diagnosis (36.4 vs. 41.7 years, p＜0.0001), more severe disease activity using PASI and body surface area measures (p=0.0021 and p=0.0008, respectively), and higher mean body mass index (23.7 vs. 24.1, p=0.0411). In a multiple linear regression model, PASE score was positively associated with cutaneous disease activity (p＜0.0001). Conclusion: After risk-adjustment, PASE was positively associated with PASI, which suggests that PASE can be sensitive to disease activity. Since psoriasis is regarded as one of the IMIDs, PASE may be utilized as a tool not only to screen PsA but also to monitor disease activity. Copyright ?

"Hydrazine expos?: The next-generation fluorescent probe",2019,"Hydrazine (N 2 H 4 ) is one of the most important pnictogen hydride chemicals, and is utilized within a wide spectrum of industries. As a result of its extensive use, hydrazine's monitoring methods have constantly come under fire due to its potential health risk and the subsequent environmental pollution. Fluorometric molecular sensing systems generally report with a major emphasis on the merit of fluorescence analysis. What we are proposing within this report is a next-generation fluorescent probe that allows hydrazine to become fully traceable, within multifarious environments that show fast and intuitional fluorescence transformation. A new sensing moiety, ortho-methoxy-methyl-ether (o-OMOM) incorporated electron donor (D)-Acceptor (A) type naphthaldehyde provides high selectivity and sensitivity amidst its superiority within practical applications for sensing hydrazine. The new probe overcomes most of the drawbacks of currently used fluorescent probes, and due to its successful demonstrations, such as real-Time spray-based sensing, soil analysis, and two-photon tissue imaging, its potential for practical application is beyond reproach. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Chemical sensors; Exhibitions; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Health risks; Hydrazine; Photons; Probes; Tissue; Environmental pollutions; Fluorescence analysis; Fluorescent probes; Hydrazones; Molecular sensing; Monitoring methods; Potential health risks; Tissue imaging; Fluorescence"
"Distribution of monetary incentives in health insurance scheme influences acupuncture treatment choices: An experimental study",2019,"Background Understanding how doctors respond to occupational and monetary incentives in health care payment systems is important for determining the effectiveness of such systems. This study examined changes in doctors' behaviors in response to monetary incentives within health care payment systems in a ceteris paribus setting. Methods An online experiment was developed to analyze the effect of monetary incentives similar to fee-for-service (FFS) and capitation (CAP) on doctors' prescription patterns. In the first session, no monetary values were presented. In the second session conducted 1 week later, doctors were randomly assigned to one of two monetary incentive groups (FFS group: n = 25, CAP group: n = 25). In all sessions, doctors were presented with 10 cases and asked to determine the type and number of treatments. Results In the first session with no monetary incentives, there was no significant difference between the FFS and CAP groups in the number of treatments. When monetary incentives were provided, doctors in the CAP group prescribed fewer treatments than the FFS group. The perceived severity of the cases did not change significantly between sessions and between groups. linear mixed-effects regression model indicated the treatment choices were influenced by monetary incentives, but not by the perceived severity of the patient's symptoms. Conclusion The monetary values incentivized the doctors' treatment choices, but not their professional evaluation of patients. Monetary values designed within health care systems influence the doctor's decisions in the form of external rewards, in addition to occupational values, and can thus be adjusted by more effective incentives. ? 2019 Lee et al.","acupuncture; adult; article; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; experimental study; female; health care system; health insurance; human; male; prescription; randomized controlled trial; reward"
"Etiology, characteristics, and outcomes of community-onset necrotizing fasciitis in Korea: A multicenter study",2019,"Background Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a serious skin and soft tissue infection causing high mortality. Investigating region specific epidemiologic factors associated with NF is important for establishing appropriate treatment strategies. This multicenter study was done to provide an update of the microbial etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of NF in Korea. Materials and methods A retrospective cohort of adult patients with NF was established using patient data from 13 general hospitals between January 2012 and December 2015 in Korea. We evaluated microbial etiology and clinical characteristics to identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality; analyses were performed using binary logistic regression models. Results A total of 161 patients with NF were included. The most common underlying disease was diabetes mellitus (66 cases, 41.0%). A total of 148 organisms were isolated from 119 (73.9%) patients. Enteric Gram-negative organisms (36 patients) were the most common pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (30 patients) and streptococci (28 patients). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified in 6.2% (10/161) of patients. Of 37 enteric Gram-negative isolates tested, 26 (70.3%) isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. The in-hospital mortality rate was 22.4%. Intensive care unit admission, septic shock, and Gram-negative organism infections were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, and surgery was not a favorable prognostic factor. Conclusions As initial empirical antibiotics, glycopeptides against MRSA and broad-spectrum antibiotics against third-generation cephalosporin-resistant organisms should be considered for patients with community-onset NF in Korea. ? 2019 Kim et al.

"Inhibitory effects of Cheongsangbangpoong-tang on both inflammatory acne lesion and facial heat in patients with acne vulgaris: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial",2019,"Objectives: To investigate the inhibitory effects of an herbal formulation of Cheongsangbangpoong-tang (CBT) on inflammatory acne lesions as the control of the ‘Heat’ pattern. Design: A single center study. Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind trial Setting: Fifty-six subjects, who had more than 10 acne inflammatory lesions each, were randomly allocated into the CBT or placebo groups and took 5 g CBT extract (CBT group) or 5 g placebo extract (control group), respectively, three times a day for 8 weeks. Pattern identification, change of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions, temperature of the facial points, serum cortisol level, serum dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate level, number rating scale, investigator global assessment (IGA), and severity score on the Korean acne grading system were measured. Main outcome measure: mean change of the inflammatory acne lesions. Results: After CBT/placebo administration, the percentage count of inflammatory lesions in subjects was significantly reduced in the CBT group when compared with the control group. The other outcomes showed no significant difference between the two groups. On pattern identification, subjects with the Wind-Heat pattern (風熱型, WHP) and Disharmony of the thoroughfare and conception vessels pattern (衝任不調型, DTCVP) tended show better effect than those with other patterns. Conclusions: CBT is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of acne vulgaris, linked to inhibition of inflammatory lesions and facial heat.

"Potential of zerumbone as an anti-cancer agent",2019,"Cancer is still a major risk factor to public health globally, causing approximately 9.8 million deaths worldwide in 2018. Despite advances in conventional treatment modalities for cancer treatment, there are still few effective therapies available due to the lack of selectivity, adverse side effects, non-specific toxicities, and tumour recurrence. Therefore, there is an immediate need for essential alternative therapeutics, which can prove to be beneficial and safe against cancer. Various phytochemicals from natural sources have been found to exhibit beneficial medicinal properties against various human diseases. Zerumbone is one such compound isolated from Zingiber zerumbet Smith that possesses diverse pharmacological properties including those of antioxidant, antibacterial, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, as well as anti-neoplastic. Zerumbone has shown its anti-cancer effects by causing significant suppression of proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis through the molecular modulation of different pathways such as NF-κB, Akt, and IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 (interleukin-6/janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and their downstream target proteins. The current review briefly summarizes the modes of action and therapeutic potential of zerumbone against various cancers. ? 2019 by the authors.","antineoplastic agent; interleukin 6; JAK2 protein, human; Janus kinase 2; RELA protein, human; sesquiterpene; STAT3 protein; transcription factor RelA; zerumbone; apoptosis; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effect; human; metabolism; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Zingiberaceae; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Humans; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinase 2; Molecular Structure; Sesquiterpenes; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factor RelA; Zingiberaceae"
"Development of the clinical assessment scale in autoimmune encephalitis",2019,"Objective: There is no scale for rating the severity of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). In this study, we aimed to develop a novel scale for rating severity in patients with diverse AE syndromes and to verify the reliability and validity of the developed scale. Methods: The key items were generated by a panel of experts and selected according to content validity ratios. The developed scale was initially applied to 50 patients with AE (development cohort) to evaluate its acceptability, reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity. Then, the scale was applied to another independent cohort (validation cohort, n = 38). Results: A new scale consisting of 9 items (seizure, memory dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms, consciousness, language problems, dyskinesia/dystonia, gait instability and ataxia, brainstem dysfunction, and weakness) was developed. Each item was assigned a value of up to 3 points. The total score could therefore range from 0 to 27. We named the scale the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). The new scale showed excellent interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.97) and intraobserver (ICC = 0.96) reliability for total scores, was highly correlated with modified Rankin scale (r = 0.86, p < 0.001), and had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88). Additionally, in the validation cohort, the scale showed high interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.92). Interpretation: CASE is a novel clinical scale for AE with a high level of clinimetric properties. It would be suitable for application in clinical practice and might help overcome the limitations of current outcome scales for AE.

"Whole cigarette smoke condensates induce ferroptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells",2019,"Cigarette smoke is responsible for many fatal pulmonary diseases, however, the toxic mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we first confirmed that whole cigarette smoke condensates (WCSC) contain hydrophilic elements, lipophilic and gaseous components. Then, we treated BEAS-2B cells, a normal human bronchial epithelial cell line, at dosages of 0.25, 0.5, and 1% for 24 h and explored the toxic mechanism. Cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and fission and fusion of mitochondria, damage of endoplasmic reticulume (ER) structures, and formation of autophagosome-like vacuoles were found in cells treated with 1% WCSC. Mitochondrial and ER volumes, lysosomal fluorescence intensity, LDH release, and intracellular ROS levels notably decreased at the highest doses compared with the control, whereas intracellular calcium ion and NO levels were significantly elevated accompanying G2/M phase arrest. Expression of an iron-binding nuclear protein-related gene (pirin) was the most up-regulated in the WCSC-treated cells with enhanced expression of antioxidant-related genes, whereas expression of carbonic anhydrase IX gene, a marker of tumor hypoxia, was the most down-regulated. Additionally, levels of apoptosis (BAX, Apaf-1, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP), autophagy (p62 and LC3B-II), ER stress (PERK, IRE-1a, Bip, and CHOP), antioxidant (SOD-1 and SOD-2), and MAPkinase activation (p-ERK, p-p38, and p-JNK)-related proteins were clearly enhanced following exposure to WCSC, whereas expression of several mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins was reduced with dose. Interestingly, expression of ferritin protein (light chain) was dramatically enhanced near the ER along with that of p62 protein. More importantly, the hypoxia inducible factor-1 pathway and ferroptosis were proposed among the 20 terms in KEGG pathway analysis, and secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, which are involved in hypoxia-induced inflammation, were clearly elevated with dose. Taken together, we suggest that WCSC may induce ferroptosis in bronchial epithelial cells via ER stress and disturbed homeostasis in mitochondrial dynamics caused by induction of hypoxia conditions. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","apoptotic protease activating factor 1; calcium ion; carbonate dehydratase IX; caspase 3; cigarette smoke condensate; glucose regulated protein 78; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; ire 1a protein; iron binding nuclear protein related gene; lactate dehydrogenase; lc3b ii protein; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; perk protein; protein; protein Bax; protein serine threonine kinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; sequestosome 1; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; APAF1 protein, human; apoptotic protease activating factor 1; BAX protein, human; CASP3 protein, human; caspase 3; IL6 protein, human; IL8 protein, human; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; protein Bax; reactive oxygen metabolite; apoptosis; Article; autophagosome; BEAS-2B cell line; bronchus epithelium; calcium cell level; cell fusion; cell vacuole; cell viability; controlled study; cytokine release; down regulation; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; enzyme activation; enzyme release; ferroptosis; fluorescence analysis; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; mitochondrion; priority journal; tumor hypoxia; upregulation; bronchus; cell line; cell survival; cytology; dose response; drug effect; epithelium cell; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrial dynamics; smoke; tobacco; Apoptosis; Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1; Autophagosomes; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Bronchi; Caspase 3; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-8; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Reactive Oxygen Species; Smoke; Tobacco"

"A multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial (phase III) comparing the quality of life between laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy and totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric Cancer (study protocol)",2019,"Background: KLASS (the Korean Laparoendoscopic Gastrointestinal Surgery Study) is a time-honored study group that has established laparoscopic surgery for gastrointestinal disease in Korea and has performed some important studies for the rationale of laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. A multi-center RCT (randomized controlled trial) to compare the quality of life (QOL) of patients undergoing totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) and laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) for gastric cancer, named as KLASS 07, has been currently prepared in Korea. Methods: Patients diagnosed as gastric cancer, with clinical stage IA (T1N0M0) or IB (T1N1M0 / T2N0M0) according to the 7th edition of the Americal Joint Committee on Cancer System, were randomized to receive either TLDG or LADG. For surgical quality control, the surgeons participating in this trial had to have performed at least 50 gastrectomies and at least 30 gastrectomies annually (regardless of open or laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer). The patients who are allocated to TLDG group undergo intracorporeal anastomosis and those who are assigned to LADG undergo extracorporeal anastomosis for gastrointestinal reconstruction. Discussion: Thirty-one surgeons from 26 institutions were engaged in this trial. The primary endpoint is 30-day morbidity, and secondary endpoint is QOL assessed by the questionnaire score. The KLASS 07 trial is the first multi-center RCT to investigate whether there are significant and quantifiable differences between the QOL of TLDG and LADG. The findings from this trial are expected to be the critical clues for designing the detailed procedures during laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer.

"Dielectrophoresis-based filtration effect and detection of amyloid beta in plasma for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis",2019,"The filtration effect improves the impedance change through specific binding of target molecules in plasma, and decreases this change by nonspecific binding of matrix factors in plasma (i.e., matrix effect). A difference in dielectrophoresis (DEP) forces applied to target molecules and matrix factors causes the filtration effect. An optimized DEP force affects target molecules, which remain in the reaction region of an interdigitated microelectrode (IME) sensor. Various matrix factors, which are larger than the target molecules, are influenced by a strong DEP force and are filtered out of the reaction region. To demonstrate the filtration effect, the matrix effect was confirmed in standard plasma and in phosphate-buffered saline, based on the detection of amyloid beta (Aβ), an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated peptide. The filtration effect was verified using the matrix effect factor (MEF), which was calculated from the impedance change values in different detection environments. In standard plasma, the MEF value decreased by approximately 78.12%, and in buffer with heterogeneous Aβ by approximately 75.43%. Plasma from patients with AD and normal controls (NCs) was analyzed using the value of the impedance change by the filtration effect. The impedance change was enhanced approximately 1.52 ± 0.03-fold in AD plasma, but declined approximately 0.90 ± 0.03-fold in NC plasma. This difference tendency by the filtration effect was the disease evaluation index and used as an important criterion that distinguished between the AD and NC plasma. Plasma-based AD diagnosis may be possible, based on the filtration effect. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dielectric devices; Electrophoresis; Glycoproteins; Microelectrodes; Molecules; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer's disease; Evaluation index; Interdigitated microelectrodes; Non-specific binding; Normal controls; Phosphate-buffered salines; Specific binding; Target molecule; Diagnosis; amyloid beta protein; immunoglobulin G antibody; amyloid beta protein; peptide fragment; Alzheimer disease; Article; binding affinity; bioengineering; controlled study; electrophoresis; filtration; finite element analysis; human; immunoassay; limit of detection; mathematical model; process optimization; protein analysis; protein binding; protein blood level; protein degradation; Alzheimer disease; blood; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; genetic procedures; isolation and purification; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biosensing Techniques; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Peptide Fragments"
"Rapid screening of sulfonamides in dietary supplements based on extracted common ion chromatogram and neutral loss scan by LC-Q/TOF-mass spectrometry",2019,"There is an increasing amount of dietary supplements that are adulterated with diuretics and anti-diabetic drugs; this has become a global problem due to the wide distribution of dietary supplements and the serious negative health effects of the adulterants. In this study, a rapid screening method was developed for detection and confirmation of 35 sulfonamides in supplements by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole/time of flight mass spectrometry. For effective extraction of sulfonamides from dietary supplements, four extraction protocols including HLB and WAX solid-phase extraction, Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe method, and pH-controlled liquid–liquid extraction were evaluated, and pH-controlled liquid–liquid extraction method was shown to be the most effective with high recovery efficiency and low matrix effect. Rapid separation of 35 sulfonamides was achieved with the UHPLC C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 um) within 7 min using ammonium acetate aqueous solution (pH 8) and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. From the MS/MS spectra of sulfonamides, common ions (m/z 77.9650 [SO 2 N] - and m/z 79.9812 [SO 2 NH 2 ] - ) and neutral molecule loss fragments (HCl and SO 2 ) were observed according to their structural characteristics. Extracted common ion chromatograms and neutral loss scan of these characteristic fragments could effectively apply for rapid screening of sulfonamides in various types of supplements. A reduced mass tolerance window of ±5 ppm was useful for detecting targeted and untargeted sulfonamides and could avoid false positive and false negative results. Overall calibration curves within dynamic range for all targets were shown to be linear with a correlation coefficient R 2 &gt; 0.995 and limits of detection ranged from 0.04 to 11.18 ng/g for all sulfonamides. The established method was successfully applied for screening and confirmation of sulfonamides in various supplements. The developed method will be helpful for the identification of sulfonamide diuretics and anti-diabetics in dietary supplements, promoting public health and consumer safety. ? 2018","acetazolamide; acetonitrile; ammonium acetate; azosemide; bumetanide; chlorothiazide; chlorpropamide; clopamide; diclofenamide; epitizide; furosemide; glibenclamide; gliclazide; glipizide; hydrochlorothiazide; hydroflumethiazide; indapamide; methazolamide; methyclothiazide; metolazone; piretanide; quinethazone; sulfonamide; tolazamide; tolbutamide; topiramate; torasemide; trichlormethiazide; unindexed drug; xipamide; aqueous solution; Article; diet supplementation; drug isolation; ion chromatography; limit of detection; liquid liquid extraction; pH; solid phase extraction; tandem mass spectrometry; time of flight mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography"

"Targeting of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages with a melittin-based pro-apoptotic peptide",2019,"Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major component of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Macrophages are broadly categorized as M1 or M2 types, and TAMs have been shown to express an M2-like phenotype. TAMs promote tumor progression and contribute to resistance to chemotherapies. Therefore, M2-like TAMs are potential targets for the cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we targeted M2-like TAMs using a hybrid peptide, MEL-dKLA, composed of melittin (MEL), which binds preferentially to M2-like TAMs, and the pro-apoptotic peptide d (KLAKLAK)2 (dKLA), which induces mitochondrial death after cell membrane penetration. Methods: The M1 or M2-differentiated RAW264.7 cells were used for mitochondrial colocalization and apoptosis test in vitro. For in vivo study, the murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of mouse. The dKLA, MEL and MEL-dKLA peptides were intraperitoneally injected at 175 nmol/kg every 3 days. Flow cytometry analysis of tumor-associated macrophages and immunofluorescence staining were performed to investigate the immunotherapeutic effects of MEL-dKLA. Results: We showed that MEL-dKLA induced selective cell death of M2 macrophages in vitro, whereas MEL did not disrupt the mitochondrial membrane. We also showed that MEL-dKLA selectively targeted M2-like TAMs without affecting other leukocytes, such as T cells and dendritic cells, in vivo. These features resulted in lower tumor growth rates, tumor weights, and angiogenesis in vivo. Importantly, although both MEL and MEL-dKLA reduced numbers of CD206+ M2-like TAMs in tumors, only MEL-dKLA induced apoptosis in CD206+ M2-like TAMs, and MEL did not induce cell death. Conclusion: Taken together, our study demonstrated that MEL-dKLA could be used to target M2-like TAMs as a promising cancer therapeutic agent. ? 2019 The Author(s).","dKLA; interleukin 13; melittin; peptide; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; angiogenesis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer immunotherapy; carcinogenesis; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell cycle; cell respiration; cell viability; confocal microscopy; controlled study; flow cytometry; glycolysis; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; Lewis lung carcinoma cell; Lewis lung carcinoma cell line; metastasis; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; RAW 264.7 cell line; regulatory T lymphocyte; survival rate; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume"
"Retinal microvasculature changes in amyloid-negative subcortical vascular cognitive impairment compared to amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease",2019,"Background and purpose: To investigate small vessel abnormalities in patients with cognitive impairment, we compared retinal microvascular alterations between patients with cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer's disease (ADCI) and those with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI). Methods: We prospectively recruited 29 amyloid-positive ADCI patients, 28 amyloid-negative SVCI patients that were confirmed by 11C-PiB-PET scan and 34 individuals with normal cognition (NC). The three groups were compared in terms of retinal vascular variables (retinal fractal dimension, vascular caliber, tortuosity and branching angle) by using a semi-automated, computer-assisted analysis of digital fundus photographs. We also investigated the relationship between retinal variables and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI. Results: Compared to NC individuals, the SVCI patients had smaller total and arteriolar fractal dimensions, whereas there was no significant difference of fractal dimension between ADCI and NC. Other retinal variables did not differ among the three groups. A significant correlation existed between fractal dimension and WMH volume. Conclusions: Retinal microvascular alterations, especially retinal fractal dimension, may be useful markers that reflect cerebral microvascular changes in patients with SVCI as opposed to ADCI, who had no definite difference in retinal variables compared to the NC group. ? 2018","amyloid; antithrombocytic agent; Pittsburgh compound B; 2-(4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole; amyloid beta protein; aniline derivative; thiazole derivative; age; aged; Alzheimer disease; arteriole; Article; body mass; brain size; clinical article; clinical feature; cognition; cognitive defect; comparative study; correlation analysis; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hypertension; male; Mini Mental State Examination; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; prospective study; retina blood vessel; subcortical vascular cognitive impairment; white matter; Alzheimer disease; analysis of variance; complication; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; microvasculature; middle aged; multiinfarct dementia; pathology; retina; risk factor; statistical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Analysis of Variance; Aniline Compounds; Dementia, Vascular; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Microvessels; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Positron-Emission Tomography; Retina; Risk Factors; Thiazoles; White Matter"
"MMOU-AR: Multimodal obtrusive and unobtrusive activity recognition through supervised ontology-based reasoning",2019,"The aging population, prevalence of chronic diseases, and outbreaks of infectious diseases are some of the major healthcare challenges. To address these unmet healthcare challenges, monitoring and Activity Recognition (AR) are considered as a subtask in pervasive computing and context-aware systems. Innumerable interdisciplinary applications exist, underpinning the obtrusive sensory data using the revolutionary digital technologies for the acquisition, transformation, and fusion of recognized activities. However, little importance is given by the research community to make the use of non-wearables i.e. unobtrusive sensing technologies. The physical state of human pervasively in daily living for AR can be seamlessly presented by acquiring health-related information by using unobtrusive sensing technologies to enable long-term health monitoring without violating an individual’s privacy. This paper aims to propose and provide supervised recognition of Activities of Daily Livings (ADLs) by observing unobtrusive sensor events using statistical reasoning. Furthermore, it also investigates their semantic correlations by defining semantic constraints with the support of ontological reasoning. Extensive experiments were performed with real-world dataset shared by the University of Ja?n Ambient Intelligence (UJAmI) Smart Lab in order to recognize the human activities in the smart environment. The evaluations show that the accuracy of the supervised method (87%) is comparable to the one, state of the art semantic approach (91%). ?

"Clinical and microbiological factors associated with early patient mortality from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteremia",2019,"Background/Aims: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (MRS-AB) is a major bloodstream infection with a high mortality rate. Identification of factors associated with early mortality in MRSAB patients would be useful for predicting prognosis and developing new therapeutic options. Methods: A prospective cohort of MRSAB patients was examined between August 2008 and June 2011. Early and late mortality was defined as death within 2 and 28 days of blood culture, respectively. The clinical and microbiological characteristics in the early and late mortality and survival groups were compared. Risk factors associated with severe sepsis or septic shock were also investigated. Results: A total of 385 adult MRSAB patients whose S. aureus isolates were available were enrolled; of these patients, 25 patients (6.5%) and 50 (13%) died early and late, respectively. Compared with both the late-mortality group and the survival group, severe sepsis or septic shock was a statistically significant independent risk factor associated with early mortality. Rapidly or ultimately fatal McCabe and Jackson classification (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 3.02) and pneumonia (aOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.02) were independently associated with severe sepsis or septic shock. A vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ? 1.5 μg/mL was associated with a reduced incidence of severe sepsis or septic shock (aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.84). Conclusions: Severity of illness seems to be the most important risk factor associated with early mortality in MRSAB. Although vancomycin MIC was not independently associated with early mortality, reduced vancomycin susceptibility appears to be linked to reduced disease severity.

"Clinical utility of a novel natural killer cell activity assay for diagnosing non-small cell lung cancer: A prospective pilot study",2019,"Purpose: Although decreased natural killer cell activity (NKA) has been observed in many solid cancers, clinical implication of NKA has been scarcely investigated in lung cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of using NKA to support diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods: We prospectively evaluated and compared peripheral blood NKA using a novel interferon-gamma releasing assay in healthy population (n=40), patients with benign lung disease (n=40), and those with NSCLC (n=71). We explored the correlation between NKA and clinical parameters and assessed diagnostic performance of NKA for NSCLC using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: Median NKA values in healthy population, patients with benign lung disease, and those with NSCLC were 1,364.2, 1,438.2, and 406.3 pg/mL, respectively. NKA in NSCLC patients was significantly lower than that in the other two control groups (both P,0.001). At a cutoff value of NKA at 391.0 pg/mL, the area under the curve was 0.762 (95% CI: 0.685–0.838, P,0.001), with a sensitivity of 52.3%, a specificity of 91.0%, a positive predictive value of 85.3%, and a negative predictive value of 65.4% for the diagnosis of NSCLC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diagnosis of NSCLC is the only clinical parameter that was significantly associated with NKA (P,0.001). Conclusion: This pilot study showed that patients with low NKA were more likely to have lung cancer. Further studies are warranted in order to establish the clinical utility of NKA test for diagnosing lung cancer. ? 2019 Choi et al.","adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; female; human; interferon gamma release assay; lung disease; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; natural killer cell; non small cell lung cancer; pilot study; predictive value; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly"
"Comparison of T790M Acquisition Between Patients Treated with Afatinib and Gefitinib as First-Line Therapy: Retrospective Propensity Score Matching Analysis",2019,"Afatinib, a second-generation, irreversible pan-HER inhibitor, shows better suppression of T790M-positive lung cancer cells than gefitinib in preclinical studies. However, whether the effect of afatinib on T790M acquisition differs from that of gefitinib when used clinically as first-line therapy remains unclear. To reaffirm the preclinical efficacy of afatinib on T790M-positive lung cancer cells, H1975 cells and established PC-9 cells resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib by T790M were used. In total, 398 patients with second biopsy at progression with stage IIIB/IV non–small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation, treated with afatinib or gefitinib as first-line therapy, were retrospectively reviewed. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates. Afatinib inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells with low T790M allele frequencies, which are resistant to gefitinib, but not those with high T790M allele frequencies. Afatinib and gefitinib showed similar efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) (11.5 vs 13.4 months, P =.08) and overall survival (OS) (29.3 vs 28.5 months, P =.76). T790M patients had better PFS and OS than those without T790M. There was no significant difference in the cumulative T790M acquisition ratio over time between afatinib and gefitinib (48.8% vs 59.3%, P =.317). The median time to acquire T790M was 12.9 months for afatinib and 15.7 months for gefitinib (P =.342). Although afatinib inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells with low T790M allele frequencies in preclinical studies, this could not be translated into clinical efficacy in terms of lowering the rate or delaying the time of T790M acquisition. ? 2019 The Authors","afatinib; gefitinib; adult; aged; Article; cell viability; cell viability assay; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; flow cytometry; gene frequency; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; immunofluorescence; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; MTT assay; mutational analysis; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; progression free survival; propensity score"
"Hospital-based Korean diabetes prevention study: A prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label controlled study",2019,"Background: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to increase, and the disease burden is the highest of any medical condition in Korea. However, large-scale clinical studies have not yet conducted to establish the basis for diabetes prevention in Korea. Methods: The hospital-based Korean Diabetes Prevention Study (H-KDPS) is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label controlled study conducted at university hospitals for the purpose of gathering data to help in efforts to prevent type 2 DM. Ten university hospitals are participating, and 744 subjects will be recruited. The subjects are randomly assigned to the standard care group, lifestyle modification group, or metformin group, and their clinical course will be observed for 36 months. Results: All intervention methodologies were developed, validated, and approved by Korean Diabetes Association (KDA) multidisciplinary team members. The standard control group will engage in individual education based on the current KDA guidelines, and the lifestyle modification group will participate in a professionally guided healthcare intervention aiming for ?5% weight loss. The metformin group will begin dosing at 250 mg/day, increasing to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day. The primary endpoint of this study is the cumulative incidence of DM during the 3 years after randomization. Conclusion: The H-KDPS study is the first large-scale clinical study to establish evidence-based interventions for the prevention of type 2 DM in Koreans. The evidence gathered by this study will be useful for enhancing the health of Koreans and improving the stability of the Korean healthcare system (Trial registration: CRIS KCT0002260, NCT02981121).

"Central serous chorioretinopathy in elderly subjects: angiographic and tomographic characteristics",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the angiographic, tomographic, and clinical characteristics of idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) in elderly patients. Methods: The patients were divided into two groups according to a cutoff age of 60?years at baseline. Patients underwent spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Angiographic and tomographic features were compared between the two groups (young vs. elderly group). Results: Of 176 patients, 26 patients (15.1%) were 60?years or older. Complete resolution of subretinal fluid after treatment was noted in 72.0% of the elderly group and 90.8% of the young group (P = 0.021). The elderly group showed worse baseline and final vision, more bilateral involvement, and lower male preponderance than the young group (P < 0.05, respectively). The elderly group was also associated with a higher frequency of retinal pigment epithelium depigmentation, foveal thinning, and double-layer sign compared with the young group (P < 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: CSC in elderly patients was associated with a lower resolution of serous detachment, increased impairment of retinal pigment epithelial layers, foveal thinning, and worse visual outcome, suggesting a chronic insult to the choroidal vessels involving more severe damage to the outer retinal layers. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","acetazolamide; verteporfin; adult; aged; Article; best corrected visual acuity; central serous retinopathy; choroidal thickness; clinical feature; depigmentation; diabetes mellitus; female; fluorescence angiography; follow up; human; hypertension; indocyanine green angiography; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; male; optical coherence tomography; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; retina detachment; retina fovea; retinal pigment epithelium; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; subretinal fluid; central serous retinopathy; choroid; eye fundus; middle aged; pathology; physiology; procedures; retrospective study; visual acuity; Adult; Aged; Central Serous Chorioretinopathy; Choroid; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Follow-Up Studies; Fovea Centralis; Fundus Oculi; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity"
"Coffee consumption and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a meta-analysis by potential modifiers",2019,"Coffee consumption has been associated with decreased mortality in previous studies. As aging, obesity, and lifestyle factors affect the risk of mortality, the association between coffee and mortality needs to be examined in various subpopulations by characteristics of subjects. To quantitatively assess this association, we conducted an updated meta-analysis including stratified analyses by potential modifiers. We searched in the PubMed and Web of Science databases through March 8, 2019, and conducted meta-analysis including linear and non-linear dose–response analyses. We identified 40 studies including 3,852,651 subjects and 450,256 all-cause and cause-specific deaths. Non-linear inverse associations between coffee consumption and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers were found. The lowest relative risk (RR) was at intakes of 3.5?cups/day for all-cause mortality (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82–0.89), 2.5?cups/day for CVD mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.80–0.87), and 2?cups/day for cancer mortality (RR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.94–0.99), while additional intakes were not associated with further lower mortality. An inverse association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality was maintained irrespective of age, overweight status, alcohol drinking, smoking status, and caffeine content of coffee. By region, Europe and Asia showed stronger inverse associations than US. A non-linear inverse association was found for mortality from respiratory disease and diabetes, while linear inverse association was found for mortality from non-CVD, non-cancer causes. Moderate coffee consumption (e.g. 2–4?cups/day) was associated with reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality, compared to no coffee consumption. The inverse association between coffee and all-cause mortality was consistent by potential modifiers except region. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","caffeine; caffeine; all cause mortality; Article; Asia; cancer mortality; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; coffee; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drinking behavior; Europe; human; malignant neoplasm; meta analysis; obesity; respiratory tract disease; risk factor; smoking; systematic review; adverse event; causality; cause of death; coffee; drinking behavior; female; male; mortality; neoplasm; Alcohol Drinking; Caffeine; Cardiovascular Diseases; Causality; Cause of Death; Coffee; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Mortality; Neoplasms; Risk Factors"
"Anti-obesity effect of 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid on high-fat diet mouse",2019,"This study was performed to confirm the influence of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and 3,5-dicaffeyolquinic acid (3,5-diCQA) intake on problems caused by high-fat diet. CGA was more effective in suppressing weight gain than 3,5-diCQA. In contrast, 3,5-diCQA was more effective in improving glucose tolerance than CGA. In the biopsy, it was confirmed that CGA inhibited visceral fat and liver fat accumulation. 3,5-diCQA also inhibited visceral fat accumulation, but 3,5-diCQA increased liver fat accumulation. The liver fat accumulation induced oxidative stress, but 3,5-diCQA reduced oxidative damage through its antioxidant activity. The increased liver fat accumulation was because a 3,5-diCQA greatly increased Akt phosphorylation and decreased AMPK phosphorylation in the liver. Consequently, CGA was effective in alleviating the problems caused by high-fat diets, while maintaining normal balance. 3,5-diCQA also showed a positive effect on problems caused by high-fat diets, but it increased liver fat accumulation and thereby had negative consequences. ?The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology.",""
"Outcome of intravitreal aflibercept for refractory pigment epithelial detachment with or without subretinal fluid and secondary to age-related macular degeneration",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the outcomes of intravitreal aflibercept in refractory pigment epithelial detachment (PED) with or without subretinal fluid (SRF) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Methods: A prospective, nonrandomized, interventional case series involved 40 patients with persistent vascularized PED previously treated with at least 3 injections of intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab. Intravitreal aflibercept was administered as 3 initial loading doses every 4 weeks, followed by pro re nata retreatment every 8 weeks over 48 weeks. Pigment epithelial detachment was classified into solid-, hollow-, or mixed-type according to the reflective properties visualized using optical coherence tomography. The mean changes in best-corrected visual acuity, central subfield thickness, and the volumes of SRF and PED were analyzed. Results: The PED volume (baseline: 0.43 ± 0.55 mm3) significantly reduced to 0.23 ± 0.32 mm3 at Week 8 (P = 0.003) and increased to 0.36 ± 0.41 mm3 at Week 48 (P = 0.345). The SRF volume (baseline: 0.52 ± 0.64 mm3) significantly reduced to 0.24 ± 0.43 mm3 at Week 48 (P = 0.021). The mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity was 20/75 (47.5 letters); it showed no significant difference at Week 48 (+4.4 letters; P = 0.125). The baseline central subfield thickness was 323.2 ± 92.3 mm; it significantly reduced to 281.2 ± 90.7 mm at Week 48 (P = 0.001). In solid-type PEDs, there were poorer improvements in central subfield thickness, best-corrected visual acuity, and the volumes of the SRF and PED, with newly developed intraretinal cysts. Conclusion: Intravitreal aflibercept in treatment-resistant neovascular age-related macular degeneration led to significant reduction in PED and SRF volume, central subfield thickness, and best-corrected visual acuity preserved, over 12 months. However, solidtype PED showed less improvement than hollow- or mixed-type PED. ? Lippincott Williams and Wilkins 2019.

"Seasonal and diurnal patterns of population vocal activity in avian brood parasites",2019,"Patterns of vocal activity may involve information about vocalizations themselves as well as their function. In birds, vocal activity at the individual and population level is generally closely associated with breeding cycles, reaching the peak during territorial and mating competition, and decreasing with the onset of egg incubation and chick feeding. However, little is known about patterns of vocal activity in avian brood parasites that have unusual breeding cycles without parental care. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we determined the seasonal and diurnal patterns of population vocal activity in two avian brood parasites: the Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus and the Lesser Cuckoo C. poliocephalus. We found that both species and both sexes showed a similarly highly structured pattern of seasonal vocal activity, reaching a sharp peak in the early breeding season when birds compete for territories and mates, although males sang more frequently than females. Likewise, the diurnal patterns of vocal activity were similar in both species and both sexes of cuckoos, with peak activity occurring around dawn. Nocturnal calls by male cuckoos were also detected in both species, but only in the early breeding season. Collectively, the observed patterns of population vocal activity may suggest that the absence of parental care may not extend the period of vocal activity in these two species of brood parasites. ? 2019 British Ornithologists’ Union",""
"Characterization of cornea-specific bioink: high transparency, improved in vivo safety",2019,"Corneal transplantation is a typical surgical procedure for severe corneal diseases. However, the waiting time for a donor cornea has gradually increased due to a decrease in supply caused by an aging population and increased cases of laser-based surgeries. Artificial corneas were developed to meet the increase in demand; however, these approaches have suffered from material deterioration resulted by the limited tissue integration. Here, we introduce a cornea-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (Co-dECM) as a bioink for corneal regeneration. The developed Co-dECM bioink had similar quantitative measurement results for collagen and GAGs compared with that of the native cornea and also had the proper transparency for vision. The differentiation potential of human turbinate-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hTMSCs) to a keratocyte lineage was only observed in the Co-dECM group. Moreover, the developed bioink did not have any cytotoxic effect on encapsulated cells for three-dimensional (3D) culture and has great biocompatibility evident by the xeno-implantation of the Co-dECM gel into mice and rabbits for two and one month, respectively. An in vivo safety similar to clinical-grade collagen was seen with the Co-dECM, which helped to maintain the keratocyte-specific characteristics in vivo, compared with collagen. Taken together, the Co-dECM bioink has the potential to be used in various types of corneal diseases based on its corneal-specific ability and design flexibility through 3D cell printing technology. ?

"Loss of parkin reduces lung tumor development by blocking p21 degradation",2019,"Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated the reciprocal relationship between the development of cancer and Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. To identify this relationship, we first compared lung tumor growth in parkin knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Parkin KO mice showed decreased lung tumor growth and increased expression of p21, a cell cycle arrester, as compared with WT mice. We also found that parkin interacts with p21, resulting in its degradation; however, parkin KO, knockdown, as well as mutation (R275W or G430D) reduced the degradation of p21. We investigated whether parkin KO increases the association of p21 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or CDK2 by reducing p21 degradation, and, thus, arresting the cell cycle. The interaction between p21 and PCNA or CDK2 was also enhanced by parkin knockdown, and this increased interaction induced sub G0/G1 arrest, leading to cell death. Therefore, our data indicate that parkin KO reduces the development of lung tumors via cell cycle arrest by blocking the degradation of p21. These findings suggest that PD could be associated with lower lung cancer incidence. ? 2019 Park et al.

"Continuous glucose monitoring defined glucose variability is associated with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in type 1 diabetes",2019,"Background: The purpose of this study was to establish the association between continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-defined glycaemic variability (GV) and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in type 1 diabetes independent of mean glucose and to examine the relative contribution of each internationally standardized CGM parameter to this association. Materials and methods: This study included 80 adults with type 1 diabetes who underwent 3-day CGM and autonomic function tests within 3?months. The degree of association between internationally standardized CGM parameters and CAN, defined as at least two abnormal parasympathetic tests or the presence of orthostatic hypotension, were analysed by logistic regression, receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and dominance analysis. Results: A total of 36 subjects (45.0%) were diagnosed with CAN. When adjusted with mean glucose and clinical risk factors of CAN, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion, percent time in level 1 (glucose 54-69?mg/dL) and level 2 (glucose?<?54?mg/dL) hypoglycaemia, area under the curve in level 2 hypoglycaemia, low blood glucose index, high blood glucose index, and percent time in glucose 70 to 180?mg/dL were independently associated with CAN. Multivariable ROC analysis and dominance analysis revealed the highest relative contribution of percent time in level 2 hypoglycaemia to the independent associations between CGM parameters and presence of CAN. Conclusions: CGM-defined GV was associated with CAN independent of mean glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes. Among internationally standardized CGM parameters, those describing the degree of level 2 hypoglycaemia were the most significant contributors to this association. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","glucose; biological marker; adult; Article; autonomic neuropathy; blood glucose monitoring; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; glucose blood level; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; male; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; analysis; autonomic nervous system; blood glucose monitoring; cardiovascular disease; complication; diabetic neuropathy; follow up; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; pathology; prognosis; Adult; Autonomic Nervous System; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetic Neuropathies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Male; Prognosis; ROC Curve"
"Attitudes of the General Public, Cancer Patients, Family Caregivers, and Physicians Toward Advance Care Planning: A Nationwide Survey Before the Enforcement of the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decision-Making Act",2019,"Context: To respect a patient's wish for end-of-life care, “the Act on Decisions on Life-Sustaining Treatment for Patients at the End-of-Life” was enacted in South Korea in 2016. Current understanding of people who would be involved in advance care planning (ACP) is crucial to disseminate it systematically. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate awareness and attitudes toward ACP in South Korea. Methods: A multicenter, nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted, a survey regarding ACP among four groups that would have different positions and experiences: 1001 cancer patients, 1006 family caregivers, 928 physicians, and 1241 members of the general public. Results: A total of 15% of the general population, 33% of the patients and caregivers, and 61% of the physicians had knowledge of advance directives. More than 64% of the general population, above 72% of the patients and caregivers, and 97% of the physicians were willing to do so when the disease status was aggravated or terminal. The possibility for changing the plan, uncertainty as to whether directives would actually be followed, and psychological discomfort were common reasons for not wanting to engage in ACP. Routine recommendations for a specific medical condition, heightened accessibility, and health insurance support were common factors that could help facilitate ACP. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that strategies for promoting ACP should reflect different perspectives among the general public, patients, family caregivers, and physicians. Public advocacy, resources for approaching and integrating ACP into routine health care, as well as systematic support provisions are needed. ? 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","adult; advance care planning; Article; cancer patient; caregiver; cross-sectional study; decision making; education; employment status; family; female; health care access; health insurance; human; life sustaining treatment; living will; major clinical study; male; patient attitude; physician attitude; South Korea; terminal care; terminal disease"
"One-Pot Synthesis of Homogeneous EuF 3 Nanoplates: A Near-Ultraviolet Light-Induced Red-Emitting Bifunctional Platform for in vitro Cell Imaging and Solid-State Lighting",2019,"We reported a new approach to prepare the homogenous EuF 3 nanoplates and discussed their potential applications. Upon 396 nm excitation, the EuF 3 nanoplates exhibited the visible emissions with high color purity of 84.7%. The monitored photoluminescence emission spectrum indicated that the Eu 3+ ions took the high symmetry positions in the host lattices which was further confirmed via the theoretical calculation based on the Judd-Ofelt theory. The thermal quenching performance of the EuF 3 nanoplates was analyzed by the temperature-dependent photoluminescence emission spectra and the activation energy was decided to be 0.28 eV. With the aid of the near-ultraviolet chip and EuF 3 nanoplates, a red-emitting light-emitting diode device was prepared so as to identify the feasibility of the EuF 3 nanoplates for solid-state lighting. Additionally, the cell viability of the EuF 3 nanoplates as well as their fluorescence imaging behaviors in the A549 lung cancer cells was also investigated. The observed results demonstrated that the EuF 3 nanoplates were bifunctional platform for in vitro cell imaging and solid-state lighting. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",""
"Plasmodium knowlesi clinical isolates from Malaysia show extensive diversity and strong differential selection pressure at the merozoite surface protein 7D (MSP7D)",2019,"Background: The high proportion of human cases due to the simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi in Malaysia is a cause of concern, as they can be severe and even fatal. Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP7) is a multigene family which forms a non-covalent complex with MSP-1 prior to receptor-ligand recognition in Plasmodium falciparum and thus an important antigen for vaccine development. However, no study has been done in any of the ortholog family members in P. knowlesi from clinical samples. This study investigates the level of polymorphism, haplotypes, and natural selection acting at the pkmsp-7D gene in clinical samples from Malaysia. Methods: Thirty-six full-length pkmsp7D gene sequences (along with the reference H-strain: PKNH-1266000) obtained from clinical isolates of Malaysia, which were orthologous to pvmsp7H (PVX-082680) were downloaded from public databases. Population genetic, evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine the level of genetic diversity, polymorphism, recombination and natural selection. Results: Analysis of 36 full-length pkmsp7D sequences identified 147 SNPs (91 non-synonymous and 56 synonymous substitutions). Nucleotide diversity across the full-length gene was higher than its ortholog in Plasmodium vivax (msp7H). Region-wise analysis of the gene indicated that the nucleotide diversity at the central region was very high (π = 0.14) compared to the 5′ and 3′ regions. Most hyper-variable SNPs were detected at the central domain. Multiple test for natural selection indicated the central region was under strong positive natural selection however, the 5′ and 3′ regions were under negative/purifying selection. Evidence of intragenic recombination were detected at the central region of the gene. Phylogenetic analysis using full-length msp7D genes indicated there was no geographical clustering of parasite population. Conclusions: High genetic diversity with hyper-variable SNPs and strong evidence of positive natural selection at the central region of MSP7D indicated exposure of the region to host immune pressure. Negative selection at the 5′ and the 3′ regions of MSP7D might be because of functional constraints at the unexposed regions during the merozoite invasion process of P. knowlesi. No evidence of geographical clustering among the clinical isolates from Malaysia indicated uniform selection pressure in all populations. These findings highlight the further evaluation of the regions and functional characterization of the protein as a potential blood stage vaccine candidate for P. knowlesi. ? 2019 The Author(s).","merozoite surface protein 7D; parasite antigen; protozoal protein; unclassified drug; membrane protein; merozoite surface protein 7, Plasmodium; protozoal protein; Article; controlled study; data base; diversifying selection; evolutionary rate; gene sequence; genetic recombination; genetic variability; haplotype; Malaysia; microbial diversity; microbial gene; microbial genetics; nonhuman; nucleic acid base substitution; phylogeny; pkmsp 7D gene; Plasmodium knowlesi; Plasmodium vivax; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; DNA sequence; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; human; malaria; parasitology; Plasmodium knowlesi; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Humans; Malaria; Malaysia; Membrane Proteins; Phylogeny; Plasmodium knowlesi; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Protozoan Proteins; Recombination, Genetic; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA"
"Efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus combination therapy in patients with lupus nephritis: A nationwide multicentre study",2019,"Objective Recent studies have shown that a combination treatment of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus (TAC) may be an option for lupus nephritis (LN) patients that do not adequately respond to initial treatment. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment of MMF and TAC in LN patients with suboptimal response to prior MMF or TAC treatments. Methods In this multicentre study, we retrospectively enrolled 62 patients with class III, IV, or V LN who inadequately responded to MMF or TAC treatment. Those patients were then treated with a combination of MMF and TAC for 6 months. The primary outcome was complete remission (CR) at 6 months, and secondary outcomes included overall response and adverse events. Results After 6 months of treatment with the drug combination, CR was achieved in 14 of 62 patients (22.6%), and 35 (56.5%) patients responded. A significant reduction in proteinuria and lupus disease activity score was observable after 3 months. After 1 year, the CR rate increased to 36.4% (20 of 55 patients), and the overall response rate (n=38, 69.1%) also increased from 6 months. Twenty-one patients reported 29 adverse events, including severe infection requiring hospitalisation (n=3, 10.3%), infection not requiring hospitalisation (n=2, 6.9%), and herpes zoster (n=4, 13.8%). Conclusion Our findings suggest that a combined MMF and TAC treatment, with a favourable adverse-event profile, may be a beneficial option for LN patients with inadequate response to either MMF or TAC treatments. ?

"Casticin inhibits growth and enhances ionizing radiation–induced apoptosis through the suppression of STAT3 signaling cascade",2019,"Casticin (CTC), one of the major components of Vitex rotundifolia L., has been reported to exert significant beneficial pharmacological activities and can function as an antiprolactin, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, analgesic, and immunomodulatory agent. This study aimed at investigating whether the proapoptotic effects of CTC may be mediated through the abrogation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in a variety of human tumor cells. We found that CTC significantly decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and suppressed cell proliferation in 786-O, YD-8, and HN-9 cells. CTC also induced programmed cell death that was found to be mediated via caspase-3 activation and induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Interestingly, CTC repressed both constitutive and interleukin-6-induced STAT3 activation in 786-O and YD-8 cells but only affected constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in HN-9 cells. Moreover, CTC could potentiate ionizing radiation–induced apoptotic effects leading to the downregulation of STAT3 activation and thus may be used in combination with radiation against diverse malignancies. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","antiinflammatory agent; antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; casticin; interleukin 6; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose); STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; 786-O cell line; apoptosis; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cell proliferation; cell viability; cytotoxicity assay; down regulation; enzyme activation; hn 9 cell line; human; human cell; ionizing radiation; nonhuman; priority journal; proapoptotic activity; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; Vitex rotundifolia; Western blotting; yd 8 cell line"
"The effect of polydeoxyribonucleotide extracted from salmon sperm on the restoration of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw",2019,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) used for treating skeletal diseases can induce bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). Despite much effort, effective remedies are yet to be established. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) extracted from salmon sperm for the treatment of BRONJ, in a BRONJ-induced rat model. Compared with BRONJ-induced samples, PDRN-treated samples exhibited lower necrotic bone percentages and increased numbers of blood vessels and attached osteoclast production. Moreover, local administration of PDRN at a high concentration (8 mg/kg) remarkably resolved the osteonecrosis. Findings from this study suggest that local administration of PDRN at a specific concentration may be considered clinically for the management of BRONJ. ? 2019 by the authors","polydeoxyribonucleotide; rejuvenex; 3 aminopropionitrile; beta-aminopropionitrile fumarate; biological product; polydeoxyribonucleotide; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone mass; bone regeneration; bone structure; controlled study; disease severity; drug determination; drug effect; drug mechanism; female; jaw osteonecrosis; nonhuman; osteoclast; rat; salmonine; sperm; tooth extraction; analogs and derivatives; animal; bone; chemistry; disease model; human; isolation and purification; jaw osteonecrosis; Leporidae; male; pathology; preclinical study; salmonine; spermatozoon; topical drug administration; treatment outcome; vascularization; Administration, Topical; Aminopropionitrile; Animals; Biological Products; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone and Bones; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Male; Osteoclasts; Polydeoxyribonucleotides; Rabbits; Salmon; Spermatozoa; Treatment Outcome"

"Frailty index associated with all-cause mortality, long-term institutionalization, and hip fracture",2019,"Purpose: To assess the association between frailty, measured using a frailty diagnosis tool, and adverse outcomes using regular health checkup data and National Health Insurance claim data of 66-year-old Koreans. Methods: We evaluated all Koreans born between 1942 and 1946 who received a 66-year lifetime transition period health examination and regular biennial general and cancer screenings between 2008 and 2012. These patients were observed until December 31, 2015. The Lifetime Transition Period Health Examination version of the Korean Frailty Index (THE frailty index) was used to examine adverse geriatric outcomes based on levels of frailty. THE frailty index scores were used to classify participants as “robust” (0–2), “pre-frail” (3–4), or “frail” (more than 5). The main outcomes included the risks of all-cause mortality, long-term care facility institutionalization, and hip fracture. Results: Among 725,759 Korean men and women, the prevalence of frail and pre-frail conditions was 3.4% and 26.6%, respectively. After an average of 4.4?years of follow-up, frail older persons had significantly higher mortality rates [men: hazard ratio (HR) 2.031 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.894–2.178); women: HR 2.092 (95% CI 1.920–2.279)], long-term care facility institutionalization [men: HR 2.997 (95% CI 2.750–3.268); women: HR 3.057 (95% CI 2.866–3.261)], and hip fracture [men: HR 2.230 (95% CI 1.854–2.681); women: HR 2.356 (95% CI 2.086–2.660)] than those of robust older persons. Conclusions: Aged frail persons diagnosed using the THE frailty index had higher all-cause mortality, more frequent entry into long-term care facilities, and greater risk of hip fracture. ? 2019, ? 2019, European Geriatric Medicine Society.","aged; all cause mortality; Article; cancer screening; clinical outcome; cognition; daily life activity; electronic medical record; female; follow up; frailty; functional status assessment; hip fracture; human; incidence; institutionalization; Korean (people); korean frailty index; lifespan; long term care; major clinical study; male; medical examination; mortality; mortality rate; national health insurance; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study"
"Left ventricular geometry and risk of incident hypertension",2019,"Objective Left ventricular (LV) geometry change is an independent predictor for cardiovascular disease. However, data are equivocal on the association of echocardiographic parameters of LV geometry with incident hypertension. Thus, we were to investigate the risk of hypertension according to the baseline echocardiographic parameters of LV geometry. Methods Study participants were 12 562 Koreans without hypertension who received echocardiography as an item of health check-up. They were divided into normotensive or prehypertensive group according to baseline blood pressure. In each group, study subjects were classified by quintiles of baseline echocardiographic parameters including left ventricular mass index (LVMI), relative wall thickness (RWT), interventricular septal thickness (IVST), posterior wall thickness (PWT) and IVST plus PWT and followed up for 5 years. Cox proportional hazards model was used in calculating adjusted HRs and their 95% CI for hypertension according to each quintile group. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis (AUC [95% CI]) was performed to compare the predictability of LVMI, RWT, IVST, PWT, IVST plus PWT for hypertension. Results Prehypertensive group had the worse clinical and echocardiographic parameters in baseline analysis than normotensive group. The risk of hypertension significantly increased proportionally to baseline LVMI, RWT, IVST, PWI and IVST plus PWT above specific quintile levels, which was identified in both normotensive and prehypertensive group. In AUC analysis, IVST, PWT and IVST plus PWT showed a significantly increased AUC, compared with LVMI. Conclusion LV geometry change was significantly associated with the increased risk for hypertension in non-hypertensive individuals. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cardiovascular parameters; cohort analysis; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; echocardiography; female; follow up; geometry; heart left ventricle; human; hypertension; interventricular septal thickness; Korean (people); left ventricular mass index; major clinical study; male; posterior wall thickness; prehypertension; priority journal; proportional hazards model; relative wall thickness; South Korea; systolic blood pressure"
"Oncologic outcomes after laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer: Propensity score matching analysis",2019,"Purpose: This study aimed to compare the oncologic and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) and open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Materials and Methods: From July 2006 to November 2016, 384 patients underwent distal gastrectomy for AGC. Data on short- and long-term outcomes were prospectively collected and reviewed. Propensity score matching was applied at a ratio of 1:1 to compare the LDG and ODG groups. Results: The operative times were longer for the LDG group than for the ODG group. However, the time to resumption of diet and the length of hospital stay were shorter in the LDG group than in the ODG group (4.7 vs. 5.6 days, P=0.049 and 9.6 vs. 11.5 days, P=0.035, respectively). The extent of lymph node dissection in the LDG group was more limited than in the ODG group (P=0.002), although there was no difference in the number of retrieved lymph nodes between the 2 groups. The 3-year overall survival rates were 98% and 86.9% (P=0.018), and the 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were 86.3% and 75.3% (P=0.259), respectively, in the LDG and ODG groups. Conclusions: LDG is safe and feasible for AGC, with earlier recovery after surgery and longterm oncologic outcomes comparable to those of ODG. ? 2019.

"Efficient pre-catalytic conformational change of reverse transcriptases from SAMHD1 non-counteracting primate lentiviruses during dNTP incorporation",2019,"Unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 and some SIV strains replicate at high dNTP concentrations even in macrophages due to their accessory proteins, Vpx or Vpr, that target SAMHD1 dNTPase for proteasomal degradation. We previously reported that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) efficiently synthesizes DNA even at low dNTP concentrations because HIV-1 RT displays faster pre-steady state kpol values than SAMHD1 counteracting lentiviral RTs. Here, since the kpol step consists of two sequential sub-steps post dNTP binding, conformational change and chemistry, we investigated which of the two sub-steps RTs from SAMHD1 non-counteracting viruses accelerate in order to complete reverse transcription in the limited dNTP pools found in macrophages. Our study demonstrates that RTs of SAMHD1 non-counteracting lentiviruses have a faster conformational change rate during dNTP incorporation, supporting that these lentiviruses may have evolved to harbor RTs that can efficiently execute the conformational change step in order to circumvent SAMHD1 restriction and dNTP depletion in macrophages. ? 2019 The Authors","deoxynucleoside triphosphate; deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1; nucleoside triphosphate; phosphorothioic acid; RNA directed DNA polymerase; unclassified drug; viral protein; Vpr protein; Vpx protein; Article; conformational transition; controlled study; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; nonhuman; Primate lentivirus; priority journal; protein degradation; reverse transcription; Simian immunodeficiency virus"
"Maternal exposure to particulate matter during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes in the Republic of Korea",2019,"Air pollution has become a global concern due to its association with numerous health effects. We aimed to assess associations between birth outcomes in Korea, such as preterm births and birth weight in term infants, and particulate matter &lt; 10 ?m (PM 10 ). Records from 1,742,183 single births in 2010-2013 were evaluated. Mean PM 10 concentrations during pregnancy were calculated and matched to birth data by registered regions. We analyzed the frequency of birth outcomes between groups using WHO criteria for PM 10 concentrations with effect sizes estimated using multivariate logistic regression. Women exposed to PM 10 &gt; 70 ?g/m 3 during pregnancy had a higher rate of preterm births than women exposed to PM 10 ? 70 ?g/m 3 (7.4% vs. 4.7%, P &lt; 0.001; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.570; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.487-1.656).

"Validity and reliability of a Korean version of yale food addiction scale for children (YFAS-C)",2019,"Purpose: This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Korean version of Yale Food Addiction Scale for Children (YFAS-C). Methods: Participants were 419 young adolescent students (11~15 years old). The content validity of the expert group was calculated as the content validity index (CVI) after the translation and reverse translation process of the 25 items of the YFAS-C. The multitrait-multi-method matrix (MTMM) method was used to verify the construct validity; the generalized linear model (GLM) was used to evaluate the concurrent and incremental validity. Reliability was calculated as Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) and Spearman-Brown coefficients. Results: The CVI of the 25 items was greater than the item-level CVI .80 and the scale-level CVI .90. The Korean version of YFAS-C had verified convergent validity in emotional eating and external eating and discriminant validity in restrained eating. In addition, it had verified concurrent validity in emotional eating and external eating. Finally the incremental validity of the Korean version of YFAS-C was statistically significant on BMI. Reliability was KR-20 a=.69 and the Spearman-Brown coefficient was .64. Conclusion: The Korean version of YFAS-C is a valid and reliable scale for measuring the severity of food addiction; it can be a useful scale for preventing obesity by predicting food addiction early. ? 2019 Korean Society of Nursing Science.","adolescent; body mass; child; emotion; female; food addiction; human; male; pathology; questionnaire; reproducibility; severity of illness index; South Korea; translating (language); Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Child; Emotions; Female; Food Addiction; Humans; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating"
"Targets of monoclonal antibodies for immunological diseases",2019,"Immunological disorders such as allergy, autoimmune diseases, auto-inflammatory syndromes and immunological deficiency syndromes are difficult to treat with chemical drugs. Recently, many monoclonal antibodies targeting various molecules including interleukin, tumor necrosis factor-α, cluster of differentiation, integrins, complement C5 and B lymphocyte stimulator are clinically available and give a hope to patients suffering from these intractable diseases. Here, we selected twenty-seven monoclonal antibodies approved by US FDA since 1997 and they are classified according to their target molecules. Although these biomedicines possessed some restrictions such as high cost and susceptible to infectious disease, these drawbacks can be overcome through cost-cutting innovations including biosimilars and careful monitoring.

"The combination of sport and sport-specific diet is associated with characteristics of gut microbiota: An observational study",2019,"Background: Recently, gut microbiota have been studied extensively for health promotion, disease prevention, disease treatment, and exercise performance. It is recommended that athletes avoid dietary fiber and resistant starch to promote gastric emptying and reduce gastrointestinal distress during exercise, but this diet may reduce microbial diversity and compromise the health of the athlete's gut microbiota. Objective: This study compared fecal microbiota characteristics using high-throughput sequencing among healthy sedentary men (as controls), bodybuilders, and distance runners, as well as the relationships between microbiota characteristics, body composition, and nutritional status. Methods: Body composition was measured using DXA, and physical activity level was assessed using IPAQ. Dietary intake was analyzed with the computerized nutritional evaluation program. The DNA of fecal samples was extracted and it was sequenced for the analysis of gut microbial diversity through bioinformatics cloud platform. Results: We showed that exercise type was associated with athlete diet patterns (bodybuilders: high protein, high fat, low carbohydrate, and low dietary fiber diet; distance runners: low carbohydrate and low dietary fiber diet). However, athlete type did not differ in regard to gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity. Athlete type was significantly associated with the relative abundance of gut microbiota at the genus and species level: Faecalibacterium, Sutterella, Clostridium, Haemophilus, and Eisenbergiella were the highest (p < 0.05) in bodybuilders, while Bifidobacterium and Parasutterella were the lowest (p < 0.05). At the species level, intestinal beneficial bacteria widely used as probiotics (Bifidobacterium adolescentis group, Bifidobacterium longum group, Lactobacillus sakei group) and those producing short chain fatty acids (Blautia wexlerae, Eubacterium hallii) were the lowest in bodybuilders and the highest in controls. In addition, aerobic or resistance exercise training with an unbalanced intake of macronutrients and low intake of dietary fiber led to similar diversity of gut microbiota. Specifically, daily protein intake was negatively correlated with operation taxonomic unit (r = - 0.53, p < 0.05), ACE (r = - 0.51, p < 0.05), and Shannon index (r = - 0.64, p < 0.01) in distance runners. Conclusion: Results suggest that high-protein diets may have a negative impact on gut microbiota diversity for athletes, while athletes in resistance sports that carry out the high protein low carbohydrates diet demonstrate a decrease in short chain fatty acid-producing commensal bacteria. ? 2019 The Author(s).","volatile fatty acid; adult; bacterium; body composition; case control study; classification; diet; dietary fiber; human; intestine flora; male; nutrition; protein intake; sport; young adult; Adult; Bacteria; Body Composition; Case-Control Studies; Diet; Dietary Fiber; Dietary Proteins; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Male; Sports; Sports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Young Adult"
"A microparticle approach for non-viral gene delivery within 3D human mesenchymal stromal cell aggregates",2019,"Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular aggregates, in comparison to two-dimensional monolayer culture, can provide tissue culture models that better recapitulate the abundant cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions found in vivo. In addition, aggregates are potentially useful building blocks for tissue engineering. However, control over the interior aggregate microenvironment is challenging due to inherent barriers for diffusion of biological mediators (e.g. growth factors) throughout the multicellular aggregates. Previous studies have shown that incorporation of biomaterials into multicellular aggregates can support cell survival and control differentiation of stem cell aggregates by delivering morphogens from within the 3D construct. In this study, we developed a highly efficient microparticle-based gene delivery approach to uniformly transfect human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) within multicellular aggregates and cell sheets. We hypothesized that release of plasmid DNA (pDNA) lipoplexes from mineral-coated microparticles (MCMs) within 3D hMSC constructs would improve transfection in comparison to standard free pDNA lipoplex delivery in the media. Our approach increased transfection efficiency 5-fold over delivery of free pDNA lipoplexes in the media and resulted in homogenous distribution of transfected cells throughout the 3D constructs. Additionally, we found that MCMs improved hMSC transfection by specifically increasing macropinocytosis-mediated uptake of pDNA. Finally, we showed up to a three-fold increase of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression and enhanced calcium deposition within 3D hMSC constructs following MCM-mediated delivery of a BMP-2 encoding plasmid and culture in osteogenic medium. The technology described here provides a valuable tool for achieving efficient and homogenous transfection of 3D cell constructs and is therefore of particular value in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Statement of Significance: This original research describes a materials-based approach, whereby use of mineral-coated microparticles improves the efficiency of non-viral gene delivery in three-dimensional human mesenchymal stromal cell constructs. Specifically, it demonstrates the use of mineral-coated microparticles to enable highly efficient transfection of human mesenchymal stromal cells in large, 3D culture formats. The manuscript also identifies specific endocytosis pathways that interact with the mineral coating to afford the improved transfection efficiency, as well as demonstrates the utility of this approach toward improving differentiation of large cell constructs. We feel that this manuscript will impact the current understanding and near-term development of materials for non-viral gene delivery in broad tissue engineering and biofabrication applications, and therefore be of interest to a diverse biomaterials audience. ? 2019","biomaterial; bone morphogenetic protein 2; calcium; lipoplex; nanoparticle; plasmid DNA; Article; cell aggregation; cell culture technique; cell interaction; cell survival; comparative study; extracellular matrix; genetic transfection; human; human cell; macropinocytosis; mesenchymal stroma cell; microenvironment; monolayer culture; nonviral gene delivery system; priority journal; protein expression; stem cell; three dimensional multicellular aggregate; tissue engineering"
"Longitudinal change of FEV 1 and inspiratory capacity: Clinical implication and relevance to exacerbation risk in patients with COPD",2019,"Background and objective: FEV 1 is the gold standard for assessment of COPD. We compared efficacy of FEV 1 , inspiratory capacity (IC), and IC to total lung capacity (TLC) ratio in the evaluation of COPD and their association with exacerbation. Methods: We analyzed the association of dyspnea severity, quality of life status, and lung function with lung function measurements and exacerbation risk in 982 patients enrolled in the Korea COPD Subgroup Registry and Subtype Research study. Exacerbation and longitudinal lung function change were evaluated in 3 years’ follow-up. Results: The FEV 1 , IC, and IC to TLC ratio showed comparable negative correlations with dyspnea severity and quality of life status, and positive correlation with exercise capacity. In patients with &gt;2 events/year, annual rate of change in FEV 1 and IC tended to decline more rapidly in those with FEV 1 &lt;50% than in those with FEV 1 &gt;50% (-14.46±19.40 mL/year vs 12.29±9.24 mL/year, P=0.213;-4.75±17.28 mL/year vs-78.05±34.16 mL/year, P=0.056 for FEV 1 and IC, respectively), without significance. Conclusion: Longitudinal changes in IC and FEV 1 were not significantly associated with exacerbation risk. ? 2019 Jo et al.","aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease severity; dyspnea; exercise; female; follow up; forced expiratory volume; human; inspiratory capacity; lung function test; major clinical study; male; quality of life; risk factor; South Korea; total lung capacity; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial; comparative study; disease exacerbation; longitudinal study; lung; multicenter study; pathophysiology; predictive value; prognosis; prospective study; register; risk assessment; time factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disease Progression; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Inspiratory Capacity; Longitudinal Studies; Lung; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Registries; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Total Lung Capacity"
"Practice pattern of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in Japan, Korea and Taiwan: A Web-based survey",2019,"Objectives: To investigate the treatment pattern of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients among urologists in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, with emphasis on compliance with important treatment guidelines. Methods: A Web-based questionnaire survey was conceived by representative members of each country's urological oncology society and was open from June 2016 to February 2017 to each society's members. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used. Results: A total of 2334 urologists were invited and 701 responded to the survey with a response rate of 30.0%. Instruments used during transurethral resection of bladder cancer varied significantly between countries and depended on their availability. The re-transurethral resection rate for pT1 or high-grade disease >50% of the time was significantly higher in Japan than in the other two countries, but the collective rate was just 49%. The frequency of intravesical therapy in intermediate- to high-risk disease was generally consistent across countries. However, the choice of agent between chemotherapy and bacillus Calmette–Gu?rin was significantly different between countries. Maintenance bacillus Calmette–Gu?rin was used <10% of the time by 45% of respondents, the most important reasons being fear of side-effects, followed by a lack of efficacy and shortage of drug supply. Conclusions: There are significant differences between Japan, Korea and Taiwan in the management of intermediate- to high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The results of this survey can serve as the basis for joint efforts to develop common clinical guidelines. ? 2019 The Japanese Urological Association","cisplatin; doxorubicin; epirubicin; mitomycin; pirarubicin; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer therapy; health survey; high risk patient; human; Japan; Korea; major clinical study; multiple choice test; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; non muscle invasive bladder cancer; priority journal; questionnaire; Taiwan; transurethral resection; urologist; web browser"
"Effect of interaction between early menarche and genetic polymorphisms on triglyceride",2019,"Early menarche has been associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, investigating the association of each component of metabolic syndrome with age at menarche, and interactions between them, might lead to a better understanding of metabolic syndrome pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated age at menarche for risk of metabolic syndrome and associations with its components. As a result, the risk of MetS incidence was significantly increased only at ?12 years of age at menarche (OR = 1.91, P<0.05). Women with early menarche (?12 years) had significantly higher levels of triglycerides (β coefficient = 37.83, P=0.02). In addition, hypertriglyceridemia was significantly increased at early menarche with 1.99 (95% CI: 1.16-3.41, P<0.01). With GWAS-based pathway analysis, we found the type 2 diabetes mellitus, stress-activated protein kinase signaling, and Jun amino-terminal kinase cascade pathways (all nominal P<0.001, all FDR < 0.05) to be significantly involved with early menarche on triglyceride levels. These findings may help us understand the role of early menarche on triglyceride and interaction between gene and early menarche on triglyceride for the development of metabolic syndrome. ? 2019 Ho-Sun Lee et al.","Enzymes; Metabolism; Beta coefficients; Genetic polymorphisms; Hypertriglyceridemia; Metabolic syndromes; Pathway analysis; Stress-activated proteins; Triglyceride levels; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Association reactions; C reactive protein; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; protein c jun; stress activated protein kinase; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol; adolescent; adult; aged; amino terminal sequence; anthropometric parameters; Article; cardiometabolic risk; clinical evaluation; controlled study; disease association; female; gene interaction; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genotype environment interaction; high risk population; human; hypertriglyceridemia; incidence; major clinical study; menarche; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; onset age; risk assessment; risk factor; blood; child; cohort analysis; genetic polymorphism; genetics; menarche; middle aged; prospective study; Age; Enzymes; Lead; Metabolism; Organizations; Stresses; Type; Women; Adult; Aged; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Menarche; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Triglycerides"
"Analgesic effect of melittin on oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats",2019,"Oxaliplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent used for metastatic colon and other advanced cancers. Most common side effect of oxaliplatin is peripheral neuropathy, manifested in mechanical and cold allodynia. Although the analgesic effect of bee venom has been proven to be effective against oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy, the effect of its major component; melittin has not been studied yet. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether melittin has an analgesic effect on oxaliplatin-induced allodynia. Intraperitoneal single injection of oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg) induced mechanical and cold allodynia, resulting in increased withdrawal behavior in response to von Frey filaments and acetone drop on hind paw. Subcutaneous melittin injection on acupoint ST36 (0.5 mg/kg) alleviated oxaliplatin-induced mechanical and cold allodynia. In electrophysiological study, using spinal in vivo extracellular recording, it was shown that oxaliplatin-induced hyperexcitation of spinal wide dynamic range neurons in response to peripheral stimuli, and melittin administration inhibited this neuronal activity. In behavioral assessment, analgesic effect of melittin was blocked by intrathecal α1- and α2- adrenergic receptor antagonists administration. Based on these results, we suggest that melittin could be used as an analgesic on oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy, and that its effect is mediated by activating the spinal α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors. ? 2019 by the authors.","adrenergic receptor blocking agent; adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; alpha 1B adrenergic receptor; melittin; oxaliplatin; tungsten; allodynia; analgesic activity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; behavior assessment; Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale; controlled study; drug administration; dura mater; fungistatic activity; hind paw; laminectomy; mechanical allodynia; neuropathic pain; nonhuman; oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy; paw withdrawal latency; rat; spike"
"Could polyphenols help in the control of rheumatoid arthritis?",2019,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, joint-invading, autoimmune inflammatory disease, which causes joint cartilage breakdown and bone damage, resulting in functional impairment and deformation of the joints. The percentage of RA patients has been rising and RA represents a substantial burden for patients around the world. Despite the development of many RA therapies, because of the side effects and low effectiveness of conventional drugs, patients still need and researchers are seeking new therapeutic alternatives. Polyphenols extracted from natural products are effective on several inflammatory diseases, including RA. In this review polyphenols are classified into four types: flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes and others, among which mainly flavonoids are discussed. Researchers have reported that anti-RA efficacies of polyphenols are based mainly on three mechanisms: their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and apoptotic properties. The main RA factors modified by polyphenols are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Polyphenols could be potent alternative RA therapies and sources for novel drugs for RA by affecting its key mechanisms. ? 2019 by the authors.","cytokine; mitogen activated protein kinase; polyphenol; stress activated protein kinase; animal; chemistry; drug effect; human; MAPK signaling; metabolism; pathology; rheumatoid arthritis; Animals; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cytokines; Humans; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Polyphenols"
"Heavy Metal Determination by Inductively Coupled Plasma–Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Direct Mercury Analysis (DMA) and Arsenic Mapping by Femtosecond (fs)–Laser Ablation (LA) ICP-MS in Cereals",2019,"A study of the lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) contents in popular cereals was conducted using inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), direct mercury analysis (DMA), and femtosecond laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (fs-LA-ICP-MS). For Pb, Cd, and As determination, the samples were prepared using microwave digestion, while for Hg, the samples were homogenized and measured by DMA without additional pretreatment. Satisfactory values for all of the quality parameters that include the SD, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), accuracy, and recovery were obtained, clearly validating the analytical techniques used in the current study. Recovery and accuracy measurements were done using rice flour CRM 108-01-002 from Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). All measured concentrations for these elements were lower than the national regulatory guideline values provided by the CODEX Alimentarius and Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. A sample from each group was also selected for an As distribution study within a grain using fs-LA-ICP-MS. As is classified as a first-class carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). For adlay, oats, and barley, As was determined to be primarily distributed in the area where the grain splits, while for foxtail millet, sorghum and corn, As was concentrated in the grain embryo. Also, it was confirmed that the exposure of heavy metals in the diet was negligible due to the low metal concentrations consumed daily in these foods. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis.",""
"Surrogate decision making of chemotherapy consent: Do we really provide informed consent of chemotherapy for patients?",2019,"Background/Aims: Despite increased demand for cancer patient’s to make their own decisions based on an adequate understanding of what is involved in chemotherapy, the primary signing agent and the reasons for surrogate signing have not been appropriately evaluated. Methods: The ethics committee of the palliative medicine subgroup of the Korean Cancer Study Group designed this study and solid cancer patients to whom chemotherapy was offered, from seven institutions, were evaluated. The details relating to surrogate’s signing of chemotherapy consent were evaluated. Then, we analyzed the factors associated with surrogate’s signing according to patient’s demographics and characteristics related to chemotherapy consent. Results: Surrogate’s signing was noted for 20.7% (84/405) of patient and over half of surrogate signings were performed by the patients’ son or daughter (60.7%). Two main reasons for surrogate signing were patient’s incapacity (34.5%) and taking over authorization from patients (33.3%). The factors associated with more frequent surrogate’s signing were absence of spouse, lower education level, outpatient, and when residents played a role as a principle provider of chemotherapy consent. Conclusions: This study suggests the lack of patients’ own decision making for chemotherapy in some situations. This ethical dilemma must be considered for adequately informed decision making for chemotherapy while ensuring the patients’ autonomy is maintained. ? 2019 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.","adult; article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; controlled study; decision making; education; female; human; informed consent; major clinical study; male; outpatient; palliative therapy; professional standard; resident; son; spouse; aged; decision making; drug therapy; ethics; middle aged; personal autonomy; Aged; Decision Making; Drug Therapy; Female; Humans; Informed Consent; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Autonomy"
"Relationship between personal care products usage and triclosan exposure: The second Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS 2012-2014)",2019,"Background: We aimed to find the exposure level of triclosan (TCS), a known endocrine disruptor, related to the use of personal care products using a nationally representative data of the general population in Korea. Methods: This study included data of 6288 adults aged 19 years and older (2692 men, 3596 women), based on the Second Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS 2012-2014). The data were divided according to gender. The frequency and proportion of each variable were determined by dividing participants into two groups based on the top 75th percentile concentration of urinary TCS (male: 1.096 μg/g creatinine, female: 1.329 μg/g creatinine). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression analysis for the high TCS exposure and low TCS exposure groups. Results: Overall, the proportion of participants using personal care products was higher in women than in men. There was a significantly higher proportion of participants in the high TCS exposure group with younger age, higher education and income levels and with more frequent use of fragrance products, hair care products, body cleansers, cosmetics, and antimicrobial agents. In both men and women, ORs tended to increase with increased frequency of use of hair care products, body cleansers, and cosmetics before and after adjustment. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that as the frequency of use of personal care products increases, urine TCS concentration increases. Because TCS is a well-known endocrine disruptor, further studies are needed and explore other health effects with exposure to TCS in general population in Korea. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antiinfective agent; arylsulfatase; beta glucuronidase; cosmetic; creatinine; endocrine disruptor; fragrance; triclosan; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; creatinine urine level; drug exposure; drug urine level; environmental exposure; environmental factor; exercise; female; hair; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; personal care product; priority journal; self care; smoking; social status; socioeconomics; tandem mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; urinalysis"
"Understanding HLA associations from SNP summary association statistics",2019,"Strong genetic associations in the region containing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been well-documented in various human immune disorders. Imputation methods to infer HLA variants from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are currently used to understand HLA associations with a trait of interest. However, it is challenging for some researchers to obtain individual-level SNP genotype data or reference haplotype data. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new method, DISH (direct imputing summary association statistics of HLA variants), for imputing summary association statistics of HLA variants from SNP summary association statistics based on linkage disequilibria in Asian and European populations. Disease association Z scores in DISH were highly correlated with those from imputed HLA genotypes in null model datasets (r = 0.934 in Asians; r = 0.960 in Europeans). We applied DISH to two previous GWAS datasets in Asian systemic lupus erythematosus and European rheumatoid arthritis populations. There was a high correlation between Z scores in the DISH and HLA genotype imputations, showing the same disease-susceptible and protective alleles. This study illustrated the usefulness of the DISH method in understanding and identifying disease-associated HLA variants in human diseases while maintaining individual-level data security. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Development of in vitro three-dimensional co-culture system for metabolic syndrome therapeutic agents",2019,"Aims: There are many obstacles to overcome in the development of new drugs for metabolic diseases, including efficacy and toxicity problems in later stages of drug development. To overcome these problems and predict efficacy and toxicity in early stages, we constructed a new model of insulin resistance in terms of communication between 3T3-L1 adipocytes and RAW264.7 macrophages by three-dimensional (3D) culture. Results: In this study, results focused on the functional resemblance between 3D co–culture of adipocytes and macrophages and adipose tissue in diabetic mice. The 3D mono–culture preadipocytes showed good cell viability and induced cell differentiation to adipocytes, without cell confluence or cell–cell contact and interaction. The 3D co-cultured preadipocytes with RAW264.7 macrophages induced greater insulin resistance than two-dimensional and 3D mono-cultured adipocytes. Additionally, we demonstrated that 3D co-culture model had functional metabolic similarity to adipose tissue in diabetic mice. We utilized this 3D co-culture system to screen PPARγ antagonists that might have potential as therapeutic agents for diabetes as demonstrated by an in vivo assay. Conclusion: This in vitro 3D co-culture system could serve as a next-generation platform to accelerate the development of therapeutics for metabolic diseases. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor antagonist; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; body weight gain; cell culture technique; cell differentiation; cell interaction; cell viability; controlled study; in vitro study; insulin sensitivity; lipogenesis; macrophage; metabolic syndrome X; mouse; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; proadipocyte; process optimization; RAW 264.7 cell line; three dimensional cell culture"
"Chrysophanol, an anthraquinone from AST2017-01, possesses the anti-proliferative effect through increasing p53 protein levels in human mast cells",2019,"Objective: Natural products are well known as the source of drugs in the treatment of allergic inflammation. Chrysophanol, an anthraquinone from the AST2017-01 extract, showed a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect on activated human mast cells in our previous study. However, a regulatory effect of AST2017-01 and chrysophanol on mast cell proliferation induced by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) remains unclear. The present study determined the anti-proliferative effect and the fundamental mechanism of AST2017-01 and chrysophanol in mast cells. Methods: We evaluated an anti-proliferative effect of AST2017-01 and chrysophanol in TSLP-stimulated human mast cell line, HMC-1. Results: Without cytotoxicity, AST2017-01 and chrysophanol decreased mast cells growth and Ki67 mRNA expression increased by TSLP. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol enhanced expressions of p53 and Bax, whereas inhibited expression of Bcl-2. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol restored caspase-3 activity which was decreased by TSLP. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol suppressed expressions of murine double minute-2 protein and phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator of transcription six which are associated with the regulation of p53 protein. AST2017-01 and chrysophanol decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, AST2017-01 and chrysophanol reduced mRNA expressions of TSLP receptor and IL-7 receptor α. Conclusions: Therefore, this study proposes that AST2017-01 and chrysophanol may be promising candidates for the development of potent anti-inflammatory or health functional foods. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","anthraquinone; antineoplastic agent; ast 2017 01; caspase 3; chrysophanic acid; interleukin 13; interleukin 6; interleukin 7 receptor alpha; Ki 67 antigen; messenger RNA; protein Bax; protein p53; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; anthraquinone derivative; antiinflammatory agent; caspase 3; chrysophanic acid; cytokine; MDM2 protein, human; protein MDM2; protein p53; STAT6 protein; STAT6 protein, human; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; TP53 protein, human; antiproliferative activity; Article; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; enzyme activity; gene expression; HMC-1 cell line; human; human cell; mast cell; mast cell line; cell line; cell proliferation; chemistry; Cordyceps; drug effect; drug mixture; mast cell; metabolism; pharmacology; Rumex; Anthraquinones; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Caspase 3; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Complex Mixtures; Cordyceps; Cytokines; Humans; Mast Cells; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Rumex; STAT6 Transcription Factor; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"
"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Provide Better Long-Term Survival Benefits to Patients With AMI Than Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers After Survival Hospital Discharge",2019,"Aim: Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RASIs) are widely used in high-risk cardiovascular (CV) diseases, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is not yet clear which class of RASIs provides specific benefits to patients with AMI. The present study aimed to evaluate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) had any different effects on long-term CV and all-cause mortality in patients with AMI who received either agent from admission and were discharged alive from the hospital. Methods: We analyzed data of patients with AMI from the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institutes of Health registry. Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality at 12 months after AMI were assessed. Results: Among 12?481 patients with AMI who were discharged alive, RASI treatment was as follows: ACEIs (n = 5910), ARBs (n = 4009), and no RASI (n = 2562). After adjustment for multiple factors, compared with no RASI therapy, ACEI therapy was associated with lower hazard ratios (HRs) for 1-year CV and total mortality rates, whereas ARB therapy was not. In a direct comparison, compared with ARB treatment, ACEI treatment was associated with lower HRs (95% confidence interval) for CV and total mortality: 0.562 (0.420-0.753) and 0.567 (0.451-0.713), respectively. The superiority of ACEI to ARB was also observed across several subgroups. The mortality differences between the 2 treatment groups were reproduced in a propensity-score matched analysis (n = 2855 each). Conclusions: Our study of a recent AMI registry data revealed that ACEI therapy in patients with AMI was associated with better long-term survival benefits than ARB therapy. ?

"Characterization and prognostic significance of cutaneous adverse events to anti-programmed cell death-1 therapy",2019,"Background: Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immunotherapy using antibodies such as nivolumab or pembrolizumab has shown promise for treating various types of cancer. In this study, we reviewed the frequency and spectrum of cutaneous adverse events (AEs) caused by PD-1 antibodies and their possible correlation with treatment response. Methods: We reviewed records of all patients from a single institution treated with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab from August 1, 2014 to April 1, 2017. Results: Of 211 patients included in the study, 134 (63.5%) were treated with nivolumab and 77 (36.5%) with pembrolizumab. Thirty-five patients (16.4%) developed cutaneous AEs. Cutaneous AEs were significantly associated with longer treatment cycles (P = 0.001). The prevalence of cutaneous AEs did not differ between nivolumab (17.2%) and pembrolizumab (15.6%). Patient age, gender, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale and underlying malignancy were not associated with development of cutaneous AEs. Median time until onset of cutaneous AEs was 50.0 days (range, 1-378 days). Anti-PD-1 therapy was tolerable in most of patients with grade 1 (65.2%) and grade 2 (23.9%) cutaneous AEs. Pruritus (32.6%) and eczema (21.7%) were the most commonly reported cutaneous AEs. In lung cancer patients, cutaneous AEs were not associated with better treatment outcomes after adjusting for the number of treatment cycles. Conclusion: Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab exhibited tolerable cutaneous safety profiles in a variety of cancer patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy. Cutaneous AEs of anti-PD-1 therapy were not associated with antibody type, underlying malignancy, patient characteristics, or improved response. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","monoclonal antibody; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; programmed death 1 receptor; adult; aged; female; human; immunology; immunotherapy; male; middle aged; neoplasm; prognosis; pruritus; retrospective study; skin disease; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Female; Humans; Immunotherapy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Nivolumab; Prognosis; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Pruritus; Retrospective Studies; Skin Diseases; Young Adult"
"Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis of Primary Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells",2019,"Understanding the molecular profile of every human cell type is essential for understanding its role in normal physiology and disease. Technological advancements in DNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, and computational methods allow us to carry out multiomics analyses although such approaches are not routine yet. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are a widely used model system to study pathological and physiological processes associated with the cardiovascular system. In this study, next-generation sequencing and high-resolution mass spectrometry to profile the transcriptome and proteome of primary HUVECs is employed. Analysis of 145 million paired-end reads from next-generation sequencing confirmed expression of 12?186 protein-coding genes (FPKM ?0.1), 439 novel long non-coding RNAs, and revealed 6089 novel isoforms that were not annotated in GENCODE. Proteomics analysis identifies 6477 proteins including confirmation of N-termini for 1091 proteins, isoforms for 149 proteins, and 1034 phosphosites. A database search to specifically identify other post-translational modifications provide evidence for a number of modification sites on 117 proteins which include ubiquitylation, lysine acetylation, and mono-, di- and tri-methylation events. Evidence for 11 “missing proteins,” which are proteins for which there was insufficient or no protein level evidence, is provided. Peptides supporting missing protein and novel events are validated by comparison of MS/MS fragmentation patterns with synthetic peptides. Finally, 245 variant peptides derived from 207 expressed proteins in addition to alternate translational start sites for seven proteins and evidence for novel proteoforms for five proteins resulting from alternative splicing are identified. Overall, it is believed that the integrated approach employed in this study is widely applicable to study any primary cell type for deeper molecular characterization. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Usefulness of Calculation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors to Predict Outcomes in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction",2019,"Cardiovascular risk factors contribute differently to short-term prognosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI); hypertension and diabetes increase adverse outcomes, whereas hyperlipidemia, smoking, and obesity seem to paradoxically decrease these in post-MI patients. We aimed to investigate whether a simple calculation of conventional risk factors, PARADOCS (Pressure of ARtery elevAtion, Diabetes, Obesity, Cholesterol, Smoking) score, would improve the ability to predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in post-MI patients. Between November 2011 and December 2015, 13,104 patients with diagnosis of AMI were analyzed in this study from Korean AMI Registry – National Institute of Health database. PARADOCS score was calculated as follows: (number of nonparadoxical risk factors ? number of paradoxical risk factors) + 3 where nonparadoxical risk factors are hypertension and diabetes, and paradoxical risk factors are hyperlipidemia, smoking, and obesity. PARADOCS score was significantly greater in patients with 1-year MACCEs compared with those without MACCEs (3.43 ± 1.03 vs 2.88 ± 1.11, p <0.001). In Cox proportional hazards model, PARADOCS score was an independent predictor of 1-year MACCEs (hazards ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.30; p <0.001) after adjusting for confounding variables. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve, patients with greater PARADOCS score had worse clinical outcome. In conclusion, although it needs more validation, a simple calculation of risk factors, PARADOCS score, could provide useful prognostic information of MI patients to clinicians. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","angiotensin receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; cholesterol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; arterial pressure; Article; cardiovascular risk; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; smoking; adverse event; clinical trial; complication; follow up; heart infarction; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; register; risk assessment; risk factor; South Korea; survival rate; time factor; Aged; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Hypertension; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Obesity; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Registries; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smoking; Survival Rate; Time Factors"
"Impact of health care–associated community-onset cellulitis in Korea: a multicenter study",2019,"We conducted a multicenter study to determine the clinical and microbiological characteristics of health care–associated (HCA) cellulitis in Korea. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who had been diagnosed with community-onset cellulitis. Of the 2208 cellulitis patients, 232 (10.5%) had HCA cellulitis, 1243 (56.3%) patients were hospitalized, and 15 (0.7%) died in hospital. Compared with community-acquired (CA) cellulitis, patients with HCA cellulitis were older and more frequently presented with comorbidity and septic shock. A total of 355 microorganisms were isolated from 314 patients (14.2%). Staphylococcus aureus (134 isolates) was the most common organism, followed by Streptococcus spp. (86 isolates) and Gram-negative fermenters (58 isolates). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.1% (39/134) of S. aureus infections. None of the Gram-negative fermenters were resistant to carbapenem.

"Gallocatechin Gallate-Containing Fermented Green Tea Extract Ameliorates Obesity and Hypertriglyceridemia Through the Modulation of Lipid Metabolism in Adipocytes and Myocytes",2019,"Green tea is reported to exert beneficial effects on metabolic disorders through the regulation of lipid metabolism. On the contrary, fermented food products have been introduced to improve human health by modulating immune response and energy metabolism. To maximize health benefit, we applied fermentation processing to green tea. Fermented green tea extract (FGT) inhibited adipogenesis and lipogenesis in cultured adipocytes, whereas it augmented mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes in differentiated myocytes. In diet-induced obese mice, FGT blunted body weight and fat mass gain by 69.7% and 56.7%, respectively. FGT also improved circulating triglyceride concentrations by 32.6%. Similar to in vitro results, FGT suppressed lipogenesis and promoted lipid catabolism in peripheral tissues. In addition, FGT administration modulated the composition of certain gut microbiota which are associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders. Among the various components of FGT, gallocatechin gallate is suggested to mediate the effect of FGT on lipid metabolism. Taken together, we propose FGT as a novel functional food to benefit human health by controlling adiposity and lipid metabolism. ?

"Quantitative analysis of carotid arterial calcification using airway CT in obstructive sleep apnea",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and carotid arterial calcification by quantitative analysis using airway computed tomography (CT). Methods: This study included a total of 180 consecutive OSA patients aged 45–80 years underwent polysomnography and airway CT between March 2014 and October 2016. The subjects were divided into three groups based on the results of the respiratory disturbance index (RDI): mild (RDI 5–14, n = 29), moderate (RDI 15–29, n = 50), and severe (RDI ? 30, n = 101). The extent of carotid arterial calcification on each airway CT scan was quantified according to the modified Agatston scoring method. Differences among the three groups in clinical characteristics including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbid disease, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and carotid arterial calcification score (CarACS) were analyzed. Results: The severe OSA group showed significantly stronger predominance for male and smoker, higher prevalence of diabetes, and larger BMI than those of mild and moderate OSA groups. The mean CarACS was significantly different among the three groups (mild RDI: 4.3 ± 13.4, moderate RDI: 7.4 ± 28.8, severe RDI: 48.6 ± 121.6, P = 0.011). Univariate linear regression showed that RDI, age, hypertension, male sex and diabetes significantly influenced on the CarACS. In a multivariate linear regression model, the CarACS was related to age, male sex, and diabetes. Conclusions: The patients with severe OSA showed larger CarACS and a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors. The CarACS was correlated with severity of OSA, which might be more dependent on the conventional risk factors of atherosclerosis. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","cholesterol; adult; age; age difference; aged; airway computed tomography; Article; atherosclerosis; blood pressure; body mass; carotid arterial calcification score; carotid artery obstruction; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol blood level; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; correlation analysis; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; female; heart infarction; human; hypertension; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; neurologic examination; polysomnography; prevalence; quantitative analysis; respiratory disturbance index; risk factor; scoring system; sex difference; sleep disordered breathing; smoking; univariate analysis; blood vessel calcification; carotid artery disease; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic imaging; hypertension; middle aged; multivariate analysis; obesity; severity of illness index; sex factor; sleep disordered breathing; statistical model; x-ray computed tomography; Age Factors; Aged; Body Mass Index; Carotid Artery Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Overweight; Polysomnography; Prevalence; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Smoking; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vascular Calcification"
"The Associations of National Context and Subjective Well-being with Marriage Expectations Among Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese Emerging Adults",2019,"Objectives: Previous research suggests married individuals tend to be healthier and happier, however, we know little about the associations between subjective well-being and marriage expectations among never-married emerging adults, with less research in Asian context. This study examined how national context and individual subjective well-being are associated with emerging adults’ marriage expectations in three Asian countries—South Korea, China, and Vietnam—which share the traditional Confucian marriage norms but differ in the degree of industrialization. Methods: Using convenience sampling, data came from 1,019 never-married college students living in the cities of Korea, China, and Vietnam. Results: The majority of the participants across the three countries had marriage intentions. The higher the subjective well-being, the more likely the participants were to have marriage intentions, and the earlier the expected marriage age. Cross-country difference was observed such that emerging adults from Korea were more likely to expect later marriage age than their counterparts from China and Vietnam. There was also gender difference in the association between subjective well-being and expected marriage age; the negative association between subjective well-being and expected marriage age was found for men, but not for women. Conclusions: The current study provides empirical evidence that national context and subjective well-being are associated with emerging adults’ expectations about future marriage. Given that higher subjective well-being was associated with more intentions to marry and an earlier expected marriage age beyond the national context, enhancing individual well-being through mental health promotions could be an effective pro-marriage policy. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; China; city; college student; Confucian; convenience sample; expectation; female; human; human experiment; industrialization; major clinical study; male; mental health; sex difference; single (marital status); South Korea; Viet Nam; wellbeing"
"Primate-specific miR-944 activates p53-dependent tumor suppression in human colorectal cancers",2019,"As cancers with a high incidence rate, colorectal cancers are a main cause of cancer-related death. MicroRNAs are often deregulated in cancers. The primate-specific miR-944, located in a p63 intron, is known to be highly expressed in patients exhibiting low colorectal cancer recurrence rates. However, the biological functions of miR-944 in colorectal cancers remain unclear. In this study, we found that miR-944 was downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues, and inhibited cancer cell growth in a xenograft mouse model. The overexpression of miR-944 caused G1 phase arrest and increased p53 expression in cancer cells. p53 stability was enhanced by miR-944s targeting E3 ligases COP1 and MDM2. Overexpression of COP1 and MDM2 restored cell growth inhibition caused by miR-944. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-944 acts as a potential tumor suppressor in colorectal cancers through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. ? 2018","microRNA; microRNA 944; proteasome; protein MDM2; protein p53; ubiquitin C; ubiquitin protein ligase COP1; unclassified drug; MDM2 protein, human; microRNA; MIRN-944 microRNA, human; protein MDM2; protein p53; RFWD2 protein, human; TP53 protein, human; ubiquitin protein ligase; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cell cycle progression; cell growth; colorectal cancer; controlled study; down regulation; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; protein RNA binding; protein stability; protein targeting; upregulation; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; colorectal tumor; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; xenograft; Animals; Colorectal Neoplasms; HCT116 Cells; Heterografts; HT29 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"
"Characteristics of the “young-old” and “old-old” community-dwelling suicidal Ideators: A longitudinal 6-month follow-up study",2019,"Background: Despite heterogeneity of older people in suicidal behavior, research identifying characteristics by age groups is scarce. We examined baseline features of older community-dwelling suicidal ideators by dichotomized age groups and the 6-month trajectory of their suicidal ideation along with its related psychopathology. Predictors of suicidal ideation within each group were investigated. Methods: Older community-dwelling suicidal ideators enrolled in the Korean Cohort for the Model Predicting a Suicide and Suicide-related Behavior study were subdivided into the “young-old (65–74 years)” and “old-old (?75 years)” group. Baseline, 1-, and 6-month assessments were compared. Within each group, multiple regression analysis using rating scales (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Stress Questionnaire for Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-Short Form, and Social Relationships Scale) was conducted to identify predictors of suicidal ideation measured with the intensity subscale of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was used to compare changes in suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety between age groups over time, and one-way RM-ANOVA to examine changes within each age group. Results: Among 29 “young-old” and 53 “old-old” ideators, the latter were less likely to be receiving psychiatric treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 4.065) and make suicide attempts (OR = 2.874), whereas the former revealed greater levels of anxiety and stress. Baseline depression and stress in the “young-old” group and the “old-old” group, respectively, predicted the intensity of suicidal ideation at both baseline and 1-month assessments. No significant age group x time interactions on suicidal ideation and depression were found. However, within each age group, both suicidal ideation and depression significantly decreased only during the first month with no further improvement. Conclusion: We speculate cautiously that more attention may need to be paid to the “old-old” ideators in the evaluation of psychiatric issues and for referral to psychiatrists. To decrease suicidal ideation, tailored approaches involving proactive, timely management of depression in the “young-old” and interventions focusing on stress reduction in the “old-old,” would be helpful. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","aged; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; anxiety; Article; Beck Anxiety Inventory; community dwelling person; depression; female; follow up; groups by age; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; stress; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; age; analysis of variance; independent living; nutrition; psychology; questionnaire; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety; Depression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Independent Living; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Nutrition Surveys; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Glutathione-responsive PEGylated GQD-based nanomaterials for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer",2019,"Graphene quantum dots-based nanoparticles (GQD-NPs) with reduction-responsive properties were synthesized via conjugation with two precursors, doxorubicin-disulfide-GQD that endowed the drug loading capability and polyethylene glycol-disulfide-Herceptin that enhanced the half-life and conferred active targeting ability towards HER2-overexpressed cancer. Disulfide linkages between the compartments are cleaved at a physiologically relevant concentration of glutathione in cancer cells, resulting a controlled release of drugs. In vitro analysis confirmed successful internalization of GQD-NPs in the cytoplasm and enhanced cellular uptake of DOX in HER2-positive breast cancer cells.

"Staphylococcus aureus Nasal Colonization and Asthma in Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a frequent colonizer in humans, and it is known to be associated with chronic allergic diseases including asthma. Recent individual studies suggested that nasal SA colonization may be positively associated with asthma. Objective: To examine relationships between nasal SA colonization and asthma prevalence and activity in adults. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies published until June 2018. Studies that reported nasal SA colonization prevalence and asthma outcome (prevalence and disease activity) in general adult populations or patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were included. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) of the relationships. Subgroup analysis was conducted for the presence of nasal polyps within CRS populations. Results: A total of 21 cross-sectional studies were identified, and the data from 16 studies using culture methods for SA detection were meta-analyzed (5 general population-based studies and 11 studies of patients with CRS). In studies of general populations, nasal SA colonization had significant relationships with asthma prevalence (OR 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.34; I2 = 1%). In studies of patients with CRS, positive associations were also found but had a considerable heterogeneity (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.18-2.97; I2 = 72%). However, the results were comparable between CRS with and without nasal polyps. Conclusions: This study demonstrated modest but significant relationships between nasal SA colonization and asthma, supporting potential roles of SA in adult patients with asthma. Further longitudinal cohort and intervention studies are warranted to identify host determinants and to clarify causality of the relationships. ? 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","adult; antigen specificity; Article; bacterial colonization; chronic rhinosinusitis; disease association; high risk population; human; nasal colonization; prevalence; risk assessment; sensitization; Staphylococcus aureus; systematic review"
"Repurposing natural products as novel HDAC inhibitors by comparative analysis of gene expression profiles",2019,"Background: Extracts derived from natural products have been used to produce health supplements or therapeutic agents in oriental medicine. Although these extracts contain various bioactive compounds, their applications are generally limited to a few previously known diseases. To effectively expand their use for the treatment of other conditions, systematic analysis should be conducted for repurposing. Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the new therapeutic efficacies of the Platycodon grandiflorum and ginseng extract using the CMAP-based gene expression analysis. Methods: In the present study, we analyzed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from extracts as the basis for drug repurposing. Cells were treated with extracts or single compounds derived from nine natural products. DEG analysis indicated that the gene expression patterns of cells treated with P. grandiflorum and ginseng extracts were highly similar to those of cells treated with different types of Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. To identify the new mechanism of these extracts, we carried out cell viability assay, TUNEL assay, HDAC enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Results: In vitro experiments at the dose of 50 ?g/ml of each extract did not affect cell death rate but significantly inhibited HDAC activity. Each extract was found to inhibit HDAC enzymatic activity and induce the expression of the p21. Furthermore, our results revealed that each extract stimulated cell death and inhibited cell proliferation. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the HDAC-inhibiting activity of P. grandiflorum and ginseng extracts and further validate the effectiveness of DEG similarity-based repurposing of natural products. ? 2019","ginseng extract; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; natural product; Platycodon grandiflorum extract; protein p21; protein p53; vorinostat; biological product; histone deacetylase inhibitor; plant extract; transcriptome; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cell viability assay; comparative study; controlled study; drug repositioning; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; immunoblotting; in vitro study; nonhuman; oriental medicine; Platycodon; priority journal; protein expression; TUNEL assay; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug repositioning; genetics; lung tumor; Panax; pathology; procedures; tumor cell line; Biological Products; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Repositioning; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Panax; Plant Extracts; Platycodon; Transcriptome"
"Efficacy and Safety of a Fixed-Dose Combination of Candesartan and Rosuvastatin on Blood Pressure and Cholesterol in Patients With Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Phase III Clinical Study",2019,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the blood pressure–lowering and cholesterol-lowering effects of a fixed-dose combination therapy using candesartan (CND)/rosuvastatin (RSV) compared with CND or RSV monotherapy in patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Methods: This study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. A total of 394 patients were screened. After a 4-week run-in period, 219 of these patients with hypertension and primary hypercholesterolemia were randomized. Patients received 1 of 3 regimens for 8 weeks: (1) CND 32 mg/RSV 20 mg, (2) RSV 20 mg, or (3) CND 32 mg. The primary outcome variables were changes in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the percentage changes in LDL-C from baseline to the drug treatment at 8 weeks. The secondary outcome variables were percentage changes of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, non–HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A-I, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and glucose metabolic indices, including percentage changes of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, and hemoglobin A1c. Tolerability of combination therapy was compared with other monotherapy groups. Findings: The percentage changes of LDL-C were ?48.6% (from 157.2 to 80.1 mg/dL) in the RSV group and ?49.8% (from 160.2 to 78.9 mg/dL) in the CND/RSV group from baseline to the end of 8 weeks of treatment. Mean SBP and DBP were significantly decreased in the CND/RSV and CND groups after 8 weeks (P &lt; 0.001 for all); however, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups. Total cholesterol levels, triglycerides, non–HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B were significantly reduced in the CND/RSV and RSV groups, with no significant differences between the groups compared with the CND group (P &lt; 0.001 for all). The percentage changes of HOMA-IR, adiponectin, and hemoglobin A1c had no significant differences between the combination groups and monotherapy groups. However, in a 2-sample t test, HOMA-IR was significantly decreased in the CND/RSV group compared with the RSV group in nondiabetic patients (mean [SD] percentage change of HOMA-IR, ?8.7% [37.6%] vs 17.1% [53.1%]; P = 0.048). There were no significant differences in metabolic indices between the diabetic groups. Adverse events in the CND/RSV group were similar to those in the monotherapy group. Implications: Once-daily fixed-dose combination therapy with CND/RSV is an effective, tolerable, convenient treatment option for patients with essential hypertension and hypercholesteremia.

"Biochanin A prevents 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced adipocyte dysfunction in cultured 3T3-L1 cells",2019,"2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental pollutant. TCDD accumulates in the food chain, mainly in the fatty tissues of the human body where it causes various toxic effects. Biochanin A is a natural organic compound in the class of phytochemicals known as flavonoids. We investigated whether biochanin A suppresses TCDD-induced loss of adipogenic action using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell culture model of wasting syndrome. In the present study, biochanin A suppressed TCDD-induced loss of lipid accumulation. Pretreating the cells with biochanin A increased the levels of the adipogenesis-associated factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adiponectin, which were inhibited by TCDD. TCDD decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was effectively restored by pretreatment with biochanin A. Biochanin A also inhibited the TCDD-driven decrease in production of insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transporter 4. These results suggest a preventive effect of biochanin A against TCDD in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. TCDD increased production of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), prostaglandin E2, cytosolic phospholipase A2, and cyclooxygenase-1, while reducing the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. However, biochanin A inhibited these TCDD-induced effects. We conclude that biochanin A is an attractive compound for preventing TCDD-induced wasting syndrome. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cell culture; Differentiation (calculus); Glucose; Insulin; Plants (botany); 2 ,3 ,7 ,8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxins; 3T3-L1 adipocytes; Biochanin A; Environmental pollutants; Insulin receptor substrate-1; Insulin-stimulated glucose; Natural organic compounds; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Substrates; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; adiponectin; biochanin A; calcium ion; cyclooxygenase 1; cytosolic phospholipase A2; glucose transporter 4; insulin receptor substrate 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; prostaglandin E2; triacylglycerol; biochanin A; genistein; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal cell; Article; calcium cell level; cell damage; cell differentiation; controlled study; drug efficacy; glucose transport; lipid storage; nonhuman; protein blood level; adipocyte; animal; biological model; drug effect; human; metabolism; mouse; pollutant; toxicity; wasting syndrome; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Genistein; Humans; Mice; Models, Biological; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Wasting Syndrome"
"Manufacture and characterization of optimized red ginseng drinks containing herbal medicine extracts",2019,"The optimum mixing ratio of red ginseng, herbal medicine extracts, and oligosaccharides for diabetic improvement was investigated and verified through animal experiments. Using the optimum mixing technique, 2% red ginseng extract, 15% oligosaccharides, and 83% herbal medicine extracts were determined to be optimal for red ginseng beverages. The taste was improved as the amount of red ginseng decreased and oligosaccharides increased, whereas antioxidative activity was increased with increased red ginseng. In the animal model in which streptozotocin was administered to BALB-c mice, the red ginseng administration group exhibited lower blood glucose than the diabetic control group, and the blood glucose level was lower in the herbal medicine and red ginseng extract administration group. Insulin concentration was slightly increased by the red ginseng beverage, and hepatotoxicity due to excessive intake of red ginseng beverages was not detected. ? 2019, The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology.","Beverages; Blood; Glucose; Mammals; Medicine; Mixing; Oligosaccharides; Optimization; Animal experiments; Anti oxidative activity; Blood glucose; Blood glucose level; Herbal medicines; Insulin concentrations; Mixing techniques; Red ginseng; Plant extracts"
"Antiproliferative 3-deoxysphingomyelin analogs: Design, synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular docking of pyrrolidine-based 3-deoxysphingomyelin analogs as anticancer agents",2019,"Sphingomyelins and glycerophospholipids are structurally related phospholipids. Nevertheless, glycerophospholipids analogs are known as antitumor agents while sphingomyelin analogs were reported as cytoprotective agents. Herein, we have addressed the development of 3-deoxysphingomyelin analogs as cytotoxic agents possessing modified sphingobases. Thus, pyrrolidine-based 3-deoxysphingomyelin analogs were synthesized and evaluated against a panel of cell lines representing four major types of cancers. Compounds 3d, 4d and 6d elicited better GI 50 values than the FDA approved drug miltefosine. Investigation of their impact on Akt phosphorylation as a possible mechanism for the antiproliferative activity of this class of compounds revealed that these compounds might elicit a concentration-dependent mechanism via inhibition of Akt phosphorylation at the lower concentration. Molecular docking predicted their binding modes to Akt to involve polar head binding to the Pleckstrin homology domain and hydrophobic tail extension into a hydrophobic pocket connecting the Pleckstrin homology domain and the kinase domain. As a whole, the described work suggests compounds 3d, 4d and 6d as promising pyrrolidine-based 3-deoxysphingomyelin analogs for development of novel cancer therapies. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","(1 docos 13 enoylpyrrolidin 2 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; (1 docos 13 enoylpyrrolidin 3 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; (1 hexadec 9 enoylpyrrolidin 2 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; (1 hexadec 9 enoylpyrrolidin 3 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; (1 oleoylpyrrolidin 2 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; (1 oleoylpyrrolidin 3 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; (1 palmitoylpyrrolidin 2 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; (1 palmitoylpyrrolidin 3 yl)methyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; 1 (octadeca 9,12 dienoyl)pyrrolidin 3 yl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; 1 (octadeca 9,12,15 trienoyl)pyrrolidin 3 yl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; 1 docos 13 enoylpyrrolidin 3 yl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; 1 hexadec 9 enoylpyrrolidin 3 yl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; 1 oleoylpyrrolidin 3 yl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; 1 palmitoylpyrrolidin 3 yl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate; cytotoxic agent; miltefosine; protein kinase B; pyrrolidine derivative; sphingomyelin; unclassified drug; [1 (octadeca 9,12 dienoyl)pyrrolidin 2 yl]methyl 2 [2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl]phosphate; [1 (octadeca 9,12 dienoyl)pyrrolidin 3 yl]methyl 2 [2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl]phosphate; [1 (octadeca 9,12,15 trienoyl)pyrrolidin 2 yl]methyl 2 [2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl]phosphate; [1 (octadeca 9,12,15 trienoyl)pyrrolidin 3 yl]methyl 2 [2 (trimethylammonio)ethyl]phosphate; antineoplastic agent; protein kinase B; pyrrolidine derivative; sphingomyelin; A-431 cell line; A-549 cell line; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer inhibition; computer model; concentration response; controlled study; crystal structure; drug binding site; drug cytotoxicity; drug design; drug mechanism; drug screening; drug synthesis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; GI50; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; IC50; MCF-7 cell line; molecular docking; pleckstrin homology domain; priority journal; simulation; stereochemistry; binding site; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; metabolism; molecular docking; phosphorylation; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Binding Sites; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Drug Design; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyrrolidines; Sphingomyelins; Structure-Activity Relationship"
"Risks of completed suicide of community individuals with ICD-10 disorders across age groups: A nationwide population-based nested case-control study in South Korea",2019,"Objective Suicide is the leading cause of death in 10-39-year-olds in South Korea, and the second highest rate among the OECD countries. However, few studies have investigated the particularity of completed suicide in South Korea. Methods Study subjects consisted of 2,838 suicide cases and 56,758 age and sex matched living controls from a national representative sample of 1,025,340 South Koreans. They were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) with follow-up up to 12 years. We obtained information on primary diagnosis of any ICD-10 disorder along with suicide cases during their lifetime. Results Among ICD-10 disorders, depression was the most common disorder (19.10%, n=542), found in victims of completed suicides except for common medical disorders such as hypertensive crisis, respiratory tract infection or arthropathies. After adjusting for sex, age, economic status, disability, and disorders, schizophrenia showed the strongest association with suicide (AOR: 28.56, 95% CI: 19.58-41.66) among all ICD-10 disorders, followed by psoriasis, multiple body injury, epilepsy, sleep disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder. For age groups, ?19 years was associated with anxiety disorder (AOR=80.65, 95% CI: 13.33-487.93), 20-34 years with epilepsy (AOR=134.92, 95% CI: 33.69-540.37), both 35-49 years (AOR=108.57, 95% CI: 37.17-317.09) and 50-65 years (AOR=189.41 95% CI: 26.59-1349.31), with schizophrenia, and >65 years (AOR=44.7, 95% CI: 8.93-223.63) with psoriasis. Conclusion Psychiatric and physical disorders carried greatly increased risks and numbers of suicides in South Korea. Schizophrenia was the strongest risk factor, especially 35-65 years, and depression was the most common in suicide victims among ICD-10 disorders in South Korea. ? 2019 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.","adjustment disorder; adult; alcoholism; anxiety disorder; Article; bipolar disorder; cause of death; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; dementia; epilepsy; female; follow up; health insurance; household income; human; ICD-10; major clinical study; male; mental health; middle aged; psoriasis; risk factor; schizophrenia; sleep disorder; social status; suicidal ideation; suicide"
"Pharmacological Activities of Alisma orientale against Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Metabolic Syndrome: Literature Review",2019,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly emerging hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. However, its unrevealed mechanism and complicated comorbidities have led to no specific medication, except for weight loss and lifestyle modification. Alisma orientale (Sam.) Juzep (A. orientale, Alismataceae) has been increasingly reported on therapeutic effects of A. orientale against NAFLD and metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Therefore, this study aimed to review the preclinical efficacy of A. orientale and its chemical constituents including Alisol A 24-acetate, Alisol B 23-acetate, Alisol F, and Alismol against NAFLD and metabolic syndrome. A. orientale prevented hepatic triglyceride accumulation through suppressing de novo lipogenesis and increasing lipid export. In addition, it controlled oxidative stress markers, lipoapoptosis, liver injury panels, and inflammatory and fibrotic mediators, eventually influencing steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Moreover, it exhibited pharmacological activities against hyperlipidemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia as well as appetite. These biological actions of A. orientale might contribute to adiponectin activation or a role as a farnesoid X receptor agonist. In particular, Alisol A 24-acetate and Alisol B 23-acetate could be expected as main compounds. Taken together, A. orientale might be an effective candidate agent for the treatment of NAFLD and its comorbidities, although further assessment of its standardization, safety test, and clinical trials is consistently required. ? 2019 Eunsol Choi et al.","acetic acid; agents affecting metabolism; alismol; alisol B 23 acetate; alisol f; farnesoid X receptor; herbaceous agent; liver protective agent; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; Alisma; Alisma orientale; antidiabetic activity; antifibrotic activity; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; chemical composition; drug activity; drug effect; human; hyperglycemia; hyperlipidemia; hypolipidemic activity; lipid storage; lipoapoptosis; lipogenesis; liver fibrosis; liver protection; metabolic syndrome X; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; Review"
"Clonorchis sinensis omega-class glutathione transferases are reliable biomarkers for serodiagnosis of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis",2019,"Objectives: To determine the potential for immunodiagnostic application of two recombinant forms of Clonorchis sinensis omega-class glutathione transferases (rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2) against human small liver-fluke C. sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini infections. Methods: Specific antibody levels against rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2 in patients’ sera of egg-positive opisthorchiasis (n = 87) and clonorchiasis (n = 120), as well as those in sera from patients with other helminthic infections (n = 252) and healthy controls (n = 40) were retrospectively analysed by ELISA. Results: We observed highly positive correlation coefficients between specific antibody levels against rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2 and egg counts per gramme of faeces (EPG) of patients with opisthorchiasis (n = 87; r = 0.88 for rCsGSTo1 and r = 0.90 for rCsGSTo2). Sera from opisthorchiasis patients whose EPG counts >100 (n = 43) revealed high antibody titres against both antigens. Patients’ sera with low EPG counts (<100, n = 44) also exhibited reliable sensitivities of 93.2% and 97.7% for rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2, respectively. Sera from clonorchiasis patients showed sensitivities of 90% (108/120 samples) and 89.2% (107/120 sera) for rCsGSTo1 and rCsGSTo2. Overall diagnostic sensitivities for liver-fluke infections were 92.3% for rCsGSTo1 (191/207 samples) and 93.2% for rCsGSTo2 (193/207 samples). Specificities were 89.7% (rCsGSTo1) and 97.6% (rCsGSTo2). Conclusions: Detection of specific antibody levels against rCsGSTo1 or rCsGSTo2 might be promising for the serodiagnosis of patients infected with these two phylogenetically close carcinogenic liver-flukes. ? 2018 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","biological marker; glutathione transferase; omega class glutathione transferase 1; omega class glutathione transferase 2; protozoal protein; recombinant enzyme; unclassified drug; biological marker; glutathione transferase; helminth antibody; adolescent; adult; aged; antibody detection; antibody titer; Article; child; clonorchiasis; Clonorchis sinensis; controlled study; cross reaction; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fascioliasis; female; human; major clinical study; male; metagonimiasis; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; parasite serodiagnosis; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; schistosomiasis; sensitivity and specificity; animal; blood; clonorchiasis; Clonorchis sinensis; enzymology; feces; middle aged; opisthorchiasis; parasite egg count; parasitology; procedures; serology; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Antibodies, Helminth; Biomarkers; Child; Clonorchiasis; Clonorchis sinensis; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Feces; Female; Glutathione Transferase; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Opisthorchiasis; Parasite Egg Count; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Young Adult"
"Clinical practice guideline for cardiac rehabilitation in Korea [online only]",2019,"Objective Though clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) are an effective and widely used treatment method worldwide, they are as yet not widely accepted in Korea. Given that cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in Korea, it is urgent that CR programs be developed. In 2008, the Government of Korea implemented CR programs at 11 university hospitals as part of its Regional Cardio-Cerebrovascular Center Project, and three additional medical facilities will be added in 2019. In addition, owing to the promotion of CR nationwide and the introduction of CR insurance benefits, 40 medical institutions nationwide have begun CR programs even as a growing number of medical institutions are preparing to offer CR. The purpose of this research was to develop evidence-based CPGs to support CR implementation in Korea. Methods This study is based on an analysis of CPGs elsewhere in the world, an extensive literature search, a systematic analysis of multiple randomized control trials, and a CPG management, development, and assessment committee comprised of 33 authors-primarily rehabilitation specialists, cardiologists, and thoracic surgeons in 21 university hospitals and two general hospitals. Twelve consultants, primarily rehabilitation, sports medicine, and preventive medicine specialists, CPG experts, nurses, physical therapists, clinical nutritionists, and library and information experts participated in the research and development of these CPGs. After the draft guidelines were developed, three rounds of public hearings were held with staff members from relevant academic societies and stakeholders, after which the guidelines were further reviewed and modified. Principal Conclusions CR involves a more cost-effective use of healthcare resources relative to that of general treatments, and the exercise component of CR lowers cardiovascular mortality and readmission rates, regardless of the type of coronary heart disease and type and setting of CR. Individualized CR programs should be considered together with various factors, including differences in heart function and lifestyle, and doing so will boost participation and adherence with the CR program, ultimately meeting the final goals of the program, namely reducing the recurrence of myocardial infarction and mortality rates. ? 2019 by Korean Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine.",""
"Cranial burr hole with erythropoietin administration induces reverse arteriogenesis from the enriched extracranium",2019,"It is challenging to revitalize ischemic penumbra after an acute stroke with intracranial perfusion insufficiency. To evaluate whether cranial burr hole and erythropoietin (EPO) generate effective revascularization, we investigated the efficacy of the augmentation method for reverse arteriogenesis from the healthy extracranial milieu. An intracranial perfusion insufficiency was created through bilateral internal carotid artery ligation (bICAL) in Sprague-Dawley rats. We administered recombinant human EPO (5000 U/kg) or saline intraperitoneally for 3 days after bICAL. Mechanical barrier disruption (MBD) was performed through a cranial burr hole with small dural cracks in the right hemisphere. The ipsilateral hemisphere with MBD grossly showed vascular networks between the extra- and intra-cranial spaces 2 weeks after the MBD procedure. It also showed significantly increased vessels in the intracranial vasculature adjacent to the MBD region (p = 0.0006). The levels of pro-angiogenic and inflammatory factors with prominent markers of vessel permeability were also significantly increased (MBD-only vs. control; Tnf-α, p = 0.0007; Vegf, p = 0.0206). In the EPO-administered group, such elevations in inflammation were significantly mitigated (combined vs. MBD-only; Tnf-α, p = 0.0008). The ipsilateral hemisphere with MBD-EPO (vs. MBD-only) showed significantly increased vessels (RECA-1, p = 0.0182) and their maturation (RECA-1/α-SMA, p = 0.0046), with upregulation of tumor growth factor-β1 (Tgf-β1, p = 0.037) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp-2, p = 0.0488). These findings were completely blocked by minocycline (MIC) administration during in vivo (Tgf-β1, p = 0.0009; Mmp-2, p < 0.0001) and in vitro experiments (tube formation, p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that the MBD procedure (for angiogenic routes) and EPO administration (for an arteriogenic booster) are complimentary and can facilitate successfully “reverse arteriogenesis” in subjects with intracranial perfusion insufficiency. ? 2019","alpha smooth muscle actin; erythropoietin; gelatinase A; minocycline; adult; artery formation (physiology); artery ligation; Article; brain blood flow; cerebral revascularization; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; human; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; internal carotid artery; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; minimum inhibitory concentration; moyamoya disease; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; right hemisphere; synaptogenesis"
"Panax ginseng: a candidate herbal medicine for autoimmune disease",2019,"Panax ginseng Meyer (P. ginseng; Korean ginseng) is well known for its medicinal properties. It can alleviate pathological symptoms, promote health, and prevent potential diseases via its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, homeostatic, and other positive effects on biological metabolism. Although many studies have determined effects of P. ginseng on various diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurological, and immunological diseases, little is known about the effect of P. ginseng on autoimmune diseases. Here, we review a few reports about effects of P. ginseng on autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) and suggest the possibility of P. ginseng as a candidate herbal medicine to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases as well as the need to study it. ? 2018","herbaceous agent; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; Crohn disease; drug effect; ginseng; herbal medicine; human; immunocompetent cell; multiple sclerosis; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; ulcerative colitis"
"Cost analysis of single-incision versus conventional laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer: A propensity score-matching analysis",2020,"Background/objective: Although many studies have demonstrated similar perioperative outcomes for single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for colon cancer, few have directly compared the costs of them. We aimed to compare costs between SILS and CLS for colon cancer. Methods: We analyzed the clinical outcomes and overall hospital costs of patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer from July 2009 to September 2014 at our institution; 288 were used for analysis after propensity score matching. The total hospital charge, including fees for the operation, anesthesia, preoperative diagnosis, and postoperative management was analyzed. Results: The total hospital charges were similar in both groups ($8770.40 vs. $8352.80, P = 0.099). However, the patients' total hospital bill was higher in the SILS group than in the CLS group ($4184.82 vs. $3735.00, P < 0.001) mainly due to the difference of the cost of access devices. There was no difference in the additional costs associated with readmission due to late complications between the two groups ($2383.08 vs. $2288.33, P = 0.662). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for total incision length in ‘total hospital charge’ and patient's bill and government's bill in ‘cost of instruments and supplies’ were -$107.08/1 cm, -$109.70/1 cm, and $80.64/1 cm, respectively. Conclusion: SILS for colon cancer yielded similar costs as well as perioperative and long-term outcomes compared with CLS. Therefore, SILS can be considered a reasonable treatment option for colon cancer for selective patients. ? 2019",""
"Down-regulated TMED10 in Alzheimer disease induces autophagy via ATG4B activation",2019,"Several studies have shown that dysfunction of macroautophagy/autophagy is associated with many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. To explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we performed a cell-based functional screening with SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, using an siRNA library and identified TMED10 (transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 10), previously known as the γ-secretase-modulating protein, as a novel regulator of autophagy. Further investigations revealed that depletion of TMED10 induced the activation of autophagy. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction assays showed that TMED10 directly binds to ATG4B (autophagy related gene 4B cysteine peptidase), and the interaction is diminished under autophagy activation conditions such as rapamycin treatment and serum deprivation. In addition, inhibition of TMED10 significantly enhanced the proteolytic activity of ATG4B for LC3 cleavage. Importantly, the expression of TMED10 in AD (Alzheimer disease) patients was considerably decreased, and downregulation of TMED10 increased amyloid-β (Aβ) production. Treatment with Aβ increased ATG4B proteolytic activity as well as dissociation of TMED10 and ATG4B. Taken together, our results suggest that the AD-associated protein TMED10 negatively regulates autophagy by inhibiting ATG4B activity.Abbreviations: Aβ: amyloid-β; AD: Alzheimer disease; ATG: autophagy related; BECN1: beclin 1; BiFC: bimolecular fluorescence complementation; CD: cytosolic domain; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GLUC: Gaussia luciferase; IP: immunoprecipitation; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; LD: luminal domain; PD: Parkinson disease; ROS: reactive oxygen species; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SNP: single-nucleotide polymorphisms; TD: transmembrane domain; TMED10: transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 10; VC: C terminus of Venus fluorescent protein; VN: N terminus of Venus fluorescent protein. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","amyloid beta protein; atg4b protein; autophagy related gene 4B cysteine peptidase; gamma secretase; green fluorescent protein; lc3 protein; membrane protein; peptidase; rapamycin; small interfering RNA; transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 10; unclassified drug; Alzheimer disease; Article; autophagy; controlled study; dissociation; down regulation; gene library; human; human tissue; protein cleavage; protein degradation; protein expression; protein protein interaction; regulatory mechanism; SH-SY5Y cell line"

The aim of this study was to examine the association between FRA and fall-related physical performance tests. Methods A total of 289 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older participated in this cross-sectional study. All participants underwent FRA test and physical performance tests such as Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Results Participants who were younger, male, highly educated, living with family members, having high body mass index, having high appendicular lean mass index, and having no irritative lower urinary tract syndrome were more likely to have higher FRA scores. SPPB (β = 1.012), BBS (β = 0.481), and TUG (β = -0.831) were significantly associated with FRA score after adjusting for the variables (all p < 0.001).

"Efficacy and safety of voglibose plus metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Combination of metformin to reduce the fasting plasma glucose level and an α-glucosidase inhibitor to decrease the postprandial glucose level is expected to generate a complementary effect. We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of voglibose plus metformin (vogmet) with metformin monotherapy in drug-na?ve newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A total of 187 eligible patients aged 20 to 70 years, with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.0% to 11.0%, were randomized into either vogmet or metformin treatments for 24 weeks. A change in the HbA1c level from baseline was measured at week 24. Results: The reduction in the levels of HbA1c was ?1.62%±0.07% in the vogmet group and ?1.31%±0.07% in the metformin group (P=0.003), and significantly more vogmet-treated patients achieved the target HbA1c levels of <6.5% (P=0.002) or <7% (P=0.039). Glycemic variability was also significantly improved with vogmet treatment, estimated by M-values (P=0.004). Gastrointestinal adverse events and hypoglycemia (%) were numerically lower in the vogmet-treated group. Moreover, a significant weight loss was observed with vogmet treatment compared with metformin (?1.63 kg vs. ?0.86 kg, P=0.039). Conclusion: Vogmet is a safe antihyperglycemic agent that controls blood glucose level effectively, yields weight loss, and is superior to metformin in terms of various key glycemic parameters without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

"Prognostic implications and interaction of L1 methylation and p53 expression statuses in advanced gastric cancer",2019,"Background: TP53 is frequently mutated across various tissue types of cancers. In normal cells, long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, L1) is mostly repressed by DNA methylation in its 5′ untranslated region but is activated by DNA demethylation process during tumorigenesis. p53 is indispensable for maintaining genomic stability and plays its role in controlling genomic stability by repressing retrotransposon activity. However, it is unclear whether p53 regulates expression or methylation of L1 differently depending on the mutational status of TP53. Four hundred ninety cases of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) were analyzed for their statuses in p53 expression and L1 methylation using immunohistochemistry and pyrosequencing, respectively. Whether L1 methylation and expression statuses were differently affected by types of TP53 mutants was analyzed in gastric cancer cell line. Results: By p53 immunohistochemistry, tumors were classified into 4 groups according to the intensity and extent of stained tumor nuclei. L1 methylation level was significantly higher in p53 expression group 1 than in the other groups in which L1 methylation level was similar (P < 0.001). Although L1 methylation and p53 expression statuses were associated with patient survival, multivariate analysis revealed that L1 methylation was an independent prognostic parameter. In in vitro analysis of AGS cells with the introduction of wild type or mutant types of TP53, L1 methylation level and activity were different depending on types of TP53 mutation. Conclusions: Findings suggest that L1 methylation level is affected by TP53 mutation status; although, L1 methylation status was an independent prognostic parameter in patients with AGC. Further study is required to elucidate the mechanism of how wild type or mutant p53 affects L1 activity and methylation status of L1 CpG island. ? 2019 The Author(s).","genomic DNA; mutant protein; protein p53; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; female; gastric cancer cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; long interspersed repeat; major clinical study; male; molecular mechanics; multivariate analysis; mutational analysis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein DNA interaction; protein expression; protein function; pyrosequencing; retrospective study; stomach cancer; tumor classification; very elderly; wild type"
"The association of prior hospitalization with clinical outcomes among patients admitted with pneumonia: A propensity score matching study",2019,"Background: Although prior hospitalization (PH) has been considered as a risk factor for infection with potentially drug-resistant (PDR) pathogens in patients admitted with pneumonia, the evidence is limited. We aimed to elucidate the clinical impact of PH on these patients. Methods: PH was defined as hospitalization for two or more days in the preceding 90 days. Patients with PH-associated pneumonia (PHAP) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were matched using the propensity score matching method, and the clinical outcomes were compared. We also conducted subgroup analyses based on intravenous antibiotic use during PH, duration of PH, and time to re-admission. Results: A total of 704 patients were identified; the PHAP group included 97 patients (13.7%). After matching according to propensity scores, the baseline characteristics of the PHAP group were similar to those of the CAP group. The isolation rate of PDR pathogens as well as the 30-day and total in-hospital mortality did not differ between propensity score-matched PHAP and CAP patients (13.6% vs. 10.2%, P = 0.485; 10.2% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.362; and 13.6% vs. 15.9%, P = 0.671, respectively). In subgroup analyses, only intravenous antibiotic use during PH was associated with the isolation rate of PDR pathogens (adjusted OR: 5.066; 95% CI: 1.231-20.845). Conclusions: PH itself might not be related with higher isolation rates of PDR pathogens or mortality in patients admitted with pneumonia. Therefore, it seems reasonable that broad spectrum antibiotic therapy for PDR pathogens should be selectively applied to PHAP patients with intravenous antibiotic use during PH. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; adult; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterium isolation; carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae; case control study; Chlamydia pneumoniae; cohort analysis; community acquired pneumonia; controlled study; disease association; Escherichia coli; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; female; hospital acquired pneumonia; hospital admission; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; Legionella pneumophila; major clinical study; male; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; outcome assessment; pneumonia; prior hospitalization; propensity score; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; retrospective study; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Streptococcus pneumoniae; aged; bacterial pneumonia; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; hospitalization; intravenous drug administration; isolation and purification; microbiology; middle aged; pathology; propensity score; treatment outcome; very elderly; Administration, Intravenous; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Bacterial; Propensity Score; Treatment Outcome"
"The histone deacetylase class I, II inhibitor trichostatin A delays peripheral neurodegeneration",2019,"Peripheral nerves, which consist of an axon and a unique glial cell called a Schwann cell, transduce signals from the brain and spinal cord to target organs. Peripheral nerve degeneration leads to distal motor or sensory disorders such as diabetic neuropathy, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and Gullain–Barr? syndrome, with symptoms such as dysesthesia, speech impairment, vision change, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Schwann cells play an important role in peripheral nerve degeneration. Therefore, revealing the characteristics of Schwann cells will be essential in understanding peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases for which there is currently no effective treatment. Trichostatin A (TSA) is a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs have been shown not only to deacetylate histones but also to target non-histone proteins involved in diverse signaling pathways. Recent studies have revealed that diverse HDAC subtypes regulate peripheral neurodegeneration. Thus, regulating HDAC levels could be an effective strategy for the development of drugs targeting peripheral nerve-related diseases. In fact, the use of TSA has been investigated for the treatment of many diseases, including degenerative diseases of the central nervous system; however, the effects of TSA on peripheral neurodegeneration have not yet been well established. In this study, we revealed the effect of TSA on the process of peripheral neurodegeneration. TSA successfully inhibited myelin fragmentation, axonal degradation, and trans-dedifferentiation and proliferation of Schwann cells, which are essential phenotypes in peripheral neurodegeneration. Therefore, TSA could be a potential drug for patients suffering from peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","myelin; trichostatin A; histone deacetylase inhibitor; hydroxamic acid; trichostatin A; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell dedifferentiation; controlled study; diabetic neuropathy; dysesthesia; erectile dysfunction; immunohistochemistry; male; MAPK signaling; mouse; nerve degeneration; neurofilament; nonhuman; peripheral neuropathy; phenotype; priority journal; protein degradation; Schwann cell; sciatic nerve; Western blotting; axon; cell culture; cell proliferation; drug effect; human; metabolism; myelin sheath; nerve degeneration; pathology; peripheral neuropathy; Axons; Cell Dedifferentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Hydroxamic Acids; Myelin Sheath; Nerve Degeneration; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Schwann Cells"
"Oncologic Outcome and Morbidity in the Elderly Rectal Cancer Patients after Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision: A Multi-institutional and Case-matched Control Study",2019,"Objective: To determine the toxicity and oncologic outcome of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by curative total mesorectal excision (TME) in the elderly (?70 yrs) and younger (<70 yrs) rectal cancer patients.

The 5-year recurrence-free survival (younger and elderly: 67.7% vs 65.5%, P = 0.483) and overall survival (younger and elderly: 82.9% vs. 79.5%, P = 0.271) rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups either. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery was less frequently delivered to the elderly than that to younger patients (83.9% vs 69.0%). Grade 3 or higher acute hematologic toxicity was observed more frequently in the elderly than that in the younger group (9.0% vs 16.1%, P = 0.008). Late complication rate was higher in the elderly group compared with that in the younger group without statistical significance (2.6% vs 4.5%, P = 0.193). Conclusions: Although acute hematologic toxicity was observed more frequently in the elderly patients than that in the younger patients, elderly rectal cancer patients with good performance status who received preoperative CRT and TME showed favorable tumor response and recurrence-free survival similar to younger patients.

"Clinical factors associated with the recovery of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus",2019,"Background: Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes patients. Although several risk factors for CAN progression have been established, whether CAN is reversible remains unclear and the clinical factors associated with CAN recovery have not been identified. This study aimed to determine clinical factors related to CAN recovery. Methods: Type 2 diabetes patients with CAN but free of cardiovascular disease at baseline were enrolled and followed for 2-3 years in this retrospective longitudinal study. CAN was classified as early (one abnormal parasympathetic test), definite (two or more abnormal parasympathetic tests), severe (definite plus orthostatic hypotension), or atypical (early plus orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension alone) based on Ewing's method. CAN recovery was classified as partial or complete: Partial recovery was defined as one-step improvement in CAN stage (early to normal, definite to early, or severe to definite), including the disappearance of only one abnormal result in any stage. Complete recovery was defined as normalization from definite or severe CAN. Results: Among 759 subjects with CAN, 29.9% (n = 227) experienced CAN recovery, and 1.2% (n = 9) recovered completely. In a multivariate model, younger age (odds ratio [OR] per 5-year decrease 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.78, P < 0.001), shorter duration of diabetes (OR per 5-year decrease 1.33; 95% CI 1.05-1.67, P = 0.016), presence of micro/macroalbuminuria (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15-0.78, P = 0.011), body weight reduction (OR per 1-kg decrease 1.11; 95% CI 1.02-1.21, P = 0.016), and HbA1c reduction (OR per 1% decrease 1.32; 95% CI 1.05-1.67, P = 0.019) were significantly associated with composite events of partial and complete CAN recovery. Age had the highest relative significance among the associated clinical factors. In addition, younger age was the only significant factor in complete CAN recovery. Conclusions: Younger age was the most important factor in CAN recovery in subjects with type 2 diabetes, including recovery from the definite or severe stage. HbA1c reduction, body weight reduction, no concurrent micro/macroalbuminuria, and shorter duration of diabetes were also significantly associated with CAN recovery. ? 2019 The Author(s).","hemoglobin A1c; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; adult; age distribution; Article; autonomic neuropathy; body weight loss; cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular disease assessment; cholinergic system; confidence interval; controlled study; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic patient; disease duration; disease severity; Ewing method; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; male; microalbuminuria; neurologic examination; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; odds ratio; orthostatic hypotension; retrospective study; risk factor; age; aged; autonomic nervous system; autonomic neuropathy; blood; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; complication; convalescence; diabetic neuropathy; innervation; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; risk factor; time factor; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Autonomic Nervous System; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular System; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Neuropathies; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Weight Loss"
"Clinical and Molecular Characteristics of qacA- and qacB-Positive Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Causing Bloodstream Infections",2019,"The increasing use of chlorhexidine for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) decolonization has raised concerns about the emergence of resistance to these agents. However, the clinical significance of MRSA positive for the qacA and qacB chlorhexidine tolerance genes has not been established. We investigated the clinical features and predictive factors of MRSA bloodstream infection (BSI) isolates, caused by qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA, from 2010 to 2016 at a tertiary hospital in South Korea. A total of 246 MRSA BSI isolates were included; 71 (28.9%) isolates carried qacA/B. The annual frequency of qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA bacteremia did not change significantly over the study period. Patients infected with qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA had common risk factors for health care-associated infections, including prior antibiotic use, central venous catheterization in situ, intensive care unit-acquired bacteremia, and nosocomial infection. The qacA- and qacB-positive isolates were also associated with an increasing chlorhexidine MIC and resistance to nonlactam antibiotics. The qacA- and qacB-positive isolates were more likely to belong to sequence type 5 (ST5), which is a common health care-associated MRSA strain in South Korea. In multivariable analyses, qacA- and qacB-positive MRSA isolates were found to be associated with agr dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.59 to 16.10), ST5 MRSA strain (aOR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.85 to 13.26), nosocomial infection (aOR, 4.88; 95% CI, 2.20 to 10.83), and antibiotic use within the previous 3 months (aOR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.20 to 5.59). These findings suggest that the microbiological features of qacA and qacB carriage provide a selective advantage for specific MRSA strains in hospital environments.

"Theacrine attenuates epithelial mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells",2019,"Theacrine, a purine alkaloid structurally similar to caffeine, has recently become of interest as a potential therapeutic compound. Here, we investigated the antimetastatic potential of theacrine on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We observed that theacrine can reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which resulted in a decrease in the levels of mesenchymal markers (Fibronectin, Vimentin, N-cadherin, Twist, and Snail) and an increase in the levels of epithelial markers (Occludin and E-cadherin) in the cells. Additionally, theacrine attenuates TGF-β-induced EMT, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, our results suggest that theacrine may inhibit the breast cancer cell metastasis by reversing the EMT process. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","antimetastatic agent; fibronectin; nerve cell adhesion molecule; occludin; theacrine; transcription factor Snail; transcription factor Twist; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; 1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid; antineoplastic agent; cadherin; fibronectin; FN1 protein, human; nuclear protein; SNAI1 protein, human; transcription factor Snail; transforming growth factor beta; Twist related protein 1; TWIST1 protein, human; uric acid; vimentin; Article; cell adhesion; cell invasion; cell migration; cell motility; cell viability; controlled study; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug screening; drug structure; epithelial mesenchymal transition; human; human cell; immunocytochemistry; MDA-MB-231 cell line; metastasis inhibition; MTT assay; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting; breast tumor; cell motion; drug effect; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; metabolism; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Fibronectins; Humans; Nuclear Proteins; Snail Family Transcription Factors; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Twist-Related Protein 1; Uric Acid; Vimentin"
"A Phase III Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Paclitaxel Versus Irinotecan in Patients with Metastatic or Recurrent Gastric Cancer Who Failed in First-line Therapy (KCSG ST10-01)",2019,"Lessons Learned: Irinotecan could not be proven noninferior to paclitaxel as a second-line treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer. The failure to demonstrate noninferiority may have been a result of insufficient patient enrollment. Both agents were tolerable but showed different toxicity profiles. Background: This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus irinotecan in patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer (MRGC) who had experienced disease progression following first-line chemotherapy. Methods: Patients were randomized to receive either paclitaxel (70 mg/m 2 ; days 1, 8, 15, every 4 weeks) or irinotecan (150 mg/m 2 every other week). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: This study was stopped early due to low accrual rate. A total of 112 patients were enrolled; 54 were allocated to paclitaxel and 58 to irinotecan. Median PFS for the paclitaxel and irinotecan groups was 3.5 and 2.1 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86–1.88; p =.234). Noninferiority of irinotecan to paclitaxel was not proved because the upper boundary of the 95% CI (1.88) exceeded the predefined upper margin of noninferiority (1.32). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.6 months in the paclitaxel group and 7.0 months in the irinotecan group (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.91–2.11; p =.126). Among toxicities greater than or equal to grade 3, neutropenia (11.5%) was the most common, followed by peripheral neuropathy (7.7%) in the paclitaxel group, and neutropenia (34.5%) followed by nausea, vomiting, and anemia (8.6%, respectively) in the irinotecan group. Conclusion: Although paclitaxel showed numerically longer PFS and OS compared with irinotecan, this was statistically insignificant. Both irinotecan and paclitaxel are valid second-line treatment options in MRGC. ?

"Patterns of Online Activities and Related Psychosocial Factors in Adolescence: a Latent Class Analysis",2019,"Special attention should be paid to the types of online activities in which adolescents engage, along with frequencies of the activities. Thus, we aimed to identify homogeneous subgroups of adolescents using five online activities and to examine differences in 12 characteristics across the subgroups we identified. We cross-sectionally analyzed nationally representative secondary data collected in Korea (N = 1827 adolescents who used a computer at the time of the survey). We performed latent class analysis, which is a person-centered approach, to understand the patterns of online activities in adolescence. A three-latent-class model best fit the data: frequent use for academics (FUA), non-frequent use for all activities (NFUAA), and frequent use for multiple activities (FUMA). In general, the FUA class differed from the other two classes. Specifically, the FUA class spent less time online and had better psychosocial conditions. Given these findings, health professionals should implement strategies aimed at assisting (a) adolescents to be aware that some types of online activities can potentially pose a risk to their psychosocial conditions and (b) parents to actively participate in guiding children’s Internet use. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adolescence; adolescent; article; child; female; human; Internet; juvenile; Korea; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male"
"Randomized control trial comparing the effect of cilostazol and aspirin on changes in carotid intima-medial thickness",2019,"Antiplatelet drugs are effective in preventing recurrence of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. However, the efficacy and usefulness of antiplatelet drugs on the progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker for evaluating early atherosclerotic vascular disease, has not been analyzed. We conducted a prospective, randomized, open, 36-month trial comparing cilostazol vs. aspirin. A total of 415 T2D patients (age range 38–83 years; 206 females) without macrovascular complications were randomized to either an aspirin (100?mg/day) or cilostazol (200?mg/day) treatment. Patients underwent B-mode ultrasonography annually to assess the IMT and serum levels of inflammatory markers were measured before and after each treatment. Potential confounders were statistically adjusted, and included lipid profiles, HbA1c, body mass index, waist circumference, anti-hypertensive and statin medications. The decrease in mean left, maximum left, mean right and maximum right IMT were significantly greater with cilostazol compared with aspirin (??0.094 ± 0.186?mm vs. 0.006 ± 0.220?mm, p < 0.001; ??0.080 ± 0.214?mm vs. 0.040 ± 0.264?mm, p < 0.001; ??0.064 ± 0.183?mm vs. 0.004 ± 0.203?mm, p = 0.015; ??0.058 ± 0.225?mm vs. 0.023 ± 0.248?mm, p = 0.022, respectively). And these differences remained significant after adjustment of potential confounders. Compared with aspirin, cilostazol treatment was associated with significantly increased HDL cholesterol (p = 0.039) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (p = 0.001). Cilostazol treatment was associated with significantly lowered IMT in T2D patients compared to aspirin, independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Cilostazol may inhibit plaque formation and have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis through vasodilatory and antiplatelet effects. ? 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","25 hydroxyvitamin D; acetylsalicylic acid; antihypertensive agent; C reactive protein; cilostazol; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; tumor necrosis factor; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; acetylsalicylic acid; antithrombocytic agent; cilostazol; phosphodiesterase III inhibitor; adult; aged; arterial wall thickness; Article; B scan; body mass; cholesterol blood level; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; hemoglobin blood level; human; left common carotid artery; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; open study; priority journal; prospective study; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; right common carotid artery; vitamin blood level; waist circumference; atherosclerosis; clinical trial; complication; disease exacerbation; dose response; follow up; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; risk factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aspirin; Atherosclerosis; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Cilostazol; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Progression; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Effects of gut microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of protopanaxadiol ginsenosides Rd, Rg3, F2, and compound K in healthy volunteers treated orally with red ginseng",2019,"Background: It is well recognized that gut microbiota is involved in the biotransformation of ginsenosides by converting the polar ginsenosides to nonpolar bioactive ginsenosides. However, the roles of the gut microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of ginsenosides in humans have not yet been fully elucidated. Methods: Red ginseng (RG) or fermented red ginseng was orally administered to 34 healthy Korean volunteers, and the serum concentrations of the ginsenosides were determined using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, the fecal ginsenoside Rd– and compound K (CK)–forming activities were measured. Then, the correlations between the pharmacokinetic profiles of the ginsenosides and the fecal ginsenoside–metabolizing activities were investigated. Results: For the RG group, the area under the serum concentration–time curve values of ginsenosides Rd, F2, Rg3, and CK were 8.20 ± 11.95 ng·h/mL, 4.54 ± 3.70 ng·h/mL, 36.40 ± 19.68 ng·h/mL, and 40.30 ± 29.83 ng·h/mL, respectively. For the fermented red ginseng group, the the area under curve from zero to infinity (AUC∞) values of ginsenosides Rd, F2, Rg3, and CK were 187.90 ± 95.87 ng·h/mL, 30.24 ± 41.87 ng·h/mL, 28.68 ± 14.27 ng·h/mL, and 137.01 ± 96.16 ng·h/mL, respectively. The fecal CK-forming activities of the healthy volunteers were generally proportional to their ginsenoside Rd–forming activities. The area under the serum concentration–time curve value of CK exhibited an obvious positive correlation (r = 0.566, p &lt; 0.01) with the fecal CK-forming activity. Conclusion: The gut microbiota may play an important role in the bioavailability of the nonpolar RG ginsenosides by affecting the biotransformation of the ginsenosides. ? 2019",""
"Fangchinoline, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid can modulate cytokine-impelled apoptosis via the dual regulation of NF-κB and AP-1 pathways",2019,"Fangchinoline (FCN) derived from Stephaniae tetrandrine S. Moore can be employed to treat fever, inflammation, rheumatism arthralgia, edema, dysuria, athlete’s foot, and swollen wet sores. FCN can exhibit a plethora of anti-neoplastic effects although its precise mode of action still remains to be deciphered. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) can closely regulate carcinogenesis and thus we analyzed the possible action of FCN may have on these two signaling cascades in tumor cells. The effect of FCN on NF-κB and AP-1 signaling cascades and its downstream functions was deciphered using diverse assays in both human chronic myeloid leukemia (KBM5) and multiple myeloma (U266). FCN attenuated growth of both leukemic and multiple myeloma cells and repressed NF-κB, and AP-1 activation through diverse mechanisms, including attenuation of phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) and p65. Furthermore, FCN could also cause significant enhancement in TNFα-driven apoptosis as studied by various molecular techniques. Thus, FCN may exhibit potent anti-neoplastic effects by affecting diverse oncogenic pathways and may be employed as pro-apoptotic agent against various malignancies. ? 2019 by the authors.","benzylisoquinoline derivative; fangquinoline; I kappa B kinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; TNF protein, human; transcription factor AP 1; tumor necrosis factor; cell proliferation; cell survival; chronic myeloid leukemia; drug effect; drug screening; human; metabolism; multiple myeloma; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Benzylisoquinolines; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; I-kappa B Kinase; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Multiple Myeloma; NF-kappa B; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factor AP-1; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"

"Efficacy and safety of lactobacillus plantarum C29-fermented soybean (DW2009) in individuals with mild cognitive impairment: A 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial",2019,"Early intervention using dietary supplements may be effective in alleviating cognitive impairment among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study investigated the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus plantarum C29-fermented soybean (DW2009) as a nutritional supplement for cognitive enhancement. One hundred individuals with MCI were randomly assigned to take DW2009 (800 mg/day, n = 50) or placebo (800 mg/day, n = 50) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in the composite score of cognitive functions related to memory and attention, measured by computerized neurocognitive function tests. Associations between changes in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and cognitive performance for each treatment group were evaluated. Compared to the placebo group, the DW2009 group showed greater improvements in the combined cognitive functions (z = 2.36, p for interaction = 0.02), especially in the attention domain (z = 2.34, p for interaction = 0.02). Cognitive improvement was associated with increased serum BDNF levels after consumption of DW2009 (t = 2.83, p = 0.007). The results of this clinical trial suggest that DW2009 can be safely administered to enhance cognitive function in individuals with MCI. Increased serum BDNF levels after administering DW2009 may provide preliminary insight into the underlying effects of cognitive improvement, which suggests the importance of the gut-brain axis in ameliorating cognitive deficits in MCI. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Exercise and/or Dietary Varieties and Incidence of Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Women: A 2-Year Cohort Study",2019,"Objective: Exercise and dietary habits rich in variety may reduce the risk of frailty incident, but such association remains unexamined. This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations between exercise and/or dietary varieties and incidence of frailty in older women. Design: A 2-year population-based prospective cohort study. Setting and participants: Six hundred and four community-dwelling older Japanese women aged ?75 years with non-frailty at baseline survey. Measurements: Frailty was assessed using Fried’s frailty criteria composed of shrinking, weakness, slowness, low activity, and exhaustion at both baseline and follow-up surveys. Frailty incident was defined as the presence of =3 components at the follow-up survey. At baseline, information about exercise and dietary habits were obtained from all participants through a face-to-face interview. Participants were grouped into two categories, high (=2) and low (<2) exercise varieties, assessed by the number of participations in 17 exercise types. By dietary variety, assessed using Dietary Variety Score (range, 0 to 10), participants were grouped into two, high (=4 points) and low (<4 points) dietary varieties. Binary logistic regression analyses were applied to obtain adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) of the incidence of frailty in the 4 groups (low-exercise and low-dietary varieties [low EV + low DV] as reference; low-exercise and high-dietary varieties [low EV + high DV]; high-exercise and low-dietary varieties [high EV + low DV]; and high-exercise and high-dietary varieties [high EV + high DV]). Results: Frailty incidence rate was 9.3% over the 2-year follow-up period. Incidence rates of frailty in the 4 groups were as follows: 23.7%, 10.1%, 6.5%, and 7.7% in the low EV + low DV, low EV + high DV, high EV + low DV, and high EV + high DV groups, respectively. After adjustment for covariates, only the high EV + high DV group was associated with a significantly lower OR (0.38; 95% CI 0.15–0.92) of frailty incidence compared with the low EV + low DV group. Conclusion: Higher variety of exercise and diet was significantly associated with lower incidence of frailty. Thus, the combination of variety-rich exercise and dietary program may be useful in preventing the incidence of frailty in older women. ? 2018, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.","aged; aging; Article; body weight loss; cerebrovascular accident; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; community dwelling person; depression; diabetes mellitus; dietary pattern; exercise; exhaustion; female; follow up; frailty; grip strength; heart disease; human; hypertension; incidence; Japanese (people); longitudinal study; major clinical study; nutritional assessment; osteoporosis; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; risk reduction; walking speed; weakness"
"Lipoteichoic acid isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum maintains inflammatory homeostasis through regulation of th1- and th2- induced cytokines",2019,"Lipoteichoic acid isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum K8 (pLTA) alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced excessive inflammation through inhibition of TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6. In addition, pLTA increases the survival rate of mice in a septic shock model. In the current study, we have found that pLTA contributes to homeostasis through regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. In detail, pLTA decreased the production of IL-10 by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 cells stimulated with prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) and LPS. However, TNF-α production which was inhibited by PGE-2+LPS increased by pLTA treatment. The regulatory effects of IL-10 and TNF-α induced by PGE-2 and LPS in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were mediated by pLTA, but not by other LTAs isolated from either Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA) or L. sakei (sLTA). Further studies revealed that pLTA-mediated IL-10 inhibition and TNF-α induction in PGE-2+LPS-stimulated PMAdifferentiated THP-1 cells were mediated by dephosphorylation of p38 and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), respectively. Reduction of pLTA-mediated IL-10 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), which was induced by IL-10 or conditioned media prepared from PGE-2+LPS-stimulated PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that pLTA contributes to inflammatory homeostasis through induction of repressed pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as inhibition of excessive antiinflammatory cytokines. ? 2019 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.","cytokine; lipoteichoic acid; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; prostaglandin E2; stress activated protein kinase; synaptophysin; tumor necrosis factor; IL10 protein, human; interleukin 10; lipopolysaccharide; lipoteichoic acid; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; stress activated protein kinase; teichoic acid; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; bacterium isolation; cell stimulation; controlled study; cytokine production; gene expression regulation; homeostasis; immune system; in vitro study; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactobacillus sakei; lymphocyte differentiation; macrophage; MDA-MB-231 cell line; metastatic breast cancer; nonhuman; protein dephosphorylation; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis inhibition; Staphylococcus aureus; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; upregulation; antagonists and inhibitors; cell survival; chemically induced; chemistry; drug effect; human; inflammation; metabolism; phosphorylation; species difference; Th1 Th2 balance; tumor cell line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-10; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lipopolysaccharides; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; Species Specificity; Teichoic Acids; Th1-Th2 Balance; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
"Machine learning models based on the dimensionality reduction of standard automated perimetry data for glaucoma diagnosis",2019,"Introduction: Visual field testing via standard automated perimetry (SAP) is a commonly used glaucoma diagnosis method. Applying machine learning techniques to the visual field test results, a valid clinical diagnosis of glaucoma solely based on the SAP data is provided. In order to reflect structural-functional patterns of glaucoma on the automated diagnostic models, we propose composite variables derived from anatomically grouped visual field clusters to improve the prediction performance. A set of machine learning-based diagnostic models are designed that implement different input data manipulation, dimensionality reduction, and classification methods. Methods: Visual field testing data of 375 healthy and 257 glaucomatous eyes were used to build the diagnostic models. Three kinds of composite variables derived from the Garway-Heath map and the glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) sector map were included in the input variables in addition to the 52 SAP visual filed locations. Dimensionality reduction was conducted to select important variables so as to alleviate high-dimensionality problems. To validate the proposed methods, we applied four classifiers—linear discriminant analysis, na?ve Bayes classifier, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks—and four dimensionality reduction methods—Pearson correlation coefficient-based variable selection, Markov blanket variable selection, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm, and principal component analysis— and compared their classification performances. Results: For all tested combinations, the classification performance improved when the proposed composite variables and dimensionality reduction techniques were implemented. The combination of total deviation values, the GHT sector map, support vector machines, and Markov blanket variable selection obtains the best performance: an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.912. Conclusion: A glaucoma diagnosis model giving an AUC of 0.912 was constructed by applying machine learning techniques to SAP data. The results show that dimensionality reduction not only reduces dimensions of the input space but also enhances the classification performance. The variable selection results show that the proposed composite variables from visual field clustering play a key role in the diagnosis model. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Automation; Correlation methods; Diagnosis; Discriminant analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Ophthalmology; Principal component analysis; Reduction; Support vector machines; Vision; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction method; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Glaucoma; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Pearson correlation coefficients; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Visual fields; Data reduction; adult; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; female; glaucoma; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; perimetry; priority journal; support vector machine"
"Comparative effectiveness of Chuna manual therapy versus conventional usual care for non-acute low back pain: A pilot randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Low back pain (LBP) is common, with a lifetime prevalence of 80%, and as such it places substantial social and economic burden on individuals and society. Chuna manual therapy (CMT) combines aspects of physiology, biodynamics of spine and joint motion, and basic theory of movement dynamics. This study aimed to test the comparative effectiveness and safety of CMT for non-acute LBP. Methods: A three-arm, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted from 28 March 2016 to 19 September 2016, at four medical institutions. A total of 60 patients were randomly allocated to the CMT group (n = 20), usual care (UC) group (n = 20), or combined treatment (CMT + UC) group (n = 20), and received the relevant treatments for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was a numeric rating scale (NRS) representation of LBP intensity, while secondary outcomes included NRS of leg pain, Oswestry disability index (ODI), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), lumbar range of motion, and safety. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 55 patients (CMT, 18; UC, 18; CMT + UC, 19) were included in the per-protocol analysis (drop-out rate 5.3%). Over the treatment period there were significant differences in the NRS score for LBP (CMT mean - 3.28 (95% CI - 4.08, - 2.47); UC - 1.95 (- 2.82, - 1.08); CMT + UC - 1.75 (- 2.70, - 0.80), P < 0.01) and the ODI scores in each group (CMT - 12.29 (- 16.86, - 7.72); UC - 10.34 (- 14.63, - 6.06); CMT + UC - 9.27 (- 14.28, - 4.26), P < 0.01). The changes in other secondary outcomes did not significantly differ among the three groups. Sixteen minor-to-moderate safety concerns were reported. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CMT has comparative efficacy for non-acute LBP and is generally safe. As this was a preliminary study, a well-powered (over 192 participants) two-arm (CMT versus UC) verification trial will be performed to assess the generalizability of these results.

"Respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein-encoding DNA vaccine is less effective in conferring protection against inflammatory disease than a virus-like particle platform",2019,"Formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination causes vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) after RSV infection. It is considered that vaccine platforms enabling endogenous synthesis of RSV immunogens would induce favorable immune responses than non-replicating subunit vaccines in avoiding VED. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protection, and disease in mice after vaccination with RSV fusion protein (F) encoding plasmid DNA (F-DNA) or virus-like particles presenting RSV F (F-VLP). F-DNA vaccination induced CD8 T cells and RSV neutralizing Abs, whereas F-VLP elicited higher levels of IgG2a isotype and neutralizing Abs, and germinal center B cells, contributing to protection by controlling lung viral loads after RSV challenge. However, mice that were immunized with F-DNA displayed weight loss and pulmonary histopathology, and induced F specific CD8 T cell responses and recruitment of monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lungs. These innate immune parameters, RSV disease, and pulmonary histopathology were lower in mice that were immunized with F-VLP after challenge. This study provides important insight into developing effective and safe RSV vaccines. ? 2019.

"Electrically Activated Ultrathin PVDF-TrFE Air Filter for High-Efficiency PM1.0 Filtration",2019,"Ultrafine particulate matter (PM) in indoor air has become a serious concern for public health. Therefore, there is a growing interest in filters that can be installed on the window frames of ordinary homes to improve the indoor air quality by natural passive ventilation without using expensive forced air circulation systems. Thus, these filters require a high filtering efficiency and high air permeability and visibility, which do not compromise the original functionality of the windows. The filters developed for this purpose to date have demonstrated a high filtering efficiency for PM2.5 but a relatively low efficiency for PM1.0. Here, the performance of the ultrathin poly[(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) nanofiber air filter capable of high-efficiency PM1.0 filtration is reported. To enhance the PM1.0 filtering efficiency, the filter is electrically activated by the polarization of dipoles and triboelectrification using the ferroelectric nature and triboelectrically negative property of the PVDF-TrFE filter layer. The electrically activated PVDF-TrFE filter demonstrates a PM1.0 filtering efficiency of over ?88% after polarization, which is further improved to ?94% after triboelectrification. In addition, the filter is ultrathin and air-permeable with 65% light transmittance. The methods introduced in this work can be adopted to develop high performance, highly visible, and air-permeable filter media. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Global, regional, and national burden of neurological disorders, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016",2019,"Background: Neurological disorders are increasingly recognised as major causes of death and disability worldwide. The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders. Methods: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach. Findings: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247–308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million [8·8–9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34–44] and DALYs by 15% [9–21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26–30] and DALYs by 27% [24–31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6–46·1]), migraine (16·3% [11·7–20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0–12·1]), and meningitis (7·9% [6·6–10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 [1·05–1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8–35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8–17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable). Interpretation: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

"Prognostic Implications of Door-to-Balloon Time and Onset-to-Door Time on Mortality in Patients With ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated With Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention",2019,"Background: In patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, timely reperfusion therapy with door-to-balloon (D2B) time <90?minutes is recommended by the current guidelines. However, whether further shortening of symptom onset-to-door (O2D) time or D2B time would enhance survival of patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction remains unclear. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of O2D or D2B time in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods and Results: We analyzed 5243 patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction were treated at 20 tertiary hospitals capable of primary percutaneous coronary intervention in Korea. The association between O2D or D2B time with all-cause mortality at 1 year was evaluated. The median O2D time was 2.0?hours, and the median D2B time was 59?minutes. A total of 92.2% of the total population showed D2B time ?90?minutes. In univariable analysis, 1-hour delay of D2B time was associated with a 55% increased 1-year mortality, whereas 1-hour delay of O2D time was associated with a 4% increased 1-year mortality. In multivariable analysis, D2B time showed an independent association with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.51–2.39; P<0.001). Reducing D2B time within 45?minutes showed further decreased risk of mortality compared with D2B time >90?minutes (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.19–0.42; P<0.001). Every reduction of D2B time by 30?minutes showed continuous reduction of 1-year mortality (90 to 60?minutes: absolute risk reduction, 2.4%; number needed to treat, 41.9; 60 to 30?minutes: absolute risk reduction, 2.0%; number needed to treat, 49.2). Conclusions: Shortening D2B time was significantly associated with survival benefit, and the survival benefit of shortening D2B time was consistently observed, even <60 to 90?minutes. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Resveratrol analog, N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,5-dimethoxybenzamide induces G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HeLa human cervical cancer cells",2019,"In this study, several resveratrol analogs were synthesized and evaluated in search of a more effective anti-proliferative resveratrol analog. Among the evaluated resveratrol analogs, we have identified N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,5-dimethoxybenamide (MPDB) as a potent anti-proliferative compound. Treatment with MPDB resulted in G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest, which was accompanied by alteration of G 2 /M-related protein expression and phosphorylation. MPDB-induced G 2 /M arrest was blocked by transfection of ATM/ATR siRNAs, indicating the critical role of ATM/ATR in G 2 /M phase arrest. In addition, treatment with MPDB displayed the activation of caspase and decreased Bcl-xl protein expression after 20 h in HeLa cells. Moreover, MPDB increased cytosolic cytochrome c release and Fas and Fas-L protein expression, indicating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway, respectively. These results suggest that MPDB is a new and potent compound that induces ATM/ATR-dependent G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, implicating it as a putative candidate in the investment of cervical cancer therapy. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2 (2 methoxybenzoylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester; 2,5 dimethoxyl n (4 methoxyphenyl)benzamide; 2,6 dimethoxy n (4 butoxyphenyl)benzamide; 2,6 dimethoxy n (4 methoxyphenyl)benzamide; 2,6 dimethoxy n phenylbenzamide; ATM protein; ATR protein; caspase; caspase 3; caspase 8; cytochrome c; Fas ligand; n (3,4 dimethoxyphenyl) 2,4,6 trimethoxybenzamide; n (4 methoxyphenyl) 3,5 dimethoxybenzamide; protein bcl xl; resveratrol; small interfering RNA; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; ATM protein; ATM protein, human; ATR protein, human; BCL2L1 protein, human; benzamide derivative; CDK1 protein, human; checkpoint kinase 1; checkpoint kinase 2; CHEK1 protein, human; CHEK2 protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase 1; protein bcl x; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; Ca Ski cell line; controlled study; cytosol; drug synthesis; enzyme activation; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; genetic transfection; HeLa cell line; HL-60 cell line; human; human cell; MRC-5 cell line; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; SiHa cell line; uterine cervix cancer; apoptosis; cell proliferation; drug effect; female; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; metabolism; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; uterine cervix tumor; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; bcl-X Protein; Benzamides; CDC2 Protein Kinase; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Checkpoint Kinase 1; Checkpoint Kinase 2; Female; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Humans; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"
"Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata, the Dried Root of Aconitum carmichaelii Debx., Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia via Suppressing 5-Alpha Reductase and Inducing Prostate Cell Apoptosis",2019,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease in elderly men which can be characterized by an abnormal enlargement of the prostate associated with lower urinary symptoms. Current medications available for BPH treatment display several adverse effects; thus, the search for effective treatments with less side effects is still ongoing. In this study, we investigated the effect of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata (dried root of Aconitum carmichaelii Debx.; AL), which is an herb used to treat extremely cold symptoms in traditional Korean medicine, on BPH using a testosterone propionate- (TP-) induced BPH rat model. Eight-week inguinal injection of TP induced BPH in rats, the prostate of which was displaying an abnormal proliferation. The pathological proliferation of the prostate was ameliorated by AL treatment of 4 weeks. Pathohistological changes in the prostate including epithelial thickness and lumen area were restored in AL-treated rats. Furthermore, 5α-reductase (5AR) and androgen receptor (AR), the two main factors in the pathogenesis of BPH, were decreased. In addition, the ratio of BAX and Bcl-2, an indicator of apoptosis, was increased by AL as well. Similar results were observed in AL-treated LNCaP prostate cancer cells. AL treatment suppressed the expression of the 5AR-AR axis and increased the ratio of BAX and Bcl-2. Apoptosis in the testis is considered a crucial side effect of finasteride, a 5AR inhibitor used to treat BPH. Our results showed that AL treatment did not display such effects, while finasteride treatment resulted in loss of spermatogenic cells within the prostate. Overall, these results suggest AL as a potentially safe nature-derived therapeutic agent for BPH treatment. ? 2019 Jinbong Park et al.","aconiti lateralis radix preparata; androgen receptor; plant extract; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; steroid 5alpha reductase; testosterone propionate; unclassified drug; Aconitum carmichaelii; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; human; human cell; Korean medicine; LNCaP cell line; male; nonhuman; plant root; prostate cell; prostate hypertrophy; rat"
"Meta-Qtest: Meta-analysis of quadratic test for rare variants",2019,"Background: In genome-wide association studies (GWASs), meta-analysis has been widely used to improve statistical power by combining the results of different studies. Meta-analysis can detect phenotype associated variants that are failed to be detected in single studies. Especially, in biomedical sciences, meta-analysis is often necessary not only for improving statistical power, but also for reducing unavoidable limitation in data collection. As next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been developed, meta-analysis of rare variants is proceeding briskly along with meta-analysis of common variants in GWASs. However, meta-analysis on a single variant that is commonly used in common variant association test is improper for rare variants. A sparse signal of rare variant undermines the association signal and its large number causes multiple testing problem. To over-come these problems, we propose a meta-analysis method at the gene-level rather than variant level. Results: Among many methods that have been developed, we used the unified quadratic tests (Q-tests); Q-test is more powerful than or as powerful as other tests such as Sequence Kernel Association Tests (SKAT). Since there are three different versions of Q-test (QTest1, QTest2, QTest3), each assumes different relationships among multiple rare variants, we extended them into meta-study accordingly. For meta-analysis, we consider two types of approaches, the one is to combine regression coefficients and the other is to combine test statistics from each single study. We extend the Q-test for meta-analysis, proposing Meta Quadratic Test (Meta-Qtest). Meta Q-test avoids the limitations of MetaSKAT. It does not only consider genetic heterogeneity among studies as MetaSKAT but also reflects diverse real situations; since we extend three different Q-tests into meta-analysis respectively, flexible Meta Q-test suggests way to deal with gene-level rare variant meta-analysis efficiently From the results of real data analysis of blood pressure trait, our meta-analysis could successfully discovered genes, KCNA5 and CABIN1 that are already well known for relevance with hypertension disease and they are not detected in MetaSKAT. Conclusion: As exemplified by an application to T2D Genes projects data set, Meta-Qtest more effectively identified genes associated with hypertension disease than MetaSKAT did. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; blood pressure measurement; CABIN1 gene; data analysis; genetic association; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; human; hypertension; KCNA5 gene; meta analysis (topic); Meta Quadratic Test; multiple linear regression analysis; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; sequence analysis; Sequence Kernel Association Test; study design"

"Anti-obesity Effects of Ginsenosides in High-Fat Diet-Fed Rats",2019,"Objective: To examine the anti-obesity effects of ginsenosides in Korea Red Ginseng (KRG, Panax ginseng) in rats fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). Methods: Twenty-five 4-week-old obesity rats after receiving an HFD for 5 weeks; subsequently, they were additionally treated with ginsenosides Rb1, Rd, Rg1, or Re (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) for a further 3 weeks (n=5 in each group). The control rats were fed a normal diet. The food consumption, body weight, locomotor activity, serum lipids, adipose tissues, nitric oxide (NO) expression, leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), cholecystokinin (CCK) in the brains were measured. Results: In the HFD-fed rats, body weight, body fat mass, serum levels of leptin and NO were significantly higher than in the control rats (P<0.05 or P<0.01). However, the treatment of Rd, Re, and Rb1 markedly decreased body fat mass and body weight (P<0.05). The serum level of leptin and NO in ginsenoside-treated rats were markedly lower than the control group (P<0.01). The expression of NPY and CCK in the hypothalamic nuclei showed insignificant difference among groups. However, the expression of NPY immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus was significantly reduced in the Rb1-treated group (P<0.05). Conclusion: PD-type ginsenoside Rb1 from the crude saponins of KRG may be a useful compound for the treatment of obesity and related disorders through the modulation of peripheral and central appetite-regulating signals. ? 2019, The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cholecystokinin; ginsenoside Rb 1; ginsenoside Rd; ginsenoside Re; ginsenoside Rg 1; leptin; lipid; neuropeptide Y; nitric oxide; adipose tissue; animal experiment; antiobesity activity; arcuate nucleus; Article; body fat; body mass; body weight; controlled study; drug mechanism; fat mass; food intake; ginseng; hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus; hypothalamus nucleus; immunoreactivity; Korean medicine; lateral hypothalamus; lipid blood level; lipid diet; locomotion; male; nonhuman; obesity; physical activity; priority journal; protein expression; rat; zona incerta"
"Global, regional, and national burden of suicide mortality 1990 to 2016: Systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016",2019,"Objectives To use the estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 to describe patterns of suicide mortality globally, regionally, and for 195 countries and territories by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index, and to describe temporal trends between 1990 and 2016. Design Systematic analysis. Main outcome measures Crude and age standardised rates from suicide mortality and years of life lost were compared across regions and countries, and by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index (a composite measure of fertility, income, and education). Results The total number of deaths from suicide increased by 6.7% (95% uncertainty interval 0.4% to 15.6%) globally over the 27 year study period to 817 000 (762 000 to 884 000) deaths in 2016. However, the age standardised mortality rate for suicide decreased by 32.7% (27.2% to 36.6%) worldwide between 1990 and 2016, similar to the decline in the global age standardised mortality rate of 30.6%. Suicide was the leading cause of age standardised years of life lost in the Global Burden of Disease region of high income Asia Pacific and was among the top 10 leading causes in eastern Europe, central Europe, western Europe, central Asia, Australasia, southern Latin America, and high income North America. Rates for men were higher than for women across regions, countries, and age groups, except for the 15 to 19 age group. There was variation in the female to male ratio, with higher ratios at lower levels of Socio-demographic index. Women experienced greater decreases in mortality rates (49.0%, 95% uncertainty interval 42.6% to 54.6%) than men (23.8%, 15.6% to 32.7%). Conclusions Age standardised mortality rates for suicide have greatly reduced since 1990, but suicide remains an important contributor to mortality worldwide. Suicide mortality was variable across locations, between sexes, and between age groups. Suicide prevention strategies can be targeted towards vulnerable populations if they are informed by variations in mortality rates. ?

"Sex-specific relationship of cardiometabolic syndrome with lower cortical thickness",2019,"ObjectiveTo investigate whether cardiometabolic factors were associated with age-related differences in cortical thickness in relation to sex.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 1,322 cognitively normal elderly (?65 years old) individuals (774 [58.5%] men, 548 [41.5%] women). We measured cortical thickness using a surface-based analysis. We analyzed the associations of cardiometabolic risk factors with cortical thickness using multivariate linear regression models after adjusting for possible confounders and interactions with age.ResultAmong women, hypertension (β =-1.119 to-0.024, p &lt; 0.05) and diabetes mellitus (β =-0.920, p = 0.03) were independently associated with lower mean cortical thickness. In addition, there was an interaction effect between obesity (body mass index [BMI] ?27.5 kg/m2) and age on cortical thickness in women (β =-0.324 to-0.010, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that age-related differences in cortical thickness were more prominent in obese women compared to women with normal weight. Moreover, low education level (&lt;6 years) was correlated with lower mean cortical thickness (β =-0.053 to-0.046, p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, among men, only being underweight (BMI ?18.5 kg/m2, β =-2.656 to-0.073, p &lt; 0.05) was associated with lower cortical thickness.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that cortical thickness is more vulnerable to cardiometabolic risk factors in women than in men. Therefore, sex-specific prevention strategies may be needed to protect against accelerated brain aging. ? 2019 American Academy of Neurology.","age; aged; aging; Article; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cardiometabolic syndrome; cortical thickness (brain); cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; educational status; female; heart disease; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; metabolic disorder; obesity; priority journal; risk factor; sex; sex difference; underweight; brain cortex; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; obesity; sexual characteristics; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cerebral Cortex; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Obesity; Risk Factors; Sex Characteristics"
"GI inflammation increases sodium-glucose cotransporter Sglt1",2019,"A correlation between gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and gut hormones has reported that inflammatory stimuli including bacterial endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 induces high levels of incretin hormone leading to glucose dysregulation. Although incretin hormones are immediately secreted in response to environmental stimuli, such as nutrients, cytokines, and LPS, but studies of glucose-induced incretin secretion in an inflamed state are limited. We hypothesized that GI inflammatory conditions induce over-stimulated incretin secretion via an increase of glucose-sensing receptors. To confirm our hypothesis, we observed the alteration of glucose-induced incretin secretion and glucose-sensing receptors in a GI inflammatory mouse model, and we treated a conditioned media (Mφ 30%) containing inflammatory cytokines in intestinal epithelium cells and enteroendocrine L-like NCI-H716 cells. In GI-inflamed mice, we observed that over-stimulated incretin secretion and insulin release in response to glucose and sodium glucose cotransporter (Sglt1) was increased. Incubation with Mφ 30% increases Sglt1 and induces glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion with increasing intracellular calcium influx.

"Development and validation of the COugh Assessment Test (COAT)",2019,"Background and objective: A cough-specific quality-of-life questionnaire is recommended to assess the impact of cough; however, a simple instrument to quantify cough is required for everyday clinical practice. This study was aimed to develop a short patient-completed questionnaire (COugh Assessment Test, COAT). Methods: The COAT was developed and validated by comparison with the Korean version of Leicester Cough Questionnaire (K-LCQ) and cough numeric rating scale (NRS, 0–10, 11-point scale) for chronic cough patients. Results: Item selection identified five items regarding cough frequency, daily activity, sleep disturbance, fatigue and cough hypersensitivity (0–4 scaling of items, 0–20 score range) through reliability test cohort (n = 78). Test–retest reliability was strong (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.88). The final COAT was compared with K-LCQ and cough NRS in a validation cohort (n = 323). In Rasch analysis, COAT fitted well to a unidimensional model. Pearson correlations of COAT versus K-LCQ (i) before treatment, (ii) after treatment; COAT versus cough NRS (iii) before treatment, (iv) after treatment; (v) delta-COAT versus delta-cough NRS, (vi) delta-COAT versus delta-K-LCQ were (i) ?0.71, (ii) ?0.81, (iii) 0.69, (iv) 0.82, (v) ?0.66 and (vi) 0.72, respectively. Conclusion: The COAT is a useful, simple questionnaire for assessing and monitoring cough. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology","adult; Article; clinical practice; cohort analysis; COugh Assessment Test; coughing; daily life activity; disease assessment; fatigue; female; frequency; human; hypersensitivity; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; numeric rating scale; priority journal; process development; quality of life; sleep disorder; test retest reliability; validation process; validation study"
"Gastroprotective Effects of Paeonia Extract Mixture HT074 against Experimental Gastric Ulcers in Rats",2019,"Background. Paeonia extract mixture HT074 is a standardized multiherbal mixture comprising extracts from Inula britannica flowers and Paeonia lactiflora roots, which are used to treat digestive disorders in traditional Korean medicine. This study was focused on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the gastroprotective effects of HT074 in different gastric ulcer models. Methods. Gastric lesions were induced in rats by an HCl/EtOH solution, water immersion-restraint stress (WIRS), and indomethacin. Gastric secretions were studied in pylorus-ligated rats, while mucus secretions were assessed by measuring alcian blue-binding capacity of mucus in the rat model of HCl/EtOH-induced gastric ulcer. Additionally, the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and sulfhydryl compounds in HT074-mediated mucosal protection was elucidated using their inhibitors, i.e., NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), respectively. Furthermore, the effects on indomethacin-induced cell death and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels were assessed in AGS cells. Results. Oral administration of HT074 significantly decreased gastric lesions induced by HCl/EtOH, WIRS, and indomethacin. Furthermore, it significantly decreased the volume, acidity, and total acidity of gastric juice in pylorus-ligated rats and increased the alcian blue-stained gastric mucus in HCl/EtOH-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Pretreatment with NEM abolished the gastroprotective effects of HT074, while L-NAME did not. In AGS cells, HT074 significantly reduced indomethacin-induced cell death and increased the PGE2 levels. Conclusions. These findings suggest that HT074 has gastroprotective effects against various ulcerogens, including HCl/EtOH, immersion stress, and NSAIDs. These effects are attributed to the inhibition of gastric secretions and preservation of the gastric mucosal barrier by increased mucus production, which is partially mediated through endogenous sulfhydryl compounds and PGE2. Based on these findings, we propose that HT074 may be a promising therapeutic agent for gastritis and gastric ulcer. ? 2019 Young-Sik Kim et al.","antiulcer agent; carbenoxolone; gastrointestinal mucosa protective agent; ht 047; ht 074; nitric oxide; omeprazole; Paeonia extract; prostaglandin E2; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiulcer activity; Article; cell death; cell viability; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug dose comparison; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; experimental gastric ulcer; gastroprotection; glandular stomach; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; immobilization stress; male; mucus secretion; nonhuman; prophylaxis; protection; rat; stomach mucus; stomach pH; stomach secretion; water immersion"
"Clinical research on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Chuna manual therapy for temporomandibular disorder: A study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial",2019,"Introduction: Chuna manual therapy (CMT), one of the therapeutic modalities of Korean Medicine which is a kind of manual therapies, is well known among Korean Medicine doctors for the treatment of TMD but the evidence for the effect of CMT is insufficient. Therefore, this trial is designed to propose a protocol to investigate the efficacy and economic efficiency of CMT on TMD, compared to usual care (UC). Methods: This trial is a prospective, assessor-blinded, two-arm parallel multicenter randomized controlled trial. Eighty patients with temporomandibular disorder, with numeric rating scale (NRS) above 4, will be randomly assigned to either the CMT or the UC group, with a 1:1 ratio. Participants will be recruited by five Korean Medicine hospitals. Participants will be treated eight times for 4 weeks, and will be assessed for pain, range of motion, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Adverse events will also be reported. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness, medical consumption data (quality of life questionnaire) will be used to assess indices such as the Quality Adjusted Life Year. Discussion: There were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of CMT for TMD, however, evidence is evaluated as “Low”. For this reason, this trial was designed as a high-quality RCT protocol. Conclusion: We expect that this trial will contribute new knowledge on the effects of CMT for TMD, so that an economically efficient way of treatment could be developed and standardized, providing more populations with the benefits of an effective and economic treatment for TMD. ? 2019 The Authors","adverse event; Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical research; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; depression; human; jaw disease; jaw pain; Korean medicine; manipulative medicine; multicenter study; parallel design; priority journal; prospective study; quality adjusted life year; randomized controlled trial; range of motion"

"Long-term survival is similar between closed-wedge high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with similar demographics",2019,"Purpose: Long-term clinical and radiographic results and survival rates were compared between closed-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTOs) and fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in patients with similar demographics. Methods: Sixty HTOs and 50 UKAs completed between 1992 and 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. There were no significant differences in pre-operative demographics. The mean follow-up period was 10.7 ± 5.7?years for HTO and 12.0 ± 7.1?years for UKA (n.s.). The Knee Society knee and function scores, WOMAC, and range of motion (ROM) were investigated. The mechanical axis and femorotibial angle were evaluated. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed (failure: revision to TKA) and the failure modes were investigated. Results: Most of the clinical and radiographic results were not different at the last follow-up, except ROM; ROM was 135.3° ± 12.3° in HTO and 126.8° ± 13.3° in UKA (p = 0.005). The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates were 100%, 91.0%, 63.4%, and 48.3% for closed-wedge HTO, respectively, and 90.5%, 87.1%, 70.8%, and 66.4% for UKA (n.s.). The survival rate was higher than that for UKA until 12?years post-operatively but was higher in UKAs thereafter, following a remarkable decrease in HTO. The most common failure mode was degenerative osteoarthritic progression of medial compartment in HTO and femoral component loosening in UKA. Conclusions: Long-term survival did not differ significantly between closed-wedge HTO and fixed-bearing UKA in patients with similar pre-operative demographics and knee conditions. The difference in post-operative ROM and failure mode should be considered when selecting a procedure.

"Incidence and overall survival of biliary tract cancers in South Korea from 2006 to 2015: Using the national health information database",2019,"Background/Aims: There have been no nationwide studies to investigate the trends in incidence and 5-year survival rates of intra- and extrahepatic bile duct cancers and gallbladder cancer. Therefore, our study aimed to describe the incidence and 5-year survival rates of biliary tract cancers by subsites in South Korea. Methods: A total of 86,134 patients with biliary tract cancers were selected from the National Health Information Database. Age-standardized incidence rates and annual percentage changes were calculated. Life-table methods and log-rank tests were used to determine the differences in survival rates. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio of the patients with biliary tract cancers. Results: The incidence rate of intrahepatic bile duct cancer decreased by 1.3% annually from 8.8 per 100,000 in 2006 to 7.8 per 100,000 in 2015. Extrahepatic bile duct cancer also showed a decreasing trend by 2.2% per year from 8.7 per 100,000 in 2006 to 6.7 per 100,000 in 2015. Gallbladder cancer showed the greatest decline, with an annual percentage change of 2.8% from 6.3 per 100,000 to 5.2 per 100,000 during the same period. The 5-year survival rates were 30.0% in gallbladder cancer, 27.8% in extrahepatic bile duct cancer, and 15.9% in intrahepatic bile duct cancer. Conclusions: The overall incidence rates of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct cancer and gallbladder cancer decreased from 2006 to 2015. Among biliary tract cancers, intrahepatic bile duct cancers exhibited the highest incidence rate and the worst survival rate. (Gut Liver 2019;13:104-113). ?

"Ras association domain family 1 isoform A suppresses colonic tumor cell growth through p21 WAF1 activation in a p53-dependent manner",2019,"Background and Aim: Despite the frequent loss of Ras association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) expression in various cancers, the precise mechanism underlying its tumor-suppressive effect is not fully understood. To elucidate the growth-inhibitory role for RASSF1A in colorectal tumorigenesis, this study investigated the RASSF1A regulation of the p53-p21 WAF1 pathway. Methods: Ras association domain family 1 isoform A effect on cellular growth was tested in three human colon cancer cell lines by flow cytometry, cell counting, and [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation assay. HCT116 p53 +/+ and p53 ?/? isogenic sublines were utilized to determine the p53 dependence of RASSF1A effect on p21 WAF1 . Cycloheximide chase experiment and immunoprecipitation assay were carried out to define RASSF1A effect on p53 stability and mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) homolog ubiquitination. Results: Ras association domain family 1 isoform A expression inhibits colonic cell proliferation by preventing the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. The RASSF1A-induced G1 cell cycle arrest is accompanied by the increase in the level of p21 WAF1 mRNA expression. The p21 WAF -inducing activity of RASSF1A was substantially higher in HCT116 p53 +/+ cell compared with isogenic p53 ?/? cells. The cycloheximide chase assay revealed that RASSF1A expression leads to p53 stabilization and MDM2 homolog degradation. Using p53 ?/? and p21 WAF1?/? subline cells, this study finally validated a crucial role of the p53-p21 WAF1 axis in RASSF1A-mediated growth inhibition. Conclusions: RASSF1A suppresses colonic tumor growth through the activation of the p53-p21 WAF1 pathway. This finding supports that RASSF1A could be a valuable marker for the assessment of colorectal cancer development and progression. ? 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1; cycloheximide; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; protein MDM2; protein p53; ras association domain family 1 isoform A; Ras protein; RNA directed DNA polymerase; unclassified drug; CDKN1A protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; Mdm2 protein, mouse; protein MDM2; protein p53; RASSF1 protein, human; tumor suppressor protein; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell counting; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle progression; cell cycle S phase; cell growth; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; enzyme activation; flow cytometry; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; genetic association; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; S phase cell cycle checkpoint; signal transduction; thymidine incorporation assay; tumor growth; ubiquitination; carcinogenesis; colorectal tumor; gene expression; genetics; interphase; metabolism; pathology; physiology; tumor cell line; tumor suppressor gene; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21; Gene Expression; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; Interphase; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Ubiquitination"
"Pediatric Intracranial Aneurysms: Favorable Outcomes Despite Rareness and Complexity",2019,"Objective: Pediatric intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are rare and differ from their adult counterparts in terms of their aneurysmal characteristics, presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Their treatment is often more difficult and complex compared with that of adults. However, studies outlining the clinical effect of pediatric IAs remain sparse. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data from patients aged ?18 years admitted to our hospital from 2000 to 2017 with a diagnosis of IAs. Results: From the sample of 8207 patients with an IA diagnosis, 26 patients with 33 IAs were involved. Our cohort included 17 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 12.5 years. The mean follow-up duration was 4 years and 3 months. Seven patients (26.92%) were assumed to have a traumatic origin for their IAs. Ruptured aneurysms were more common than unruptured ones (61.53% vs. 38.46%). Complex features were observed in 14 aneurysms (42.42%). Initially, microsurgical and endovascular treatment were both performed in 10 patients (38.46%). A good recovery was obtained in 16 patients (61.54%) as determined by the Glasgow outcome scale scores at the 6-month follow-up visits. The complete obliteration of aneurysms was observed in 17 patients (65.38%). Endovascular treatment was the initial treatment in 3 patients with incomplete obliteration. Conclusions: The treatment of pediatric IAs is challenging and technically demanding owing to their discrete nature compared with adult IAs and the need for greater surgical skills. We found a male predominance, with internal carotid artery bifurcation as the most frequent location of the aneurysms. Despite the greater incidence of ruptured and complex aneurysm cases, many patients had experienced a good recovery at the 6-month follow-up examinations. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; aneurysm; aneurysm rupture; angioplasty; anterior cerebral artery; anterior communicating artery; Article; astrocytoma; bacterial endocarditis; basal cistern; basilar artery; brain angiography; brain tumor; brain vasospasm; cerebellum tentorium; childhood disease; coil embolization; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted tomography; consciousness; conservative treatment; craniopharyngioma; dissecting aneurysm; dizziness; endocarditis; endovascular surgery; false aneurysm; female; fever; follow up; germ cell tumor; Glasgow outcome scale; head injury; headache; heart myxoma; human; incidence; internal carotid artery; intracranial aneurysm; lumbar puncture; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; medical record review; meningitis; microsurgery; middle cerebral artery; neuroimaging; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; posterior cerebral artery; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; retrospective study; schizophrenia; shunting; subarachnoid hemorrhage; superficial temporal artery; transfemoral cerebral angiography; tuberculosis; unruptured intracranial aneurysm; x-ray computed tomography; adolescent; aneurysm rupture; child; cohort analysis; intracranial aneurysm; neurosurgery; preschool child; Adolescent; Aneurysm, Ruptured; Carotid Artery, Internal; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Glasgow Outcome Scale; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Neurosurgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies"
"Prevalence of fabry disease in Korean men with left ventricular hypertrophy",2019,"Background: Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). Previous studies identified many cases of Fabry disease among men with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The purpose of this study was to define the frequency of Fabry disease among Korean men with LVH. Methods: In this national prospective multicenter study, we screened Fabry disease in men with LVH on echocardiography. The criterion for LVH diagnosis was a maximum LV wall thickness 13 mm or greater. We screened 988 men with LVH for plasma α-Gal A activity. In patients with low α-Gal A activity (< 3 nmol/hr/mL), we searched for mutations in the α-galactosidase gene. Results: In seven men, α-Gal A activity was low. Three had previously identified mutations; Gly328Arg, Arg301Gln, and His46Arg. Two unrelated men had the E66Q variant associated with functional polymorphism. In two patients, we did not detect GLA mutations, although α-Gal A activity was low on repeated assessment. Conclusion: We identified three patients (0.3%) with Fabry disease among unselected Korean men with LVH. Although the prevalence of Fabry disease was low in our study, early treatment of Fabry disease can result in a good prognosis. Therefore, in men with unexplained LVH, differential diagnosis of Fabry disease should be considered. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","alpha galactosidase; adult; aged; blood; complication; dna mutational analysis; echocardiography; Fabry disease; genetics; genotype; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; kidney; male; middle aged; pathology; prospective study; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; young adult; Adult; Aged; alpha-Galactosidase; DNA Mutational Analysis; Echocardiography; Fabry Disease; Genotype; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Kidney; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prospective Studies; Republic of Korea; Young Adult"
"Ursolic acid induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells partially via upregulation of microRNA-4500 and inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation",2019,"Though ursolic acid (UA) isolated from Oldenlandia diffusa was known to exhibit anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects, the underlying antitumor mechanism of ursolic acid was not fully understood to date. Thus, in the present study, the apoptotic mechanism of ursolic acid was elucidated in HCT116 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells in association with STAT3 and microRNA-4500 (miR-4500) by MTT assay, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay, cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Ursolic acid significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased TUNEL positive cells and sub-G1 apoptotic portion, induced cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase 3 in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Of note, ursolic acid attenuated the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and also blocked nuclear translocation of STAT3 in colorectal cancer cells. Notably, ursolic acid increased the expression level of miR-4500 in HCT116 cells by qRT-PCR analysis and conversely miR-4500 inhibitor reversed cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects by increasing TUNEL positive cells, PARP cleavage and inhibiting p-STAT3 in ursolic acid treated colorectal cancer cells. Overall, our findings provide evidence that usolic acid induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells partially via upregulation of miR-4500 and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation as a potent anti-cancer agent for colorectal cancer therapy. ? 2018 by the authors.

"Health-related quality of life changes in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy: A longitudinal cohort study",2019,"Purpose Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) information related to radical prostatectomy (RP) is valuable for prostate cancer (PC) patients needing to make treatment decisions. We aimed to investigate HRQOL change in PC patients who underwent three types of RP (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) and compared their HRQOL with that of general population. Materials and Methods Patients were prospectively recruited between October 2014 and December 2015. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and PC-specific module (PR25) were administered before surgery (baseline) and at postoperative 3 and 12 months. At each time point, HRQOL was compared, and a difference of 10 out of 0-100 scale was considered clinically significant. Results Among 258 screened patients, 209 (41 open, 63 laparoscopic, and 105 robotic surgeries) were included. Compared to baseline, physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning improved at 12 months. Role functioning worsened at 3 months, but recovered to baseline at 12 months. Pain, insomnia, diarrhea, and financial difficulties also significantly improved at 12 months. Most PR25 scales excluding bowel symptoms deteriorated at 3 months. Urinary symptoms and incontinence aid recovered at 12 months, whereas sexual activity and sexual function remained poor at 12 months. Clinically meaningful differences in HRQOL were not observed according to RP modalities. Compared to the general population, physical and role functioning were significantly lower at 3 months, but recovered by 12 months. Social functioning did not recover. Conclusion Most HRQOL domains showed recovery within 12 months after RP, excluding sexual functioning and social functioning. Our findings may guide patients considering surgical treatment for PC.

"Asymmetric atrophy of cervical multifidus muscles in patients with chronic unilateral cervical radiculopathy",2019,"The purpose of this study was to assess whether the asymmetry of cervical multifidus muscles occurred in radiculopathy patients, and if it did, whether it was related to the chronicity of unilateral cervical radiculopathy by assessing the cross-sectional area (CSA) of multifidus muscles using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).This study used a retrospective design and was conducted from January 2013 to August 2016. Seventy-seven patients (age 18-65) who had unilateral neck pain, symptom duration of 3 months to 1 year, and who were diagnosed with unilateral 6th cervical radiculopathy by electrodiagnostic testing, were included in study. The CSA of cervical multifidus muscles was measured at the midpoint between the lower margin of the upper vertebra and upper margin of the lower vertebra on axial MRI. Relative CSA (rCSA), which is the ratio of the CSA of muscles to that of the lower margin of C5 vertebra was also obtained.At the C4-5 and C6-7 levels, CSA and rCSA of cervical multifidus muscles showed no statistically difference between the affected and unaffected sides. At the C5-6 level, multifidus muscles were significantly smaller in the affected side (at the C5-6 level, P value of CSA.007 and P value of rCSA.102).The atrophy of multifidus muscles ipsilateral to cervical radiculopathy was observed in patients who had chronic unilateral cervical radiculopathy. ? 2019 the Author(s).

Thirty-four studies were selected for the present meta-analysis. Physical activity helps decrease ovarian cancer risk. Moderate intensity and low amount of physical activity showed the greatest reduction of ovarian cancer risk and prolonged sitting time had the worst ovarian cancer risk. At least 2 h of moderate physical activity per week and <3 h of sitting time per day provided a preventive effect to ovarian cancer. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","colorectal tumor; exercise; female; human; meta analysis; middle aged; ovary tumor; risk; sitting; time factor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Exercise; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Ovarian Neoplasms; Risk; Sedentary Behavior; Sitting Position; Time Factors"
"Effects of Tai Chi therapy on body mass index and physical index of intellectual disability",2019,"Aim: Continuous program development and application are necessary in order to manage the health and address the problems of secondary metabolic disorders for people with intellectual disabilities. This study examines the effects of Tai Chi therapy on body mass index (BMI) and physical index among people with intellectual disabilities. Methods: A quasi-experimental study using a pretest-post-test control group, non-synchronized design was employed. Samples were in total 104 people with intellectual disabilities (experimental: n = 67, control: n = 37) in two facilities in South Korea. They were randomly allocated using a coin toss into the two groups. Tai Chi therapy as an experimental intervention was the Sun style Tai Chi exercise, which consists of the warm-up (5 min), main exercise (45 min), and finishing (meditation, 10 min). Tai Chi therapy was conducted twice a week for a total of 40 sessions for 5 months (1 hour each) by one professional instructor. Measures were general characteristics of study participants, BMI as degree of obesity, and physical index. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 21.0 program (descriptive statistics, χ2 test, independent t test). A P value of less than.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There were statistically significant differences on fasting blood glucose (t = 4.351, P &lt;.001) and high-density lipoprotein (t = ?2.052, P =.043) in the physical index between the two groups. Conclusions: Tai Chi therapy was an effective intervention for decreasing fasting blood glucose and for increasing high-density lipoprotein in those with intellectual disabilities. Tai Chi therapy can be implied as a nursing intervention for intellectual disabilities in nursing practice. ? 2019 Japan Academy of Nursing Science",""
"Herbal medicine for insomnia in elderly with hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Introduction: Herbal medicine (HM) may be beneficial for geriatrics with multiple pathological conditions. The objective of this study was to systematically analyze the effectiveness and safety of HM for insomnia in the hypertensive elderly. Methods: Thirteen databases were comprehensively searched from their inception dates to August 28, 2018, to identify relevant randomized control trials (RCTs). The results of meta-analyses were presented as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. The quality of evidence (QoE) was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results: Eight RCTs were included in this review. Based on routine antihypertensive therapies in most cases, compared to the hypnotics group, HM group had a significantly higher total effective rate (TER) for improvement of insomnia (RR 1.24 [1.12, 1.39]). Compared to no intervention group, HM group showed a significantly higher TER for improving insomnia (RR 1.70 [1.25, 2.33]), and lowering systolic (MD -5.63 mmHg [-7.18, -4.09]) and diastolic blood pressures (MD -4.40 mmHg [-5.63, -3.18]). Pittsburgh sleep quality index (MD -4.11 [-5.72, -2.50]), Zung self-rating anxiety scale (MD -6.60 [-7.79, -5.41]), and Zung self-rating depression scale (MD -6.15 [-7.43, -4.87]). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the HM and no intervention groups. The QoE ranged from “Very low” to “Moderate.” Conclusion: HM might have some beneficial effects including improving insomnia, blood pressure, and mental health, for the hypertensive elderly with insomnia. Since the methodological quality of the included studies and QoE were not high, well-designed RCTs are important to confirm these results. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH","antihypertensive agent; herbaceous agent; antihypertensive activity; Article; clinical practice; diastolic blood pressure; drug efficacy; drug safety; GRADE approach; herbal medicine; human; hypertension; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; meta analysis; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polypharmacy; priority journal; Self-rating Anxiety Scale; Self-rating Depression Scale; senescence; systematic review"
"Effectiveness of teacher-led nutritional lessons in altering dietary habits and nutritional status in preschool children: Adoption of a NASA mission x-based program",2019,"The preschool years are a sensitive period for the development of food preferences that will a ect physical growth and life-long health. The promotion of healthy eating and nutritional status was achieved by adapting the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Mission X (MX) Program among young children in South Korea. The intervention program was delivered by nutritional experts and class teachers over 10 weeks. Children from 37 school classes (n = 534) from 7 daycares and kindergartens were randomized into a control group (CG, n = 280) and an intervention group (IG, n = 254). Parents were surveyed for their children’s characteristics and nutrition quotient (NQ) at baseline and at the 10-week follow-up. At baseline, 18.8% (boys: 18.9%; girls: 18.8%) of the subjects were overweight or obese (body mass index ? 85th percentile). After the intervention, the mean differences in various anthropometric measures did not differ significantly between the groups in a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, and type of school. The NQ grades were significantly higher in the IG than the CG after the intervention (p = 0.000). In summary, the 10-week South Korean MX program improved the eating behaviors and nutrition status of young children. A further multisector prevention program is needed to prevent childhood obesity in young children. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Assessment of pressure pain thresholds in collisions with collaborative robots",2019,"In recent years, safety issues surrounding robots have increased in importance, as more robots are in close contact with humans, both in industrial fields and elsewhere. Safety standards for industrial robots operating in specific spaces have been established, but no such standards have been specified for collaborative and service robots. To establish safety standards for such robots, we assessed pressure pain thresholds for collisions between humans and robots, under the assumption that the pain threshold is lower than the mild injury threshold. The pressure pain threshold for collision with a robot was measured in 90 male Korean adults using a homemade collision system. The pain thresholds were measured three times at 15 sites, including the forehead. The highest threshold was 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2 at the back of the hand, and the lowest was 65.1 ± 22.6 N/cm2 at an arm nerve. Moderate thresholds, i.e., 100–120 N/cm2, were noted on the forehead, neck muscle, ball of the thumb, and shin. The thresholds of participants &lt; 30 years of age were lower, by 3–33%, than those of participants aged &gt; 30 years. Thresholds differed by body mass index only at certain sites, including the shoulder joint, neck, and back of the hand. The pressure pain threshold depended on individual characteristics, body site, and age. The threshold relevant to potential human-robot collisions was determined to be between 65.1 ± 22.6 and 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2. ? 2019 Park et al.

"Impact of gender on the career development of female traditional Korean medicine doctors: A qualitative study",2019,"Objective This study aims to examine the impact of gender and expected gender roles on the career development of young female traditional Korean medicine (KM) doctors. Design We conducted semistructured interviews to examine the experiences of study subjects regarding early career choices, employment, job performance and career moves, as well as future career aspirations, from the perspective of gender. The transcription was analysed using the Strauss and Corbin constant comparative analysis method. Setting The interview was conducted at a quiet and comfortable place selected by the participants in South Korea. Participants Ten female KM doctors in their 30s participated in the study. Results This study reveals that, initially, the participating female KM doctors were unaware of their gender affecting career decisions. However, after graduation and during employment, female doctors experienced direct discrimination or gender segregation while selecting areas of treatment and specialty; they found that they were preferred to work in paediatrics and dermatology departments than in departments treating musculoskeletal health problems. Furthermore, after entering the workforce, female KM doctors found that their gender significantly affects patient-doctor relationships and life events, such as pregnancy and childbirth require temporary career breaks. In addition, female KM doctors assumed stereotypical gender roles both in the workplace and at home, as well as becoming the main nurturer of their children. Conclusion Gender and stereotyped gender roles affect the overall career planning, career moves and even patient-doctor relationships of female KM doctors. Female doctors were also more likely to experience specific gender roles in the workplace and at home, including both childbirth and childrearing. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

"Association of nutritional factors with hearing loss",2019,"Hearing loss (HL) is a major public health problem. Nutritional factors can affect a variety of diseases, such as HL, in humans. Thus far, several studies have evaluated the association between nutrition and hearing. These studies found that the incidence of HL was increased with the lack of single micro-nutrients such as vitamins A, B, C, D and E, and zinc, magnesium, selenium, iron and iodine. Higher carbohydrate, fat, and cholesterol intake, or lower protein intake, by individuals corresponded to poorer hearing status. However, higher consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids corresponded to better hearing status of studied subjects. In addition to malnutrition, obesity was reported as a risk factor for HL. In studies of the relationship between middle ear infection and nutrition in children, it was reported that lack of vitamins A, C and E, and zinc and iron, resulted in poorer healing status due to vulnerability to infection. These studies indicate that various nutritional factors can affect hearing. Therefore, considering that multifactorial nutritional causes are responsible, in part, for HL, provision of proper guidelines for maintaining a proper nutritional status is expected to prevent some of the causes and burden of HL. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Surface expression of TTYH2 is attenuated by direct interaction with β-COP",2019,"TTYH2 is a calcium-activated, inwardly rectifying anion channel that has been shown to be related to renal cancer and colon cancer. Based on the topological prediction, TTYH2 protein has five transmembrane domains with the extracellular N-terminus and the cytoplasmic C-terminus. In the present study, we identified a vesicle transport protein, β-COP, as a novel specific binding partner of TTYH2 by yeast two-hybrid screening using a human brain cDNA library with the C-terminal region of TTYH2 (TTYH2-C) as a bait. Using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we confirmed the protein-protein interactions between TTYH2 and β-COP. We also found that the surface expression and activity of TTYH2 were decreased by co-expression with β-COP in the heterologous expression system. In addition, β-COP associated with TTYH2 in a native condition at a human colon cancer cell line, LoVo cells. The over-expression of β-COP in the LoVo cells led to a dramatic decrease in the surface expression and activity of endogenous TTYH2. Collectively, these data suggested that β-COP plays a critical role in the trafficking of the TTYH2 channel to the plasma membrane. ? 2019 by the The Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.","coatomer protein; membrane protein; messenger RNA; protein binding; TTYH2 protein, human; tumor protein; animal; cell membrane; Chlorocebus aethiops; CV-1 cell line; gene expression profiling; genetics; human; metabolism; surface property; Animals; Cell Membrane; Chlorocebus aethiops; Coatomer Protein; COS Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Binding; RNA, Messenger; Surface Properties"
"Sex and Ethnic Differences in the Relationship between Changes in Anthropometric Measurements and Visceral Fat in Adolescents with Obesity",2019,"Objective: To examine sex and ethnic differences in how baseline and changes in anthropometric measures relate with change in visceral fat with interventions in adolescents. Study design: Black and white adolescents (n = 143: body mass index [BMI] ?85th percentile, 12-18 years) who participated in intervention studies (3-6 months) were included and had assessments of anthropometric measures (weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR], and waist-to-thigh ratio) and visceral fat at L4-L5 by magnetic resonance imaging before and after interventions. Results: At baseline, all of the anthropometric measures were positively associated with visceral fat (P &lt; .05), with weight, waist circumference, and WHR having the largest variance explained (model adjusted R2 = 0.35-0.47 vs 0.32-0.35). Blacks had 11.5-23.3 cm2 less visceral fat compared with whites for a given anthropometric value. Girls tended to have less visceral fat for a given anthropometric value, but the sex differences were not consistently significant (range: 0.7-12.9 cm2). Changes in waist circumference, BMI, and weight, but not WHR, remained significantly associated with changes in visceral fat. There were no sex differences, and much more minimal ethnic differences (&lt;4.9 cm2). Conclusions: At baseline, there are sex and ethnic differences in how anthropometric measures correlate with visceral fat. However, there were minimal sex and ethnic differences in how changes in anthropometric measures related with changes in visceral fat. Although all of the anthropometric measures were associated with visceral fat at baseline, waist circumference, BMI, and weight, but not WHR were associated with changes in visceral fat.

"Expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related mRNA in otitis media with effusion",2019,"Objectives: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intracellular organelle involved in the synthesis and secretion of proteins. The ER stress response, which protects cells from cytotoxic proteins such as unfolded proteins, is related to several diseases including inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effect of ER stress on the pathophysiology of otitis media with effusion (OME). Methods: Thirty-nine pediatric patients who were diagnosed with OME and underwent ventilation tube insertion were enrolled in this study. Exudate from the middle ear cavity was collected through ventilation insertion, and ER stress gene expression was analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reactions(PCR). Results: There were no significant differences in ER stress-related mRNA expression between effusion culture-positive and culture-negative groups (p > 0.05). Expression of the C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) was higher in the otitis-prone group than in the non-otitis-prone group (p < 0.05). The most common type of fluid was mucoid, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α expression was higher in serous fluid than in mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent fluid (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Endoplasmic reticulum stress-related responses are activated in pediatric OME patients, and specific ER-stress related pathways are related to both the characteristics of fluid and the frequency of OME. Thus, ER stress-related responses affect the pathophysiology of OME in pediatric OME patients. ? 2019","CCAAT enhancer binding protein; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; inositol; messenger RNA; DDIT3 protein, human; ERN1 protein, human; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; messenger RNA; protein serine threonine kinase; ribonuclease; Article; bacterium culture; cell interaction; child; clinical article; effusion; endoplasmic reticulum stress; female; gene expression; genetic analysis; human; incidence; infant; male; middle ear; otitis media; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; pediatrics; prevalence; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; suppurative otitis media; endoplasmic reticulum stress; genetics; metabolism; middle ear ventilation; newborn; preschool child; secretory otitis media; Child; Child, Preschool; Ear, Middle; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Endoribonucleases; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Ear Ventilation; Otitis Media with Effusion; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Factor CHOP"
"Trends in birth weight and the incidence of low birth weight and advanced maternal age in korea between 1993 and 2016",2019,"Background: As the aging society progresses, the average age of mothers is also increasing. Advanced maternal age has been known to be associated with perinatal outcomes, as well as birth weight (BW). In this study, we aimed to investigate the perinatal factors associated with low birth weight infants (LBWIs) using birth statistics of the Korean population. Methods: Birth statistics between 1993 and 2016 from the Korean Statistical Information Service were reviewed. We investigated 12,856,614 data points, which included the number of births, BWs, percentage of preterm births and LBWIs, multiple pregnancies, and maternal age. Results: The proportion of LBWIs delivered by mothers of advanced maternal age has gradually increased since 1993. In addition, the proportion of older mothers (= 35 years old) giving birth to LBWIs has increased over the years. Average BW has a negative correlation with the ratio of preterm births, LBW, multiple births, and advanced maternal age. The mean BW also has a negative correlation with maternal age. Conclusion: This study shows that the average BW continues to decline, and the incidence of LBWIs is increasing in Korea since 1993. This study also revealed that several perinatal factors, including percentage of preterm births, LBWIs, multiple births, and maternal age influence the mean BW. Although this study did not investigate the effects of decreasing mean BW on perinatal health, future research is worth discussing. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","adolescent; adult; birth weight; factual database; female; human; incidence; low birth weight; maternal age; middle aged; multiple pregnancy; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; South Korea; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Birth Weight; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Linear Models; Maternal Age; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Multiple; Premature Birth; Republic of Korea; Young Adult"
"Optimization of Vinyl Sulfone Derivatives as Potent Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) Activators for Parkinson's Disease Therapy",2019,"We previously developed a novel series of vinyl sulfones as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activators with therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the previously developed lead compound (1) exhibited undesirable druglike properties. Here, we optimized vinyl sulfones by introducing nitrogen heterocycles to improve druglike properties. Among the synthesized compounds, 17e was the most promising drug candidate with good druglike properties. Compound 17e showed superior effects on Nrf2 activation in cell-based assays compared to compound 1 (17e: half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) = 346 nM; 1: EC 50 = 530 nM). Compound 17e was further confirmed to induce expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes at both mRNA and protein levels. In a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse model of PD, 17e significantly attenuated loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive dopaminergic neurons, suppressed microglial activation, and alleviated PD-associated motor dysfunction. Thus, 17e is a novel Nrf2 activator with excellent druglike properties and represents a potential therapeutic candidate for PD. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","2' chloro 3' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' chloro 3' [2 ((3 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' chloro 3' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' chloro 5' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' chloro 6' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' chloro 6' [2 ((3 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' chloro 6' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' methoxy 3' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' [2 ((3 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 2',6' dichloro 3' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' chloro 2' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' chloro 2' [2 ((3 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' chloro 2' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' fluoro 2' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' fluoro 2' [2 ((3 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' fluoro 2' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' [2 ((3 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 3' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 5' chloro 2' [2 ((2 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 5' chloro 2' [2 ((3 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; 5' chloro 2' [2 ((4 methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)vinyl]pyridine; antioxidant; antiparkinson agent; sulfone derivative; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vinyl derivative; glutamate cysteine ligase; heme oxygenase 1; neuroprotective agent; sulfone; transcription factor Nrf2; vinyl derivative; animal experiment; animal model; antioxidant responsive element; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell viability; comparative study; controlled study; dopaminergic nerve cell; drug bioavailability; drug screening; drug synthesis; EC50; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human cell; immunoreactivity; liver microsome; metabolic stability; mouse; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; pharmacokinetic parameters; protein expression; animal; cell survival; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; Parkinson disease; pathology; tumor cell line; upregulation; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Disease Models, Animal; Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase; Heme Oxygenase-1; Humans; Mice; Microsomes, Liver; Neuroprotective Agents; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Parkinson Disease; Sulfones; Up-Regulation; Vinyl Compounds"

"Comparative effectiveness of palliative chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy versus cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy versus cystectomy for regional node-positive bladder cancer: A retrospective analysis: KCSG GU 17-03",2019,"The regional lymph node-positive bladder cancer was classified as stage IV in the AJCC 7th edition but was changed to stage IIIB in the 8th edition, revised in 2018. Among the various studies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors, groups that had only lymph node metastasis showed better outcomes than those with distant metastasis. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink the treatment strategy for lymph node-positive bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the treatment outcomes of chemotherapy, surgery, and combination therapy in patients with lymph node-positive bladder cancer. From 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015, patients with bladder cancer presenting local lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis were treated with a single treatment strategy, with either radical cystectomy or chemotherapy or with a combined strategy using both. Treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed on the basis of clinical indices and survival time. Out of 230 patients with bladder cancer, 44 (19.1%) were treated with palliative chemotherapy, 30 (13.0%) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cystectomy, 129 (56.1%) with cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, and 27 (11.7%) with cystectomy alone. Median survival among all groups was 30.4?months. For each group, median overall survival was 19.3, 49.1, 42.6, and 11.2?months, respectively. This study represents an advancement in understanding the impact of clinical treatment patterns of lymph node-positive bladder cancer through comparison of survival data of patients treated with different therapeutic strategies. Combined treatment resulted in better outcomes than did single treatments. ? 2019 The Authors.

Results: In the right side of the colon, the ADR (33.2% vs 13.7%, P <.001), PDR, serrated polyp detection rate, and number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC) were significantly higher when the colonoscopy withdrawal time was ?2 minutes compared with <2 minutes. When the withdrawal time was ?4 minutes in the proximal colon and ?3 minutes in the left segment of the colon, the ADR, PDR, and APC were significantly higher compared with withdrawal times of <4 minutes and <3 minutes, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that the ADR was significantly associated with withdrawal times of ?2 minutes in the right side of the colon (odds ratio [OR], 2.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-5.15; P <.001), ?4 minutes in the proximal colon (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 3.15-6.36; P <.001), and ?3 minutes in the left segment of the colon (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.74-4.91; P <.001). Conclusions: The PDR and ADR appeared to be significantly increased when the withdrawal time was ?2 minutes in the right-sided colon segment, ?4 minutes in the proximal colon, and ?3 minutes in the left-sided colon segment compared with shorter withdrawal times. ? 2019 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","adult; aged; Article; ascending colon; colon adenoma; colon injury; colon polyp; colonoscopy; endoscopist; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; time factor; adenocarcinoma; adenoma; adenomatous polyp; aftercare; clinical trial; colon polyp; colonoscopy; colorectal tumor; descending colon; early cancer diagnosis; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; pathology; procedures; time factor; Adenocarcinoma; Adenoma; Adenomatous Polyps; Aftercare; Aged; Colon, Ascending; Colon, Descending; Colonic Polyps; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Prospective Studies; Time Factors"
"Development of an effective sample transfer device for biomarker detection in nasal secretions",2019,"Nasal secretions (NS) reflect inflammatory activity of the nasal mucosa and thus can be utilized for disease diagnosis and determining treatment effects in Allergic rhinitis (AR). However, non-standardized collection of samples can affect the measured concentration of inflammatory biomarker in NS. In this study, we aimed to develop and evaluate new devices capable of standardizing the collection, storage, and preprocessing methods of NS samples. First, we chose the best swab as polyester (PE) and selected a stimulation method, twirling for 10 s at 1 Hz, to efficiently release AR biomarkers from a PE swab. Storage of sample solutions at ?20 °C was optimal for the stability of biomarkers for the detection of AR. The new swab sample transfer device showed excellent concentration recovery efficiency (90–100%) for tryptase (Trp) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) without crosstalk between the two biomarkers. Finally, we compared the concentration of Trp in human NS samples of AR patients (n = 6) pre-processed by the new device with that by centrifuge as a standard method. As a result, the concentrations of Trp in NS were very similar in both groups. Therefore, this device can be utilized as an effective sample transfer and pre-processing device for point-of-care testing of AR. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","biological marker; eosinophil cationic protein; polyester; tryptase; adult; aged; allergic rhinitis; Article; clinical article; human; laboratory diagnosis; male; nose mucosa; nose secretion; nose smear; point of care testing; priority journal; sampling; skin test; specimen handling; storage temperature"
"The effect of a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention on obesity status, body composition, physical fitness, and cardiometabolic risk markers in children and adolescents with obesity",2019,"This study aimed to develop a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program targeted at children and adolescents with moderate to severe obesity, and assess the additional effects of exercise intervention when compared to usual care. Overall, the 103 enrolled participants were ?85th percentile of age and sex-specific body mass index (BMI). Participants were divided into groups that received 16 weeks of either usual care or exercise intervention. The BMI z-score of the overall completers decreased by about 0.05 after the 16-week intervention (p = 0.02). After the intervention, only the exercise group had a significantly lower BMI z-score than the baseline score by about 0.1 (p = 0.03), but no significant group by time interaction effects were observed. At the 16-week follow-up, significant group by time interaction effects were observed in percentage body fat (%BF) (β = ?1.52, 95%CI = ?2.58–?0.45), lean body mass (LM) (β = 1.20, 95%CI = 0.12–2.29), diastolic blood pressure (β = ?5.24, 95%CI = ?9.66–?0.83), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (β = ?1.67, 95%CI = ?2.77–?1.01), and wall sit test score (β = 50.74, 95%CI = 32.30–69.18). We developed a moderate-intensity intervention program that can be sustained in the real-world setting and is practically applicable to both moderate and severe obesity. After interventions, the exercise group had lower %BF and cardiometabolic risk markers, and higher LM and leg muscle strength compared to the usual care group. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"Shared genetic etiology of Hwabyung (Anger Syndrome) and somatization symptoms in South Korean adolescent and young adult twins",2019,"Somatization is known to be more prevalent in Asian than in Western populations. Using a South Korean adolescent and young adult twin sample (N = 1754; 367 monozygotic male, 173 dizygotic male, 681 monozygotic female, 274 dizygotic female and 259 opposite-sex dizygotic twins), the present study aimed to estimate heritability of somatization and to determine common genetic and environmental influences on somatization and hwabyung (HB: Anger syndrome). Twins completed self-report questionnaires of the HB symptoms scale and the somatization scale via a telephone interview. The results of the general sex-limitation model showed that 43% (95% CI [36, 50]) of the total variance of somatization was attributable to additive genetic factors, with the remaining variance, 57% (95% CI [50, 64]), being due to individual-specific environmental influences, including measurement error. These estimates were not significantly different between the two sexes. The phenotypic correlation between HB and somatization was.53 (p <.001). The bivariate model-fitting analyses revealed that the genetic correlation between the two symptoms was.68 (95% CI [.59,.77]), while the individual-specific environmental correlation, including correlated measurement error, was.41 (95% CI [.34,.48]). Of the additive genetic factors of 43% that influence somatization, approximately half (20%) were associated with those related to HB, with the remainder being due to genes unique to somatization. A substantial part (48%) of individual environmental variance in somatization was unrelated to HB; only 9% of the environmental variance was shared with HB. Our findings suggest that HB and somatization have shared genetic etiology, but environmental factors that precipitate the development of HB and somatization may be largely independent from each other. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; adult; Article; child; controlled study; dizygotic twins; environmental factor; female; genetic correlation; genetic variability; heredity; heritability; human; hwabyung symptoms scale; hwabyung syndrome; major clinical study; male; measurement error; mental disease; mental disease assessment; monozygotic twins; priority journal; self report; sex difference; sex limitation; somatization; somatization scale; South Korean; telephone interview; twins; anger; Asian continental ancestry group; biological model; environment; genetics; pathophysiology; psychology; questionnaire; register; sexual characteristics; twins; young adult; Adolescent; Anger; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Diseases in Twins; Environment; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Genetic; Registries; Sex Characteristics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic; Young Adult"
"Serum levels of periostin and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children",2019,"Background: Periostin is induced by IL-13 and has been studied as a biomarker of asthma. The present study explored the relationship between serum levels of periostin and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in asthmatic children. Methods: The study population consisted of 86 children 6–15 years old divided into an asthmatic group (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 30). We measured the levels of periostin in serum and performed pulmonary function tests including baseline measurements, post-bronchodilator inhalation tests, exercise bronchial provocation tests (BPTs), and mannitol BPTs. Results: The 56 asthmatic children were divided into four groups: asthmatics with positive exercise BPT and positive mannitol BPT (n = 30), asthmatics with positive exercise BPT but negative mannitol BPT (n = 7), asthmatics with negative exercise BPT but positive mannitol BPT (n = 10), and asthmatics with negative exercise BPT and negative mannitol BPT (n = 9). Serum levels of periostin in asthmatic children with both positive exercise and mannitol BPT were significantly greater than those in asthmatic children with both negative exercise and mannitol BPT (95.0 [75.0–104.0] vs. 79.0 [68.0–82.5] ng/mL, P = 0.008) and controls (74.0 [69.75–80.0] ng/mL, P &lt; 0.001). Periostin levels were significantly correlated with both the maximum decrease in %FEV 1 and mannitol PD 15 value. Conclusion: Serum levels of periostin in asthmatic children with both positive exercise and mannitol BPT were significantly greater than those in asthmatic children with both negative exercise and mannitol BPT and also greater than in healthy controls. ? 2019 The Authors","immunoglobulin E; mannitol; methacholine; transcription factor RUNX2; adolescent; Article; asthma; bronchoconstriction; child; controlled study; eosinophil count; exercise; exercise induced bronchoconstriction; female; forced expiratory volume; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; human; inhalation test; major clinical study; male; mild intermittent asthma; mild persistent asthma; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; respiratory tract allergy"
"Crocin attenuates methylglyoxal-induced osteoclast dysfunction by regulating glyoxalase, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function",2019,"Methylglyoxal (MG), a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, is a major cell-permeant precursor of advanced glycation end-products, which are associated with several conditions, including diabetes and degenerative diseases. Crocin, a constituent of saffron, is involved in many pharmacological activities. Recent studies have reported that crocin exerts protective effects against bone diseases. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells that are responsible for bone resorption. The up- or down-regulation of their proliferation and differentiation is often associated with many bone-related diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of crocin on osteoclast differentiation and to clarify its mechanism of action in the presence of MG. We demonstrated that crocin reversed MG-induced inhibition of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity and bone resorption activity in osteoclasts. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that crocin treatment decreased the expression of TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), Akt2, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1), osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1 (OSTM1), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) genes in the presence of MG. Crocin pretreatment also reversed MG-induced changes in mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial superoxide, and glyoxalase I levels. Taken together, our data suggest that crocin may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetic bone disorders. ? 2018","acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; crocin; gelatinase B; glyoxalase; lactoylglutathione lyase; methylglyoxal; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; osteoclast differentiation factor; osteopetrosis associated transmembrane protein 1; protein kinase B beta; superoxide; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; unclassified drug; acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; carotenoid; crocin; lactoylglutathione lyase; osteoclast differentiation factor; Tnfsf11 protein, mouse; Akt2 gene; Article; cell damage; cell viability; concentration response; drug cytotoxicity; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug screening; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; ERK1 gene; gene; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial volume; MMP9 gene; osteoclast; osteoclastogenesis; osteolysis; OSTM1 gene; oxidative stress; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; TRAF6 gene; animal; bone disease; cell differentiation; chemically induced; gene expression regulation; metabolism; mitochondrion; mouse; osteoclast; oxidative stress; RAW 264.7 cell line; signal transduction; Animals; Bone Diseases; Carotenoids; Cell Differentiation; Gene Expression Regulation; Lactoylglutathione Lyase; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mice; Mitochondria; Osteoclasts; Oxidative Stress; Pyruvaldehyde; RANK Ligand; RAW 264.7 Cells; Signal Transduction; Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase"
"Suppression of gut dysbiosis by Bifidobacterium longum alleviates cognitive decline in 5XFAD transgenic and aged mice",2019,"To understand the role of commensal gut bacteria on the progression of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, we isolated anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium longum (NK46) from human gut microbiota, which potently inhibited gut microbiota endotoxin production and suppressed NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 cells, and examined whether NK46 could simultaneously alleviate gut dysbiosis and cognitive decline in male 5xFAD-transgenic (5XFAD-Tg, 6 months-old) and aged (18 months-old) mice. Oral administration of NK46 (1 × 109 CFU/mouse/day for 1 and 2 months in aged and Tg mice, respectively) shifted gut microbiota composition, particularly Proteobacteria, reduced fecal and blood LPS levels, suppressed NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression, and increased tight junction protein expression in the colon of 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice. NK46 treatment also alleviated cognitive decline in 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice. Furthermore, NK46 treatment suppressed amyloid-β, β/γ-secretases, and caspase-3 expression and amyloid-β accumulation in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-Tg mice. NK46 treatment also reduced Iba1+, LPS+/CD11b+, and caspase-3+/NeuN+ cell populations and suppressed NF-κB activation in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-Tg and aged mice, while BDNF expression was increased. These findings suggest that the suppression of gut dysbiosis and LPS production by NK46 can mitigate cognitive decline through the regulation of microbiota LPS-mediated NF-κB activation. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"International consensus on natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) for colorectal cancer",2019,"In recent years, natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) in the treatment of colorectal cancer has attracted widespread attention. The potential benefits of NOSES including reduction in postoperative pain and wound complications, less use of postoperative analgesic, faster recovery of bowel function, shorter length of hospital stay, better cosmetic and psychological effect have been described in colorectal surgery. Despite significant decrease in surgical trauma of NOSES have been observed, the potential pitfalls of this technique have been demonstrated. Particularly, several issues including bacteriological concerns, oncological outcomes and patient selection are raised with this new technique. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to reach a consensus as an industry guideline to standardize the implementation of NOSES in colorectal surgery. After three rounds of discussion by all members of the International Alliance of NOSES, the consensus is finally completed, which is also of great significance to the long-term progress of NOSES worldwide. ?

"Can beta-endorphin be used as a biomarker for chronic low back pain? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2019,"Background. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is usually quantified using the visual analog scale (VAS). However, the VAS is a subjective measure and prone to reporting bias, therefore making it difficult to differentiate patients with true pain from those seeking to obtain secondary gain. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using plasma b-endorphin as an objective biomarker for CLBP. Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized trials that compared treatment vs sham procedures for patients with CLBP. Changes in VAS and b-endorphin levels between baseline and final evaluations were assessed for the treatment and control groups. A meta-regression model was developed to evaluate the association between the b-endorphin level and VAS. Results. We included data from seven trials involving 375 patients. There was no significant difference in VAS scores and b-endorphin levels between both groups at baseline. At final evaluation, the treatment group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in VAS scores and an increased b-endorphin level compared with the control group. The change in the plasma b-endorphin level may be a surrogate marker of treatment response for patients with CLBP (explanatory power: 80%). The plasma b-endorphin level might be rarely affected by sham procedures. For patients with CLBP, the baseline b-endorphin level may reflect the intensity of CLBP (explanatory power: 66%). Conclusions. A change in plasma b-endorphin level may be a surrogate marker of the treatment response for patients with CLBP. Advancements in b-endorphin measurements may help us better quantify pain intensity. ? 2017 American Academy of Pain Medicine.","beta endorphin; biological marker; beta endorphin; Article; clinical evaluation; comparative effectiveness; disease marker; feasibility study; human; low back pain; meta analysis; pain intensity; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial (topic); sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; treatment response; visual analog scale; chronic pain; low back pain; pain measurement; beta-Endorphin; Chronic Pain; Humans; Low Back Pain; Pain Measurement; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome"
"Disability weights measurement for 289 causes of disease considering disease severity in Korea",2019,"Background: For the Korean Burden of Disease (KBD) 2015 study, we have amended disability weights for causes of disease adapting the methodology of the KBD disability weight 2012 study. Methods: We conducted a self-administered web-based survey in Korea using ranking five causes of disease. A total of 605 physicians and medical college students who were attending in third or fourth grade of a regular course performed the survey. We converted the ranked data into paired comparison data and ran a probit regression. The predicted probabilities for each cause of disease were calculated from the coefficient estimates of the probit regression. 'Being dead (1)' and 'Full health (0)' were utilized as anchor points to rescale the predicted probability on a scale from 0 to 1. Results: As a result, disability weights for a total of 289 causes of disease were estimated. In particular, we calculated the disability weights of 60 causes of disease considering severity level. These results show that prejudice about the severity of cause of disease itself can affect the estimation of disability weight, when estimating the disability weight for causes of disease without consideration of severity. Furthermore, we have shown that disability weights can be estimated based on a ranking method which can maximize efficiency of data collection. Conclusion: Disability weights from this study can be used to estimate disability adjusted life year and healthy life expectancy. Furthermore, we expected that the use of the ranking method will increase gradually in disability weight studies. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","adult; disability; diseases; female; human; life expectancy; male; medical student; physician; psychology; quality adjusted life year; questionnaire; severity of illness index; South Korea; web browser; young adult; Adult; Disability Evaluation; Disease; Female; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Physicians; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Republic of Korea; Severity of Illness Index; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Web Browser; Young Adult"
"The natural plant flavonoid apigenin is a strong antioxidant that effectively delays peripheral neurodegenerative processes",2019,"Oxidative stress contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy. Despite the greater capability of peripheral nerves to regenerate compared with those in the brain or spinal cord, chronic oxidative stress leads to irreversible neurodegeneration in peripheral nerves. Thus, many efforts have been made to defend against irreversible peripheral nerve degeneration and oxidative stress. Numerous phytochemicals have been revealed as antioxidants which neutralize free radicals and reduce peripheral neurocellular damage. Among them, polyphenols alleviate neurodegeneration by interacting with reactive oxygen species. Apigenin is a polyphenol found in plant-derived foods, including parsley, thyme, celery, and chamomile tea. Apigenin has been reported to exert antioxidative effects by scavenging free radicals. In particular, apigenin has a neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress in neurological disorders, such as cerebral ischemia. However, to date, no studies have shown an association of the inhibitory effect of apigenin with peripheral nerve degeneration. In this work, we showed that apigenin has a neuroprotective effect against peripheral nerve degeneration according to four key phenotypes: axonal degradation, myelin fragmentation, trans-dedifferentiation, and proliferation of Schwann cells via Krox20- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-independent processes. Thus, apigenin could be a good candidate to treat peripheral neurodegenerative diseases. ? 2019, Japanese Association of Anatomists.","apigenin; mitogen activated protein kinase; myelin; apigenin; early growth response factor 2; mitogen activated protein kinase; neuroprotective agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; scavenger; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; cell dedifferentiation; cell proliferation; cell transdifferentiation; controlled study; immunohistochemistry; male; mouse; myelin sheath; nerve degeneration; nerve fiber; nerve fiber degeneration; neuroprotection; nonhuman; peripheral neuropathy; priority journal; Schwann cell; sciatic nerve; animal; axon; degenerative disease; disease model; drug effect; human; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathology; peripheral neuropathy; Animals; Apigenin; Axons; Cell Dedifferentiation; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Early Growth Response Protein 2; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Free Radical Scavengers; Humans; Male; Mice; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neuroprotective Agents; Oxidative Stress; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Schwann Cells; Sciatic Nerve"
"Item-level analysis of the relationship between orthodontic treatment need and oral health–related quality of life in Korean schoolchildren",2019,"Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between normative orthodontic treatment need and oral health–related quality of life (OHRQoL) at an item level as well as subscale and total score levels among schoolchildren. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 2,010 randomly selected children aged approximately 8, 10, 12, and 15 years residing in the Gyeonggi province, Korea. Children were clinically examined with the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). To measure OHRQoL, the Child Oral Health Impact Profile (COHIP) was used. Results: In the physical health domain of COHIP, crooked teeth, discoloration, “food sticking,” and “difficulty keeping teeth clean” were significantly associated with IOTN levels (P < 0.05), whereas pain, sensitivity and bleeding, bad breath, mouth breathing, and dry mouth were not. In addition, present and future dental health were significantly associated with IOTN levels, although self-confidence, attractiveness, and future health were not. As expected, the 5 subscale scores and total score of COHIP were significantly associated with IOTN levels after adjustment for gender, age, socioeconomic level, and caries state. Conclusions: This study suggests the importance of in-depth investigation at the item level of OHRQoL assessment scales to better evaluate the impact of malocclusion that might be alleviated by orthodontic treatment. ? 2018 American Association of Orthodontists","adolescent; child; cross-sectional study; female; health; human; index of orthodontic treatment need; male; quality of life; socioeconomics; South Korea; Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need; Male; Oral Health; Quality of Life; Republic of Korea; Socioeconomic Factors"

"A prospective evaluation of the reliability and utility of quality of life measures in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Objectives:Little is known about how quality of life (QOL) can assist clinical decision-making for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of QOL as well as its prognostic value and utility.Materials and Methods:A prospective cohort of 300 HCC patients at various stages was recruited from 2015 to 2017 in Korea. The subjects answered the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) and QLQ-HCC18 and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) questionnaire. Prognostic nomograms including the QOL scales were developed. The prediction performance of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems when they were incorporated with QOL was investigated.Results:The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 subscales showed higher reliability than FACT-Hep subscales. With regard to the validity, both questionnaires discriminated the patients by stages, treatment modalities, and performance status effectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that EORTC role functioning and EORTC appetite loss subscales were statistically associated with overall survival and disease progression. The developed nomograms accurately estimated the 1-year overall survival and disease progression-free rates. Incorporating the EORTC role functioning subscale or Hepatobiliary Cancer Subscale of FACT-Hep with the BCLC and AJCC systems improved the prognostic classification. Incorporating QOL into the AJCC system showed better predictive accuracy than incorporating performance status into it did.Conclusions:The findings suggest that QOL data can serve as a reliable predictive factor and assist prognostic calculation for HCC patients.. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Factors influencing the accessibility of maternal health service in Cambodia",2019,"Despite worldwide efforts, maternal and child mortality remains a major health problem in many developing countries. Cambodia’s maternal mortality rate has decreased over recent years through government efforts and support from various international development cooperation agencies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that affected the accessibility of Cambodia’s maternal healthcare services. Data from maternal health service surveys conducted in Battambang, Cambodia in 2012 and 2015 were compared and analyzed. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors related to the accessibility of integrated maternal healthcare service. The travel time to health centers was found to be related to distance from the health center (? = 0.031, p < 0.001), travel time during the rainy season (? = 0.166, p < 0.001), and travel cost (? = 0.001, p < 0.001), with an explanatory power of 27% (R2 = 0.274). Based on these findings, future research and policy should focus on improving accessibility to effective maternal and child healthcare services, to reduce maternal and child mortality.

Promising compounds were further evaluated at various concentrations. Multiple proinflammatory mediators were assessed including NO, PGE2, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Compound 5z inhibited the induced production of NO, PGE2, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at the low 1 μM concentration by 44.76, 35.71, 53.48, 29.39 and 41.02%, respectively. Compound 5z elicited IC50 values as low as 2.11 and 0.98 μM against NO and PGE2 production respectively. Compounds 5q and 5g showed potent submicromolar IC50 values of 0.31 and 0.59 μM respectively against PGE2 production. Reverse docking of compound 5z suggested p38-α MAPK, which is a key signaling molecule within the pathways controlling the transcription of proinflammatory mediators, as the molecular target. Biochemical testing confirmed these compounds as p38-α MAPK inhibitors explaining its potent inhibition of proinflammatory mediators’ production. Collectively, the results presented 5z as a promising compound for further development of anti-inflammatory agents for treatment of macrophages-and/or immune mediated inflammatory diseases. ? 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","2 methoxy n (4 (5,6,7 trimethoxy 4 oxo 4h chromen 2 yl)phenyl)benzamide; 5,6,7 trimethoxyflavone; alcohol dehydrogenase; amide; antiinflammatory agent; binding protein; catechol oxidase; cholesterol oxidase; dynamin I; endotoxin; flavone derivative; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; mitogen activated protein kinase 14; mitogen activated protein kinase p38 alpha inhibitor; mitogen activated protein kinase p38 inhibitor; mosloflavone; n (2 cyclohexyloxy 4 nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide; n (4 (5,6,7 trimethoxy 4 oxo 4h chromen 2 yl)phenyl)benzamide derivative; natural product; nitric oxide; oxidoreductase; prostaglandin E2; resveratrol; sarcosine oxidase; stilbene; transcription factor; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone; autacoid; flavone derivative; flavonoid; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; protein kinase inhibitor; animal cell; antiinflammatory activity; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell viability assay; computer model; controlled study; crystal structure; cytokine production; drug design; drug structure; enzyme inhibition; evaluation study; human; hybrid; immune response; immunoblotting; inflammation; macrophage; mediator; molecular hybridization; molecule; MTT assay; nonhuman; prediction; prostaglandin synthesis inhibition; protein structure; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; RAW 264.7 cell line; synthesis; animal; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug development; drug effect; inflammation; macrophage; metabolism; mouse; structure activity relation; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Discovery; Flavones; Flavonoids; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Macrophages; Mice; Molecular Structure; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; RAW 264.7 Cells; Resveratrol; Structure-Activity Relationship"
"White matter hyperintensities and recurrent stroke risk in patients with stroke with small-vessel disease",2019,"Background and purpose: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a predictor of stroke among elderly individuals. This study aimed to evaluate the association between WMH severity and the risk of recurrent vascular events among Asian patients with ischaemic stroke with small-vessel disease (SVD) including micro/macrobleeds and lacunes. Methods: Data from participants (n?=?1454) in the PICASSO (PreventIon of CArdiovascular Events in iSchemic Stroke Patients with High Risk of Cerebral HemOrrhage) trial were reviewed. The severity of WMH in baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging scans was assessed using the Fazekas scale. The association between WMH severity and stroke (ischaemic or hemorrhagic) and major vascular events (MVEs) (a composite of stroke/myocardial infarction/vascular death) was assessed. Results: Study patients had a significant burden of SVD: Fazekas score 0 (n?=?2), 1 (n?=?426), 2 (n?=?650) and 3 (n?=?376) [median Fazekas score 2 (mean follow-up, 1.9 ± 1.3 years)]. The stroke incidence rate per 100 personyears was 2.6 in the Fazekas 0–1 group, 3.6 in the Fazekas 2 group and 7.0 in the Fazekas 3 group, and the rates for MVEs were 3.3, 4.3 and 7.6, respectively. Compared with the Fazekas 0–1 group, the Fazekas 3 group was associated with a higher risk of stroke [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19–3.88; P?=?0.011], ischaemic stroke (adjusted HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07–4.15; P?=?0.031), hemorrhagic stroke (adjusted HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.09–12.70; P?=?0.036) and MVEs (adjusted HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.20–3.66; P?=?0.010). Conclusion: Advanced WMH in Asian patients with ischaemic stroke with SVD burden was associated with an increased risk of recurrent vascular events. It may exert an effect as a prognostic indicator in high risk of recurrent vascular events. ? 2019 EAN","antithrombocytic agent; cilostazol; glycosylated hemoglobin; probucol; adult; Article; Asian; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular disease; controlled study; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; fazekas scale; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; nervous system parameters; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; risk factor; scoring system; white matter hyperintensity"
"The Korean Cohort for the Model Predicting a Suicide and Suicide-related Behavior: Study rationale, methodology, and baseline sample characteristics of a long-term, large-scale, multi-center, prospective, naturalistic, observational cohort study",2019,"Background: The Korean Cohort for the Model Predicting a Suicide and Suicide-related Behavior (K-COMPASS) study is a prospective, naturalistic, observational cohort study, aiming to identify predictors of suicide attempt and suicide characteristics in the Korean suicidal population. The findings intend to contribute to a thorough understanding of suicidal phenomena and development of suicide prevention guidelines. The present cross-section study examines the study rationale, methodology, and baseline characteristics of the participants. Methods: Participants were enrolled via the hospital and community gateways, establishing the hospital-based cohort (HC) and community-based cohort (CC), respectively. Baseline assessment was conducted on sociodemographic, clinical, diagnostic, and psychopathological aspects. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale was used to investigate suicidality. Results: A total of 800 suicidal people aged 15 years or older were enrolled from 8 university hospitals and 8 community mental health welfare centers (CMHWCs), among whom 480 (60%) were suicidal ideators and 320 (40%) were attempters. The ideators comprised 207 CC and 273 HC participants, whereas the attempters, 34 CC and 286 HC participants. Despite their lower severity in some measures, including suicidal ideation, compared with their HC counterparts, the CC participants within each group of ideators or attempters presented clinically significant psychopathology. Moreover, alcohol use problems and past suicide attempt were more likely to be found in CC participants. Only 11.1% to 21.6% of the participants in each of the four groups (defined by the cohorts and the ideators/attempters) were on any type of psychiatric treatment. Conclusions: Suicidal visitors to CMHWCs need to be as closely monitored as suicidal patients in university hospitals, especially considering their association with problem drinking and past suicide attempt. A cautious assumption is that the high suicide rate in Korea might be partly attributable to the low proportion of patients receiving psychiatric services. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adolescent; adult; aged; alcohol abuse; anxiety; Article; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; depression; disease severity; female; human; hypomania; major clinical study; major depression; male; married person; mental disease; multicenter study; observational study; prospective study; psychiatric treatment; social status; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; alcoholism; clinical trial; middle aged; predictive value; psychology; South Korea; suicidal ideation; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcoholism; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Republic of Korea; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult"
"Risk factors and prognostic implications of aspiration pneumonia in older hip fracture patients: A multicenter retrospective analysis",2019,"Aim: The present study aimed to investigate the risk factors and prognostic implications of aspiration pneumonia in older hip fracture patients. Methods: A total of 394 female and 125 male hip fracture patients aged ?60 years who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. To identify risk factors of aspiration pneumonia, demographic factors, the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, past medical history, known risk factors of aspiration and factors associated with surgery were compared between the aspiration pneumonia group and the control group. Regression analysis was also carried out. To assess the prognostic implications of aspiration pneumonia, hospital stay, frequency of the intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality rates were compared between groups. Results: Aspiration pneumonia was diagnosed in 8.8% of the hip fracture patients. Increased age, low body mass index, malnutrition, longer duration of surgery and delayed surgery were identified as risk factors of aspiration pneumonia. Regarding prognostic implications, hospital stay, the frequency of intensive care unit care and in-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher in the aspiration pneumonia group (P < 0.001, <0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Older hip fracture patients with aspiration pneumonia showed worse prognostic outcome compared with patients without aspiration pneumonia. Longer duration of surgery and delayed surgery, as well as patient characteristics including increased age, low body mass index and malnutrition were identified as risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, surgeons should try to reduce the operation time and the time interval between injury and surgery when treating older patients for hip fractures.

"Comparative prognosis in patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and Bell’s palsy",2019,"Purpose: Patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome have a poorer prognosis than patients with Bell’s palsy. Factors of metabolic syndrome affecting prognosis were therefore compared between patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and those with Bell’s palsy. Methods: This retrospective study included 106 with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and 182 with Bell’s palsy. Age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, blood test results, and ENoG results, stratified by House–Brackmann grade, were compared in patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and Bell’s palsy. Both groups of patients were treated with steroids and the antiviral agent famciclovir. Results: Age, sex, body mass index, dyslipidemia, triglyceride, diabetes, hypertension, and onset of palsy did not differ in patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and Bell’s palsy. Rates of favorable recovery in patients with severe facial palsy and DM were lower in patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome than with Bell’s palsy and were also lower in low-weight, normal weight, and overweight patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome than with Bell’s palsy. Rates of favorable recovery in patients with severe facial palsy and normal HDL, as well as in patients with severe facial palsy and < 10% ENoG, were lower in patients with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome than with Bell’s palsy. Conclusions: Among patients with severe facial palsy, along with diabetes and < 10% ENoG, unfavorable recovery rates were significantly higher in those with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome than with Bell’s palsy. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","famciclovir; steroid; triacylglycerol; adult; age; Article; Bell palsy; blood pressure; body mass; body weight; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease course; drug megadose; dyslipidemia; female; gender; herpes zoster oticus; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypertriglyceridemia; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; obesity; occult blood test; priority journal; prognostic assessment; triacylglycerol blood level; comparative study; complication; diabetic complication; herpes zoster; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; prognosis; retrospective study; Adult; Age Factors; Bell Palsy; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Complications; Female; Herpes Zoster Oticus; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Steroids; Varicella Zoster Virus Infection"
"Prognostic significance of high metabolic activity in breast cancer: PET signature in breast cancer",2019,"High metabolic activity, reflected in increased glucose uptake, is one of the hallmarks of many cancers including breast cancer. However, not all cancers avidly take up glucose, suggesting heterogeneity in their metabolic demand. Thus, we aim to generate a genomic signature of glucose hypermetabolism in breast cancer and examine its clinical relevance. To identify genes significantly associated with glucose uptake, gene expression data were analyzed together with the standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of 18 F-fluorodeoxy-glucose on positron emission tomography (PET) for 11 breast cancers. The resulting PET signature was evaluated for prognostic significance in four large independent patient cohorts (n = 5417). Potential upstream regulators accountable for the high glucose uptake were identified by gene network analysis. A PET signature of 242 genes was significantly correlated with SUVmax in breast cancer. In all four cohorts, high PET signature was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. The prognostic value of this PET signature was further supported by Cox regression analyses (hazard ratio 1.7, confidential interval 1.48–2.02; P &lt; 0.001). The PET signature was also strongly correlated with previously established prognostic genomic signatures such as PAM50, Oncotype DX, and NKI. Gene network analyses suggested that MYC and TBX2 were the most significant upstream transcription factors in the breast cancers with high glucose uptake. A PET signature reflecting high glucose uptake is a novel independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. MYC and TBX2 are potential regulators of glucose uptake. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; Myc protein; transcription factor; transcription factor TBX2; unclassified drug; glucose; adverse outcome; Article; breast cancer; cancer prognosis; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease activity; disease association; gene expression; genetic marker; genetic screening; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; human; maximum standardized uptake value; metabolic regulation; positron emission tomography; predictive value; priority journal; protein function; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; standardized uptake value; breast tumor; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; positron emission tomography; procedures; prognosis; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glucose; Glycolysis; Humans; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prognosis"
"Risk factor analysis for secondary malignancy in dexrazoxane-treated pediatric cancer patients",2019,"Purpose: Dexrazoxane has been used as an effective cardioprotector against anthracycline cardiotoxicity. This study intended to analyze cardioprotective efficacy and secondary malignancy development, and elucidate risk factors for secondary malignancies in dexrazoxane-treated pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: Data was collected from 15 hospitals in Korea. Patients who received any anthracyclines, and completed treatment without stem cell transplantation were included. For efficacy evaluation, the incidence of cardiac events and cardiac event-free survival rates were compared. Data about risk factors of secondary malignancies were collected. Results: Data of total 1,453 cases were analyzed; dexrazoxane with every anthracyclines group (D group, 1,035 patients) and no dexrazoxane group (non-D group, 418 patients). Incidence of the reported cardiac events was not statistically different between two groups; however, the cardiac event-free survival rate of patients with more than 400 mg/m 2 of anthracyclines was significantly higher in D group (91.2% vs. 80.1%, p=0.04). The 6-year cumulative incidence of secondary malignancy was not different between both groups after considering follow-up duration difference (non-D, 0.52%±0.37%; D, 0.60%±0.28%; p=0.55). The most influential risk factor for secondary malignancy was the duration of anthracycline administration according to multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Dexrazoxane had an efficacy in lowering cardiac event-free survival rates in patients with higher cumulative anthracyclines. As a result of multivariate analysis for assessing risk factors of secondary malignancy, the occurrence of secondary malignancy was not related to dexrazoxane administration.

"Angiographic features of patients with coronary plaque erosion",2019,"Background: Although an in vivo diagnosis of coronary plaque erosion has become possible by optical coherence tomography (OCT), angiographic characteristics of erosion have not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the angiographic features of plaque erosion in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). Methods: Patients with NSTE-ACS who underwent OCT of the culprit lesion were collected at 11 institutions from 6 countries. Patients were classified as erosion or non-erosion based on OCT images. Angiographic features of both groups were compared. Results: Among 494 cases with NSTE-ACS, 242 had plaque erosion and 252 had non-erosion. Compared to non-erosion group, erosion patients had less multivessel disease (28.5% vs. 49.6%, p < 0.001), lower Jeopardy score (4.2 vs. 5.0, p < 0.001), lower Gensini score (21.3 vs. 25.6, p = 0.014), and lower Syntax score (8.9 vs. 11.5, p < 0.001). With regard to the culprit lesion morphology, plaque erosion group had smaller reference diameter (2.8 mm vs. 3.0 mm, p = 0.032), less frequent type B2/C lesions (51.2% vs. 71.8%, p < 0.001), and lower prevalence of calcification (4.1% vs. 13.9%, p < 0.001) and thrombus (16.5% vs. 28.2%, p = 0.002). In the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD), erosion was significantly more frequent than non-erosion (30.2% vs. 21.8%, p = 0.034).

"Targeted next-generation sequencing panel (TruSight Tumor 170) in diffuse glioma: a single institutional experience of 135 cases",2019,"Purpose: The TruSight Tumor 170 (TST-170) panel consists of a DNA workflow for the identification of single-nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, and copy number variation, as well as a panel of 55 genes for a RNA workflow for the identification of splice variants and gene fusions. To date, the application of TST-170 in diffuse gliomas (DGs) has not been described. Methods: We analyzed 135 samples of DG, which were diagnosed by WHO criteria based on histological features and conventional molecular tests including immunostaining, 1p/19q FISH, and analysis of MGMT methylation and TERT promoter mutation. Results: A total of 135 cases consisted of 38 IDH-mutant [17 astrocytoma (AC), 13 oligodendroglioma (OD) and eight glioblastoma (GBM)], 87 IDH-wildtype (six AC, three OD and 78 GBM), and 10 diffuse midline glioma, H3K27M-mutant. DNA analysis enabled the detection of all mutations identified in these samples by conventional techniques, and the results were highly comparable to the known mutations in each subtype. RNA analysis detected four fusion genes including PTPRZ1–MET, FGFR3–TACC3, FAM131B–BRAF, and RET–CCDC6 and one splicing variant (EGFR vIII mutant). Clustered copy number loss in 1p and 19q loci genes were detected in 1p/19q-codeleted OD. Conclusions: The application of TST-170 panel based NGS in clinical and laboratory setting is expected to improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostication. Most benefits are expected in IDH-wildtype DG, a group of genetically heterogenous tumors harboring DNA sequence changes, copy number alterations, and fusions in a large number of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","B Raf kinase; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibroblast growth factor receptor 3; histone H3; isocitrate dehydrogenase; lysine; methylated DNA protein cysteine methyltransferase; protein Ret; scatter factor receptor; telomerase reverse transcriptase; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; astrocytoma; BRAF gene; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; CCDC6 gene; chromosome 19q; chromosome 1p; clinical feature; controlled study; copy number variation; DNA determination; EGFR gene; FAM131B gene; female; FGFR3 gene; fluorescence in situ hybridization; fusion gene; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene locus; gene mutation; glioblastoma; glioma; histone methylation; histopathology; human; IDH gene; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; MET gene; MGMT gene; molecular diagnosis; mutational analysis; next generation sequencing; oligodendroglioma; oncogene; promoter region; PTPRZ gene; RET gene; RNA analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; TACC3 gene; TERT gene; tumor suppressor gene; very elderly; wild type; workflow; World Health Organization; adolescent; brain tumor; clinical trial; copy number variation; follow up; genetics; glioma; high throughput sequencing; middle aged; mutation; pathology; procedures; prognosis; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glioma; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Prognosis; Young Adult"

"Assessment of the clinical heterogeneity of Kawasaki disease using genetic variants of BLK and FCGR2A",2019,"Background and Objectives: Patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) are clinically heterogeneous because its diagnosis is based solely on clinical observation and there are no definitive biomarkers. We dissected the clinical heterogeneity of KD patients using the KD-associated genetic variants. Methods: We performed a genetic association analysis in several KD subgroups categorized by clinical characteristics using the KD-associated variants of the B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK; rs6993775) and Fc gamma receptor II a (FCGR2A; rs1801274) in a large number of case (n=1,011) and control (n=4,533) samples. Results: BLKand FCGR2Awere very significantly associated with KD in Korean KD patients (odds ratio [OR],1.48; p=4.63×10 ?11 for BLK, and OR, 1.26; p=1.42×10 ?4 for FCGR2A). However, in KD subgroup analysis, we found that neither BLKnor FCGR2Awere associated with either incomplete Kawasaki disease (iKD) type patients or those older than 5 years of age (p&gt;0.2), suggesting that patients with iKD or those older than 5 years of age are a unique subgroup of KD. In genetic association analysis after excluding iKD patients and those older than 5 years old, we found that BLKwas associated with all KD subgroups, whereas FCGR2Awas specifically associated with male KD patients younger than 1 year of age (OR, 2.22; p=2.35×10 ?5 ). Conclusions: KD is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. These findings will provide new insights into the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of KD. Copyright ? 2019.

"Cycloastragenol can negate constitutive STAT3 activation and promote paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells",2019,"Background: Cycloastragenol (CAG), a triterpene aglycone is commonly prescribed for treating hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, viral hepatitis, and various inflammatory-linked diseases. Hypothesis: We investigated CAG for its action on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation cascades, and its potential to sensitize gastric cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Methods: The effect of CAG on STAT3 phosphorylation and other hallmarks of cancer was deciphered using diverse assays in both SNU-1 and SNU-16 cells. Results: We observed that CAG exhibited cytotoxic activity against SNU-1 and SNU-16 cells to a greater extent as compared to normal GES-1 cells. CAG predominantly caused negative regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 through the abrogation of Src and Janus-activated kinases (JAK1/2) activation. We noted that CAG impaired translocation of STAT3 protein as well as its DNA binding activity. It further decreased cellular proliferation and mediated its anticancer effects predominantly by causing substantial apoptosis rather than autophagy. In addition, CAG potentiated paclitaxel-induced anti-oncogenic effects in gastric tumor cells. Conclusions: Our results indicate that CAG can function to impede STAT3 activation in human gastric tumor cells and therefore it may be a suitable candidate agent for therapy of gastric cancer. ? 2019","caspase 3; cycloastragenol; cyclooxygenase 2; cytotoxic agent; docetaxel; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 2; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; paclitaxel; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; protein tyrosine kinase; STAT3 protein; survivin; triterpene derivative; tyrosine; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; antineoplastic agent; cycloastragenol; JAK1 protein, human; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 2; paclitaxel; sapogenin; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; diabetic nephropathy; DNA binding; down regulation; drug potentiation; enzyme activation; GES-1 cell line; human; human cell; hypertension; malignant neoplasm; priority journal; protein DNA binding; protein expression level; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein transport; SNU-1 cell line; SNU-16 cell line; stomach cancer; stomach tumor; virus hepatitis; apoptosis; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; phosphorylation; phytotherapy; signal transduction; stomach tumor; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Janus Kinase 1; Janus Kinase 2; Paclitaxel; Phosphorylation; Phytotherapy; Sapogenins; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Stomach Neoplasms"
"Previous infection with plasmodium berghei confers resistance to toxoplasma gondii infection in mice",2019,"Both Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii are important apicomplexan parasites, which infect humans worldwide. Genetic analyses have revealed that 33% of amino acid sequences of inner membrane complex from the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei is similar to that of Toxoplasma gondii. Inner membrane complex is known to be involved in cell invasion and replication. In this study, we investigated the resistance against T. gondii (ME49) infection induced by previously infected P. berghei (ANKA) in mice. Levels of T. gondii-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody responses, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations were found higher in the mice infected with P. berghei (ANKA) and challenged with T. gondii (ME49) compared to that in control mice infected with T. gondii alone (ME49). P. berghei (ANKA) + T. gondii (ME49) group showed significantly reduced the number and size of T. gondii (ME49) cysts in the brains of mice, resulting in lower body weight loss compared to ME49 control group. These results indicate that previous exposure to P. berghei (ANKA) induce resistance to subsequent T. gondii (ME49) infection. ? 2019, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.","immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin G1 antibody; immunoglobulin G2a antibody; immunoglobulin G2b; immunoglobulin G; protozoon antibody; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; Article; body weight loss; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; controlled study; female; humoral immunity; infection resistance; lymphocyte subpopulation; mixed infection; mouse; nonhuman; parasitemia; Plasmodium berghei infection; Th1 cell; toxoplasmosis; animal; animal toxoplasmosis; Bagg albino mouse; blood; body weight; brain; immunology; parasitology; pathology; Plasmodium berghei; Toxoplasma; Animals; Antibodies, Protozoan; Body Weight; Brain; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Female; Immunoglobulin G; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Plasmodium berghei; Toxoplasma; Toxoplasmosis, Animal"
"Factors associated with sequelae after treatment of hematogenous pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis",2019,"Objectives: Functional disability may persist after completing treatment for hematogenous pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (HPVO). The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with residual sequelae after treatment of HPVO. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with HPVO at 5 tertiary-care hospitals between January 2005 and December 2012. Sequelae were defined as an inability to walk without assistance, bladder/bowel incontinence, and/or unresolved pain that required analgesic therapy at 12 months after completing the HPVO treatment. Results: Of the 279 patients with microbiologically proven HPVO, 79 (28.3%) had sequelae at 12 months posttherapy. Independent risk factors for sequelae were neurologic deficit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.38), recurrence within 12 months (aOR, 2.45), age ? 65 years (aOR, 2.05), C-reactive protein level ? 10 mg/dL (aOR, 2.01), and epidural/paravertebral abscess (aOR, 2.00). Among 58 patients with neurologic deficit, sequelae rates differed according to the surgical strategy, as follows: 28.6% (early surgery [<48 h]), 55.0% (delayed surgery [?48 h]), and 66.7% (no surgery) (P = 0.03). Among the 170 patients with abscess, early drainage (<72 h) was an independent protective factor for sequelae (aOR, 0.35). The 12-month recurrence rates differed according to the total duration of antibiotic treatment, as follows: 20.5% (4–6 weeks), 18.4% (6–8 weeks), and 5.2% (?8 weeks) (P < 0.001). Conclusions: A substantial proportion of patients with HPVO experienced sequelae after completing treatment. Early surgery for neurologic deficit, early drainage of abscess, and antibiotic therapy of appropriate duration to reduce recurrence may prevent development of sequelae in patients with HPVO. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","antibiotic agent; C reactive protein; adult; aged; Article; brain abscess; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; end stage renal disease; female; human; immune deficiency; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; neurologic disease; operation duration; priority journal; protein blood level; recurrence risk; retrospective study; rheumatic disease; spondylitis; tertiary care center; treatment outcome; urine incontinence; very elderly"
"Korean clinical practice guideline for perioperative red blood cell transfusion from Korean society of anesthesiologists",2019,"Background: Considering the functional role of red blood cells (RBC) in maintaining oxygen supply to tissues, RBC transfusion can be a life-saving intervention in situations of severe bleeding or anemia. RBC transfusion is often inevitable to address intraoperative massive bleeding; it is a key component in safe perioperative patient management. Unlike general medical resources, packed RBCs (pRBCs) have limited availability because their supply relies entirely on voluntary donations. Additionally, excessive utilization of pRBCs may aggravate prognosis or increase the risk of developing infectious diseases. Appropriate perioperative RBC transfusion is, therefore, crucial for the management of patient safety and medical resource conservation. These concerns motivated us to develop the present clinical practice guideline for evidence-based efficient and safe perioperative RBC transfusion management considering the current clinical landscape. Methods: This guideline was obtained after the revision and refinement of exemplary clinical practice guidelines developed in advanced countries. This was followed by rigorous evidence-based reassessment considering the healthcare environment of the country. Results: This guideline covers all important aspects of perioperative RBC transfusion, such as preoperative anemia management, appropriate RBC storage period, and leukoreduction (removal of white blood cells using filters), reversal of perioperative bleeding tendency, strategies for perioperative RBC transfusion, appropriate blood management protocols, efforts to reduce blood transfusion requirements, and patient monitoring during a perioperative transfusion. Conclusions: This guideline will aid decisions related to RBC transfusion in healthcare settings and minimize patient risk associated with unnecessary pRBC transfusion. ?

"Recurrent Bell's palsy",2019,"Objective: Although recurrent facial palsy was first reported in 1871, the aetiology, definitions, classifications, pathogenesis, treatment options and prognosis have not been clearly determined. There have been no systematic reviews and meta-analyses of recurrent Bell's palsy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations of recurrent Bell's palsy through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Design: The SCOPUS, PubMed, Cochrane Library and EBSCO databases were searched through 1 May 2018, using the search terms “recurrent Bell's palsy” and “recurrent facial palsy,” for studies involving patients with recurrent Bell's palsy. Reference lists of eligible studies were also reviewed. Results: A search of titles and abstracts in these four databases identified 222 studies; of these, 27 studies, involving 1041 patients from 13 countries, were analysed. The mean percentage of patients who experienced recurrence of Bell's palsy ranged from 0.8% to 19.4%. Five studies that included 191 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Conclusions: Among patients previously affected by Bell's palsy, the mean incidence of recurrent Bell's palsy was 6.5%. Sidedness of recurrent disease, relative to the side of the original disease, had no effect on patient prognosis. Of all patients with Bell's palsy, 66.0% recovered completely, with the recovery rate lower in patients with recurrent than with primary Bell's palsy. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article; Bell palsy; clinical feature; convalescence; decompression; gender; human; prevalence; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; systematic review"
"Factors affecting willingness to get assessed and treated for osteoporosis",2019,"Summary: Individuals with poor knowledge of osteoporosis and lower socioeconomic status, including being single and having a lower level of annual income, are less likely to be assessed or treated for osteoporosis. Individuals with particular osteoporosis risk factors such as smokers and heavy drinkers are overlooked for diagnosis. Further study is needed to identify and address the existing barriers and to promote osteoporosis management for women with these risk factors. Introduction: Despite the negative health consequences of osteoporosis and the availability of effective treatment, a pervasive and persistent prevention care gap for osteoporosis remains present throughout the world. We attempted to identify the factors affecting the willingness of patients to either undergo or avoid assessment and treatment for osteoporosis. Methods: A nationwide online survey was conducted in 926 Korean women over age 50. The survey included questions addressing three domains: (1) clinical and socio-demographic characteristics, (2) questions concerning the reasons for undergoing or avoiding osteoporosis assessment or treatment, and (3) knowledge of osteoporosis as measured using the modified Korean version of Facts on Osteoporosis Quiz. The assessed and non-assessed participants were compared in terms of their clinical and socioeconomic statuses, reasons for undergoing or avoiding osteoporosis management, and levels of knowledge of osteoporosis. Results: The highest-ranked reason for undergoing osteoporosis assessment was fear of osteoporotic fracture, while the highest-ranked reason for avoiding osteoporosis assessment was not feeling a need to get tested for osteoporosis. Participants who sought assessment for osteoporosis were older and more likely to be married, and had greater knowledge of osteoporosis than those who did not seek assessment. The two groups were found to be similar in terms of tobacco use and daily alcohol use. Patients who had been diagnosed with osteoporosis but either did not initiate or discontinued osteoporosis treatment within 1?year were younger and had lower levels of annual income than those who began and continued treatment. Conclusion: Individuals with poor knowledge of osteoporosis and those of lower socioeconomic status, including those who were single and had a lower level of annual income, were less likely to be assessed and treated for osteoporosis. Individuals with particular osteoporosis risk factors such as smokers and heavy drinkers are overlooked for diagnosis. Further study is needed to identify and address the existing barriers and to promote osteoporosis management for women with these risk factors. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","alcohol; bone density conservation agent; adult; age; alcohol consumption; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; fear; female; fragility fracture; help seeking behavior; human; income; knowledge; Korean (people); major clinical study; married person; middle aged; osteoporosis; patient attitude; priority journal; risk factor; single (marital status); social status; tobacco use; aged; attitude to health; fragility fracture; patient attitude; postmenopause osteoporosis; psychology; questionnaire; socioeconomics; South Korea; Aged; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Osteoporotic Fractures; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Late-onset neurological deficits induced by proximal adjacent segment degeneration related to severe post-tuberculous kyphotic deformities of the spine: A series of 7 cases and surgical correction concept",2019,"Objective: Late-onset neurological deficits are a rare complication of spinal tuberculosis that may be caused by proximal adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) above the kyphus. The objective of this study was to report several cases of neurological deficits due to proximal ASD in patients with post-tuberculous kyphotic deformity and discuss the characteristics of the authors' corrective surgical technique. Methods: The inclusion criteria in this study were severe angular kyphosis due to a post-tuberculous kyphotic deformity and a late-onset neurological deficit. The cause of these deficits was related to a lesion in the proximal cephalad portion of the kyphotic deformity. Surgical intervention, including decompression and compromised restoration of the sagittal imbalance, was performed in all patients. Preoperative surgical planning with a radiological evaluation included CT, plain radiograph, and MRI studies. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Results: The main goal of our surgical technique was the correction of sagittal malalignment by positioning the patient's head above the kyphotic deformity on the sagittal plane, excluding aggressive osteotomy. The neurological symptoms showed immediate improvements postoperatively, except in 1 patient. Compared to the preoperative value of 66.9, the mean ODI score improved to 42.6 at the final follow-up for all patients. Preoperatively, the mean values of the angles of deformity and the sagittal vertical axis were 99.7° and 157.7 mm, respectively, and decreased to 75.3° and 46.0 mm, respectively, at the final follow-up. No major complications were observed, and the patients' self-satisfaction was high with respect to both cosmetic and functional outcomes. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of the degeneration of the vertebrae above the kyphotic segment in patients with post-tuberculosis deformity. Successful neurological recovery and compromised sagittal balance could be obtained by using our ""head on kyphus"" surgical concept. ? 2019 AANS.","cosmetic; adult; aged; American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; female; follow up; human; kyphosis; male; middle aged; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteotomy; Oswestry Disability Index; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; post tuberculous kyphotic deformity; preoperative period; proximal adjacent segment degeneration; retrospective study; sagittal vertical axis; spinal cord atrophy; spinal cord decompression; spine malformation; spine radiography; treatment planning; x-ray computed tomography"
"Role of Obesity in Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases",2019,"Purpose of Review: Obesity is a major public health problem associated with various diseases. Improving obesity control and achieving greater patient satisfaction are critical unmet needs. Various otorhinolaryngologic diseases can have negative effects on quality of life or actual health status depending on their type. Over the past decade, the relationship between obesity and otorhinolaryngologic conditions has been investigated. The purpose of this review was to discuss the relationship between obesity and otorhinolaryngological diseases. Recent Findings: This is a narrative review on the current state of incidence, effects, and associated mechanisms between obesity and otorhinolaryngologic diseases. In various otologic diseases, otitis media (OM) and hearing loss (HL) are associated with obesity. In rhinologic parts, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were significantly associated with obesity. Most of these diseases are reported to have higher susceptibility and severity as body mass index (BMI) increases. However, the incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC) was inversely associated with obesity, especially central adiposity. The relevance of obesity in laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPR) and allergic rhinitis (AR) has yet to be clarified, and this remains controversial. Summary: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of incidence, effects, and associated mechanisms between obesity and otorhinolaryngologic diseases. Various otorhinolaryngological diseases are related to obesity. As obesity can be a negative risk factor in these otorhinolaryngologic diseases, early diagnosis and treatment of these diseases in obese patients will be critical. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","allergic rhinitis; body mass; chronic rhinosinusitis; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; ear nose throat disease; head and neck cancer; hearing impairment; human; laryngopharyngeal reflux; morbidity; obesity; otitis media; pathophysiology; Review; risk factor; sleep disordered breathing"

"Serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of invasive and noninvasive streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in korea between 2014 and 2016",2019,"Background: Several factors contribute to differences in Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype distribution. We investigated the serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae isolated between 2014 and 2016 in Korea. Methods: We collected a total of 1,855 S. pneumoniae isolates from 44 hospitals between May 2014 and May 2016, and analyzed the serotypes by sequential multiplex PCR. We investigated the distribution of each serotype by patient age, source of the clinical specimen, and antimicrobial resistance pattern. Results: The most common serotypes were 11A (10.1%), followed by 19A (8.8%), 3 (8.5%), 34 (8.1%), 23A (7.3%), and 35B (6.2%). The major invasive serotypes were 3 (12.6%), 19A (7.8%), 34 (7.8%), 10A (6.8%), and 11A (6.8%). Serotypes 10A, 15B, 19A, and 12F were more common in patients ?5 years old, while serotype 3 was more common in patients ?65 years old compared with the other age groups. The coverage rates of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)7, PCV10, PCV13, and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 were 11.8%, 12.12%, 33.3%, and 53.6%, respectively. Of the 1,855 isolates, 857 (46.2%) were multi-drug resistant (MDR), with serotypes 11A and 19A predominant among the MDR strains. The resistance rates against penicillin, cefotaxime, and levofloxacin were 22.8%, 12.5%, and 9.4%, respectively. Conclusions: There were significant changes in the major S. pneumoniae serotypes in the community. Non-PCV13 serotypes increased in patients ?5 years old following the introduction of national immunization programs with the 10- A nd 13-polyvalent vaccines. ? 2019 Seoul National University, Institute for Cognitive Science.

"Long-term natural history of a neuromuscular choristoma of the sciatic nerve: a case report and literature review",2019,"Neuromuscular choristomas are rare tumors with mature skeletal muscle elements admixed with neural elements. Follow-up results are limited, the natural history of neuromuscular choristomas is poorly understood. To date, 14 cases of sciatic nerve neuromuscular choristomas have been reported, but follow-up results were provided only for 10 cases (median duration: 2 years). The natural history of neuromuscular choristomas is therefore poorly understood due to lack of longitudinal data. We describe a case with long-term natural history for 17 years of the disease and provide a literature review of the reported cases. A 6 year old girl, with a 6 year history of left buttock mass with neonatal pathologic diagnosis of neuromusculoar choristoma, presented with intermittent left lower extremity weakness in July 2006. She had a left buttock mass for 6 years, and the neonatal pathologic diagnosis was neuromuscular choristoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed fusiform enlargement of the left sciatic nerve with mild enhancement similar to that of the muscle. The pathology of a re-biopsy sample was also consistent with neuromuscular. choristoma. In follow up, the mass increased slightly, but MRI findings remained consistent, and her condition remained stable for 11 years after re-biopsy. Aggressive fibrosis known as complication by manipulation of neuromuscular choristoma was also not developed. The patient has been followed up for a total of 17 years and this is the only case of long-term natural history of neuromuscular choristoma. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Biopsy; Muscle; Pathology; Tumors; Literature reviews; Longitudinal data; Lower extremity; Natural history; Neuromuscular choristoma; Pathologic diagnosis; Sciatic nerves; Skeletal muscle; Magnetic resonance imaging; Article; case report; child; choristoma; clinical article; echography; female; follow up; gluteus maximus muscle; greater trochanter; histopathology; human; limb weakness; muscle atrophy; nerve tumor; neuromuscular choristoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient monitoring; postoperative period; preschool child; priority journal; sciatic nerve; surgical approach; tumor biopsy; tumor volume; biopsy; choristoma; disease exacerbation; hamartoma; hypertrophy; pathology; procedures; sciatic nerve; skeletal muscle; skin disease; Biopsy; Child; Choristoma; Disease Progression; Female; Hamartoma; Humans; Hypertrophy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Muscle, Skeletal; Sciatic Nerve; Skin Diseases"
"Effect of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and tertiary butyl alcohol on the performance of convection polymerase chain reaction",2019,"Rapid and on-site DNA-based molecular detection has become increasingly important for sensitive, specific, and timely detection and treatment of various diseases. To prepare and store biomolecule-containing reagents stably, reducing agents are used during protein preparation, and freeze-drying technology has been applied to the protein reagents. Some of the additives used during these processes may affect subsequent processes such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, we evaluated the impact of TCEP, a reducing agent, and TBA, a freeze-drying medium, on the performance of convection PCR (cPCR) using a battery-operable PCR device. Singleplex cPCR detection of a 249?bp amplicon from human genomic DNA suggested that approximately 82% of performance was achieved in the presence of 0.1?mM TCEP and 1% TBA. The limit of detection and the minimum number of cycles at which amplicons began to appear was a little lower (~ 82% efficiency) or higher (20 vs 15 cycles), respectively, in the chemical-treated group than in the control group. With larger amplicons of 500?bp, the chemical-treated group revealed approximately 78% of performance and amplicons started to appear at 20 cycles of cPCR in both groups. Similar results were obtained with multiplex cPCR amplification. ? 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","butanol; genomic DNA; tris(2 carboxyethyl)phosphine; phosphine derivative; tert butyl alcohol; tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; amplicon; Article; controlled study; freeze drying; human; human cell; limit of detection; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; polymerase chain reaction; HEK293 cell line; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; thermodynamics; Convection; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Limit of Detection; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Phosphines; Polymerase Chain Reaction; tert-Butyl Alcohol"
"Rubrofusarin-6-β-gentiobioside inhibits lipid accumulation and weight gain by regulating AMPK/mTOR signaling",2019,"Background: Although rubrofusarin-6-β-gentiobioside (RFG), which is a component of Cassiae tora seed, could likely regulate hyperlipidemia, its anti-obesity effect and related mechanism have not been elucidated. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine whether RFG can ameliorate obesity and the mechanism of lipid accumulation regulated by RFG. Study design: In in vitro experiments, we confirmed the anti-adipogenic effect of RFG using 3T3-L1 cells and human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). To confirm the anti-obesity effect, High-Fat Diet (HFD)-induced obese mice were selected as a model. Methods: We investigated anti-adipogenic effects of RFG using MTS assay, Oil Red O Staining, real-time RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence staining. The anti-obesity effect of RFG was confirmed in HFD-induced mice model using hematoxylin and eosin staining and serum analysis. Results: RFG inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and hAMSCs by reducing expression of mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α. RFG phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in a liver kinase B (LKB) 1-independent manner. Moreover, the anti-adipogenic effect of RFG was blocked by AMPK inhibitor. These results suggest that RFG inhibits lipid accumulation via AMPK signaling. Furthermore, RFG reduced the body weight, size of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and fatty liver in the mice. RFG also suppressed levels of adipogenic factors PPARγ, C/EBPα, FAS, LPL, and aP2) by activating AMPK in the eWAT and liver. Conclusion: RFG can ameliorate obesity, and thus, could be used as a therapeutic agent for treating obesity. ? 2019 The Authors","adenylate kinase; adiponectin; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; complementary DNA; creatinine; fat droplet; fatty acid; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; leptin; lipid; liver kinase beta; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; mammalian target of rapamycin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; rubrofusarin 6 beta gentiobioside; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; antiobesity agent; chromone derivative; glucoside; rubrofusarin gentiobioside; target of rapamycin kinase; adipogenesis; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiobesity activity; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body weight gain; controlled study; creatinine blood level; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid oxidation; fatty liver; glucose blood level; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipogenesis; male; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; triacylglycerol blood level; urea nitrogen blood level; Western blotting; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; adverse event; animal; body weight; body weight gain; drug effect; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mouse mutant; obesity; physiology; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Weight; Chromones; Diet, High-Fat; Glucosides; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Obese; Obesity; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Weight Gain"
"Higher high density lipoprotein 2 (HDL2) to total HDL cholesterol ratio is associated with a lower risk for incident hypertension",2019,"Background: Recent studies have suggested that high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is inversely associated with the development of hypertension. We aimed to determine the association between different HDL cholesterol subclasses and risk of future hypertension. Methods: A total of 270 Japanese Americans (130 men, 140 women) without hypertension between the ages of 34 to 75 years were enrolled. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer, and average blood pressure was calculated. Incident hypertension was determined 5 to 6 and 10 to 11 years after enrollment. HDL2, HDL3, and total HDL cholesterol were measured at baseline. Results: During 10 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of hypertension was 28.1% (76/270). In univariate analysis, age, diabetes, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin resistance index, total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and visceral adipose tissue were significant predictors for incident hypertension. Among the HDL cholesterol subclass, HDL2 cholesterol was inversely associated with hypertension incidence, but both total and HDL3 cholesterol were not. In addition, HDL2/HDL cholesterol was inversely associated with future hypertension risk. In multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 2.31; P=0.001), systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.31 to 2.56; P<0.001), and HDL2/HDL cholesterol (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98; P=0.035), were associated with future development of hypertension. Conclusion: A higher proportion of HDL2 cholesterol among total HDL cholesterol predicted a lower risk for incident hypertension. However, concentrations of total HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol were not independent predictors of incident hypertension.

"Clonazepam for probable REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease: A randomized placebo-controlled trial",2019,"Background: Clonazepam is considered to be a first-line treatment for rapid eye movement sleep-related behavior disorder (RBD) in Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term efficacy and safety of clonazepam for the treatment of probable RBD (pRBD) in patients with PD. Methods: We conducted a four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of clonazepam (0.5 mg/day at bedtime) compared to a placebo for RBD symptoms in patients with PD. Patients aged 30 years or older who had a caregiver that could observe RBD symptoms were recruited between April 2015 and February 2016. The primary outcome was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI[sbnd]I) score at week four, and we compared scores between the clonazepam and placebo groups. Results: A total of 40 patients were enrolled, with 20 assigned to receive clonazepam and 20 to receive the placebo. The CGI-I score at four weeks indicated an improvement in RBD symptoms in both the clonazepam (median score [minimum, maximum] = 2 [1,5]) and placebo (3 [1,6]) groups, with no significant difference between the groups (p =.253). The secondary outcomes were not significantly different between the clonazepam and placebo groups. Conclusions: Both clonazepam and placebo tended toward improvement on pRBD symptoms in patients with PD. No firm conclusion on efficacy of clonazepam was drawn due to limitations in the study design. This study emphasized the importance of conducting future large-scale, randomized trials with better assessment tools and polysomnography to provide evidence for the benefit of clonazepam. ? 2019","clonazepam; placebo; adult; aged; Article; bedtime dosage; clinical article; Clinical Global Impression scale; controlled study; daytime somnolence; disease severity; dizziness; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; dyskinesia; female; follow up; human; male; outcome assessment; parallel design; parasomnia; Parkinson disease; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale"

TJ001 had significant cytotoxicity against DU145 but not PC3 and LNCaP cells and, similarly, TJ001 markedly AMPK phosphorylation only in DU145 cells. This was accompanied by the downregulation of phosphorylated-acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) proteolytic cleavage, thereby inhibiting its role as a transcription factor to induce lipid biosynthesis. When Oil Red O staining was performed, it is reflected in the reduction of lipid droplets (LDs). TJ001 also induced G1/S cell cycle arrest via a cell cycle inhibitor (CKI) p21WAF1/CIP1 upregulation. Although p53 proteins remained unchanged, both cyclin E and cyclin D1 were decreased. Moreover, TJ001 suppressed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Generally, the prolonged G1/S phase arrest accompanies apoptosis, but TJ001 failed to work as a trigger apoptosis in DU145 cells. We showed that mutant p53 proteins were required for the survival of DU145 cells. In presence of TJ001, inhibition of endogenous mutant p53 by RNAi led to cell viability reduction and induction of the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio. In addition, it induced apoptotic cell death in DU145 cells. At the cellular level, induction of PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9 cleavages was observed, and caspase-3 activity was increased in the p53 knockdown cells treated with TJ001. Taken together, we demonstrated that TJ001 inhibited cell growth in DU145 prostate cancer cells as indicated by blocking lipogenesis and induction in G1/S cell cycle arrest. In addition, we may provide an evidence that mutant p53 protein has potential role as an oncogenic action in DU145 cells. Collectively, the combination of mutant p53 targeting and TJ001 treatment resulted in decreased cell growth in DU145 cells. ? 2019 Sooyeon Kang et al.","adenylate kinase; antineoplastic agent; Chinese drug; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1; cyclin E; mammalian target of rapamycin; protein p53; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; taeeumjowi tang; unclassified drug; Article; cancer inhibition; cell viability; drug cytotoxicity; DU145 cell line; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; lipogenesis; prostate cancer; RNA interference; staining; upregulation"
"Nonsurgical treatments for patients with radicular pain from lumbosacral disc herniation",2019,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbosacral disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most frequent musculoskeletal diseases causative of sick leave in the workplace and morbidity in daily activities. Nonsurgical managements are considered as first line treatment before surgical treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is intended to provide physicians who treat patients diagnosed with LDH with a guideline supported by scientific evidence to assist in decision-making for appropriate and reasonable treatments. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A systematic review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Studies of human subjects written in Korean or English that met the following criteria were selected: patients aged ?18 years, clinical presentation of low back and radicular leg pain, diagnosis of LDH on radiological evaluation including computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Pain and functional evaluation scales such as visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, and Oswestry disability index METHODS: The MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Review, and KoreaMed databases were searched for articles regarding non-surgical treatments for LDH published up to July 2017. Of the studies fulfilling these criteria, those investigating clinical results after non-surgical treatment including physical and behavioral therapy, medication, and interventional treatment in terms of pain control and functional improvements were chosen for this study. RESULTS: Nonsurgical treatments were determined to be clinically effective with regards to pain reduction and functional improvement in patients with LDH. Nevertheless, the evidence level was generally not evaluated as high degree, which might be attributed to the paucity of well-designed randomized controlled trials. Exercise and traction were strongly recommended despite moderate level of evidence. Epidural injection was strongly recommended with high degree of evidence and transforaminal approach was more strongly recommended than caudal approach. CONCLUSIONS: This CPG provides new and updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of the patients with LDH, which suggested that, despite an absence of high degrees of evidence level, non-surgical treatments were clinically effective. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","antidepressant agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; bed rest; behavior therapy; clinical outcome; Cochrane Library; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; Embase; human; intervertebral disk hernia; lumbosacral spine; manipulative medicine; medical decision making; Medline; neuromodulation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; numeric rating scale; Oswestry Disability Index; practice guideline; priority journal; radicular pain; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; thermotherapy; visual analog scale"
"Age-related biophysical changes of the epidermal and dermal skin in Korean women",2019,"Introduction: The clinical characteristics of skin were investigated to study the inter-relationship and changes in the biophysical properties of the epidermal and dermal layers associated with aging using noninvasive methods. Methods: Our study included 100 healthy women aged between the early 20s and late 60s. Biophysical characteristics of skin such as color (brightness and spots), transparency, wrinkle on crow's feet, elasticity, hydration, sebum content, glossiness, and transepidermal water loss measured under controlled conditions. Results: This study performed in a Korean population demonstrated that aging significantly affects human skin in terms of parameters such as wrinkles, skin color, elasticity, and epidermal hydration. Age-related changes in skin hydration showed varying patterns between the epidermis and dermis. Skin color showed heterogeneous characteristics between the upper and lower epidermal layers associated with aging. Skin elasticity and wrinkles were observed to show and inversely proportional relationship in the early 40s. Conclusions: We confirmed the significant influence of aging on the biophysical properties of skin and determined the distinct age-related biophysical changes in the epidermal and dermal layers of skin using noninvasive method. This study indicates the need for further research to investigate the distinctive age-related changes in characteristics of the epidermal and dermal layers of human skin. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Neutralization of Acidic Intracellular Vesicles by Niclosamide Inhibits Multiple Steps of the Dengue Virus Life Cycle In Vitro",2019,"Dengue fever is one of the most important mosquito-borne viral infections in large parts of tropical and subtropical countries and is a significant public health concern and socioeconomic burden. There is an urgent need to develop antivirals that can effectively reduce dengue virus (DENV) replication and decrease viral load. Niclosamide, an antiparasitic drug approved for human use, has been recently identified as an effective antiviral agent against a number of pH-dependent viruses, including flaviviruses. Here, we reveal that neutralization of low-pH intracellular compartments by niclosamide affects multiple steps of the DENV infectious cycle. Specifically, niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization not only prevents viral RNA replication but also affects the maturation of DENV particles, rendering them non-infectious. We found that niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization prevented E glycoprotein conformational changes on the virion surface of flaviviruses, resulting in the release of non-infectious immature virus particles with uncleaved pr peptide from host cells. Collectively, our findings support the potential application of niclosamide as an antiviral agent against flavivirus infection and highlight a previously uncharacterized mechanism of action of the drug. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Additional effect of dietary fiber in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using metformin and sulfonylurea: An open-label, pilot trial",2019,"Background: Metformin, sulfonylurea, and dietary fiber are known to affect gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This open and single-arm pilot trial investigated the effects of the additional use of fiber on glycemic parameters, insulin, incretins, and microbiota in patients with T2DM who had been treated with metformin and sulfonylurea. Methods: Participants took fiber for 4 weeks and stopped for the next 4 weeks. Glycemic parameters, insulin, incretins during mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level, and fecal microbiota were analyzed at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The first tertile of difference in glucose area under the curve during MMTT between weeks 0 and 4 was defined as ‘responders’ and the third as ‘nonresponders,’ respectively. Results: In all 10 participants, the peak incretin levels during MMTT were higher and LPS were lower at week 4 as compared with at baseline. While the insulin sensitivity of the ‘responders’ increased at week 4, that of the ‘nonresponders’ showed opposite results. However, the results were not statistically significant. In all participants, metabolically unfavorable microbiota decreased at week 4 and were restored at week 8. At baseline, metabolically hostile bacteria were more abundant in the ‘nonresponders.’ In ‘responders,’ Roseburia intestinalis increased at week 4. Conclusion: While dietary fiber did not induce additional changes in glycemic parameters, it showed a trend of improvement in insulin sensitivity in ‘responders.’ Even if patients are already receiving diabetes treatment, the additional administration of fiber can lead to additional benefits in the treatment of diabetes.

"Patient Participation in Patient Safety and Its Relationships with Nurses' Patient-Centered Care Competency, Teamwork, and Safety Climate",2019,"Purpose: This study's aim was to examine degrees of patient participation in patient safety activities in hospitals and to investigate their relationships with nurses' patient-centered care competency (PCC), teamwork, and safety climate. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. Data were collected with 479 nurses from two general hospitals in Seoul, Korea, using a questionnaire designed to collect data on patient participation in patient safety activities, PCC, teamwork perceptions, and safety climate. The response rate was 74.1% (N = 355). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The mean score for patient participation was 2.76 ± 0.46 of 4.0. The mean scores for PCC, teamwork, and safety climate were 3.61 ± 0.46, 3.64 ± 0.41, and 3.35 ± 0.57 of 5.0, respectively. Nurses who experienced high patient participation in patient safety activities (? 3.0) had higher scores for PCC, teamwork, and safety climate. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that PCC (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.14–4.70) and safety climate (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.09–5.78) scores were the significant factors associated with patient participation. Conclusion: The degree of patient participation in patient safety activities was not high. Nurses' PCC, teamwork, and safety climate were positively related with patient participation. In particular, the findings indicate that enhancing nurses' competency for patient-centered care and creating a strong safety climate are important to promote patient participation for safer health care. ? 2019","adult; article; climate; cross-sectional study; drug safety; female; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; nurse; patient care; patient participation; patient safety; perception; questionnaire; South Korea; statistics; teamwork; clinical competence; middle aged; nursing care; organizational culture; procedures; young adult; Adult; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Care; Organizational Culture; Patient Care Team; Patient Participation; Patient Safety; Patient-Centered Care; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Very high high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with increased all-cause mortality in South Koreans",2019,"Background and aims: Our study aimed to investigate the association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Korean adults. Methods: A total of 365,457 participants aged ?40 years were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort from 2009 to 2015. HDL-C level was categorized into <1.0, 1.0–1.19, 1.2–1.39, 1.4–1.59, 1.6–1.79 (reference), 1.8–1.99, 2.0–2.19 and ? 2.20 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between HDL-C level and mortality risk. Results: In a median 3.5-year follow-up period, 9,350 participants (2.6%) died. Men with HDL-C level of 1.6–1.79 mmol/L and women with HDL-C level of 1.4–1.59 mmol/L had the lowest age-standardized mortality rates for all-cause death. However, for cardiovascular death, men with HDL-C level ?2.20 mmol/L and women with HDL-C level of 1.8–1.99 mmol/L showed the lowest mortality rate. After adjusting for multiple covariates, the hazard ratios for all-cause and cancer deaths showed a U-shaped relationship with HDL-C level for both sexes. However, there were heterogenetic associations between HDL-C level and mortality risk of subtypes of cardiovascular disease by sex. For other causes of death except for cardiovascular and cancer death, elevated mortality risk was mainly due to external causes (ICD-10 code, S00-T98). Conclusions: In South Korea, very high HDL-C level was associated with increased risk of all-cause death. However, the increased all-cause mortality risk in people with very high HDL-C level was partly due to mortality risk from external causes. ? 2019 The Author(s)","glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; age; alcohol consumption; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; brain ischemia; cancer mortality; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol blood level; coronary artery disease; diastolic blood pressure; female; follow up; glucose blood level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; male; medical history; middle aged; mortality rate; mortality risk; priority journal; risk assessment; sex difference; South Korean; systolic blood pressure; triacylglycerol level; waist circumference"
"Public perception of fine dust: A comparative research of participation motives in outdoor physical activities depending on fine dust concentration",2019,"Since the concentration of fine dust concentration in the atmosphere is rapidly increasing, recently to severe levels, and it has a fatal effect on human health, a change in people's awareness of outdoor physical activities is necessary. Nevertheless, people still take part in outdoor physical activities, even on days when a fine dust risk alert is issued, which shows that people's awareness of the danger of fine dust to their health is still lacking. This study used 341 surveys that was conducted to analyze and compare people's motives for participation in physical activities in relation to the fine dust level. After an exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis using SPSS 23.0, the level of fine dust concentration in the atmosphere was divided into ""dangerous"" and ""normal,"" while the respondents to the survey were divided into a ""with fine dust group"" and a ""without fine dust group."" People's participation motives were compared and analyzed by using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). People who participated in outdoor physical activities on days with a severe fine dust concentration showed higher scores for the motives of Competition, Appearance, Physical Condition, and Mastery, while those who participate in outdoor physical activities on days without a find dust alert showed higher scores for the motive of Psychological Condition. Countermeasures against the danger of fine dust that are more effective should be established by analyzing the motives of people who participate in outdoor physical activities despite the dangerous level of fine dust concentration in the atmosphere. ? 2019 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

"Design, synthesis and cytotoxicity of chimeric erlotinib-alkylphospholipid hybrids",2019,"Two series of erlotinib-alkylphospholipid hybrids were prepared and evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against a panel of four cell lines representing lung, breast, liver and skin cancers using erlotinib and miltefosine as reference standards. Amide analogs elicited more enhanced cytotoxic activity than analogous esters. Amide derivatives 8d and 8e exhibited promising broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity and higher efficacy than reference erlotinib and miltefosine. Their cellular GI 50 values was in the ranges of 24.7–46.9 μM and 26.8–43.1 μM for 8e and 8d respectively. Assay results of the inhibitory activity of the prepared compounds on EGFR kinase reaction and Akt phosphorylation in conjugation with statistical correlation analysis indicated that other mechanisms might contribute to their elicited cytotoxicities. In addition, statistical correlation analysis revealed that mechanisms of elicited cytotoxicities for amide series might be different from ester series. In addition, correlation analysis indicated variations in the mechanisms according to the types of cell line. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","2 (6 (4 (3 ethynylphenylamino) 6 methoxyquinazolin 7 yloxy) hexanamido) 3 (hexadecyloxy)propyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethylphosphate; 2 (6 (4 (3 ethynylphenylamino) 6 methoxyquinazolin 7 yloxy) hexanamido) 3 (octadecyloxy)propyl 2 (trimethylammonio)ethylphosphate; amide; antineoplastic agent; erlotinib; erlotinib alkylphospholipid hybrid; miltefosine; phospholipid derivative; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; phospholipid; protein kinase B; protein kinase inhibitor; A-431 cell line; A-549 cell line; antiproliferative activity; Article; correlation analysis; cytotoxicity; drug design; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug structure; drug synthesis; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; MCF-7 cell line; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; cell proliferation; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug effect; drug screening; metabolism; phosphorylation; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Design; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; ErbB Receptors; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Humans; Molecular Structure; Phospholipids; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Structure-Activity Relationship"
"Healed Culprit Plaques in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes",2019,"Background: Healed plaques, morphologically characterized by a layered phenotype, are frequently found in subjects with sudden cardiac death. However, in vivo data are lacking. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, morphological characteristics, and clinical significance of healed culprit plaques in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: A total of 376 ACS patients (252 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [MI] and 124 non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome) who had undergone pre-intervention OCT imaging of the culprit lesion were enrolled. Patients were stratified according to the presence of layered phenotype, defined as layers of different optical density at OCT. Clinical and laboratory data, OCT characteristics, and 1-year outcome were compared between the 2 groups. Results: Among 376 patients, 108 (28.7%) healed plaques were identified. Hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and history of MI were more frequent in patients with healed plaques (44.4% vs. 33.2%; p = 0.041; 35.2% vs. 23.5%; p = 0.021; and 15.7% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.009, respectively). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly higher in patients with healed plaques (median 4.98 mg/l [interquartile range: 1.00 to 11.32 mg/l] vs. 3.00 mg/l [interquartile range: 0.30 to 10.15 mg/l]; p = 0.029). Plaque rupture (64.8% vs. 53.0%; p = 0.039), thin cap fibroatheroma (56.5% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.016), and macrophage accumulation (81.1% vs. 63.4%; p = 0.001) were common in the layered group. OCT also revealed greater area stenosis in plaques with layered phenotype (79.2 ± 9.5% vs. 74.3 ± 14.3%; p = 0.001). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was similar between the 2 groups, except that the all-cause rehospitalization rate was higher among healed plaques (32.7% vs. 16.5%; p = 0.013). Conclusions: Healed plaques, a signature of prior plaque destabilization, were found at the culprit site in more than one-quarter of ACS patients. Such patients more frequently were diabetic, were hyperlipidemic, or had a history of MI. Healed plaques frequently showed OCT features of vulnerability with evidence of local and systemic inflammation. The combination of plaque vulnerability, local inflammation, and greater plaque burden in addition to systemic inflammation may outweigh the protective mechanism of plaque healing and predispose those plaques to develop occlusive thrombus. ? 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","C reactive protein; acute coronary syndrome; adult; Article; atheroma; atherosclerotic plaque; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; fibroatheroma; heart infarction; hospital readmission; human; hyperlipidemia; macrophage; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; medical history; morphology; optical coherence tomography; outcome assessment; phenotype; plaque rupture; prevalence; priority journal; protein blood level"
"Difference in psychological distress between patients with periodic limb movement disorder and restless legs syndrome",2019,"Background and Objective We used the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R) to compare the psychosomatic symptom profiles between periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients. Methods Twenty consecutive drug-na?ve RLS patients, 20 age- and sex-matched patients with PLMD and healthy controls were enrolled. Questionnaires evaluating sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Insomnia Severity Index), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), and psychosomatic symptoms (SCL-90-R) were administered. Polysomnography was performed in the patients with PLMD or RLS. Results The mean age of the subjects was 57.5 ± 10.9 years, and half of the subjects were male. Compared with the patients with RLS, the patients with PLMD exhibited a reduced total sleep time (276.6 ± 41.3 vs. 322.4 ± 42.9, p = 0.04) and a decreased proportion of REM sleep (12.5 ± 6.6 vs. 17.8 ± 7.8, p = 0.009). The patients with RLS exhibited higher SCL-90-R T-scores on the somatization (post hoc p < 0.001), obsessive-compulsive (post hoc p < 0.001), interpersonal sensitivity (post hoc p = 0.003), anxiety (post hoc p = 0.005), and psychoticism (post hoc p = 0.004) domains than the controls. Compared to the controls, the patients with PLMD exhibited higher SCL-90-R scores only in hostility (post hoc p = 0.016). Somatization in the RLS patients was significantly worse than that in the PLMD patients (post hoc p = 0.003). Conclusions The results of our study demonstrate that psychosomatic distress is greater in RLS patients and lesser in PLMD patients.

"Predictive factors for efficacy of AST-120 treatment in diabetic nephropathy: A prospective single-arm, open-label, multi-center study",2019,"Background: Removal of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate by AST-120 is known to improve renal function and delay the initiation of dialysis in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. However, it is unclear whether the addition of AST-120 to conventional treatments is effective in delaying the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Methods: A total of 100 patients with type 2 diabetes and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine levels ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL) were recruited from eight centers in Korea and treated with AST-120 (6 g/day) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was improvement in renal function measured as the gradient of the reciprocal serum creatinine level (1/sCr) over time (i.e., the ratio of 1/sCr time slope for post- to pre-AST-120 therapy). A response was defined as a ratio change of the regression coefficient of 1/sCr ? 0.90. Results: Renal function improved in 80.3% of patients (61/76) after 24 weeks of AST-120 treatment. There were no differences between responder and non-responder groups in baseline characteristics except for diastolic blood pressure (73.5 ± 9.5 mmHg in the responder group vs. 79.3 ± 11.1 mmHg in the non-responder group; P = 0.046). Serum lipid peroxidation level decreased significantly in the responder group (from 2.25 ± 0.56 μmol/L to 1.91 ± 0.72 μmol/L; P = 0.002) but not in the non-responder group. Conclusion: The addition of AST-120 to conventional treatments may delay the progression of renal dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy.

"Adjuvant chemotherapy in rectal cancer patients who achieved a pathological complete response after preoperative chemoradiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"This study evaluated the prognostic impact of ACT in patients who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR). Articles published from January 1990 to September 2018 were searched in EMBASE, PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) were extracted. Thirteen observational studies were included. There were four National Cancer Database studies with overlapping study periods, thus individual pooled analyses of four different datasets were conducted (n = 3,182, 3,330, 3,575, and 4,739 for pooled analysis sets including Dossa et al., Polanco et al., Xu et al., and Shahab et al., respectively). Although a trend toward improved OS with ACT was observed, statistical significance was not proven (P = 0.09, P = 0.03, P = 0.12, and P = 0.10, respectively). When we performed a stratified analysis comparing the results from single institution and multicenter studies, there was no significant prognostic benefit of ACT. Publication bias was not observed. Routine use of ACT in patients with a pCR could not be warranted from the present meta-analysis. Further study of individual patient data from randomized trials is needed to clarify the role of ACT. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Feasibility of totally extraperitoneal (TEP) laparoscopic hernia repair in elderly patients",2019,"Introduction: Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal peritoneal (TEP) repair has become increasingly popular since its introduction. The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and feasibility of TEP in elderly patients compared to that in younger patients. Methods: The clinical records of patients who received TEP hernia repair from August 2007 to September 2016 were reviewed. The patients were categorized into two groups: younger than 70 and 70?years or older. The patient demographics, operative time, estimated blood loss, rate of open conversion, complications, length of hospital stay, rate of readmission, rate of recurrence were compared. Results: A total of 425 cases were documented. 317 (74.6%) patients were younger than 70?years and 108 (25.4%) were 70?years or older. The mean ages were 51.6?years in the younger group and 75.3?years in the older group. Co-morbidities (34.0% vs 72.2%, p = 0.000) and ASA score III and IV (4.1% vs. 6.5%, p value = 0.000) were more common in the elderly group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the percentage of history of previous surgery in the lower abdominal region (23.9% vs 29.6%, p = 0.292), overall complications (7.2% vs 12.7%, p value = 0.177), and anesthesia-related complications (0% vs 1%, p value = 0.617). The operative time was similar between the two groups (54.3 vs 57.1 p = 0.220). The length of hospital stay (2.7 vs 3.0, p = 0.022) was longer in the elderly group. Conclusions: Laparoscopic TEP hernia repair can be performed safely in elderly patients without differences in perioperative complications and recurrence rate compared to that in a younger population despite a longer hospital stay. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","abdominal surgery; adult; aged; anesthesia; anesthesia complication; Article; comorbidity; controlled study; conversion to open surgery; demography; dysuria; feasibility study; female; geriatric patient; hernioplasty; hospital readmission; human; inguinal hernia; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical record review; operation duration; patient history of surgery; patient safety; peroperative complication; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; recurrence risk; recurrent disease; retrospective study; seroma; statistical significance; surgical technique; totally extraperitoneal hernia repair; treatment outcome; urine retention"

A total of 253 subjects were enrolled and randomized to either the GC1107 group or the control group. For immunogenicity assessment, blood samples were collected at baseline and 28 days after vaccination and antibody titer of diphtheria and tetanus were assessed. Results: The seroprotection rates of diphtheria and tetanus were 89.76% and 91.34%, respectively, in the GC1107 group, and 87.80% and 86.99% in the control group. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of the anti-diphtheria antibody increased after vaccination in both groups, showing no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.139). The anti-tetanus GMTs after vaccination also showed comparable increases in both groups, and showed no significant difference (P = 0.860). In the safety evaluation, solicited local adverse reactions occurred in 81.2% of the subjects in the GC1107 group and in 86.4% of the subjects in the control group. Solicited systemic adverse events occurred in 33.2% of the subjects in the GC1107 group and in 47.2% of the subjects in the control group, which did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: This phase III study demonstrated non-inferiority in immunogenicity and comparable safety of GC1107 compared with the control Td vaccine. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","bacterium antibody; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; adolescent; adult; blood; clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; human; immunology; male; middle aged; multicenter study; myalgia; phase 3 clinical trial; randomized controlled trial; tetanus; vaccination; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Antibodies, Bacterial; Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myalgia; Tetanus; Vaccination; Young Adult"

"Clinical characteristics and ophthalmologic findings of pituitary adenoma in Korean patients",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the clinical characteristics of and ophthalmic findings in Korean patients diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma. Methods: The medical records of 534 patients diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma at Kyung Hee University Hospital between January 2007 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Mean patient age was 47.9?±?16.2?years. The most common symptoms at the time of presentation were headache (26.2%) and visual disturbance (12.4%). The referral rate to the ophthalmology department was 18.44% and patients most often presented to the neurosurgery department. Optic chiasm compression was identified in 23.4% of patients (54.4% of patients referred to ophthalmology, 15.0% of patients not referred to ophthalmology). Normal visual field (57%) was the most common visual field feature followed by bitemporal hemianopsia (17.8%). Optic chiasmal compression without visual field defects was found in 36.1% of patients. Tumor volume was positively correlated with visual field pattern standard deviation (PSD, p?=?0.020) and best-corrected logMAR visual acuity (p?=?0.000) and negatively associated with tumor volume and visual field mean deviation (MD, p?=?0.000). Best-corrected visual acuity (p?=?0.000), MD (p?=?0.001), and PSD (p?=?0.028) significantly improved after surgery. Conclusions: Pituitary adenoma patients do not always have ocular symptoms at their first presentation, even when optic chiasm compression and visual field deficits are present. Therefore, collaboration with an ophthalmologist is important when evaluating pituitary adenoma patients. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","adolescent; adult; aged; best corrected visual acuity; child; clinical feature; controlled study; female; functional status; headache; hemianopia; human; hypophysis adenoma; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; medical record review; ophthalmologist; optic chiasm compression; optic nerve disease; patient referral; retrospective study; Review; transsphenoidal hypophysectomy; tumor volume; university hospital; visual disorder; visual field defect; adenoma; complication; diagnostic imaging; eye disease; hypophysis tumor; incidence; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optic chiasm; optic disk; optical coherence tomography; physiology; South Korea; very elderly; visual acuity; visual field; young adult; Adenoma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Eye Diseases; Female; Humans; Incidence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Optic Chiasm; Optic Disk; Pituitary Neoplasms; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields; Young Adult"
"Focus on formononetin: Anticancer potential and molecular targets",2019,"Formononetin, an isoflavone, is extracted from various medicinal plants and herbs, including the red clover (Trifolium pratense) and Chinese medicinal plant Astragalus membranaceus. Formononetin’s antioxidant and neuroprotective effects underscore its therapeutic use against Alzheimer’s disease. Formononetin has been under intense investigation for the past decade as strong evidence on promoting apoptosis and against proliferation suggests for its use as an anticancer agent against diverse cancers. These anticancer properties are observed in multiple cancer cell models, including breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Formononetin also attenuates metastasis and tumor growth in various in vivo studies. The beneficial effects exuded by formononetin can be attributed to its antiproliferative and cell cycle arrest inducing properties. Formononetin regulates various transcription factors and growth-factor-mediated oncogenic pathways, consequently alleviating the possible causes of chronic inflammation that are linked to cancer survival of neoplastic cells and their resistance against chemotherapy. As such, this review summarizes and critically analyzes current evidence on the potential of formononetin for therapy of various malignancies with special emphasis on molecular targets. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"Association between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of metabolic syndrome determined using the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES)",2019,"Purpose: This study examined the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in middle-aged and older adults using data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Methods: A total of 5688 participants aged 40–69?years without MetS at baseline were recruited and followed for 8?years. Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed using a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire at baseline and after 4?years. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the risk of incident MetS and its components according to fruit and vegetable consumption. Results: A total of 2067 participants (1020 men and 1047 women) developed MetS during the 8-year follow-up period. Frequent fruit consumers (? 4 servings/day) had a lower risk of incident MetS than did rare consumers (< 1 serving/day) in both men and women (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.55, 95% CI 0.44–0.67, p < 0.0001 for men; HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.47–0.70, p for trend < 0.0001 for women) after adjusting for confounders. Frequent fruit consumption was inversely associated with incidence of abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevated blood pressure. Frequent vegetable consumption was inversely associated with a risk of hyperglycemia only in men (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44–0.96, p for trend = 0.0275), but no association was observed with risk of incident MetS. Conclusions: High fruit consumption was associated with a reduced risk of incident MetS and its components, whereas high vegetable consumption was associated with a reduced risk of incident hyperglycemia, but not with MetS in middle-aged and older adults. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Ginsenoside Rk1 ameliorates paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in mice through inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress, nitrative stress and apoptosis",2019,"Background: Frequent overdose of paracetamol (APAP) has become the major cause of acute liver injury. The present study was designed to evaluate the potential protective effects of ginsenoside Rk1 on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and investigate the underlying mechanisms for the first time. Methods: Mice were treated with Rk1 (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) by oral gavage once per d for 7 d. On the 7th d, all mice treated with 250 mg/kg APAP exhibited severe liver injury after 24 h, and hepatotoxicity was assessed. Results: Our results showed that pretreatment with Rk1 significantly decreased the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1β compared with the APAP group. Meanwhile, hepatic antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase and glutathione, were elevated compared with the APAP group. In contrast, a significant decrease in levels of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde was observed in the ginsenoside Rk1-treated group compared with the APAP group. These effects were associated with a significant increase of cytochrome P450 E1 and 4-hydroxynonenal levels in liver tissues. Moreover, ginsenoside Rk1 supplementation suppressed activation of apoptotic pathways by increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing Bax protein expression levels, which was shown using western blotting analysis. Histopathological observation also revealed that ginsenoside Rk1 pretreatment significantly reversed APAP-induced necrosis and inflammatory infiltration in liver tissues. Biological indicators of nitrative stress, such as 3-nitrotyrosine, were also inhibited after pretreatment with Rk1 compared with the APAP group. Conclusion: The results clearly suggest that the underlying molecular mechanisms in the hepatoprotection of ginsenoside Rk1 in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity may be due to its antioxidation, antiapoptosis, anti-inflammation, and antinitrative effects. ? 2018","4 hydroxynonenal; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 E1; ginsenoside; ginsenoside Rk 1; glutathione; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; liver protective agent; malonaldehyde; paracetamol; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; controlled study; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; injury severity; liver protection; male; mouse; nitrative stress; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression level; toxic hepatitis; TUNEL assay; Western blotting"
"Lactobacillus sakei Alleviates High-Fat-Diet-Induced Obesity and Anxiety in Mice by Inducing AMPK Activation and SIRT1 Expression and Inhibiting Gut Microbiota-Mediated NF-κB Activation",2019,"Scope: Long-term feeding of a high-fat diet (HFD) causes gastrointestinal inflammation and gut microbiota disturbance, leading to the increased occurrence of obesity and anxiety. In the present study, the effects of heat-labile Lactobacillus sakei OK67, tyndallized OK67 (tOK67), and heat-stable Lactobacillus sakei PK16 on HFD-induced obesity and anxiety in mice are examined. Methods and results: Obesity is induced in mice by feeding with HFD. Oral administration of live OK67, tOK67, or PK16 reduces HFD-induced body and liver weights and blood triglyceride, total cholesterol, corticosterone, and lipopolysaccharide levels. These treatments also suppress HFD-induced NF-κB activation and increased HFD-suppressed AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and SIRT-1 expression in the liver. OK67 or PK16 treatment alleviates HFD-induced anxiety-like behaviors and increases BDNF expression and NF-κB activation in the hippocampus. Moreover, OK67 or PK16 treatment suppresses HFD-induced colitis and suppresses the Proteobacteria population and fecal lipopolysaccharide levels in mice. OK67 or PK16 treatment inhibits NF-κB activation and induced AMPK activation and SIRT-1 expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Overall, the antiobesity and anxiolytic effects of live OK67 are more potent than those of tOK67. Conclusion: Lactobacillus sakei can alleviate HFD-induced obesity, colitis, and anxiety by regulating gut microbiota-mediated AMPK and NF-κB activation and SIRT-1 expression. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods: Twenty-eight boys and 27 girls with obesity (BMI ?95th percentile, 12-18 years) were randomly assigned to 3-month interventions (180 minutes per week) of AE or RE. Changes in total and regional fat and skeletal muscle distribution were assessed by a whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. Results: After controlling for corresponding baseline values, age, and race, changes in body weight, BMI, BMI z-score, and waist circumference were similar between exercise groups (p &gt; 0.05) and sexes (p &gt; 0.05). There were no sex or exercise group differences in the reductions in total fat, total SAT, visceral fat, or intermuscular fat. With AE, boys had greater (p &lt; 0.05) reductions in abdominal SAT as compared with girls. With RE, boys had greater (p &lt; 0.05) increases in total, upper body, and abdominal skeletal muscle as compared with girls. Independent of exercise modality, the improvement in VO 2max was greater (p &lt; 0.05) in boys than in girls. Independent of sex, the increase in muscular strength index was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the RE vs. AE group. Conclusion: With the exception of abdominal SAT, there were no sex or exercise treatment differences in the reductions in total and regional fat.

"Inhibitory activities of microalgal fucoxanthin against α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and glucose oxidase in 3T3-L1 cells linked to type 2 diabetes",2019,"Postprandial hyperglycemia is an early indication of type 2 diabetes and the target of many anti-diabetic and anti-obesity studies. α-Glucosidase and α-amylase are the crucial factors in regulating starch digestion and glucose absorption, making them key targets for many studies to treat postprandial hyperglycemia. We studied the inhibitory activities of microalgal fucoxanthin against rat-intestinal α-glucosidase and pancreatic α-amylase along with the antidiabetic effect to induce differentiation in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes using Oil Red-O staining. Fucoxanthin displayed strong hindrance activities toward α-amylase in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 0.68 mmol/L, whereas weak inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase, with an IC50 value of 4.75 mmol/L. Fucoxanthin also considerably elevated glucose oxidase activity in 3T3-L1 cells by 31.3% at 5 ?mol/L. During adipocyte differentiation, fucoxanthin showed lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells with no cytotoxicity up to 20 ?mol/L. However, fucoxanthin had no inhibitory activity on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. These results suggest that fucoxanthin might be useful for the prevention of obesity or diabetes by inhibiting carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes and lipid accumulation and be utilized as an ingredient for a functional food or dietary supplement. ? 2019, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Amino acid signatures of HLA Class-I and II molecules are strongly associated with SLE susceptibility and autoantibody production in Eastern Asians",2019,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a key genetic factor conferring risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but precise independent localization of HLA effects is extremely challenging. As a result, the contribution of specific HLA alleles and amino-acid residues to the overall risk of SLE and to risk of specific autoantibodies are far from completely understood. Here, we dissected (a) overall SLE association signals across HLA, (b) HLA-peptide interaction, and (c) residue-autoantibody association. Classical alleles, SNPs, and amino-acid residues of eight HLA genes were imputed across 4,915 SLE cases and 13,513 controls from Eastern Asia. We performed association followed by conditional analysis across HLA, assessing both overall SLE risk and risk of autoantibody production. DR15 alleles HLADRB1*15:01 (P = 1.4x10-27, odds ratio (OR) = 1.57) and HLA-DQB1*06:02 (P = 7.4x10-23, OR = 1.55) formed the most significant haplotype (OR = 2.33). Conditioned protein-residue signals were stronger than allele signals and mapped predominantly to HLA-DRB1 residue 13 (P = 2.2x10-75) and its proxy position 11 (P = 1.1x10-67), followed by HLA-DRB1-37 (P = 4.5x10-24). After conditioning on HLA-DRB1, novel associations at HLA-A-70 (P = 1.4x10-8), HLA-DPB1-35 (P = 9.0x10-16), HLA-DQB1-37 (P = 2.7x10-14), and HLA-B-9 (P = 6.5x10-15) emerged. Together, these seven residues increased the proportion of explained heritability due to HLA to 2.6%. Risk residues for both overall disease and hallmark autoantibodies (i.e., nRNP: DRB1-11, P = 2.0x10-14; DRB1-13, P = 2.9x10-13; DRB1-30, P = 3.9x10-14) localized to the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB1. Enrichment for specific amino-acid characteristics in the peptide-binding groove correlated with overall SLE risk and with autoantibody presence. Risk residues were in primarily negatively charged side-chains, in contrast with rheumatoid arthritis. We identified novel SLE signals in HLA Class I loci (HLA-A, HLA-B), and localized primary Class II signals to five residues in HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, and HLADQB1. These findings provide insights about the mechanisms by which the risk residues interact with each other to produce autoantibodies and are involved in SLE pathophysiology. ? 2019 Molineros et al.

"The Salmonella virulence protein MgtC promotes phosphate uptake inside macrophages",2019,"The MgtC virulence protein from the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica is required for its intramacrophage survival and virulence in mice and this requirement of MgtC is conserved in several intracellular pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite its critical role in survival within macrophages, only a few molecular targets of the MgtC protein have been identified. Here, we report that MgtC targets PhoR histidine kinase and activates phosphate transport independently of the available phosphate concentration. A single amino acid substitution in PhoR prevents its binding to MgtC, thus abrogating MgtC-mediated phosphate transport. Surprisingly, the removal of MgtC’s effect on the ability to transport phosphate renders Salmonella hypervirulent and decreases a non-replicating population inside macrophages, indicating that MgtC-mediated phosphate transport is required for normal Salmonella pathogenesis. This provides an example of a virulence protein directly activating a pathogen’s phosphate transport inside host. ? 2019, The Author(s).","ABC-type glycerol 3-phosphate transporter; adenylate cyclase; bacterial protein; beta galactosidase; messenger RNA; MgtC virulence protein; phosphate; protein histidine kinase; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; unclassified drug; virulence factor; bacterial protein; cation transport protein; MgtC protein, Salmonella typhimurium; PhoR protein, Bacteria; phosphate; amino acid; bacterium; cell; immune response; nutrient uptake; pathogenicity; phosphate; protein; rodent; virulence; amino acid substitution; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autophosphorylation; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; female; gene overexpression; heterologous expression; macrophage; membrane vesicle; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; phosphate transport; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein structure; protein targeting; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; salmonellosis; signal transduction; animal; C3H mouse; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; macrophage; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; transport at the cellular level; virulence; Mus; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Salmonella; Salmonella enterica; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Biological Transport; Cation Transport Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Humans; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Phosphates; Salmonella Infections; Salmonella typhimurium; Virulence"

However, studies related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) have not been investigated. Objective: The effects of L. cuneata aqueous extract (LCW) on testosterone-induced prostatic hyperplasia (TPH) were examined. Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats (10 weeks, 330–350 g) were randomly divided to 6 groups (n = 6): Control group; TPH group (3 mg/kg, s.c, daily); TPH + LCW (25, 50, 100 mg/kg); TPH + Finasteride 10 mg/kg for 6 weeks. At the end of treatment, histological change of prostate, serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level, mRNA expression of 5α-reductase, inflammatory factors, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in prostate were examined. Then, LCW was treated with BPH-1, a human BPH cell line, at 25, 50, 100 μg/mL for 24 h and examine mRNA level of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In addition, the content of vicenin-2 was analyzed. Results: LCW treatment of TPH inhibited serum DHT levels by 54.5, 51.2 and 54.1% and mRNA expression of 5α-reductase were inhibited 54.3, 61.3 and 73.6%, respectively. In addition, mRNA expression of inflammatory factors, PCNA and FGF-2 were decreased in the prostate of rats. Also, LCW attenuated mRNA level of AR and PSA in BPH-1 cell. The content of vicenin-2 in the LCW was analyzed to 0.89 mg/g.

"Diet control more intensively disturbs gut microbiota than genetic background in wild type and ob/ob mice",2019,"Changes in environmental and genetic factors are vital to development of obesity and its complications. Induction of obesity and type 2 diabetes by both leptin deficiency (ob/ob) and high fat diet (HFD) has been verified in animal models. In the present experiment, three types of diets (normal diet; ND, HFD and high sucrose diet; HSD) and two types of genetic mice (Wild type: WT and ob/ob) were used to explore the relationship among diet supplements, gut microbiota, host genetics and metabolic status. HFD increased the body, fat and liver weight of both ob/ob and WT mice, but HSD did not. HFD also resulted in dyslipidemia, as well as increased serum transaminases and fasting glucose in ob/ob mice but not in WT mice, while HSD did not. Moreover, HFD led to brain BDNF elevation in WT mice and reduction in ob/ob mice, whereas HSD did not. Both HFD and HSD had a greater influence on gut microbiota than host genotypes. In detail, both of HFD and HSD alteration elucidated the majority (?63%) of the whole structural variation in gut microbiota, however, host genetic mutation accounted for the minority (?11%). Overall, diets more intensively disturbed the structure of gut microbiota in excess of genetic change, particularly under leptin deficient conditions. Different responses of host genotypes may contribute to the development of metabolic disorder phenotypes linked with gut microbiota alterations. ? 2019 Wang, Shin, Lim, Im, Song, Nam and Kim.","aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biochemical analysis; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; diet; dietary supplement; dyslipidemia; environmental factor; food intake; gene mutation; genetic analysis; glucose blood level; heredity; intestine flora; leptin deficiency; lipid diet; liver weight; male; metabolic disorder; metabolism; metagenomics; mouse; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; phylogeny; Western blotting"
"Complementary and alternative medicine research in practice-based research networks: A critical review",2019,"Aims: To provide a critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature reporting research from practice-based research networks (PBRNs) relating to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Methods: A comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed literature reporting PBRN research focusing upon CAM was conducted in PubMed, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL from their inceptions to June 2017. PBRN registry and websites of relevant PBRNs were also searched for further information. With regards to the nested PBRN studies included in our review, no study design restrictions were imposed and both empirical research and relevant methodologically-focused manuscripts were included. Methodological quality was evaluated via a number of established tools. Results: A total of 51 articles reporting upon CAM research in PBRNs including six articles outlining CAM-focused PBRN establishment were included in the review. The findings of the literature were categorised as either: health services research (including work examining characteristics of patients and practices, doctor-patient communication, and CAM prevalence); effectiveness/safety research; or feasibility research. While 19 studies from non-CAM focused PBRNs tended to report on CAM prevalence and doctor-patient communication about CAM use, 26 articles from CAM-focused PBRNs reported on the characteristics of CAM users, practice patterns, and effectiveness/safety of CAM practice. Discussion and conclusion: PBRNs - both CAM-focused and non-CAM focused - have provided a useful platform for research investigations around a number of core CAM-related issues. Given the increasing popularity of CAM use in healthcare and the identified benefits of practice-relevant research, further in-depth CAM research nested within PBRN designs is warranted. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; alternative medicine; Cinahl; drug safety; Embase; empirical research; feasibility study; female; health services research; human; male; Medline; prevalence; publication; review; systematic review; alternative medicine; doctor patient relationship; interpersonal communication; statistics and numerical data; Communication; Complementary Therapies; Humans; Physician-Patient Relations"
"Nanomaterial-based electrochemical sensors for the detection of neurochemicals in biological matrices",2019,"Neurochemicals such as dopamine, glutamate, GABA, adenosine, and serotonin are efficient indicators for quantifying the dynamics of many brain disorders. Both in vivo and in vitro detection strategies for those neurochemicals are important in treating various human diseases. Along with common, conventional tools (e.g., microelectrodes, biosensors, spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared, Raman, chromatography, fluorescence, flow injection, and capillary electrophoresis), electrochemical sensors based on nanomaterials (NMs; e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes, molecular imprinted polymers, metal organic frameworks, and metallic nanoparticles) have emerged as potent tools for the quantitation of neurochemicals due to their robust designs, selectivity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy. The performance of the latter varies widely because of differences in their sensing efficiencies. This review provides a brief introduction to those electrochemical sensors with a detailed overview of the latest trends, limitations of NM-based sensing techniques, and the potential for their future expansion for various neurochemicals. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amines; Capillary electrophoresis; Crystalline materials; Metal nanoparticles; Microelectrodes; Nanostructured materials; Neurophysiology; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Yarn; Biological matrixes; Dopamine; Fourier transform infra reds; Metal organic framework; Metallic nanoparticles; Molecular imprinted polymers; Molecularly Imprinted Polymer; Neurochemicals; Electrochemical sensors; 4 aminobutyric acid; acetylcholine; adenosine; adenosine phosphate; carbon monoxide; carbon nanotube; cholecystokinin; dopamine; endorphin; epinephrine; glutamic acid; glycine; graphene; graphene oxide; histamine; hydrocortisone; insulin; levodopa; metal nanoparticle; metal organic framework; molecularly imprinted polymer; nitric oxide; noradrenalin; oxytocin; serotonin; testosterone; tryptophan; tyramine; unindexed drug; vasopressin; capillary electrophoresis; chemical analysis; chromatography; electrochemical analysis; flow rate; fluorescence analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; human; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; physical chemistry; physical parameters; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; Review; sensitivity and specificity; spectrophotometry"
"Safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of olmutinib in non-small cell lung cancer with T790M mutation: A single arm, open label, phase 1/2 trial",2019,"Objectives: The aim of this phase 1/2 study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of olmutinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had failed ? 1 previous line of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Materials and methods: Phase 1 consisted of dose-escalation and four dose-expansion parts (1: olmutinib 300 mg once daily; 2A: 800 mg once daily [EGFR T790 M mutation-positive patients]; 2B: 500 mg twice daily [EGFR T790 M mutation-positive]; 3: 800 mg once daily [EGFR T790 M mutation-negative]). In phase 2, EGFR T790 M mutation-positive patients received olmutinib 800 mg once daily. Data from expansion part 2A and phase 2 were integrated (‘pooled phase 2′). Each olmutinib cycle was 21 days. Outcomes included: tumor response, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), pharmacokinetic parameters. Results: Overall, 272 patients received at least one olmutinib dose: dose-escalation (n = 66), expansion parts (n = 165), phase 2 (n = 41). In pooled phase 2, the overall objective response rate, confirmed by independent review, was 55.1% (38/69 evaluable patients; 95% CI, 42.6–67.1). All responses were partial responses; 23 patients had stable disease. Estimated median progression-free survival was 6.9 (95% CI, 5.6–9.7) months; estimated median overall survival was not reached. The most frequent treatment-related AEs were diarrhea (59.2% of patients), pruritus (42.1%), rash (40.8%), and nausea (39.5%). Conclusion: Olmutinib showed effective clinical activity with a manageable safety profile, indicating therapeutic potential for T790M-positive NSCLC patients who have failed ? 1 previous line of EGFR-TKI therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; epidermal growth factor receptor; olmutinib; abdominal pain; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antineoplastic activity; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; brain metastasis; cancer survival; decreased appetite; diarrhea; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug response; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dry skin; epidermolysis; female; gastrointestinal disease; hand foot syndrome; human; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; overall survival; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; recommended drug dose; side effect; skin exfoliation; survival rate; treatment outcome; very elderly; vomiting"
"Bitter orange (citrus aurantium linn?) improves obesity by regulating adipogenesis and thermogenesis through AMPK activation",2019,"Obesity is a global health threat. Herein, we evaluated the underlying mechanism of antiobese features of bitter orange (Citrus aurantium Linn?, CA). Eight-week-administration of CA in high fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant decrease of body weight, adipose tissue weight and serum cholesterol. In further in vitro studies, we observed decreased lipid droplets in CA-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha indicated CA-inhibited adipogenesis. Moreover, CA-treated primary cultured brown adipocytes displayed increased differentiation associated with elevation of thermogenic factors including uncoupling protein 1 and PPARγ coactivator 1 alpha as well. The effects of CA in both adipocytes were abolished in AMPactivated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα)-suppressed environments, suggesting the anti-adipogenic and pro-thermogenic actions of CA were dependent on AMPKα pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest CA as a potential anti-obese agent which regulates adipogenesis and thermogenesis via AMPKα. ? 2019 by the author.

"PEGylated substance P augments therapeutic angiogenesis in diabetic critical limb ischemia",2019,"Substance P (SP) is a therapeutic peptide that has been widely used to induce angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. However, its therapeutic efficacy is often limited due to rapid degradation in vivo and a short half-life (?1 min) after systemic administration. In the present study, we chemically modified SP with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to generate long-lasting formulations with increased stability and extended retention time in vivo and evaluated their ability to enhance therapeutic angiogenesis. Compared to the unmodified SP, PEGylated SP (PEG-SP) exhibited significantly increased half-life in vivo (?360-fold increase in normal mouse and ?120-fold increase in diabetic mouse). Systemic injection of PEG-SP led to a marked increase in therapeutic efficacy and angiogenesis in diabetic hindlimb ischemia, as evident from the remarkable improvement in salvage of ischemic limb and recovery of blood perfusion in diabetic mice with limb ischemia. These formulations increased endogenous stem cell mobilization to the injured site and modulated the immune system to increase microvessel formation and reduce systemic inflammation. Importantly, PEGylation efficiently reduced the injection doses of SP while still maintaining its therapeutic efficacy. To conclude, our study demonstrated that PEG-SP formulations exhibited an improved in vivo pharmacokinetic profile with enhanced efficacy and clinically acceptable treatment regimens, thus acting as a potent therapeutic for diabetic ischemia and inflammation. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","Mammals; Pathology; Stem cells; Diabetic limb ischemia; Endogenous stem cells; PEgylation; Substance-P; Systemic administration; Systemic inflammation; Therapeutic angiogenesis; Therapeutic peptides; Tissue regeneration"
"Cannabidiol overcomes oxaliplatin resistance by enhancing NOS3- and SOD2-Induced autophagy in human colorectal cancer cells",2019,"Although oxaliplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic drug for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, patients often develop resistance to it. Therefore, a new strategy for CRC treatment is needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of cannabidiol (CBD), one of the components of the cannabis plant, in overcoming oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells. We established oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines, DLD-1 R and colo205 R, in CRC DLD-1 and colo205 cells. Autophagic cell death was induced when oxaliplatin-resistant cells were treated with both oxaliplatin and CBD. Additionally, phosphorylation of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) was increased in oxaliplatin-resistant cells compared to that in parent cells. Combined treatment with oxaliplatin and CBD reduced phospho-NOS3 levels and nitric oxide (NO) production and resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reducing the levels of superoxide dismutase 2, an antioxidant present in the mitochondria, causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, these results suggest that elevated phosphorylation of NOS3 is essential for oxaliplatin resistance. The combination of oxaliplatin and CBD decreased NOS3 phosphorylation, which resulted in autophagy, by inducing the overproduction of ROS through mitochondrial dysfunction, thus overcoming oxaliplatin resistance. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Clinicopathological characteristics of patients with pain after endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric epithelial neoplasm",2019,"Background: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely used for large superficial gastrointestinal tumors. Epigastric pain is a frequent complication of ESD. However, little is known about its incidence and associated factors. This study evaluated pain incidence and characteristics of patients with pain after gastric ESD. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected registry of clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic results of patients who underwent ESD for gastric adenoma or cancer from January 2010 to December 2015. A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain immediately after, and 2, 12, and 24?h after ESD. The primary outcome was the use of painkillers (VAS score > 4). Analyzed data included age, sex, pathology, specimen and tumor size, procedure time, and tumor location. Results: Of 1226 patients, 461 (36.4%) needed a painkiller at least once after ESD (pain group). Compared with the no pain group, the pain group had more females, less alcohol consumption, larger tumor and specimen size, and more antral lesions. In multivariate analysis, female sex (OR 1.559, 95% CI 1.217–1.996, p < 0.001), antral tumor location (OR 1.780, 95% CI 1.398–2.265, p < 0.001), and procedure time over 30?min (OR 1.443, 95% CI 1.130–1.842, p = 0.003) were predictive factors for pain. Conclusion: This study showed that a considerable number of patients needed one or more painkiller doses after gastric ESD. The factors affecting pain included sex, procedure time, and lesion location. Endoscopists should use preemptive or aggressive pain management in high-risk patients after ESD. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","cholinergic receptor blocking agent; epinephrine; esomeprazole; glycerol; indigo carmine; midazolam; pethidine; propofol; tramadol; abdominal pain; abdominal radiography; adult; alcohol consumption; analgesia; argon plasma coagulation; Article; carcinogenesis; clinical feature; endoscopic submucosal dissection; female; gastric epithelial neoplasm; high risk patient; human; incidence; loading drug dose; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nociception; outcome assessment; pain assessment; postoperative pain; priority journal; prospective study; repeated drug dose; retrospective study; stomach tumor; tumor localization; tumor volume; visual analog scale"
"The relationship between age-related hearing loss and cognitive disorder",2019,"Background: Although the rates of occurrence of age-related diseases, including presbycusis and cognitive disorders, have increased with an increase in the geriatric population, the relationship between these two conditions remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the association between presbycusis and cognitive disorder. Subjects and Methods: A retrospective review of patient medical records was conducted at a single tertiary university hospital. This study enrolled 399 patients aged ?65 years who were prescribed hearing aids for the chief complaint of hearing loss. For main outcomes and measures we used audiograms, the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). Results: Of the 399 patients who were prescribed hearing aids for presbycusis, 45 (11.3%) had dementia and 354 (88.7%) did not have dementia. When the cognitive disorder group was divided into mild (1-4) and severe (5-7) subgroups based on the GDS scores, the threshold of hearing loss was significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group (p < 0.05). The prevalence of dementia was significantly higher in patients with hearing loss for ?10 years than in patients with hearing loss for <10 years (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Presbycusis and cognitive disorder are correlated. More severe and prolonged hearing loss is associated with a higher prevalence of cognitive disorder. ? 2019 S.

"Procalcitonin as a prognostic marker for outcomes in post-cardiac arrest patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Aim: This study aimed to seek evidence for the usefulness of the procalcitonin as a prognostic blood biomarker for outcomes in post-cardiac arrest patients. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (search date: 8 January, 2019). Studies on patients who experienced return of spontaneous circulation, who had out of hospital cardiac arrest and had their level of procalcitonin measured and outcomes assessed at and after hospital discharge, were included. We additionally performed subgroup analyses for confounding factors affecting patients’ outcomes. To assess the risk of bias of each included study, the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool was used. Results: A total of 1065 patients from 10 studies were finally included. Elevated procalcitonin level during hospital admission (at 0–24 h) was associated with in-hospital mortality (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33–0.95, I 2 = 26%). The elevation of procalcitonin level (at 0–48 h) was also associated with poor neurologic outcomes (at 0–24 h, SMD 0.61; 95% CI 0.44–0.79, I 2 = 0%; at 24–48 h, SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.35–0.82, I 2 = 0%) as well as at 1–6 months (at 24–48 h, SMD 0.62; 95% CI 0.36–0.88, I 2 = 0%). Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggested that an elevated procalcitonin level measured at 0–48 h of post-cardiac arrest syndrome was associated with poor outcomes. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","procalcitonin; Cochrane Library; Embase; heart arrest; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospital mortality; human; Medline; meta analysis; out of hospital cardiac arrest; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; return of spontaneous circulation; Review; risk assessment; systematic review"
"Exposure to environmental pollutants and a marker of early kidney injury in the general population: Results of a nationally representative cross-sectional study based on the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) 2012–2014",2019,"Exposure to environmental pollutants may lead to early kidney injury, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This study investigated the early renal effects associated with exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and heavy metals using general Korean population data. We used data from the Second Korean National Environmental Health Survey (2012–2014). As exposure markers, the concentrations of EDCs, such as triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalate metabolites (DEHP, MnBP and MBzP), and heavy metals, such as cadmium, lead and mercury were analyzed. As an early kidney injury marker, the urinary concentration of β2-microglobulin (β2M) was measured. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between environmental pollutants and β2M. A total of 5489 people (male: 2538, female: 2951) aged 19 years and older were enrolled. The geometric mean (GM) concentration of β2M in the total population was 1.88 μg/g creatinine (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85–1.91). The β2M concentrations were significantly higher in cases of female, old age, low income, and presence of a history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. The GM concentrations of urinary TCS and cadmium were 1.16 μg/g creatinine (95% CI 1.11–1.21) and 0.57 μg/g creatinine (95% CI 0.57–0.59), respectively. TCS, DEHP, cadmium, lead, and mercury exposure was significantly positively related to urinary β2M in the multiple regression analysis. β2M levels increased significantly with increases in the cadmium, mercury, and lead levels (p for trend &lt;0.0001). The higher the DEHP, MnBP, and TCS concentrations, the higher the β2M level (p for trend &lt;0.01). Environmental pollutants exposure significantly increased urinary β2M levels in the general Korean population. To prevent the development of early kidney injury and CKD, it is important to reduce environmental pollutants exposure through regulatory measures, and cooperation between related bodies in both developing and developed countries. ? 2019","Cadmium; Endocrine disrupters; Heavy metals; Linear regression; Manganese compounds; Mercury (metal); Population statistics; Surveys; Chronic kidney disease; Cross-sectional study; Early kidney injury; End stage renal disease; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Environmental pollutants; Multiple linear regressions; Multiple regression analysis; Pollution; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; beta 2 microglobulin; biological marker; cadmium; creatinine; endocrine disruptor; lead; mercury; mono benzyl phthalate; mono(n butyl)phthalate; phthalic acid; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; triclosan; unclassified drug; biological marker; concentration (composition); endocrine disruptor; health care; health risk; health survey; heavy metal; injury; low income population; pollution exposure; adult; aged; Article; concentration (parameter); diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; female; health survey; human; hypertension; kidney injury; limit of detection; male; nephrotoxicity; pollutant; priority journal; analysis; environmental exposure; kidney; metabolism; pollutant; questionnaire; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Korea; Adult; Biomarkers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Kidney; Male; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Methotrexate-associated primary hepatic lymphoma and cranial neuropathy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis: A case report with clinical follow-up over a 7-year period",2019,"RATIONALE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows a variable clinical expression in patients. Articular disease is common manifestation, but patients may rarely present with extra-articular manifestation such as cranial neuropathy. Also, primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) has rarely been reported in patient treated with immunosuppressive drug such as methotrexate (MTX) for RA. We herein describe a case of cranial neuropathy and MTX-related PHL in a woman receiving MTX for RA. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 73-year-old women received MTX treatment for more than 5 years, presented with recurrent cranial neuropathies. During therapy of cranial neuropathies, liver enzyme levels were elevated. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed as RA by laboratory examination. A series of examinations had been launched to evaluate any possible cause of the extra-articular manifestation of the patient including ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance image (MRI) and positron emission tomography of the liver and MRI of the brain. Finally, the patient diagnosed as MTX-associated PHL and cranial neuropathy. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent 4-year MTX therapy for RA at first with prednisolone. After that, she had been treated with cyclophosphamide therapy for cranial neuropathy. The liver biopsy was performed for hepatic lesion. OUTCOMES: MTX was discontinued, but no improvement of PHL and elevated liver enzyme was observed during the 3 weeks. The patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy for 3 months and achieved complete remission including PHL and cranial neuronal lesion with symptom. No instances of relapse have occurred in 2 years of follow-up. LESSONS: The present case is the extremely rare case in which MTX-related PHL and cranial neuropathy were involved together in the RA patient. It is necessary to examine long-term follow up hepatic and neurologic examinations that patient had a long history of receiving MTX therapy for RA.","antirheumatic agent; methotrexate; aged; case report; complication; cranial neuropathy; female; follow up; human; liver tumor; lymphoma; pathology; recurrent disease; rheumatoid arthritis; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cranial Nerve Diseases; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lymphoma; Methotrexate; Recurrence"
"Clinical implications of coagulotoxic variations in Mamushi (Viperidae: Gloydius) snake venoms",2019,"Snake bite is currently one of the most neglected tropical diseases affecting much of the developing world. Asian pit vipers are responsible for a considerable amount of envenomations annually and bites can cause a multitude of clinical complications resulting from coagulopathic and neuropathic effects. While intense research has been undertaken for some species of Asian pit viper, functional coagulopathic effects have been neglected for others. We investigated their effects upon the human clotting cascade using venoms of four species of Gloydius and Ovophis okinavensis, a species closely to Gloydius. All species of included within this investigation displayed varying fibrinogenolytic effects, resulting in a net anticoagulant outcome. Gloydius saxatilis and Gloydius ussuriensis displayed the most variable effects from differing localities, sampled from Russia and Korea. As this Gloydius investigation includes some geographical variation, notable results indicate key variations of these species that point to possible limitations in antivenom cross-reactivities, which may have implications for the clinical care of victims envenomed by these snakes. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","blood clotting factor 10a; serine proteinase; snake venom; thrombin; anticoagulant agent; mamushigin; snake venom; anticoagulation; Article; controlled study; drug activity; female; fibrinogenolytic activity; fibrinolysis; Gloydius; Gloydius saxatilis; Gloydius ussuriensis; male; nonhuman; priority journal; thromboelastography; animal; blood; blood clotting; human; metabolism; snakebite; Viperidae; Animals; Anticoagulants; Blood Coagulation; Crotalid Venoms; Humans; Snake Bites; Viperidae"
"Simultaneous determination of androgens and prostaglandins in human urine using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry",2019,"A simultaneous quantitative profiling method for androgens and prostaglandins using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated to evaluate urinary androgen and prostaglandin levels. Solid-phase extraction and liquid–liquid extraction steps were combined during the sample preparation. β-Glucuronidase/arylsulfatase was also used in the enzyme hydrolysis step. Chemical derivatization was performed using 2-hydrazinopyridine for simultaneous determination of androgen and prostaglandin in the same ionization mode. The analytes were all separated and measured using multiple reaction monitoring in the positive ion mode within a run time of 22 min. The method was validated, achieving overall recoveries ranging from 81.0 to 102.9% with limits of quantification ranging from 0.01 to 2 ng/mL. The intra-day accuracy and precision ranged from 6.5 to 14.3% and from 77.1 to 106.8%, respectively. The inter-day accuracy and precision ranged from 8.9 to 18.2% and 89.9 to 101.4%, respectively. The linearity was expressed using the correlation coefficient, which was >0.99. The method developed herein was used to investigate the effects of a one-year finasteride treatment through differences in urinary androgen and prostaglandin levels between treated male pattern baldness patients and normal controls. The urinary androgen and prostaglandin levels were not significantly different between the two groups because of the administration of finasteride. The results confirmed that finasteride affects androgens and PGs related to hair regrowth and growth length, and a one-year finasteride treatment is effective for MPB. The mass spectrometry-based quantitative profiling method used herein for the investigation of male pattern baldness also holds great potential for the evaluation of androgens and prostaglandins associated with the metabolism of various inflammatory diseases. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Extraction; High performance liquid chromatography; Lipids; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Patient treatment; Phase separation; Positive ions; Androgen; Derivatizations; Male pattern baldness; Metabolic profiling; Prostaglandin; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies; High pressure liquid chromatography; androgen; androstanolone; creatinine; epitestosterone; finasteride; prasterone; pregnenolone; prostaglandin; prostaglandin D2; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2 alpha; prostaglandin F2 beta; testosterone; unclassified drug; androgen; prostaglandin; Article; clinical article; controlled study; creatinine urine level; electrospray; hair growth; human; limit of quantitation; male; male type alopecia; multiple reaction monitoring; priority journal; tandem mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; urinalysis; adult; alopecia; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; statistical model; tandem mass spectrometry; urine; young adult; Adult; Alopecia; Androgens; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Finasteride; Humans; Limit of Detection; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prostaglandins; Reproducibility of Results; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Young Adult"

"Feasibility and effectiveness assessment of a mobile application for subhealth management: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Mibyeongbogam (MBBG) is a mobile application developed for subhealth status self-management in the Republic of Korea. It aims to assess a user's subhealth status, and then to recommend relevant traditional Korean medicine (TKM)-based health-promoting strategies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of MBBG's employment for the subhealth management of general healthy adults. METHODS: This is a prospective, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial that will seek to enroll 150 healthy adults, aged 30 to 49 years old, from 2 hospitals in the Republic of Korea. The eligible participants will then be randomly allocated to either the MBBG or control group, at a 1:1 allocation ratio. The MBBG group will use the application for 12 weeks, while the control group will undergo no intervention. The awareness of subhealth status will be primarily assessed. Health promoting behaviors, quality of life, TKM-based health questionnaires, and physical examination results will be assessed as secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: The primary endpoint will be tested with a 2-sample t test, or a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Any other continuous variables will be tested via an analysis of covariance, while categorical variables will be tested by a Chi-squared or Fisher exact test. Repeated measure analysis of variance will be performed to explore any in-group differences. The results will be addressed with a 95% confidence interval. We expect that MBBG will be the 1st TKM-based mobile application to be feasible for primary care in subhealth management.

"Dietary patterns associated with sebum content, skin hydration and pH, and their sex-dependent differences in healthy Korean adults",2019,"Sebum content, skin hydration and acidic skin pH are major factors in maintaining skin health. Various nutrients are reported to influence skin health, but the effect of dietary patterns (DPs) on skin health is unclear. In this study, we considered the DPs associated with these three skin health parameters in 84 healthy adults aged 19–37 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and skin health parameters were determined on the forehead of each subject. Among the four DPs extracted from the FFQ, DP2, characterized by a high intake of cereals, potatoes and starch, saccharides and fish and shellfish, was negatively associated with skin hydration. DP3, characterized by a high intake of potatoes and starch, seeds and nuts, fruits and eggs, was positively associated with acidic skin pH only before adjusting for potential confounders. On the other hand, DP4, characterized by a low intake of beans, and a high intake of meats, dairy products and beverages and alcohol, was negatively associated with acidic skin pH and positively associated with sebum content. The data stratified by sex revealed a negative association between skin hydration and DP2 in males and a negative association between sebum content and DP3 and a positive association between sebum content and DP4 in females. In conclusion, we demonstrated that specific DPs were associated with sebum content, skin hydration and pH in healthy Korean adults and that those associations were affected by sex. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Novel galiellalactone analogues can target stat3 phosphorylation and cause apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer",2019,"Aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been documented in various malignancies including triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). The STAT3 transcription factor can regulate the different important hallmarks of tumor cells, and thus, targeting it can be a potential strategy for treating TNBC, for which only limited therapeutic options are available. In this study, we analyzed the possible effect of (-)-galiellalactone and its novel analogues, SG-1709 and SG-1721, and determined whether these agents exerted their antineoplastic effects by suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway in TNBC cells. The two analogues, SG-1709 and SG-1721, inhibited both constitutive as well as inducible STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 more effectively than (-)-galiellalactone, which indicates that the analogues are more potent STAT3 blockers. Moreover, SG-1721 not only inhibited nuclear translocation and DNA binding of STAT3 but also induced apoptosis, and decreased expression of diverse oncogenic proteins. Interestingly, SG-1721 also exhibited an enhanced apoptotic effect when combined with radiotherapy. Furthermore, in vivo administration of SG-1721 significantly attenuated breast xenograft tumor growth via decreasing levels of p-STAT3. Therefore, SG-1721 may be a promising candidate for further application as a pharmacological agent that can target STAT3 protein in treating TNBC. ? 2019 by the authors.","antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; cyclin D1; cyclooxygenase 2; galiellalactone; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; interleukin 6; lactone derivative; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; protein inhibitor; sg 1709; sg 1721; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; galiellalactone; Janus kinase; lactone; STAT3 protein; tumor marker; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; breast radiotherapy; BT-20 cell line; BT-549 cell line; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer radiotherapy; cell cycle arrest; cell viability; controlled study; gene translocation; human; human cell; in vivo study; MCF-10A cell line; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-453 cell line; MDA-MB-468 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; protein DNA binding; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; SK-BR-3 cell line; T-47D cell line; triple negative breast cancer; tumor xenograft; animal; apoptosis; cell cycle checkpoint; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; female; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; phosphorylation; triple negative breast cancer; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Female; Humans; Janus Kinases; Lactones; Mice, Nude; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms"
"Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of human periodontal ligament stem cells by high-resolution mass spectrometry",2019,"Background and Objectives: Proteome analysis of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) could be used to study the function of PDL tissue. We used a label-free quantitative proteomic technique to investigate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs) compared to human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and identify proteins specific to hPDLSCs. Material and Methods: hPDLSCs (n?=?3) and hBMSCs (n?=?3) were cultured and harvested for protein extraction and trypsin digestion. The proteomes of both cell types were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. DEPs in hPDLSCs compared to hBMSCs were detected by label-free quantification and evaluated through signal transduction pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis. Results: In total, 690 and 771 proteins were identified from hPDLSCs and hBMSCs, of which 561 proteins were in common and 124 DEPs were found between hPDLSCs and hBMSCs. Fifty-eight proteins were expressed at significantly higher levels in hPDLSCs, whereas 66 proteins were expressed at lower levels compared to hBMSCs. The more highly expressed proteins were associated with translation and initiating protein synthesis, and lower expressed proteins were related to cell aging and metabolic processes. Proteins unique to hPDLSCs and hBMSCs were associated with translation and metabolic processes, respectively. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate evidence of distinct differences in protein expression between hPDLSCs and hBMSCs by using label-free quantitative proteomic analysis which was the first attempt in this field. DEPs included previously reported hPDLSC marker proteins and novel marker candidates, such as microtubule-associated protein, CTP synthase 1 and stathmin, which could be the markers for developing periodontal disease diagnostics and therapies. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Engineered beta-cyclodextrin-based carrier for targeted doxorubicin delivery in breast cancer therapy in vivo",2019,"In this study, we prepared a beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-based carrier consisting of β-CD, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and folic acid (FA) (CDPF) for improved doxorubicin (DOX) delivery to targeted breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. The morphology and size distribution were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, which revealed in particles ranging from 38 nm to 52 nm in size. DOX from CDPF was released in a sustained manner for 48 h. Cell viability analysis showed the low toxicity of free DOX, whereas CDPF-DOX remarkably exhibited reduced viability after incubation for 7 days. In vivo animal test showed that intravenous injection of CDPF-DOX contributes to decreased tumor volume, along with no systemic toxicity and cardiotoxicity. The results suggested that CDPF can maximize the efficacy of DOX delivery; therefore can be used as a good candidate for developing optimal drug delivery systems. ? 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","Controlled drug delivery; Cyclodextrins; Diseases; Dynamic light scattering; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Oncology; Organic acids; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylenes; Toxicity; Transmission electron microscopy; Beta-cyclodextrin; Breast Cancer; Doxorubicin; Drug delivery system; Folic acids; Intravenous injections; Morphology and size; Systemic toxicities; Targeted drug delivery"
"Herpes zoster involving the abducens and vagus nerves without typical skin rash: A case report and literature review",2019,"RATIONALE: Herpes zoster is characterized by unilateral vesicular eruption and it most often affects the trigeminal nerve. We would like to report a rare case of abducens and vagus nerves palsy caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) without the typical vesicular rash. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old woman presented with diplopia. Three days previously, she had experienced sore throat and hoarseness. DIAGNOSIS: At presentation, the prism cover test revealed esotropia of 10 prism diopters at primary gaze, and abduction was restricted in the right eye. No vesicular rash was observed on the patient's face, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no pathology. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed multiple ulcerations on the right side of the larynx-from the epiglottis to the arytenoid. After 1 day of hospitalization, a diffuse skin rash occurred on the patient's trunk, and polymerase chain reaction for VZV DNA was positive at the skin lesion. The patient was diagnosed as having herpes zoster associated with vagus and sixth nerve palsy. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES: She received famciclovir at a dose of 500?mg 3 times daily for 7 days and coadministered methylprednisolone. At the 4-month follow-up, her diplopia and eye movement had resolved completely. LESSONS: In patients with abducens nerve palsy without typical vesicular lesion, herpes zoster may not be detected early. In that case, systemic examination is very important for diagnosing herpes zoster.","abducens nerve; abducens nerve disease; aged; case report; complication; differential diagnosis; female; herpes zoster; human; vagus nerve; Abducens Nerve; Abducens Nerve Diseases; Aged; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Herpes Zoster; Humans; Vagus Nerve"
"Spirulina supplementation in a mouse model of diet-induced liver fibrosis reduced the pro-inflammatory response of splenocytes",2019,"Treatment of liver fibrosis is very limited as there is currently no effective anti-fibrotic therapy. Spirulina platensis (SP) is a blue-green alga that is widely supplemented in healthy foods. The objective of this study was to determine whether SP supplementation can prevent obesity-induced liver fibrosis in vivo. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a low-fat or a high-fat (HF)/high-sucrose/high-cholesterol diet or an HF diet supplemented with 2·5 % SP (w/w) (HF/SP) for 16 or 20 weeks. There were no significant differences in body weight, activity, energy expenditure, serum lipids or glucose tolerance between mice on HF and HF/SP diets. However, plasma alanine aminotransferase level was significantly reduced by SP at 16 weeks. Expression of fibrotic markers and trichrome stains showed no differences between HF and HF/SP. Splenocytes isolated from HF/SP fed mice had lower inflammatory gene expression and cytokine secretion compared with splenocytes from HF-fed mice. SP supplementation did not attenuate HF-induced liver fibrosis. However, the expression and secretion of inflammatory genes in splenocytes were significantly reduced by SP supplementation, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effects of SP in vivo. Although SP did not show appreciable effect on the prevention of liver fibrosis in this mouse model, it may be beneficial for other inflammatory conditions. ?

"A cell-penetrating peptide blocks Toll-like receptor-mediated downstream signaling and ameliorates autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in mice",2019,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen/damage-associated molecular patterns and initiate inflammatory signaling cascades. Occasionally, overexpression of TLRs leads to the onset of numerous inflammatory diseases, necessitating the development of selective inhibitors to allow a protective yet balanced immune response. Here, we demonstrate that a novel peptide (TIP1) derived from Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein inhibited multiple TLR signaling pathways (MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent) in murine and human cell lines. TIP1 also inhibited NLRP3-mediated IL-1β secretion, as we validated at both the protein and mRNA levels. Biophysical experiments confirmed that TIP1 specifically binds to the BB loop of the TLR4-TIR domain. Animal studies revealed that TIP1 inhibited the secretion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokines in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and kaolin/carrageenan-induced arthritis (K/C) rodent models. TIP1 also rescued animals from sepsis and from LPS-induced kidney/liver damage. Importantly, TIP1 ameliorated the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in CIA and K/C rodent models, suggesting that TIP1 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of TLR-mediated autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. ? 2019, The Author(s).","carrageenan; collagen; cryopyrin; interleukin 1beta; kaolin; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; myeloid differentiation factor 88; toll like receptor; toll like receptor antagonist; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arthritis; Article; autoimmune disease; cell line; controlled study; cytokine release; downstream processing; human; human cell; inflammatory disease; kidney injury; liver injury; male; monarthritis; mouse; nonhuman; protein binding; sepsis; signal transduction; validation process"
"Efficacy and Safety of Switching to Teneligliptin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled with Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors: A 12-Week Interim Report",2019,"Introduction: Teneligliptin, an antidiabetic agent classified as a class III dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, has a unique structural feature that provides strong binding to DPP-4 enzymes. We investigated the efficacy and safety of switching patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who had inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of other DPP-4 inhibitors to teneligliptin. Methods: Patients with T2DM whose glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were ? 7% despite taking DPP-4 inhibitors other than teneligliptin, with or without other hypoglycemic agents, for at least 3?months were enrolled. The DPP-4 inhibitors taken before participating in the study were switched to 20?mg qd teneligliptin, and this was to be maintained for 52?weeks. The primary end point was the change in HbA1c levels after 12?weeks. Metabolic parameters including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and blood lipids were assessed also. To assess safety, adverse and hypoglycemic events were monitored. The data from baseline to week 12 were used for analysis in this interim report. Results: The mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to week 12 was ? 0.44%. At week 12, the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0% was 31.6% and that of achieving HbA1c < 6.5% was 11.4%, respectively. In 41.2% of patients, the HbA1c levels decreased by at least 0.5% at 12?weeks. The mean change in FPG levels from baseline to week 12 was ? 11.5?mg/dl. No severe hypoglycemia was reported. Conclusion: After switching to teneligliptin, HbA1c levels decreased significantly in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with other DPP-4 inhibitors.

"Acupuncture for symptoms management in Korean breast cancer survivors: a prospective pilot study",2019,"Background: There is an unmet need for effective treatment of the various treatment-related symptoms experienced by breast cancer survivors. These symptoms could be alleviated by acupuncture. Although several lines of evidence in Western countries suggest that acupuncture has a beneficial effect on symptoms in breast cancer survivors, few relevant studies have been conducted in Korean patients. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of acupuncture for a variety of treatment-related symptoms in Korean breast cancer survivors. Method: From October 2015 to March 2016, we recruited patients who had undergone treatment for breast cancer and subsequently reported symptoms, including aromatase inhibitor-related knee pain, vasomotor symptoms, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and post-mastectomy pain in the chest wall or shoulder. The women received 4 weeks of symptom-specific acupuncture followed by a further 4 weeks of follow-up to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture for this indication, and its impact on common and symptom-specific outcome variables. Results: Eight study participants were recruited over a period of 6 months, six of whom completed the planned acupuncture treatment and follow-up assessments. A total of 78 acupuncture sessions were performed. We found that acupuncture was feasible, with only six minor self-limiting acupuncture-related adverse events. Most of the women felt that they had benefitted from participation in the study. The preliminary analysis indicated improvement in common symptom-specific outcomes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that acupuncture is feasible, but low recruitment rates should be considered when considering future acupuncture research in Korean breast cancer survivors. Rigorous evaluation of this symptomatic treatment strategy is now needed in the Korean population. ?

"Healthcare IoT-Based Affective State Mining Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network",2019,"Human effects are complex phenomena, which are studied for pervasive healthcare and well-being. The legacy pen and paper-based affective state determination methods are limited in their scientific explanation of causes and effects. Therefore, due to advances in intelligence technology, researchers are trying to apply some advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to realize individuals' affective states. To recognize, realize, and predict a human's affective state, domain experts have studied facial expressions, speeches, social posts, neuroimages, and physiological signals. However, with the advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and wearable computing technology, on-body non-invasive medical sensor observations are an effective source for studying users' effects or emotions. Therefore, this paper proposes an IoMT-based emotion recognition system for affective state mining. Human psychophysiological observations are collected through electromyography (EMG), electro-dermal activity (EDA), and electrocardiogram (ECG) medical sensors and analyzed through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine the covert affective state. According to Russell's circumplex model of effects, the five basic emotional states, i.e., happy, relaxed, disgust, sad, and neutral, are considered for affective state mining. An experimental study is performed, and a benchmark dataset is used to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The higher classification accuracy of the primary affective states has justified the performance of the proposed method. ? 2013 IEEE.","Benchmarking; Convolution; Electrocardiography; Health care; Internet of things; Neural networks; Speech recognition; Wearable sensors; Affective Computing; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Determination methods; Emotion recognition; Facial Expressions; Pervasive healthcare; Physiological signals; Deep neural networks"
"High proportion of adult cases and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in type 1 diabetes mellitus population in Korea: A nationwide study",2019,"Background: The prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in all age groups and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with T1DM in Korea were estimated. Methods: The incidence and prevalence of T1DM between 2007 and 2013 were calculated using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) datasets of claims. Clinical characteristics and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in individuals with T1DM between 2009 and 2013 were determined using the database of NHIS preventive health checkups. Results: The prevalence of T1DM in Korea between 2007 and 2013 was 0.041% to 0.047%. The annual incidence rate of T1DM in Korea in 2007 to 2013 was 2.73 to 5.02/100,000 people. Although the incidence rate of typical T1DM was highest in teenagers, it remained steady in adults over 30 years of age. In contrast, the incidence rate of atypical T1DM in 2013 was higher in people aged 40 years or older than in younger age groups. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with T1DM was 51.65% to 55.06% between 2009 and 2013. Conclusion: T1DM may be more common in Korean adults than previously believed. Metabolic syndrome may be a frequent finding in individuals with T1DM in Korea.

"Prognostic impact of β-blocker dose after acute myocardial infarction",2019,"Background: The differential prognostic impact of β-blocker dose after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been under debate. The current study sought to compare clinical outcome after AMI according to β-blocker dose using the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institutes of Health (KAMIR-NIH). Methods and Results: Of the total population of 13,104 consecutive AMI patients enrolled in the KAMIR-NIH, the current study analyzed 11,909 patients. These patients were classified into 3 groups (no β-blocker; low-dose [<25% of target dose]; and high-dose [?25% of target dose]). The primary outcome was cardiac death at 1 year. Compared with the no β-blocker group, both the low-dose and high-dose groups had significantly lower risk of cardiac death (HR, 0.435; 95% CI: 0.363-0.521, P<0.001; HR, 0.519; 95% CI: 0.350-0.772, P=0.001, respectively). The risk of cardiac death, however, was similar between the high- and low-dose groups (HR, 1.194; 95% CI: 0.789-1.808, P=0.402). On multivariable adjustment and inverse probability weighted analysis, the result was the same. Conclusions: The use of β-blockers in post-AMI patients had significant survival benefit compared with no use of β-blockers. There was no significant additional benefit of high-dose β-blockers compared with low-dose β-blockers, however, in terms of 1-year risk of cardiac death. ? 2019, Japanese Circulation Society.","beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; bisoprolol; carvedilol; creatine kinase; metoprolol; nebivolol; troponin T; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cardiovascular risk; clinical outcome; diastolic blood pressure; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; electrocardiogram; female; follow up; heart death; heart failure; heart infarction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; middle aged; multicenter study; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; obesity; percutaneous coronary intervention; propensity score; prospective study; revascularization; sensitivity analysis; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; systolic blood pressure; death; heart infarction; mortality; national health organization; prognosis; register; South Korea; survival analysis; United States; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Aged; Death; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Prognosis; Registries; Republic of Korea; Survival Analysis; United States"
"Development of lactobacillus kimchicus DCY51T-mediated gold nanoparticles for delivery of ginsenoside compound K: In vitro photothermal effects and apoptosis detection in cancer cells",2019,"We report a non-covalent loading of ginsenoside compound K (CK) onto our previously reported gold nanoparticles (DCY51T-AuCKNps) through one-pot biosynthesis using a probiotic Lactobacillus kimchicus DCY51T isolated from Korean kimchi. The ginsenoside-loaded gold nanoparticles were characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques such as field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, elemental mapping, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Furthermore, drug loading was also determined by liquid chromatogra-phy–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). In addition, DCY51T-AuNps and DCY51T-AuCKNps were resistant to aggregation caused by pH variation or a high ionic strength environment. Cell-based study confirmed that DCY51T-AuCKNps exhibited slightly higher cytotoxicity compared to ginsenoside CK treatment in A549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and HT29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line). Upon laser treatment, DCY51T-AuCKNps showed enhanced cell apoptosis in A549, HT29 and AGS cells (human stomach gastric adenocarcinoma cell line) compared with only DCY51T-AuCKNps treated cells. In conclusion, this preliminary study identified that DCY51T-AuCKNps act as a potent photothermal therapy agents with synergistic chemotherapeutic effects for the treatment of cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Biochemistry; Cell culture; Cell death; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Drug delivery; Drug products; Dynamic light scattering; Electron diffraction; Fiber optic sensors; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gold compounds; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ionic strength; Mass spectrometry; Measurement theory; Metal nanoparticles; Probiotics; Synthesis (chemical); Targeted drug delivery; X ray powder diffraction; X rays; Anticancer activities; Colorectal adenocarcinoma; Field-emission transmission electron microscopies; Ginsenosides; Green synthesis; Human lung adenocarcinoma cells; Photothermal therapy; Selected area electron diffraction; Gold nanoparticles; ginsenoside; gold nanoparticle; drug carrier; ginsenoside; ginsenoside M1; gold; metal nanoparticle; A-549 cell line; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; electron diffraction; field emission; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gram positive bacterium; high resolution transmission electron microscopy; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; infrared radiation; ionic strength; kimchi; Lactobacillus kimchicus; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nonhuman; photon correlation spectroscopy; photothermal therapy; transmission electron microscopy; animal; chemistry; drug effect; Lactobacillus; luminescence; metabolism; mouse; particle size; phototherapy; temperature; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Carriers; Ginsenosides; Gold; Humans; Lactobacillus; Luminescent Measurements; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Particle Size; Phototherapy; Temperature"
"Selection of an appropriate empiric antibiotic regimen in hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis",2019,"Background: Empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO) should be initiated immediately in seriously ill patients and may be required in those with negative microbiological results. The aim of this study was to inform the appropriate selection of empiric antibiotic regimens for the treatment of suspected HVO by analyzing antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated bacteria from microbiologically proven HVO. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with microbiologically proven HVO in five tertiary-care hospitals over a 7-year period. The appropriateness of empiric antibiotic regimens was assessed based on the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of isolated bacteria. Results: In total, 358 cases of microbiologically proven HVO were identified. The main causative pathogens identified were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (33.5%), followed by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (24.9%), Enterobacteriaceae (19.3%), and Streptococcus species (11.7%). Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes accounted for only 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively, of the causative pathogens. Overall, 73.5% of isolated pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin plus rifampicin, 71.2% to levofloxacin plus clindamycin, and 64.5% to amoxicillin-clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin. The susceptibility to these oral combinations was lower in cases of healthcare-associated HVO (52.6%, 49.6%, and 37.6%, respectively) than in cases of community-acquired HVO (85.8%, 84.0%, and 80.4%, respectively). Vancomycin combined with ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime was similarly appropriate (susceptibility rates of 93.0%, 94.1%, 95.8%, and 95.8%, respectively). Conclusions: Based on our susceptibility data, vancomycin combined with a broad-spectrum cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone may be appropriate for empiric treatment of HVO. Fluoroquinolone-based oral combinations may be not appropriate due to frequent resistance to these agents, especially in cases of healthcare-associated HVO. ? 2019 Parketal.

"MACppred: A support vector machine-based meta-predictor for identification of anticancer peptides",2019,"Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are promising therapeutic agents for targeting and killing cancer cells. The accurate prediction of ACPs from given peptide sequences remains as an open problem in the field of immunoinformatics. Recently, machine learning algorithms have emerged as a promising tool for helping experimental scientists predict ACPs. However, the performance of existing methods still needs to be improved. In this study, we present a novel approach for the accurate prediction of ACPs, which involves the following two steps: (i)We applied a two-step feature selection protocol on seven feature encodings that cover various aspects of sequence information (composition-based, physicochemical properties and profiles) and obtained their corresponding optimal feature-based models. The resultant predicted probabilities of ACPs were further utilized as feature vectors. (ii) The predicted probability feature vectors were in turn used as an input to support vector machine to develop the final prediction model called mACPpred. Cross-validation analysis showed that the proposed predictor performs significantly better than individual feature encodings.

"Continuous autotrophic denitrification process for treating ammonium-rich leachate wastewater in bioelectrochemical denitrification system (BEDS)",2019,"The reduction of nitrogen compounds in aqueous solution is extremely important for sustainable management of ecosystem and human health. An autotrophic bioelectrochemical denitrification (BED) process was evaluated at various conditions for enhanced treatment of synthetic wastewater (SW) and ammonium-rich leachate. With SW, a decrease in hydraulic retention time (HRT: 41.6 to 8.3 h) resulted in a 370% increase in denitrification rate from 0.026 to 0.096 kg NO3 ?–N/m3. D. An increase in applied voltage (0.7 to 2 V) enhanced nitrate removal (81 to 97% removal), but coulombic efficiency decreased from 74% to 19%. With doubled cathode electrodes, the nitrate removal rate was doubled from 0.056 to 0.114 kg NO3 ?–N/m3. D. Moreover, leachate wastewater was successfully denitrified with the maximum removal rate of 0.121 kg NO3 ?–N/m3. D. These results point towards the practical potential for the combination of nitrification systems with BEDS for reduction of nitrogen for discharge purposes. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Denitrification; Electrodes; Leachate treatment; Nitrates; Wastewater treatment; Autotrophic denitrification process; Bio-electrochemical; Biocathodes; Coulombic efficiency; Hydraulic retention time; Leachates; Sustainable management; Synthetic waste water; Nitrogen removal; ammonia; nitrate; ammonium derivative; acclimatization; analytic method; Article; autotrophy; bioelectrochemical denitrification system; chemical procedures; denitrification; electric potential; electrochemistry; energy consumption; human; hydraulic retention time; leaching; nitrification; reactor operation; retention time; surface area; waste component removal; waste water; waste water management; autotrophy; bacterium; bioreactor; bioremediation; denitrification; electrochemical analysis; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; procedures; sewage; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Ammonium Compounds; Autotrophic Processes; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Electrochemical Techniques; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

"Measuring the economic burden of disease and injury in Korea, 2015",2019,"Background: Disease burden can be represented by health-related parameters such as disability-adjusted life years and economic burden. Economic burden is an important index, as it estimates the maximum possible cost reduction if a disease is prevented. This study aimed to determine the economic burden of 238 diseases and 22 injuries in Korea in 2015. Methods: Economic burden was estimated with a human resources approach from a social perspective, and direct and indirect costs were calculated from insurance claims data and a cause of death database. Direct costs were divided into medical costs (including hospital admission, outpatient visit, and medication use) and nonmedical costs (including transportation and caregiver costs). Indirect costs from lost productivity, either from the use of healthcare service or premature death, were analyzed. Results: In 2015, the estimated economic burden was USD 133.7 billion (direct: USD 65.5 billion, indirect: USD 68.2 billion). The total cost of communicable diseases was USD 16.0 billion (11.9%); non-communicable diseases, USD 92.3 billion (69.1%); and injuries, USD 25.4 billion (19.0%). Self-harm had the highest costs (USD 8.3 billion), followed by low back pain (LBP, USD 6.6 billion). For men, self-harm had the highest cost (USD 7.1 billion), while LBP was the leading cost (USD 3.7 billion) for women. Conclusion: A high percentage of Korea's total socioeconomic disease burden is due to chronic diseases; however, unnoticed conditions such as infectious diseases, injuries, and LBP are high in certain age groups and differ by gender, emphasizing the need for targeted social interventions to manage and prevent disease risk factors. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","adolescent; adult; aged; cause of death; child; cost of illness; economics; female; global disease burden; human; infant; male; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost of Illness; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Young Adult"
"Development of species-specific chloroplast markers for the authentication of Gynostemma pentaphyllum and their distribution in the Korean peninsula",2019,"Gynostemma pentaphyllum is a traditional oriental medicinal herb used as tea since ancient time. Among Gynostemma species, G. pentaphyllum has more active chemical components and better therapeutic effect. It is used to cure depression, diabetes, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, fatigue, immunity, cancer, and oxidative stress. Overexploitation of G. pentaphyllum for its medicinal benefits has been on a rise, due to which they are adulterated or mistakenly identified with other members of Gynostemma species. Hence, we used chloroplast universal regions such as ycf3, accD, petD, psbB and their polymorphism to distinguish G. pentaphyllum from other Gynostemma species. By using the species-specific primers derived from the above regions, we established a multiplex allele-specific PCR for the authentication of G. pentaphyllum from other species. Thus the PCR reaction produced unique amplicons of size 244 bp and 438 bp for G. pentaphyllum amplified by the primers flanking ycf3, and accD regions respectively. While a 607 bp, and 787 bp amplicons from the primers targeting psbB, and petD regions distinguished G. longipes, G. burmanicum, and G. pubescens species. Moreover, these primers were successful to analyze the dried tea samples of Gynostemma as well. Thus, the developed molecular markers could authenticate different Gynostemma species as well as its products thereby preventing the mistaken-identity of this medicinal herb. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","accd gene; amplicon; Article; chloroplast; chloroplast genome; DNA polymorphism; gene; Gynostemma; Gynostemma burmanicum; Gynostemma longipes; Gynostemma pentaphyllum; Gynostemma pubescens; haplotype; indel mutation; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; petd gene; phenotype; phylogeny; plant leaf; plant seed; priority journal; psbb gene; South Korea; species difference; ycf3 gene; chloroplast; chloroplast gene; classification; genetics; medicinal plant; nucleotide sequence; plant gene; quality control; species difference; biological marker; primer DNA; Base Sequence; Biomarkers; Chloroplasts; DNA Primers; Genes, Chloroplast; Genes, Plant; Gynostemma; Phylogeny; Plants, Medicinal; Quality Control; Republic of Korea; Species Specificity"
"Long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis continuing on an etanercept biosimilar (LBEC0101) or switching from reference etanercept to LBEC0101: An open-label extension of a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study",2019,"Background: To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of continuing LBEC0101; the etanercept (ETN) biosimilar; or switching from the ETN reference product (RP) to LBEC0101 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: This multicentre, single-arm, open-label extension study enrolled patients who had completed a 52-week randomised, double-blind, parallel phase III trial of LBEC0101 vs ETN-RP. Patients treated with ETN-RP during the randomised controlled trial switched to LBEC0101; those treated with LBEC0101 continued to receive LBEC0101 in this study. LBEC0101 (50 mg) was administered subcutaneously once per week for 48 weeks with a stable dose of methotrexate. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of LBEC0101 were assessed up to week 100. Results: A total of 148 patients entered this extension study (70 in the maintenance group and 78 in the switch group). The 28-joint disease activity scores (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were maintained in both groups from week 52 to week 100 (from 3.068 to 3.103 in the maintenance group vs. from 3.161 to 3.079 in the switch group). ACR response rates at week 100 for the maintenance vs. switch groups were 79.7% vs. 83.3% for ACR20, 65.2% vs. 66.7% for ACR50 and 44.9% vs. 42.3% for ACR70. The incidence of adverse events and the proportion of patients with newly developed antidrug antibodies were similar in the maintenance and switch groups (70.0% and 70.5%, 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively). Conclusions: Administration of LBEC0101 showed sustained efficacy and acceptable safety in patients with RA after continued therapy or after switching from ETN-RP to LBEC0101. ? 2019 The Author(s).","biosimilar agent; drug antibody; etanercept; lbec 0101; methotrexate; neutralizing antibody; unclassified drug; acute pyelonephritis; adult; arthralgia; Article; controlled study; coughing; DAS28; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; drug withdrawal; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; human; immunogenicity; injection site reaction; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; patient attitude; phase 3 clinical trial; randomized controlled trial; remission; respiratory tract infection; rheumatoid arthritis; rhinopharyngitis; upper respiratory tract infection"
"Gene expression profile of PM014 of immortalized mouse lung epithelial cells in response to the effect of PM014 on radiation-induced fibrosis",2019,"Radiotherapy is a major method for cancer treatment, but it frequently causes various side effects such as radiation-induced pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. Drugs to treat these side effects are urgently needed in the clinic, since there is no clearly defined medication for treating these symptoms. Previous studies demonstrated that the herbal formula, PM014, is effective for radiation-induced lung injury and fibrosis in mice. In this study, we investigated gene expression profiles to understand the mechanism of action behind the effects of PM014 on radiation induced damage in immortalized lung epithelial cells, MLE12. We performed QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq analysis on the mRNA from radiation treated MLE-12 cells in the presence and absence of PM014. Transcriptome analysis found that 217 genes were significantly affected by PM014. Among them (217 genes, > twofold, p value < 0.05, 4 normalize), 77 genes were found to be upregulated, and 140 genes were downregulated in response to PM014 treatment in a dose dependent manner. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, we found that genes involved in cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathways were the most strongly affected by PM014. Based on these data, we selected 20 genes, and performed real-time PCR. Expression of 11 genes, including IL-18, IL-12a, Tnfrsf9, IL-17, CCR5, Blnk, Irf8, Nrros, TGF-β, Relt, and Cxcl2 was increased after irradiation, while PM014 treatment showed the reversed expression pattern of these genes. Therefore, PM014 may be useful for the treatment of radiation induced lung injury by modulating genes involved in cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway. ? 2018, Institute of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","erythropoietin; interleukin 12p35; interleukin 18; messenger RNA; platelet derived growth factor; transcriptome; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; Blnk gene; carbon metabolism; CCR5 gene; Cxcl 2 gene; down regulation; fibrosis; gene; gene expression profiling; gene insertion; human; IL 17 gene; IL 2a gene; Irf8 gene; irradiation; lung epithelium; lung parenchyma; mouse; multigene family; nonhuman; Nrros gene; PDK1 gene; priority journal; protein interaction; radiation; radiation induced fibrosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Relt gene; RNA sequence; TGF beta gene; Tnfrsf9 gene; upregulation"
"Lung Compliance and Outcomes in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Receiving ECMO",2019,"Background: Limited data are available regarding mechanical ventilation strategies in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: A retrospective analysis of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients on ECMO was conducted in 9 hospitals in Korea. Data on ventilator settings (pre-ECMO and 0, 4, 24, and 48 hours after ECMO) were collected. Based on the effect of the duration and intensity of mechanical ventilator on outcomes, time-weighted average values were calculated for ventilator parameters. Results: The 56 patients included in the study had a mean age of 55.5 years. The hospital and 6-month mortality rates were 48.1% and 54.0%, respectively, with a median ECMO duration of 9.4 days. After initiation of ECMO, peak inspiratory pressure, above positive end-expiratory pressure, tidal volume, and respiration rate were reduced, while lung compliance did not change significantly. Before and during ECMO support, tidal volume and lung compliance were higher in 6-month survivors than in nonsurvivors. In Cox proportional models, both lung compliance (odds ratio, 0.961; 95% confidence interval, 0.928 to 0.995) and time-weighted average–lung compliance (odds ratio, 0.943; 95% confidence interval, 0.903 to 0.986) were significantly associated with 6-month mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that patients with higher lung compliance before ECMO had a longer survival time at the 6-month follow-up than did those with lower lung compliance. Conclusions: Lung compliance, whether before or during ECMO, may be an important predictor of outcome in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients receiving ECMO. However, this result requires confirmation in larger clinical studies. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; breathing rate; clinical outcome; controlled study; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; follow up; hospital mortality; human; lung compliance; major clinical study; male; maximal inspiratory pressure; mortality rate; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; retrospective study; survival time; survivor; tidal volume; treatment duration; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; clinical trial; Kaplan Meier method; lung function test; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; pathophysiology; procedures; proportional hazards model; Adult; Aged; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung Compliance; Middle Aged; Positive-Pressure Respiration, Intrinsic; Proportional Hazards Models; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory Rate; Retrospective Studies; Tidal Volume"
"Association Between Pepsin in the Saliva and the Subjective Symptoms in Patients With Laryngopharyngeal Reflux",2019,"Objectives: Our study was designed to further evaluate the relationships between the saliva pepsin level and the symptoms and quality of life of patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Study design: A prospective cohort study without controls. Setting: Tertiary teaching hospital. Subjects and methods: We analyzed 50 patients diagnosed with LPR by 24-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance pH monitoring. All subjects were instructed to collect saliva samples upon waking in the morning. The saliva pepsin levels were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Reflux Symptom Index, Reflux Finding Score, Laryngopharyngeal Reflux-Health-Related Quality of Life, and Short Form 36 survey were administered. Results: The pepsin was detected in the saliva of 41 patients with LPR (17.15 ± 20.42 ng/mL). Nine patients did not have pepsin in the saliva. There were no significant associations between the pepsin level in the saliva and Reflux Symptom Index, Laryngopharyngeal Reflux-Health-Related Quality of Life, or Short Form 36 of patients with LPR. Conclusion: The saliva pepsin level is not significantly correlated with LPR symptoms or quality of life in LPR patients. It may be true that there is no association between pepsin levels and LPR symptoms, but this lack of association does not prove the lack of pathophysiological effect. ? 2019 The Voice Foundation","pepsin A; biological marker; pepsin A; adult; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; esophageal pH monitoring; female; health survey; human; laryngopharyngeal reflux; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prospective study; quality of life; Reflux Symptom Index; respiratory tract parameters; saliva; Short Form 36; social interaction; teaching hospital; tertiary care center; voice change; wakefulness; blood; complication; enzymology; laryngopharyngeal reflux; questionnaire; saliva; Adult; Biomarkers; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Esophageal pH Monitoring; Female; Humans; Laryngopharyngeal Reflux; Male; Middle Aged; Pepsin A; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Saliva; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Immune Correlates of Protection Induced by Virus-Like Particles Containing 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza HA, NA or M1 Proteins",2019,"Influenza virus-like particle (VLPs) vaccines are a promising alternative to conventional egg-based vaccines. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy induced by HA-M1 VLPs, NA-M1 VLPs or M1 VLPs against virus challenge infection would provide important insight into vaccine design strategy. In this study, we generated VLPs containing hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) or M1 proteins derived from the A/California/04/09. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with HA-M1, NA-M1 or M1 VLPs and protective immunity was evaluated by assessing lung virus loads against low (5LD50) or high (100LD50) lethal dose of homologous virus challenges. High levels of virus-specific serum IgG antibody responses were induced in mice after HA-M1 VLPs immunization, whereas low or no IgG antibody responses were detected from immunization with NA-M1 VLPs or M1 VLPs, independently. Mice that were immunized with HA-M1 VLPs showed below the limit of detection on lung virus loads against low dose (5LD50) of challenge and significant reduction against high dose (100LD50) of challenge infection. Mice that were immunized with NA-M1 or M1 VLPs also displayed reduced lung viral loads compared to na?ve control. In vitro cultures of cells from mouse spleen and bone marrow revealed that HA-M1 VLPs and NA-M1 VLPs induced higher levels of antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses compared to na?ve control, whereas M1 VLPs showed no ASC responses. HA-M1, NA-M1 or M1 VLPs immunization demonstrated varying degree of protection with respect to body weight changes and survival rates, which are consistent with the levels of antibody responses in sera and ASC responses from spleen and bone marrow. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis.","influenza matrix protein 1; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus like particle vaccine; virus sialidase; immunoglobulin G; influenza vaccine; viral protein; virus antibody; virus like particle vaccine; 2009 H1N1 influenza; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; antibody secreting cell; Article; body weight; body weight change; body weight loss; bone marrow; controlled study; female; influenza vaccination; limit of detection; lung homogenate; MDCK cell line; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; spleen; virus load; virus pathogenesis; virus replication; animal; Baculoviridae; Bagg albino mouse; blood; genetics; immunoglobulin producing cell; immunology; Influenza A virus (H1N1); lung; orthomyxovirus infection; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Antibody-Producing Cells; Baculoviridae; Bone Marrow; Female; Immunoglobulin G; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Lung; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Spleen; Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle; Viral Proteins"
"Trends and patterns of burden of disease and injuries in Korea using disability-adjusted life years",2019,"Background: It is extremely important to objectively take a view of population health to provide useful information to decision makers, health-sector leaders, researchers, and informed citizens. This study aims to examine the burden of disease in Korea as of 2015, and to study how the burden of disease changes with the passage of time. Methods: We used results from the Korean National Burden of Disease and Injuries Study 2015 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by gender and age groups from 2007 to 2015. DALYs were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost (YLLs) and the years lived with disability (YLDs). Results: In 2015, the burden of disease for Korean people was calculated at 29,476 DALYs per 100,000 population. DALYs caused by low back pain were the highest, followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The burden of disease showed a consistently increasing trend from 2007 to 2015. Although YLLs have been on the decrease since 2011, the increase in YLDs has contributed to the overall rise in DALYs. The DALYs per 100,000 population in 2015 increased by 28.1% compared to 2007. Conclusion: As for the diseases for which the burden of disease is substantially increasing, it is needed to establish appropriate policies in a timely manner. The results of this study are expected to be the basis for prioritizing public health and health care policies in Korea. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","adolescent; adult; aged; cause of death; child; chronic obstructive lung disease; diabetes mellitus; female; global disease burden; human; infant; low back pain; male; middle aged; newborn; pathology; preschool child; quality adjusted life year; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; trends; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Low Back Pain; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Republic of Korea; Young Adult"

"Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of genetic markers in Dupuytren's disease",2019,"Background: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by thickening and contracting palmar fascia. The exact pathogenesis of DD remains unknown. Results: In this study, we identified co-expressed gene set (DD signature) consisting of 753 genes via weighted gene co-expression network analysis. To confirm the robustness of DD signature, module enrichment analysis and meta-analysis were performed. Moreover, this signature effectively classified DD disease samples. The DD signature were significantly enriched in unfolded protein response (UPR) related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Next, we conducted multiple-phenotype regression analysis to identify trans-regulatory hotspots regulating expression levels of DD signature using Genotype-Tissue Expression data. Finally, 10 trans-regulatory hotspots and 16 eGenes genes that are significantly associated with at least one cis-eQTL were identified. Conclusions: Among these eGenes, major histocompatibility complex class II genes and ZFP57 zinc finger protein were closely related to ER stress and UPR, suggesting that these genetic markers might be potential therapeutic targets for DD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","HLA DQA1 antigen; HLA DQB1 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; HLA DRB5 antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; Notch4 receptor; Article; ATF6B gene; controlled study; Dupuytren contracture; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene locus; genetic marker; genomics; HLA DQA1 gene; HLA DQB1 gene; HLA DQB2 gene; HLA DRB1 gene; HLA DRB5 gene; HLA DRB56gene; human; microarray analysis; NOTCH4 gene; priority journal; transcriptomics; unfolded protein response; ZFP57 gene"

"Effects of aromatic ring-substituted phenethylamines on the release of dopamine and serotonin",2019,"Purpose: Significant disturbances of the classical amphetamines on the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems have been previously reported. However, few studies have been conducted on the effects of new psychoactive phenethylamines on the release of DA and 5-HT. In the present study, the effects of new psychoactive phenethylamines with a variety of aromatic ring substitutions (5-API, 3-FMA, 5-MAPB, and DMMA) on the release of DA and 5-HT were investigated. Methods: Changes of DA, 5-HT and their metabolites in brain microdialysates from rats following exposure to the drugs were examined using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method. Their potencies of DA and 5-HT uptake inhibition as well as dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) binding were also determined. Results: With the exception of DMMA, the drugs markedly affected the extracellular concentration of DA, 5-HT and/or their metabolites in rats and acted as potent inhibitors for DAT and/or SERT. Especially, 5-API potently induced the nonselective release of both DA and 5-HT, which was strongly correlated with a high degree of uptake inhibition and binding affinity to DAT and SERT. The 3-FMA, a methamphetamine analog with a halogen-substituted benzene, induced greater 5-HT release than DA. Conclusions: We found that new psychoactive phenethylamines, with a variety of aromatic ring substitutions, affected the extracellular levels of DA, 5-HT, and/or their metabolites in the nucleus accumbens of rats to varying degrees and in different ways. The current results may assist further research into monoamine neurotransmitter-related mechanisms of new psychoactive phenethylamines.

"Pattern identification of lung cancer patients based on body constitution questionnaires (BCQ) and glycoproteomics for precision medicine",2019,"Background:The patient's pattern identification has been used for personalized medicine in traditional Korean medicine (TKM) and aims for patient-specific therapy by Korean medical doctors. The pattern identification in this trial will be diagnosed from body constitution questionnaire (BCQ) with a more objective diagnosis of it but this method still needs a more concrete scientific basis. Glycoproteins are well-known to be associated with diseases (especially cancers) so glycoproteomics can be applied to differentiate pattern identification types of lung cancer patients. Thus, for the first time proteomics approach will be applied to the pattern identification by comparing BCQ assessment in order to establish a scientific basis with clinical proteomics for precision medicine.Methods:This observational trial will at first diagnose the pattern identification types of lung cancer patients with BCQ assessment and then elucidate their relationships with proteomics. Blood samples will be collected before surgery along with clinical information of participants. The patients' pattern identification in TKM will be diagnosed from BCQ assessment. Then, lung cancer patients will be divided and pooled into 3 lung cancer entire (LCE) groups according to their pattern identification types (Xu, Stasis, or Gentleness). Three lung cancer representative (LCR) groups will be selected and pooled from each LCE group by selecting those with the same control factors. The 3 LCE groups and the 3 LCR groups from lung cancer patients will be independently analyzed through the glycoproteomics approach based on the patients' pattern identification. Glycoproteins from the 6 groups will be identified through proteomics approach and then categorized for analysis.Discussion:This study intends to diagnose pattern identification of patients in TKM with BCQ assessment and proteomics approach. The identification of the glycoproteins in each group will lead to the scientific foundation of personalized medicine in TKM according to patients' pattern identification for lung cancer therapy. We intend to(1) diagnose the pattern identification types of lung cancer patients with BCQ under the framework of TKM;(2) evaluate BCQ assessment with glycoproteomics approach for precision medicine.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03384680.

"Questionnaire study of the dietary habits of breast cancer survivors and their relationship to quality of life (KROG 14-09)",2019,"We evaluated the dietary habits of breast cancer survivors and investigated the relationship with quality of life (QoL), with 1,156 survivors recruited from 17 institutions. We used the Questionnaire Survey of Dietary Habits of Korean Adults (Q-DH-KOR) comprising 25 questions. The following indices were derived as follows: (1) quality of healthy dietary habits (Q-HD)—eight questions on number of meals, regularity, quantity, duration, skipping breakfast, dinner with companion(s), overeating and late-night snacks; (2) habits of nutritional balance (H-NB)—questions on consuming five food categories (grains, fruits, proteins, vegetables and dairy products); and (3) habits of unhealthy foods (H-UF)—questions on consuming three food categories (fatty, instant and fast foods). The times and regularity of meals, frequency of skipping breakfast, dinner with companion(s) and overeating were better in groups with high symptomatic and functional QoL. Symptomatic QoL positively affected Q-HD and H-NB (p?<?0.001 and p?=?0.024 respectively) and negatively affected H-UF (p?=?0.02). Breast cancer survivors more frequently ate from the fruit, protein and vegetable categories than did the control group, with lower H-UF and higher Q-HD values (p?<?0.001 and p?<?0.001 respectively). Our findings supported the relationship between QoL and dietary habit and showed healthier dietary habits of breast cancer survivors than controls. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; age distribution; aged; breast tumor; cancer survivor; case control study; cross-sectional study; ethnology; feeding behavior; female; food preference; healthy diet; human; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; South Korea; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Preferences; Healthy Diet; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Magnetoencephalography as a Prognostic Tool in Patients with Medically Intractable Temporal Lobe Epilepsy",2019,"Background: Most surgical treatments for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy are helpful. When a patient has persistent symptoms after surgery, there are no tests that accurately predict whether a patient will have remnant epileptic foci. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a prognostic tool in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: From July 2012 to July 2016, 21 patients underwent preoperative and postoperative MEG at our center. Postoperative MEG was performed within 2 weeks after surgery. We analyzed MEG by estimating the time-frequency component of the signal to define gamma oscillations (GOs), which are an indicator of epileptogenic foci. We analyzed the relationship between GOs on MEG and surgical outcomes. Results: Mean follow-up period was 28.3 months (range, 13–44 months). At the last follow-up visit, patients were divided into 2 groups according to surgical outcome. All patients showed spike waves and GOs on preoperative electroencephalography and MEG. In the seizure control group (16 patients), spike waves (2 patients) and GOs (2 patients) were seen postoperatively despite absence of symptoms. In the recurrent seizure group (5 patients), whereas 3 patients showed spike waves, all 5 patients showed GOs on MEG postoperatively. There was a significant association between presence of GOs on postoperative MEG and surgical outcome (P = 0.01). Conclusions: MEG can provide valuable postsurgical information on epileptic foci in patients with recurrent symptoms; GOs on postoperative MEG were especially correlated with epileptic recurrence. Our data show that GOs on postoperative MEG may have prognostic value. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","anticonvulsive agent; adult; aged; anticonvulsant therapy; Article; cavernous hemangioma; clinical article; complex partial seizure; cortical dysplasia; electroencephalography; epileptic discharge; epileptic focus; female; follow up; gamma rhythm; glioma; hippocampal sclerosis; human; intractable epilepsy; magnetoencephalography; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; prognosis; recurrent disease; spike wave; temporal lobe epilepsy; temporal lobectomy; amygdala; chronic disease; evaluation study; hippocampus; middle aged; procedures; prognosis; prospective study; temporal lobe; temporal lobe epilepsy; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Aged; Amygdala; Anterior Temporal Lobectomy; Chronic Disease; Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Temporal Lobe; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Impact of pulmonary tuberculosis on the EGFR mutational status and clinical outcome in patients with lung adenocarcinoma",2019,"Purpose Although it has been suggested that pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is associated with increased risk of lung cancer, the exact mechanism is not clearly identified. We investigated the effect of pulmonary TB on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status and clinical outcome in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods We reviewed data of patients diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutations and treated at our institution from 2008 to 2015. We divided our population into two groups: patients with pre-existing TB lesions on chest computed tomography scan (TB group) and those without the lesions (non-TB group). We compared the differences in EGFR mutational status, response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and survival between the two groups. Results A total of 477 patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma were analyzed. One hundred eighty-three patients (39%) had EGFR-mutated tumors and 100 (21%) patients had pre-existing TB lesions. The frequency of EGFR mutation was significantly higher in the TB group compared with the non-TB group (56% vs. 34%, p=0.038). Pre-existing TB lesions were independently associated with more frequent EGFR mutations in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.43). In addition, both the progression-free survival (9.1 months vs. 11.6 months, p=0.020) and the overall survival (19.4 months vs. 24.5 months, p=0.014) after first-line EGFR-TKIs were significantly shorter in the TB group than in the non-TB group. Conclusion Previous pulmonary TB may be associated with more frequent EGFR mutations and poorer treatment response to EGFR-TKIs in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

"4,5-dicaffeyolquinic acid improves high-fat diet-induced cognitive dysfunction through the regulation of insulin degrading enzyme",2019,"This study was performed to investigate the effects of Artemisia argyi and 4,5-dicaffeyolquinic acid (4,5-diCQA) as a main compound of ethyl acetate fraction from Artemisia argyi (EFAA) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive dysfunction. Both EFAA and 4,5-diCQA were effective in improving cognitive function on HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction. In brain tissue analysis, it was confirmed that EFAA and 4,5-diCQA inhibited the reduction of neurotransmitters as well as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, they inhibited amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation by increasing the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme and consequently prevented apoptosis. In conclusion, it is presumed that Artemisia argyi may help to improve the cognitive impairment due to the HFD, and it is considered that this effect is closely related to the physiological activity of 4,5-diCQA. Practical applications: Artemisia argyi is used in traditional herbal medicine in Asia. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been proven by a variety of epidemiological studies to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer’s disease. This study confirmed that 4,5-diCQA is a bioactive compound of Artemisia argyi on improving HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, this study can provide useful information to the effect of Artemisia argyi and related substance. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Brain; Cell death; Enzymes; Insulin; Artemisia argyi; cognitive dysfunction; Epidemiological studies; High-fat diet; Insulin-degrading enzymes; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Physiological activity; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Psychophysiology"
"CCAR2/DBC1 and Hsp60 positively regulate expression of survivin in neuroblastoma cells",2019,"CCAR2 (cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 2) controls a variety of cellular functions; however, its main function is to regulate cell survival and cell death in response to genotoxic and metabolic stresses. Recently, we reported that CCAR2 protects cells from apoptosis following mitochondrial stress, possibly by co-operating with Hsp60. However, it is not clear how CCAR2 and Hsp60 control cell survival and death. Here, we found that depleting CCAR2 and Hsp60 downregulated expression of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family. Survivin expression in neuroblastoma tissues and human cancer cell lines correlated positively with expression of CCAR2 and Hsp60. Furthermore, high expression of CCAR2, Hsp60, and survivin was associated with poor survival of neuroblastoma patients. In summary, both CCAR2 and Hsp60 are required for expression of survivin, and both promote cancer cell survival, at least in part, by maintaining survivin expression. Therefore, CCAR2, Hsp60, and survivin are candidate tumor biomarkers and prognostic markers in neuroblastomas. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Randomized, Open-Label, Phase IV, Korean Study of Kidney Transplant Patients Converting From Cyclosporine to Prolonged-Release Tacrolimus Plus Standard- or Reduced-Dose Corticosteroids",2019,"Background: This 24-week, multicenter, randomized, exploratory, comparative, open-label, phase-IV study assessed the safety and efficacy of prolonged-release tacrolimus (PR-T) with reduced-dose versus standard-dose corticosteroids in stable kidney transplant recipients in Korea after converting from cyclosporine-based therapy. Methods: At baseline, patients were converted from cyclosporine-based to PR-T-based immunosuppression and randomized (1:1) to receive either corticosteroids maintained at prestudy dose (standard-dose group) or tapered from week 4 to 50% of the prestudy dose by week 12 (reduced-dose group). Patients were seen at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24. The primary endpoint was change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (Modification-of-Diet-in-Renal-Disease-4) between baseline and week 24. Secondary endpoints included either acute rejection or patient-reported satisfaction with PR-T. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Results: Overall, 150 patients were randomized into a reduced-dose group (n = 73) and a standard-dose group (n = 77). At week 24, mean ± standard deviation for corticosteroid dose was 2.5 ± 0.9 mg and 5.0 ± 1.3 mg, respectively. Mean change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to week 24 was +1.5 ± 9.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P =.1567) and +3.4 ± 10.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P =.0065), respectively, and not significantly different between groups. There were no acute rejection episodes. Most respondents (&gt;70%) considered PR-T more convenient than cyclosporine. AE incidence was similar between groups. The most common AEs experienced by ?3% of patients in either treatment group were gastrointestinal events (20.8% and 28.6% of patients receiving reduced- and standard-dose corticosteroids, respectively). Most AEs in both treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. Conclusion: Renal function was maintained following conversion from cyclosporine to PR-T, irrespective of corticosteroid regimen; PR-T enables reduced corticosteroid dosage. ? 2019 The Authors","corticosteroid; cyclosporine; tacrolimus; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; immunosuppressive agent; tacrolimus; acute graft rejection; adult; age; aged; Article; clinical assessment; clinical practice; controlled study; diarrhea; disease severity; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; estimated glomerular filtration rate; exploratory research; female; gingiva hyperplasia; graft recipient; human; hypertrichosis; immunosuppressive treatment; incidence; kidney donor; kidney failure; kidney function; kidney transplantation; Korea; major clinical study; male; morning dosage; multicenter study; patient satisfaction; phase 4 clinical trial; physical examination; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sustained drug release; treatment duration; treatment outcome; urticaria; vital sign; clinical trial; delayed release formulation; drug therapy; glomerulus filtration rate; graft recipient; graft rejection; methodology; middle aged; procedures; South Korea; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Cyclosporine; Delayed-Action Preparations; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Graft Rejection; Humans; Immunosuppression; Immunosuppressive Agents; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Republic of Korea; Research Design; Tacrolimus; Transplant Recipients"
"Analysis of the Changes in the Clinical Outcomes According to Time After Arthroscopic Microfracture of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus",2019,"Background: Arthroscopic microfracture can effectively treat osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). However, very few studies have reported on symptomatic improvement duration and time when symptomatic improvement ceases. This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcome changes after arthroscopic microfracture in patients with OLT. Methods: Among patients who underwent arthroscopic microfracture for OLT, 70 patients were available for follow-up for more than 3 years. Of these, 6 patients who showed worsening or no improvement in the 6 months after surgery were excluded, and a total of 64 patients were included in the analysis. To analyze and compare the clinical outcome changes according to time, the visual analog scale (VAS) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores were evaluated every 3 months up to 1 year postoperatively and every 1 year thereafter. The clinical outcome differences based on the lesion size, lesion location, lesion containment, presence of cyst and bone marrow edema, age, sex, and obesity were analyzed. Results: The preoperative and final follow-up VAS scores significantly improved from 6.2 ± 1.1 to 1.2 ± 1.1 (P <.05) and the AOFAS score from 63.1 ± 7.3 to 91.0 ± 7.3 (P <.05). The overall success rate for arthroscopic microfracture in this study was 88.6%. The postoperative VAS and AOFAS scores at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 months were 3.7 ± 1.4, 2.5 ± 1.3, 2.0 ± 1.1, 1.6 ± 1.2, 1.2 ± 1.2, and 1.3 ± 1.2 and 74.7 ± 10.3, 80.5 ± 8.9, 84.3 ± 7.4, 88.3 ± 7.3, 91.1 ± 7.2, and 90.8 ± 7.5, respectively, showing significant improvements up to 2 years. After 2 years, the symptoms did not improve but were maintained at a certain level up to 3 years. No clinical outcome differences based on the lesion size, lesion containment, presence of cyst and bone marrow edema, age, sex, and obesity were observed. Conclusion: Symptomatic improvement early after arthroscopic microfracture for OLT was observed continuously for up to 2 years postoperatively. Symptom improvement was maintained without worsening for up to 3 years after surgery. Determining the final outcome of microfracture at least after 2 years would be reasonable.

"Fimasartan versus perindopril with and without diuretics in the treatment of elderly patients with essential hypertension (Fimasartan in the Senior Subjects (FITNESS)): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, even in the elderly. Fimasartan is a new non-peptide angiotensin II receptor blocker with a selective type I receptor blocking effect. The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and the non-inferiority of the blood pressure-lowering effect of fimasartan compared with those of perindopril, which has been proven safe and effective in elderly patients with hypertension. Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, two-parallel group, optional-titration, multicenter, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of fimasartan and perindopril arginine. The study population consists of individuals 70 years old or older with essential hypertension. The primary outcome will be a change in sitting systolic blood pressure from baseline after the administration of the investigational product for 8 weeks. The secondary outcomes will be a change in sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline and changes in sitting systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from baseline after the administration of the investigational product for 4, 16, and 24 weeks. The sample size will be 119 subjects for each group to confer enough power to test for the primary outcome. Discussion: Research to confirm the efficacy and safety of a new medicine compared with those of previously proven anti-hypertensive drugs is beneficial to guide physicians in the selection of therapeutic agents. If it is confirmed that the new drug is not inferior to the existing drug, the drug will be considered as an option in the treatment of hypertension in elderly patients.

"Length of hospital stay after hip fracture surgery and 1-year mortality",2019,"Summary: There is ongoing effort to discharge patients early after hip fracture surgery to reduce the medical and economic burden. We tried to find whether there is any related side effect, and discovered that early discharge, especially before 10?days after surgery, is associated with higher mortality. Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze the association between the length of hospital stay after hip fracture and 1-year mortality in older adults aged ? 65?years old. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service data to identify patients who were discharged after hip fracture surgery from 2007 to 2009 among 487,460 older adults of age ? 65?years. The lengths of stay involving hip fracture surgery were categorized at 10-day interval, and analyzed in relation to 1-year mortality from the date of hospital discharge. Results: A total of 4213 patients were discharged after hip fracture surgery, of whom 604 (14.3%) died within 1?year of discharge. The average length of stay was 30.7?days (standard deviation 24.5?days). The 1-year mortality was the highest for the length of stay ? 10?days group at 21.7%, followed by 15.2%, 14.3%, 13.3%, and 12.4% for > 40, 21–30, 31–40, and 11–20?days groups, respectively (p value 0.05). On Cox proportional hazard regression, the adjusted hazard ratio for length of stay ? 10?days group was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.14–2.12) against the reference group (11–20?days), while other groups did not show statistical significance. Higher risk of death was associated with increasing age, male gender, Charlson comorbidity index ?3, subtrochanteric fracture, and discharge to tertiary care hospitals and long-term care hospitals. Conclusion: Older adults discharged within 10?days of hospital admission for hip fracture surgery have higher 1-year mortality after discharge. ? 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","age; aged; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; closed reduction (procedure); cohort analysis; disease association; female; femur subtrochanteric fracture; gender; hemiarthroplasty; hip fracture; hip surgery; hospital discharge; human; length of stay; long term care; major clinical study; male; mortality; open reduction (procedure); postoperative period; priority journal; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk assessment; South Korea; tertiary care center; total hip replacement; very elderly; age distribution; epidemiology; factual database; fragility fracture; hip fracture; hip replacement; hospitalization; Kaplan Meier method; length of stay; mortality; osteosynthesis; procedures; sex ratio; social class; statistics and numerical data; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Databases, Factual; Female; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Hip Fractures; Hospitalization; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Length of Stay; Male; Osteoporotic Fractures; Patient Discharge; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Social Class"
"Fenton-like reaction performing mineralized nanocarriers as oxidative stress amplifying anticancer agents",2019,"We developed Fenton-like reaction performing mineralized nanoparticles as novel oxidative stress amplifying anticancer agents. We fabricated Cu-doped superoxide dismutase (SOD)-loaded calcium carbonate (CaCO3)-mineralized nanoparticles (Cu/SOD-MNPs) that could simultaneously release hydrogen peroxide-generating SOD and Fenton-like reaction-inducing copper ions within cancer cells. The CaCO3 core of the Cu/SOD-MNPs effectively inhibited the release of the entrapped SOD and copper ions in physiological pH (7.4). In contrast, in acidic pH (5.0), the release of SOD and copper ions was facilitated by CaCO3 dissolution. We demonstrated that the Cu/SOD-MNPs elevated the level of highly toxic apoptosis-inducing hydroxyl radicals in the cancer cells. The Cu/SOD-MNPs showed specific toxicity for cancer cells (MCF-7 cells), whereas no or negligible toxicity was found for normal cells (NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells). This mineralized oxidative stress amplifying nanoparticle may serve as a novel cancer-specific anticancer agent. ? 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Cell death; Diseases; Enzymes; Metal ions; Nanoparticles; Oxidation; Oxidative stress; pH; Toxicity; Anti-cancer agents; Fenton reactions; Fenton-like reactions; Hydroxyl radicals; Nano-carriers; Physiological pH; Super oxide dismutase; Superoxide dismutases; Copper compounds"
"Deletion at 2q14.3 is associated with worse response to TNF-α blockers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis",2019,"Background: Structural variations such as copy number variations (CNVs) have a functional impact on various human traits. This study profiled genome-wide CNVs in Korean patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to investigate the efficacy of treatment with TNF-α blockers. Methods: A total of 357 Korean patients with RA were examined for the efficacy of TNF-α blocker treatment. Disease activity indexes were measured at baseline and 6 months after the treatment. The patients were classified as responders and non-responders based on the change in disease activity indexes according to the EULAR response criteria. CNVs in the same patients were profiled using fluorescence signal intensity data generated by a genome-wide SNP array. The association of CNVs with response to TNF-α blockers was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression accounting for genetic background and clinical factors including body mass index, gender, baseline disease activity, TNF-α blocker used, and methotrexate treatment. Results: The study subjects varied in their responses to TNF-α blockers and had 286 common CNVs in autosomes. We identified that the 3.8-kb deletion at 2q14.3 in 5% of the subjects was associated with response to TNF-α blockers (1.37 × 10- 5 ? P ? 4.07 × 10- 4) at a false discovery rate threshold of 5%. The deletion in the identified CNV was significantly more frequent in the non-responders than in the responders, indicating worse response to TNF-α blockers in the deletion carriers. The 3.8-kb deletion at 2q14.3 is located in an intergenic region with the binding sites of two transcription factors, MAFF and MAFK. Conclusions: This study obtained the CNV landscape of Korean patients with RA and identified the common regional deletion associated with poor response to treatment with TNF-α blockers. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adalimumab; biological marker; etanercept; golimumab; infliximab; methotrexate; spacer DNA; transcription factor MafF; transcription factor MafK; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; Article; autosome; binding site; body mass; chromosome 2q; comparative study; copy number variation; disease activity; drug efficacy; drug response; gender; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene identification; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; high risk population; human; Korean (people); major clinical study; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism"
"Body Composition and Cardiorespiratory Fitness Between Metabolically Healthy Versus Metabolically Unhealthy Obese Black and White Adolescents",2019,"Purpose: We compared body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) between metabolically healthy overweight/obese (MHO) versus metabolically unhealthy overweight/obese (MUO) adolescents in 189 black and white adolescents (BMI ? 85th percentile, 12–18 years of age). Methods: Participants were defined as MHO or MUO if their insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, measured by a 3-hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, was in the upper quartile or in the lower three quartiles. Total fat was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and visceral adiposity and liver fat were measured by magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. CRF was measured by a graded maximal treadmill test. Results: Black MHO adolescents had lower (p <.05) 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with a lower prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance compared with black MUO adolescents. White MHO adolescents had lower (p <.05) triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with a lower prevalence of impaired fasting glucose compared with white MUO adolescents. Independent of race, CRF was higher in MHO versus MUO adolescents. After accounting for gender, Tanner stage, and BMI, there were no differences in total fat (kg, %) between MHO versus MUO in both races. MHO adolescents had significantly lower trunk fat, waist circumference, and visceral fat compared with MUO adolescents in both races. In whites, MHO adolescents had lower (p =.055) liver fat compared with MUO adolescents. Conclusions: Independent of race, the MHO phenotype is characterized by high CRF, lower waist circumference and visceral fat, and lower rates of dysglycemia in youth. ? 2018","glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adolescent; adolescent obesity; adult; Article; Black person; body composition; body fat; body fat distribution; cardiorespiratory fitness; Caucasian; child; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fasting; female; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; impaired glucose tolerance; intra-abdominal fat; major clinical study; male; metabolically healthy obese; metabolically unhealthy obese; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oral glucose tolerance test; phenotype; prevalence; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; treadmill test; waist circumference"
"Comparative research for the healthcare budget and burden of disease in perspective resource allocation",2019,"Background: Burden of disease can be used to prioritize the healthcare budget allocation. We analyzed the research and development (R&D) budget of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. Methods: The 2018 MOHW R&D Project integrated implementation plan was used to analyze the R&D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk factors were compared with corresponding budgets. Results: In 2018, the MOHW major R&D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R&D budget, 35.9% was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were targeted for R&D. Conclusions: It would be difficult to say that current R&D allocations focus to minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R&D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a similar finding for risk factors R&D. A novel approach for allocating government R&D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the Korean population should be considered. ? 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","economics; global disease burden; health care policy; human; quality adjusted life year; research; resource allocation; Global Burden of Disease; Health Policy; Humans; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Research; Resource Allocation"
"Identification of the TIFAB Gene as a Susceptibility Locus for Coronary Artery Aneurysm in Patients with Kawasaki Disease",2019,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limiting systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. KD is often complicated by coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs), which develop in about 20–25% of untreated children and 3–5% of children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. To identify the risk loci for CAA susceptibility in patients with KD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using our previous Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 KD patients) and a new replication study in an independent sample set (713 KD patients) by grouping KD patients without CAA (control) versus KD patients with extremely large aneurysms (diameter ? 5?mm) (case). Among 44 candidate single -nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from the initial GWAS data (33 cases vs. 215 controls), a SNP (rs899162) located 7?kb upstream of the TIFAB gene on chromosome five was replicated in an independent sample (12 cases vs. 532 controls). In the combined analysis (45 cases vs. 747 controls), the SNP (rs899162) showed a highly significant association with CAA formation (diameter ? 5?mm) in patients with KD (odds ratio = 3.20, 95% confidence interval = 2.02–5.05, P combined = 1.95 × 10 ?7 ). These results indicate that the TIFAB gene may act as a CAA susceptibility locus in patients with KD. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article; case control study; chromosome 5; chromosome replication; controlled study; coronary artery aneurysm; disease course; disease severity; gene; gene function; gene identification; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; human; molecular pathology; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; replication study; risk assessment; single nucleotide polymorphism; TIFAB gene; complication; coronary artery aneurysm; coronary blood vessel; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; pathology; Tifab protein, human; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; Case-Control Studies; Coronary Aneurysm; Coronary Vessels; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6"
"3D biosensors in advanced medical diagnostics of high mortality diseases",2019,"Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes are high mortality diseases, which account for almost two thirds of all deaths worldwide. Their early detection and continuous evaluation are? fundamental for an improved patient prognosis and reduced socioeconomic impact. Current biosensor technologies are typically based on the analysis of whole blood samples from patients for the detection of disease-specific biomarkers. However, these technologies display serious shortcomings, such as reduced sensitivity and dynamic range, limited in vivo applicability, and lack of continuous monitoring. There is the urgent need for new diagnostic and treatment follow-up tools, which allow for the early detection of the pathology as well as for the continuous monitoring of the physiological responses to specific therapies. During the last years, a new generation of biosensor technologies with improved performance has emerged in the biomedical sector. The combination of advanced biomaterial methods, biochemical tools, and micro/nanotechnology approaches has resulted in the development of innovative three-dimensional (3D) biosensor platforms for advanced medical diagnosis. In this review, we report the most recent advances in the field of 3D biosensors for clinical applications, focusing on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. We discuss about their clinical performance compared to standard biosensor technologies, their implantable capability, and their integration into microfluidic devices to develop clinically-relevant models. Overall, we anticipate that 3D biosensors will drive us toward a new paradigm in medical diagnosis, resulting in real-time in vivo biosensors capable to significantly improve patient prognosis. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biosensors; Cardiology; Diseases; Medical problems; Monitoring; Physiological models; Cancer; Cardio-vascular disease; Implantable; Micro-fluidic devices; On chips; Physiological response; Socio-economic impacts; Threedimensional (3-d); Diagnosis; acrylamide; alginic acid; carbon; dextran; ferrocene; glass; gold; graphene oxide; macrogol; metal; nanocomposite; nordihydroguaiaretic acid; phenylalanine; polycarbonate; polyethylene; polyethyleneimine; polymacon; polymer; polystyrene; silicon; silicon dioxide; cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; electrochemical analysis; enzyme immobilization; human; hydrogel; immobilization; malignant neoplasm; microfluidics; microtechnology; nanofabrication; nonhuman; Review; three dimensional biosensor; early cancer diagnosis; genetic procedures; lab on a chip; nanotechnology; neoplasm; trends; Biosensing Techniques; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Nanotechnology; Neoplasms"
