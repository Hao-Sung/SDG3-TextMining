More than 30% of epilepsy patients suffer pharmacoresistance. Transport of antileptic drugs by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MRP2 plays an important role in drug-resistant epilepsy. Huperzine A (Hup-A) is a natural compound, which might have potential in treating neurological disorders including epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, we investigated whether human P-gp and MRP2 transport Hup-A. 2. LLC-PK1 and MDCKII cells transfected with human P-gp or MRP2 were used to establish concentration equilibrium transport assays (CETAs) and determine the transport profile of Hup-A. The expression of P-gp and MRP2 was detected by qPCR and western blotting. The transport function of P-gp and MRP2 was measured by Rho123 and CDFDA cell uptake assay. 3. In CETAs, Hup-A at concentrations of 10 ng/mL or 2??g/mL was transported by MDR1 and MRP2 from basolateral to apical sides of the cell monolayers. P-gp and MRP2 inhibitors completely blocked the efflux of Hup-A. There was no efflux of Hup-A in LLC-PK1 or MDCKII wild-type (WT) cells. 4. We demonstrate that Hup-A is a substrate of P-gp and MRP2. These results imply the efflux of Hup-A across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo, suggesting potential drug resistance of Hup-A. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cell monolayer; drug transporter; drug-resistant epilepsy; Hup-A; P-glycoprotein,huperzine A; multidrug resistance associated protein 2; multidrug resistance protein 1; animal cell; Article; controlled study; drug transport; genetic transfection; human; human cell; in vitro study; LLC-PK1 cell line; MDCK-II cell line; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; transport assay; uptake assay; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85067576553

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with data from 1,831 community-dwellers aged 65 years and above. Participants’ basic demographics, comorbidity, and six lifestyle factors: diet; smoking; alcohol drinking; and physical, mental, and social activities were surveyed. Cognitive function was assessed using the Cantonese Chinese Montreal Cognitive Assessment (CC-MoCA). Linear regressions were performed to examine the associations between lifestyle, gender, and cognitive performance. Results: There were gender differences in lifestyle: men smoked (χ2(1) = 159.4) and drank more (χ2(1) = 85.9) and were more active in mentally stimulating activities (χ2(1) = 14.3, all p&lt;.001); while women were more socially active (χ2(1) = 28.0). Age, gender and education explained the greatest variance in cognition (R2=.32). Being active/healthy in more domains further contributed to better cognitive function, although the effect was small (ΔR2=0.03 in women; ΔR2=0.01 in men, both p&lt;.05). Among the lifestyle domains, physical activity showed the strongest effects on cognitive function (ΔR2=0.004 in men and ΔR2=0.02 in women, both p&lt;.05). Conclusions: Naturalistically, a physically active lifestyle and being active/healthy in more domains is associated with better cognitive function in older people after controlling for non-modifiable and early-life factors. The effects are however small. There are gender differences in lifestyle and the impact of lifestyle on cognitive function. Preventive strategies targeting lifestyle domains for cognitive health in older people may consider these naturalistic associations. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Cognitive functioning; gender difference; lifestyle,aged; alcohol consumption; article; case report; Chinese; clinical article; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; diet; education; female; healthy lifestyle; Hong Kong; human; linear regression analysis; male; mental performance; Montreal cognitive assessment; physical activity; sex difference; smoking; social behavior; additive effect; demography,2-s2.0-85058174191

Design: Multisite randomised controlled trial. Setting: Antenatal clinics at three regional public hospitals in Hong Kong. Sample: 388 low-risk childbearing couples. Methods: Childbearing couples were randomly allocated to couple-based CBI (n?=?134), women-alone CBI (n?=?124) or control (n?=?130). The CBI consists of a 3-hour antenatal group session and two 30-minute postnatal telephone follow-up sessions. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was depressive symptoms, measured on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Assessments were collected at baseline (during pregnancy), 6?weeks, 6?months, and 12?months postpartum. Results: Depressive symptoms were significantly more improved at 6?weeks postpartum for mothers in couple-based CBI than in women-alone CBI (difference 1.46, 95% CI 0.11–2.81) or control groups (difference 1.71, 95% CI 0.29–3.13). The proportion of mothers with postnatal depression (EPDS score???10) was significantly lower at 6?weeks postpartum in couple-based CBI than in control (difference 17.8%, 95% CI 3.6–32.0). However, the treatment effect was not maintained at 6 and 12?months. There was no significant intervention effect among fathers. Conclusions: Couple-based CBI is more effective than CBI delivered to mothers alone and standard perinatal care in reducing the incidence of postnatal depression among Chinese mothers in the early postpartum period.

Pathway analysis with the adaptive rank truncated product method was used to assess the association between a TB-related gene-set and lung adenocarcinoma using GWAS data from 5512 lung adenocarcinoma cases and 6277 controls. The gene-set consisted of 31 genes containing known/suggestive associations with genetic variants from previous TB-GWAS. Subsequently, we followed-up with Mendelian Randomization to evaluate the association between TB and lung adenocarcinoma using three genome-wide significant variants from previous TB-GWAS in East Asians. The TB-related gene-set was associated with lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.016). Additionally, the Mendelian Randomization showed an association between TB and lung adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.66, p = 0.027).

Methods: 157 Chinese informal caregivers of lung cancer patients were recruited together with the family members for whom they were providing care, and randomly assigned to either integrative body-mind-spirit intervention (I-BMS) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Patient-caregiver dyads attended the same arm of intervention in separate groups for 8?weeks. Assessments of generic QoL, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, insomnia, and caregiving burden were measured before intervention (T0), within 1-week (T1), 8-week (T2), and 16-week (T3) post-intervention. Results: Adopting the intention-to-treat analysis, family caregivers in receipt of both I-BMS and CBT exhibited a statistically significant improvement in generic QoL immediately following intervention and at follow-up assessments, with moderate effect size. Improvement of insomnia was found at T1 for both modes, which deteriorated at follow-up; both modes reduced anxiety and perceived stress at follow-up. No intervention effect was observed in depression and domains of caregiving burden. There was no significant interaction effect between intervention type and time. No main or interaction effect between sample background variables and intervention type was found to predict symptomatic changes at T1 and T3. Conclusions: Culturally attuned I-BMS and CBT exhibited equivalent effectiveness in improving psychological distress and generic QoL for family caregivers of lung cancer patients. To improve the evaluation of outcomes, future study could benefit from incorporating a usual care control. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Chinese; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Family caregiver; Lung cancer; Mind-body intervention; Quality of life,adult; anxiety; Article; assessment of humans; cancer patient; care behavior; caregiver; caregiver burden; Caregiver Reaction Assessment; Chinese; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; depression; distress syndrome; female; follow up; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; integrative body mind spirit intervention; intention to treat analysis; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mental stress; middle aged; outcome assessment; patient care; Perceived Stress Scale; prediction; priority journal; psychiatric treatment; quality of life; Quality of Life Index; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration,2-s2.0-85068877536

Yet, the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options has not been fully compared under Hong Kong’s setting. This cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) serves as the first study in Hong Kong to compare the economic value of these two combinations ADT + AA vs. ADT + D. Methods: A deterministic Markov model is used to project cost-effectiveness of each treatment until death. Survival curves for progression/death were extracted and digitized from the five RCTs (CHAARTED, LATITUDE, two STAMPEDE (2016/2017), and GETUG-AFU15). Clinically significant adverse events (AEs) were modeled; utility values were obtained from the literature. Primary outcomes were the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We used the societal perspective from Hong Kong and considered three times of local gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) as the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (i.e., US$138,649). We estimated the break-even cost of AA in case ADT + AA is not a cost-effective strategy under this WTP threshold. While considering the standard AA dosage (1000 mg) as the main analysis, we also examined the potential impact of the low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy. Results: Integrating simulations with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ADT + D returns 0.79 (median; 95% credible interval 0.56–0.97) QALY with an ICER of US$14,397/QALY ($7824–22,632) compared to ADT-alone. A head-to-head comparison indicates that ADT + AA further gains 0.79 (0.45–1.17) QALY but with an ICER of $361,439/QALY ($260,615–599,683) when compared to ADT + D. Considering three times of GDPpc as WTP threshold, ADT + D is more cost-effective in all simulations; while ADT + AA is more cost-effective than ADT + D only if the cost of AA is reduced by at least 63%. The low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy is potentially cost-effective when it generates equivalent efficacy as the standard dosage (1000 mg). Conclusions: ADT + D is therefore shown to be a more cost-effective strategy than ADT + AA in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients in developed economies. Addition of AA substantially improved QALY compared to D but at a significant cost. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,abiraterone acetate; docetaxel; prednisone; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; cancer growth; cause of death; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; failure free survival; gross domestic product per capita; gross national product; Hong Kong; human; low drug dose; male; metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer; multiple cycle treatment; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; progression free survival; prostate cancer; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; urogenital tract metastasis; Willingness To Pay,2-s2.0-85068866913

Methods: The antiapoptotic effects of GRb1 were evaluated in H9C2 cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and Western blotting. The antioxidative effects were measured by a reactive oxygen species assay, and GSH levels and GR activity were examined in the presence and absence of the GR inhibitor 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the binding of GRb1 to GR. The direct influence of GRb1 on GR was confirmed by recombinant human GR protein. Results: GRb1 pretreatment caused dose-dependent inhibition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cell apoptosis, at a level comparable to that of the positive control N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The binding energy between GRb1 and GR was positive (?6.426 kcal/mol), and the binding was stable. GRb1 significantly reduced reactive oxygen species production and increased GSH level and GR activity without altering GR protein expression in H9C2 cells. Moreover, GRb1 enhanced the recombinant human GR protein activity in vitro, with a half-maximal effective concentration of ?2.317 μM. Conversely, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea co-treatment significantly abolished the GRb1's apoptotic and antioxidative effects of GRb1 in H9C2 cells. Conclusion: GRb1 is a potential natural GR agonist that protects against oxidative stress–induced apoptosis of H9C2 cells. ? 2019",Apoptosis; Ginsenoside Rb1; Glutathione reductase; H9C2; Oxidative stress,ginsenoside Rb 1; glutathione; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal cell; antiapoptotic activity; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; EC50; embryo; H9c2(2-1) cell line; heart protection; in vitro study; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; MTT assay; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; rat; staining; upregulation; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85059576473

Yet after a two-year trial run, the 'Home-Based Medical Care Scheme for the Oldest-Old' (HBMCSOO) policy remained significantly under-utilised despite the increasing demand for medical services. Our multi-disciplinary research team of social workers and anthropologists identified two key factors impeding the implementation of home-based medical care services: (a) the distortion of policy implementation and (b) the inadequate professionalisation of community-based elder-care workers. Based on our evaluation of the pilot programme, the Shanghai municipal government made several practical adjustments to improve the subsequent city-wide policy implemented in 2016. While these changes mostly focused on minor adjustments to improve in-home medical services for the oldest-old, they represent an encouraging first step towards our call for a holistic integrated care system whose design and delivery takes into account local political and social contexts, including existing institutional infrastructure and cultural expectations about care-giving responsibilities. The challenges of implementing Shanghai's HBMCSOO policy ultimately provide instructive lessons on best practices for integrating medical and social services in order to improve ageing-in-place measures in diverse local settings around the world. ?

The files of patients ages 18 years or older were reviewed for demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with influenza B virus–associated pneumonia. Results: A total of 78 patients with influenza B, ages 20 to 87 years, were identified. Comparing cases with pneumonia vs cases without pneumonia, there were significant differences in the following: age in years (67.41 ± 16.63 vs 58.16 ± 17.65; P =. 028), age group (74.1% vs 51.0%; P =. 049), chronic respiratory diseases (70.4% vs 21.6%; P =. 000), shortness of breath (40.7% vs13.7%; P =. 007), abnormal breath sounds on auscultation (51.9% vs 21.6%; P =. 006), and serum alanine transaminase level (30.07 ± 10.73 vs 38.64 ± 21.68; P =. 022). Logistic regression models indicated that chronic respiratory diseases (odds ratio, 8.452; 95% confidence interval, 2.768-25.808; P =. 000) and shortness of breath (odds ratio, 1.261; 95% confidence interval, 1.015-1.566; P =. 036) were independent risk factors.

The aim of this study was to conduct an initial retrospective study of the prevalence and severity of upper esophageal clearance impairments in a cohort of patients post-NPC management. A secondary aim was to explore any observed relationship between severity of impairment with both (a) aspiration and (b) temporal oropharyngeal swallowing measures. A cohort of 134 NPC patients who received curative intent (chemo)radiotherapy (C/RT) and completed a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) between 2012 and 2015 were reviewed. An Esophageal Clearance parameter, based on the scale used in MBSImP was used to classify the presence and severity of esophageal impairment on thin liquid and semisolids. Data on oral and pharyngeal temporal measures, pharyngeal constriction, and penetration/aspiration were also collected. The prevalence of cervical esophageal clearance impairment was high with ratings > 0 observed among 83% and 97% of patients on thin liquid and semisolids, respectively. With the increasing impairment, significantly (p < 0.05) increased oral transit times were observed for liquid swallows, and increased pharyngeal transit times for semisolids. Significantly higher proportions of patients presented with penetration/aspiration in the group with more severe esophageal clearance impairment. Results confirm that cervical esophageal clearance impairment is highly prevalent post-C/RT treatment for NPC. Causality cannot be determined from this study; however, this initial evidence supports that esophageal impairment may coexist in patients post NPC, presenting with more severe oral/pharyngeal deficits, and the impact of this on swallow function needs to be considered.

Local incidence of large vessel occlusion is critical in determining the development of thrombectomy service, but reliable data from Asian countries are lacking. Aims: We performed a population-based study to estimate the burden of large vessel occlusion and the service gap for thrombectomy in Hong Kong. Methods: All acute ischemic stroke patients admitted in 2016 to the public healthcare system, which provided 90% of the emergency healthcare in the city, was identified from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority’s central electronic database. The diagnosis of large vessel occlusion was retrospectively verified by two independent cerebrovascular specialists in a randomly sampled cohort based on clinical and neuroimaging data. The incidence of large vessel occlusion in the population was estimated through weighting the sample results and compared with the thrombectomy data in the same period. Results: There were 6859 acute ischemic stroke patients treated in the public health system in 2016. Amongst the 300 patients randomly sampled according to diagnosis coding, 130 suffered from anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. This translated to 918 patients (95% CI 653–1180) and 13.3% of all ischemic stroke patients. The estimated incidence of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion was 12.5 per 100,000 persons per year (95% CI 11.7–13.4). Large vessel occlusion stroke patients were more commonly female than male (67.4% vs. 31.6%, p = 0.003), and were older than non-large vessel occlusion stroke patients (mean of 80.5 years vs. 71.4 years, p = < 0.001). They also had higher 30-day mortality rate (31.1% vs. 4.6%, p = < 0.001), and longer hospital stay (mean 38.6 vs. 21.1 days, p = 0.003) than non-large vessel occlusion stroke. In the same period, 83 thrombectomies for large vessel occlusion were performed, representing 9.1% of the estimated large vessel occlusion incidence. Conclusion: The estimated incidence of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion in the Hong Kong Chinese population is lower than that in the West. There is however a substantial service gap for endovascular thrombectomy with less than 10% of large vessel occlusion patients receiving thrombectomy. ? 2019 World Stroke Organization.",Asia; Chinese; health burden; incidence; ischemic stroke; Large vessel occlusion; thrombectomy,age distribution; aged; Article; blood vessel occlusion; brain ischemia; Chinese; cohort analysis; disease burden; female; human; large vessel occlusion; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; neuroimaging; population research; priority journal; public hospital; sex difference; thrombectomy,2-s2.0-85061739277

The Happy Family Kitchen Movement project, which emphasized the interaction and integration of physical health and psychosocial health, was conducted to promote well-being and health in Hong Kong families. Social workers and teachers from 54 social service units and schools in collaboration with the research team designed and implemented a brief community-based family “holistic health” intervention for 1983 individuals from 1467 families. In a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, participants were allocated into positive physical activity (PPA), positive healthy diet (PHD), or control group. The positive psychology framework, which encompassed joy, gratitude, and savoring, was used to help families build positive attitudes with stronger motivation to engage in health promotion behaviors. Data were collected at pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 1-month and 3-month follow-up. Results showed that compared to the control, PPA was effective in improving subjective happiness at immediately post-intervention and PHD was effective in promoting family harmony at 1-month and subjective happiness at 3-month, with small effect size. Both PPA and PHD showed some evidence of effectiveness on mental quality of life at 3-month. Participants’ evaluation of the program provided evidence for the perceived usefulness of PPA and PHD.

Apart from its well-established physiological role in central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), autonomic nervous system and neuromuscular junction, the widely distributed expression of AChRs in different human organs suggests roles in other biological processes in addition to synaptic transmission. Accumulating evidence revealed that cancer cell processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and even epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are mediated by overexpression of AChRs in different kinds of tumors. In breast cancer, α7-nAChR and α9-nAChR were reported to be oncogenic. On the other hand, research on the role of mAChRs in breast cancer tumorgenesis is limited and confined to M3 receptor only. Since AChRs distributed in both CNS and PNS even non-neuronal tissues, there is an urgent need for the development of subtype-specific AChR antagonist which inhibits cancer cell progression with minimal intervention on the normal acetylcholine-regulated system within human body. ? 2019",Acetylcholine receptors; Cancer development; Muscarinic receptors; Nicotinic receptors,acetylcholine; bungarotoxin receptor; cholinergic receptor; muscarinic M3 receptor; muscarinic receptor; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha9; nicotinic receptor; unclassified drug; angiogenesis; apoptosis; autonomic nervous system; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer growth; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; central nervous system; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetic association; human; neuromuscular junction; peripheral nervous system; priority journal; protein expression; Review; signal transduction; synaptic transmission,2-s2.0-85072194725

H446 and H526 SCLC cells were serially cultured in stepwise increasing concentrations of BCT-100 until stable BCT-100-resistant cell lines emerged (H446-BR and H526-BR). Compared with parent cells, H446-BR and H526-BR displayed stronger migration ability, anoikis resistance and EMT progression. Gene chip assay was employed to select three potential targets (CDH17, CNTN-1 and IGF2BP1). Silencing CNTN-1 rather than CDH17 or IGF2BP1 in H446-BR and H526-BR cells re-sensitized resistant cells to BCT-100 treatment and attenuated the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype.

The current study examined the relationship between medical comorbidities of inpatients with dementia and caregiver burden in adult–child primary caregivers, and the buffering effect of having a secondary caregiver on the relationship between patients’ comorbidities and caregiver burden. The study is a secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional observational study design. The sample comprised 477 dyads of inpatients with dementia and adult–child primary caregivers attending the neurological department of two grade A hospitals. All the inpatients were assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). All the adult–child primary caregivers were assessed with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and completed the questionnaires on socio-demographic data, caring hours, presence of secondary caregiver, and the level of impairment of the patient. Higher burden was associated with higher scores on the CCI and having a spouse of the patient as the secondary caregiver. A significant interaction occurred between the CCI and caregiver burden when having a spouse as the secondary caregiver, indicating the negative effect of the CCI on caregiver burden was greater when the spouse of the patient served as the secondary caregiver. In summary, the negative impact of patients’ comorbidities on caregiver burden in adult–child primary caregivers was heightened when the secondary caregiver role was undertaken by the spouse of the patient with dementia. These results may inform programmes targeted to improve care arrangements for people with dementia and their caregivers. ? 2019 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.",caregiver burden; comorbidity; dementia; hospitalization; secondary caregiver,,2-s2.0-85070735406

In the marine habitat, well-connected populations with large numbers of reproducing individuals are common but even so population structure can exist on a small-scale. Variation in dispersal patterns between populations or over time is often associated to geographic distance or changing oceanographic barriers. Consequently, detecting structure and variation in dispersal on a fine-scale within marine populations still remains a challenge. Here we propose and use a novel approach of combining a clustering model, early-life history trait information from fish otoliths, spatial coordinates and genetic markers to detect very fine-scale dispersal patterns. We collected 1573 individuals (946 adults and 627 juveniles) of the black-faced blenny across a small-scale (2 km) coastline as well as at a larger-scale area (<50 kms). A total of 178 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were used to evaluate relatedness patterns within this well-connected population. In our clustering models we categorized SHORT-range dispersers to be potential local recruits based on their high relatedness within and low relatedness towards other spatial clusters. Local retention and/or dispersal of this potential local recruitment varied across the 2 km coastline with higher frequency of SHORT-range dispersers towards the southwest of the area for adults. An inverse pattern was found for juveniles, showing an increase of SHORT-range dispersers towards the northeast. As we rule out selective movement and mortality from one year to the next, this pattern reveals a complex but not full genetic mixing, and variability in coastal circulation is most likely the main driver of this fine-scale chaotic genetic patchiness within this otherwise homogeneous population. When focusing on the patterns within one recruitment season, we found large differences in temperatures (from approx. 17 °C to 25 °C) as well as pelagic larval duration (PLD) for juveniles from the beginning of the season and the end of the season. We were able to detect fine-scale differences in LONG-range juvenile dispersers, representing distant migrants, depending on whether they were born at the beginning of the season with a longer PLD, or at the end of the reproductive season. The ability to detect such fine-scale dispersal patchiness will aid in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of population structuring and chaotic patchiness in a wide range of species even with high potential dispersal abilities. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,adult; article; driver; female; fish; genetic association; genetic marker; human; human experiment; juvenile; life history trait; major clinical study; male; migrant; mortality; nonhuman; otolith; season; single nucleotide polymorphism,2-s2.0-85070648089

Rapid tests for GUTB are urgently needed because it is often associated with delayed health-care seeking, leading to serious consequences. This study evaluated the performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in the rapid diagnosis of urinary tract tuberculosis (UTB) and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis with urine specimens. In all, 302 patients were included from four hospitals in China. Suspected UTB patients were tested with Xpert, smear, and MGIT 960 culture. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was conducted for culture-positive cases. The performance of the assays was evaluated against MGIT 960 culture and a composite reference standard (CRS). Among all participants, 150 (49.7%) had CRS-positive UTB, of whom 36 (24.0%) were culture-confirmed. Against culture, Xpert and smear achieved a sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI: 81.3–99.3%) and 22.2% (95% CI: 10.1–39.2%), respectively. Against CRS, the sensitivity of Xpert, smear and culture was 41.3% (95% CI: 33.4–49.7%), 7.3% (95% CI: 3.7–12.7%), and 24.0% (95% CI: 17.4–31.6%). Xpert had better performance than smear and culture in detecting UTB from urine samples and could be considered for the diagnosis of UTB.

This study explores the multiple institutional logics underpinning the duality between safety and productivity in the construction industry. Specifically, it explores the tensions between safety and production through an institutional lens by untangling the institutional logics of processing safety in production. A theory of protection, production and reconciling logics is developed and refined through an in-depth case study of heat stress management in a mega-project in Australia. Ethnographic data were collected over a six-day working week on site, interpreted using institutional analysis and conceptualized with a grounded theory approach. The results confirmed the co-existence of the three logics in the power dynamics between employers, unions, regulators and workers. It is found that the production and the protection logic leads to paradoxical effect of their desired goals, and a reconciling logic emerges in the bottom-up initiatives which aims for community building and leads to improvement in both safety and productivity. However, the reconciling logic was found incomplete and handicapped due to the lack of involvement at senior management level and the production side of the project organization. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Construction safety; Heat stress management; Institutional analysis; Productivity analysis; Protection logic; Reconciling logic,Accident prevention; Construction industry; Human resource management; Productivity; Thermal stress; Construction safety; Heat stress; Institutional analysis; Productivity analysis; Protection logic; Reconciling logic; Computer circuits; article; Australia; building industry; disabled person; employer; grounded theory; heat stress; human; logic; multicenter study; productivity; tension; theoretical study; worker; working time,2-s2.0-85069829232

Early observational clinical data suggested that telbivudine (LdT) might have renoprotective effects. Methods: In this prospective study, consecutive CHB patients on combined lamivudine (LAM) + ADV/TDF were switched to LdT + ADV/TDF at recruitment and were followed up for 24?months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the modification of diet in renal disease equation. The effects of LdT on cell viability and expression of kidney injury or apoptotic biomarkers were investigated in cultured renal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2. Results: Thirty-one patients (median age 55?years, 90.3% male) were recruited (54.8% TDF: 45.2% ADV). Serum HBV DNA was undetectable at all time points. Median eGFR was 70.2 (IQR 62.6–77.9) and 81.5 (IQR 63.6–99.1) mL/min/1.73?m2 at baseline and 24?months, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Downstaging of chronic kidney disease was observed in eight (25.8%) patients and was more common in ADV-treated compared to TDF-treated patients (7/8 vs. 1/17, p = 0.011; OR 16, 95% CI 1.643–155.766, p = 0.017). In vitro data showed that adding LdT to ADV or TDF was associated with improved cell viability and lower expression of injury and apoptotic biomarkers compared with ADV or TDF alone. Treatment was prematurely discontinued in four(12.9%) patients due to myalgia. Conclusions: Clinical and in vitro data suggest that LdT has renoprotective effects in patients on long-term ADV/TDF treatment.

We demonstrate that Fcmr (Toso), the putative receptor for soluble IgM, modulates myeloid cell responses to cancer. In a syngeneic melanoma model, Fcmr ablation in myeloid cells suppressed tumor growth and extended mouse survival. Fcmr deficiency increased myeloid cell population density in this malignancy and enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Single-cell RNA sequencing of Fcmr-deficient tumor-associated mononuclear phagocytes revealed a unique subset with enhanced antigen processing/presenting properties. Conversely, Fcmr activity negatively regulated the activation and migratory capacity of myeloid cells in vivo, and T cell activation by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro. Therapeutic targeting of Fcmr during oncogenesis decreased tumor growth when used as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1. Thus, Fcmr regulates myeloid cell activation within the TME and may be a potential therapeutic target. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,"CD11b antigen; CD64 antigen; fluorescein isothiocyanate; immunoglobulin Fc fragment; immunoglobulin M; myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; programmed death 1 receptor; transcription factor; antineoplastic agent; carrier protein; Fcmr protein, mouse; membrane protein; Pdcd1 protein, mouse; programmed death 1 receptor; cell; immunity; tumor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antigen presenting cell; Article; B16 cell line; biochemical analysis; bone marrow cell; bone marrow derived dendritic cell; carcinogenesis; cell isolation; cell migration assay; cell proliferation assay; centrifugation; controlled study; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; experimental melanoma; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; gene ontology; gene sequence; genotype; in vivo study; inguinal lymph node; melanoma; mononuclear phagocyte; mouse; nonhuman; principal component analysis; protein expression; RNA sequence; single cell analysis; survival; T lymphocyte activation; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor growth; tumor immunity; tumor microenvironment; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; antigen presentation; C57BL mouse; cell motion; drug effect; experimental melanoma; genetics; immunology; knockout mouse; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; monocyte; mortality; pathology; skin tumor; survival analysis; T lymphocyte; transplantation; tumor cell line; Animals; Antigen Presentation; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinogenesis; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Female; Lymphocyte Activation; Melanoma, Experimental; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Monocytes; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Skin Neoplasms; Survival Analysis; T-Lymphocytes; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85067544135

Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted during the 2018 winter influenza season. Adult patients with fever/respiratory symptoms (fever/RS group) were age- and sex-matched with patients without fever/RS (non-fever/RS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Respiratory viruses were tested using NxTAG? Respiratory Pathogen Panel IVD, a commercially-available multiplex PCR panel. Results: A total of 214 acutely hospitalized patients were included in the final analysis, consisting of 107 with fever/RS (fever/RS group), and 107 age- and sex-matched patients without fever/RS (non-fever/RS group). Respiratory viruses were detected in 34.1% (73/214) of patients, and co-infection occurred in 7.9% (17/214) of patients.

Siblings (N = 23) provided qualitative data regarding suggestions for new resources and feedback on existing and proposed SuperSibs programs. Qualitative data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. Results: Siblings emphasize the importance of support that is meaningful, age-appropriate, consistently delivered and that offers autonomy. Siblings recommended revised SuperSibs program initiatives, such as yoga instruction, education for parents and teachers, and game-based interventions.

Consequently, TMEM33 reduces intracellular calcium content in a PC2-dependent manner, impairs lysosomal calcium refilling, causes cathepsins translocation, inhibition of autophagic flux upon ER stress, as well as sensitization to apoptosis. Invalidation of TMEM33 in the mouse exerts a potent protection against renal ER stress. By contrast, TMEM33 does not influence pkd2-dependent renal cystogenesis in the zebrafish.

Since cigarette smoke contains mainly submicron and ultrafine particles (UFPs), the harmful effects of the particles in cigarette smoke might be correlated more with number and surface area concentrations of UFPs instead of their mass concentration. To assess these harmful effects, we investigated the size distribution of particles (20 nm to 600 nm) released from sidestream smoke. An experiment was carried out in a two-zone house which was divided into smoking and non-smoking areas. Particle concentrations were measured in both zones and the exposure doses of people in both zones were calculated. The lung cancer risk of UFPs was then analysed by a modified surface area-based risk assessment scheme, which was found to be much closer to the incidence rate of lung cancer. In most of the studied scenarios, the excess lifetime cancer risks to non-smoker occupants exceeded an acceptable level.

Although an association between human and bovine brucellosis has been identified, the spatial relationship has not been studied in South Korea. Here, we analysed the spatial patterns of human and bovine brucellosis retrieved from the human and veterinary surveillance data, as well as the spatial correlation between human and bovine brucellosis and associated factors that contribute to its occurrence. The risk of human brucellosis was analysed using a Bayesian spatial model with potential risk factors. Our results show that, for both human and bovine brucellosis, hotspots were clustered in the southeast regions of Korea, whereas coldspots were clustered in the northwest regions of Korea. Our study suggests that the risk of human brucellosis increases in rural regions with the highest risk of bovine brucellosis. Collaborative strategies between human and veterinary health sectors (e.g, public health intervention and region-specific eradication programs for bovine brucellosis) would reduce the burden of brucellosis in South Korea. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85065095922

However, there are a few studies that examined whether a change in food environment caused risk of obesity after a natural disaster. To address this question, we leveraged a natural experiment of residential relocation in the aftermath of the 2011 Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. Our baseline data came from a nationwide cohort study of older community-dwelling adults conducted 7 months prior to the disaster. By chance, one of the field sites (Iwanuma City, Miyagi Prefecture) was directly in the line of the tsunami. Approximately 2.5 years after the disaster, we ascertained the residential addresses and health status of 3,594 survivors aged 65 years or older (82.1% follow-up rate). Fixed effects multinomial logistic regression showed that shortened distances to food outlets/bars increased the risks of transitioning from BMI in the normal range (18.5–22.9) to obesity (?25.0) (Odds ratios: 1.46 for supermarkets; 1.43 for bars; 1.44 times for fast food outlets).

Upregulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells contributes to malignancy through suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor response. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a glycolytic gate-keeping enzyme, is also known to promote tumor development. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism of regulation of PD-L1 by PDK1 through activation of c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)-c-Jun in ovarian cancer cells. Elevated PDK1 expression was correlated with that of PD-L1 in the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset and ovarian cancer tissue array. Overexpression of PDK1 in ovarian cancer cells impaired CD8+ T cell function by suppressing IFN-γ secretion through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Conversely, knockdown of PDK1 in ovarian cancer cells relieved suppression of CD8+ T cell function. CD8+ T cell apoptosis induced by binding of PD-1 with PD-L1 was increased after co-culture with ovarian cancer cells overexpressing PDK1, while depletion of PDK1 exerted the opposite effect. In vivo experiments revealed synergistic improved overall survival and enhanced inhibition of tumor growth upon co-treatment with dichloroacetate (DCA), a PDK inhibitor, and PD-L1 antibody, accompanied by increased IFN-γ secretion by monocytes infiltrating tumor islets. Moreover, PDK1 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration were inversely correlated in the ovarian cancer tissue array. Our collective findings provide a novel explanation of how PDK1 contributes to upregulation of PD-L1 in ovarian cancer and highlight its potential as a target therapeutic molecule that cooperates with the immune checkpoint blockade. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",CD8+ T cell; Ovarian cancer; PD-1; PD-L1; PDK1,"6 phosphofructo 2 kinase fructose 2,6 biphosphatase 2; 6 phosphofructo 2 kinase fructose 2,6 biphosphatase 3; beta actin; dichloroacetic acid; drug antibody; gamma interferon; glycolytic enzyme; hexokinase; hexokinase 2; immunological antineoplastic agent; lactate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase A; leaf antibody; phosphatase; phosphofructokinase platelet; phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; protein c jun; pyruvate kinase M; stress activated protein kinase; tumor marker; unclassified drug; A2780/CP70 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell culture; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cancer tissue; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell infiltration; cell survival; coculture; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cytokine release; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; drug targeting; enzyme activation; female; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; lymphocyte function; monocyte; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; normal human; ovarian cancer cell line; ovary cancer; OVCAR-3 cell line; overall survival; protein expression level; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; SK-OV-3 cell line; synergistic effect; tissue microarray; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; upregulation",2-s2.0-85071966562

Twenty-four articles were identified and reviewed. Most articles did not even have insights/implications for working with trauma and dissociation survivors regarding the social aspects of their care. None of the articles discussed the potential role of social workers in the assessment or management of complex DD.

For countries at risk of introduction of H7N9, such as Vietnam, early detection of H7N9 virus is essential for the early containment of the virus. Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR (iiRT-PCR) is a portable PCR system that can be deployed under field conditions to identify pathogens at the sampling site. Applying PCR at the sampling site will greatly reduce the time to obtain a diagnostic result which allows the veterinary authority to take immediate action to contain disease spreading. Objective: To determine analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the portable iiRT-PCR for H7N9 virus detection. Methods: A panel of 59 virus isolates, including H7N9, avian influenza viruses of subtype H1 to H13, swine and human influenza viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus, were tested by H7 and N9 iiRT-PCR reagents, using probes and primers specific to H7 or N9, in comparison with laboratory-based real-time RT-PCR assays to determine analytical sensitivity and specificity. Fifty oropharyngeal samples from experimentally infected chicken and ducks with H7N9 and 50 non-infected control swabs were tested by the H7 iiRT-PCR to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Results: The H7 and N9 iiRT-PCR reagents yielded comparable levels of analytical sensitivity and specificity with real-time RT-PCR for the detection of H7N9 virus. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of H7 iiRT-PCR were 98% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: The observed high sensitivity and specificity of iiRT-PCR for H7N9 detection show its potential for early detection of H7N9 in risk-based surveillance. ? 2019 The Authors.

Logistic regressions were conducted to explore factors associated with treatment status. Older adults with SMI, especially major depressive disorder, reported significantly lower rates of treatment than younger group.

Hexokinase II (HKII) is a key metabolic enzyme and is upregulated in multiple cancers. In this study, we examined the impact of targeting metabolism via silencing of HKII on chemoresistance in ovarian cancer (OVCA). In addition, the regulatory molecular mechanism of tumor metabolism was examined using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in epithelial OVCA cell lines of various histological subtypes. We demonstrated that cisplatin (CDDP)-induced p53-mediated HKII downregulation is a determinant of chemosensitivity in OVCA. Silencing of HKII sensitized chemoresistant OVCA cells to apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. As a negative regulator, p53 suppressed HKII transcription by promoter binding and decreased glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key regulator of cell proliferation involved in Akt signaling axis. Our Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and molecular studies also revealed that PDK1, an upstream activator strongly correlates with HKII expression and regulates its metabolic activity. Finally, we demonstrated that the clinically approved drug metformin sensitizes chemoresistant OVCA cells to CDDP via PDK1-HKII pathway. Collectively, our data implicate that p53--PDK1-HKII axis is a central regulatory component of metabolism conferring chemoresistance in OVCA. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",chemoresistance; hexokinase II; metabolism; ovarian cancer; p53,"6 phosphofructokinase; cisplatin; hexokinase; hexokinase ii; lactate dehydrogenase; metformin; proteasome; protein kinase B; protein p53; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase 2; unclassified drug; cisplatin; hexokinase; PDK1 protein, human; protein kinase B; protein p53; TP53 protein, human; aerobic glycolysis; Akt signaling; apoptosis; Article; cancer resistance; cancer survival; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; clinical outcome; controlled study; drug response; drug sensitization; female; gain of function mutation; gene expression profiling; gene knockdown; gene silencing; genetic transcription; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; loss of function mutation; ovary carcinoma; OVCA cell line; overall survival; priority journal; promoter region; protein content; protein degradation; drug effect; drug resistance; drug therapy; gene expression regulation; genetics; nuclear reprogramming; pathology; signal transduction; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Cell Proliferation; Cellular Reprogramming; Cisplatin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hexokinase; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Acetyl-Transferring) Kinase; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",2-s2.0-85071769301

Considering the impact of cultural values on organizational behaviors, vaccination among nurses may also be influenced by cultural values via their impacts on socially oriented motivation and the acceptance of social influence. Objectives: This study examined whether and in what way two individual-level cultural dimensions, collectivism and power distance, would influence vaccination via social benefits (i.e., self-and-clan protection and community protection) and social influence (i.e., authority advice, and family-and-peer advice), respectively, among nurses. Design: A cross-sectional online survey. Setting: An invitation to participate in the survey was sent to nurses using the contact list of a professional nursing organization in Hong Kong and by personal referrals. Participants: A total of 1386 nurses (mean age = 37.82, SD = 10.36; 89% women) completed the survey. Methods: The survey included instruments on cultural values, perceived social benefits, and social influence, and questions regarding 2-year vaccination records. The mediation model was tested using structural equation modeling with bootstrapped samples. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine whether the mediation paths were different across different levels of demographic factors. Results: The structural paths in the mediation model were different between nurses that had been vaccinated in the past and those who had not. In the adoption model (i.e., for nurses non-vaccinated in the past), the positive effects of collectivism on vaccination were mediated by self-and-clan protection and authority advice, whereas the negative effect of collectivism on vaccination was mediated by community protection. In addition, the positive effect of power distance on vaccination was mediated by authority advice. In the maintenance model (i.e., for nurses vaccinated in the past), except for the positive effect of collectivism on vaccination via authority advice, the other indirect effects were not significant. The direct effect of collectivism on vaccination was negative, whereas the direct effect of power distance on vaccination was positive. Conclusions: Collectivism and power distance may guide how nurses attend to and process social information and subsequently influence their vaccination adoption behaviors. More research is needed to examine how cultural dimensions may influence vaccination maintenance and the applicability of the current findings to other cultures. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Culture; Human; Influenza; Nurses; Social benefits; Social influence; Vaccination,adoption; adult; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cultural value; female; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; influenza vaccination; male; nurse; nursing organization; structural equation modeling,2-s2.0-85071683411

Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 CRC survivors. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim for grounded theory analysis. Results: Most CRC survivors interviewed reported making both short- and long-term changes post-diagnosis, influenced by physical symptoms and personal beliefs: short-term treatment-driven changes to facilitate recovery, manage treatment side-effects and avoid disruption in treatment; short-term ‘patient role’ driven changes heavily influenced by family members and cultural beliefs; long-term changes driven by residual symptoms and illness beliefs, including cancer causal attributions and beliefs about preventing future recurrences. Traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) beliefs were influential in both short- and long-term dietary decision-making, which may explain why survivors focused on specific food items rather than food patterns. Conclusion: While our findings suggested that the majority of CRC survivors made dietary changes post-diagnosis, their dietary pattern and motivation may change over the course of their illness trajectory. Also, the types of changes made are often not consistent with existing dietary recommendations. It is necessary to consider illness perception and cultural beliefs when delivering dietary care or developing interventions for this population. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",colorectal cancer; diet modification; nutrition; survivorship,,2-s2.0-85071386039

Text analysis can serve as an important means to decipher stakeholder (dis)agreements. Traditionally, researchers analyze texts using qualitative text analysis. Relying only on qualitative text analysis can no longer be sufficient to handle very large amounts of textual data. Now computational methods can be applied to help extract opinions in electronic texts. Our paper adopts a big data computational text analysis approach (keyword analysis, keyword co-occurrence, thematic analysis), based on a corpus of 2.4 million words, to compare concerns towards air pollution among three stakeholder groups (i.e. the government (GOV), the environmental groups (NGO) and the news media (MEDIA)) in Hong Kong, between 2002 and 2012, a period when air pollution was subject to rigorous policy debates and discussions. Our analysis shows the somewhat different concerns of the stakeholders. The stakeholders focus heavily on emissions and end-of-pipe pollution control. Though the advocation of sustainability since 1990s, the government-led command-and-control approach still dictates the discourse. Sustainability is featured more intensively by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Transboundary pollution (e.g. from Guangdong, China) is not a major concern for all stakeholder groups. Public health is a greater concern in MEDIA, as compared to the other two stakeholder groups. Future air pollution policy-making may direct more of its attention to the pressing concerns over the negative impacts of air pollution on health and its associated costs, with health experts getting more closely involved in the regulatory decision-makings. More information should be given to vulnerable groups, such as young children or workers in polluted environments. To better relate differential health risks of pollution in everyday life, both local and international governments should consider developing more personalized air pollution monitoring and health management systems for their citizens in future. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution; Big data; Computational text analysis; Personalisation; Public health; Stakeholder concerns,air pollution; article; attention; big data; child; decision making; government; health care management; health hazard; Hong Kong; human; monitoring; pollution control; public health; thematic analysis; worker,2-s2.0-85071300764

This study aims to validate the LOCOMO-25 in Chinese patients with chronic low back pain and/or neck pain. Methods: Adult patients with chronic low back pain and/or neck pain completed the LOCOMO-25, SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, ODI, VAS and/or NDI. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α). Test-retest reliability was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients. Construct validity was assessed by Spearman correlation tests against other outcome measures. Sensitivity to detect differences between groups was assessed by Mann–Whitney U or Kruskal–Wallis H test, where appropriate. Intergroup comparison was performed further in terms of domain scores and their changes at test-retest. Results: A total of 111 patients were consecutively recruited. LOCOMO-25 demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.915) and test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation: 0.705 to 0.826). LOCOMO-25 was significantly correlated with all domains of SF-36, EQ-5D, ODI, NDI, and VAS (p < 0.01).

Patients with neural compression scored significantly higher in the domain of pain and patients requiring assistive devices for ambulation scored significantly higher in the domains of ADL and social functions. The minimum detectable differences for various domains of the LOCOMO-25 score included pain (2.76), activities of daily living (6.07), social function (1.59), and mental health status (2.06). Conclusions: LOCOMO-25 has been validated in Chinese patients with chronic low back and neck pain with satisfactory psychometric properties, and with individual domain minimum clinically important differences. There is adequate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity and sensitivity to detect differences between patients with/without neural compression, different ambulatory statuses and pain severity. ? 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association",,25 question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale; adult; aged; Article; Chinese; construct validity; daily life activity; disease duration; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; geriatric assessment; health program; health survey; human; internal consistency; low back pain; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental health; minimum detectable change; motor dysfunction assessment; Neck Disability Index; neck pain; Oswestry Disability Index; outcome assessment; prospective study; Short Form 36; social status; test retest reliability; visual analog scale,2-s2.0-85070548798

We identified five major themes on changes in social stigma, perceived stigma, and stigma coping. Stigmatizing and discriminatory experiences were still common in workplace, healthcare system, and relational aspects but some participants perceived that there were reductions in social stigma. Participants believed that media portrayal and celebrity effect were important in fostering greater acceptance toward people with mental illness and the importance of family support and stigma resistance for minimizing the harmful impacts of stigma.

Its clinical phenotype implies dysfunction of various mental domains, which has motivated a series of theories regarding the underlying pathophysiology. Aiming at a predictive benchmark of a catalog of cognitive functions, we developed a data-driven machine-learning strategy and provide a proof of principle in a multisite clinical dataset (n = 324). Existing neuroscientific knowledge on diverse cognitive domains was first condensed into neurotopographical maps. We then examined how the ensuing meta-analytic cognitive priors can distinguish patients and controls using brain morphology and intrinsic functional connectivity. Some affected cognitive domains supported well-studied directions of research on auditory evaluation and social cognition. However, rarely suspected cognitive domains also emerged as disease relevant, including self-oriented processing of bodily sensations in gustation and pain.

Barrier tissues, like epithelial cells, act as the frontline against circulating tumour cells and their disruption is often regarded as the hallmark of malignancy. Therefore, assessing barrier function is often involved in cancer-related studies and drug screening assays. Limitations of the current existing strategies have, however, led to a need for an accurate, intuitive option that carries the capability of simultaneous bioimaging. Taking advantages of the good biocompatibility and high transconductance, we made use of organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), an emerging bioelectronic platform, to study the effects of intruding cancer cells on normal epithelium monolayer. We performed multichannel recording of 16-channel OECT array to investigate the behaviour of a newly reported nasopharyngeal cancer cell line NPC43 on epithelial cells. Experimental results show that the platform can distinguish NPC43 from other epithelial or cancer cell types and retrieve spatial information during NPC43 invasion. The developed platform is thus envisioned to be a potential non-optical tool for monitoring cancer invasion. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Barrier integrity; Biosensors; Cancer; Organic electrochemical transistor; Semiconductors,Biocompatibility; Biosensors; Cell culture; Diagnosis; Diseases; Semiconductor materials; Transistors; Tumors; Barrier integrity; Cancer; Circulating tumour cells; Multi-channel recording; Nasopharyngeal cancer; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Organic electrochemical transistors; Spatial informations; Cells,2-s2.0-85068258950

Surgery is reserved for locally advanced diseases and salvage for failed chemoradiotherapy. Traditionally, surgery comprises total pharyngolaryngeal esophagectomy and gastric pull-up, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We hereby propose pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy by a transcervical approach, allowing preservation of the esophagus and stomach below, reducing operative morbidity and mortality. Methods: A retrospective review of 31 patients who underwent curative pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy for isolated cervical esophageal tumor at the Department of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2018, was performed. Results: There were 26 male and 5 female patients. Median age was 64.8 years. Seventeen patients underwent definitive surgery. Fourteen patients underwent salvage surgery for failed chemoradiotherapy. Most patients presented with stage III and IV diseases (90.3%). Median length of pharyngoesophageal defect was 14.0 cm (range, 8.0-21.0 cm). Free jejunal flap was used for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction in 77.4%. Eight complications developed in 7 patients (22.6%). There was no in-hospital mortality. Clear radial and longitudinal resection margins were achieved in 96.8%. Median follow-up was 21.5 months. Locoregional recurrence rate was 32.3%. Nine patients died of disease progression (29.0%). Seven died of other causes (22.6%). Median survival was 21.5 months. Overall 2-year survival rate was 36.7%. Conclusions: Transcervical pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy should be considered in patients with isolated cervical esophageal tumors. Pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy allows adequate tumor resection while preserving the esophagus and stomach below. Operative morbidity and mortality outcomes were improved without compromising oncologic control. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",,"adult; aged; Article; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; disease exacerbation; esophagus; esophagus cancer; esophagus resection; female; follow up; Hong Kong; hospital mortality; human; laryngectomy; male; morbidity; mortality; operation duration; pharyngectomy; priority journal; recurrence risk; retrospective study; stomach; surgical margin; survival rate; trachea resection; treatment failure; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; esophagoscopy; esophagus resection; esophagus tumor; middle aged; procedures; prognosis; salvage therapy; surgery; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chemoradiotherapy; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Esophagoscopy; Esophagus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85072260172

This study aimed to analyze the survival outcome of hepatectomy for this patient population. Methods: From January 1995 to December 2014, 2522 patients with liver cancer received hepatectomy at our hospital. Twenty-one of them, all female, received the operation for breast cancer liver metastasis. Performance was compared with patients with colorectal liver metastasis treated with hepatectomy after propensity score analysis in a ratio of 1:3. Results: Twenty-one patients received hepatectomy for breast cancer. After propensity score matching, 63 patients who had hepatectomy for colorectal cancer were selected for comparison. There was no significant difference in immediate or short-term outcomes between the two groups of patients in terms of operative time, blood loss and surgical morbidities. All patients with breast cancer had R0 resection. No hospital death occurred. After hepatectomy, the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 100.0%, 58.9% and 58.9% respectively in patients with breast cancer. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 95.0%, 57.2% and 39.7% respectively in patients with colorectal cancer (P = 0.572). On multivariate analysis, triple negative status was the only independent poor prognostic factor in breast cancer liver metastasis (OR = 6.411; 95% CI: 1.351–30.435; P = 0.019). Conclusions: Hepatectomy is a safe and effective way of treating breast cancer liver metastasis at experienced centers where multidisciplinary adjuvant treatments are available.

Without this understanding, we lose the opportunity to create evidence-based environmental interventions that promote mental health for tens of millions of sweatshop workers worldwide. This participatory smartphone-photography survey (PSPS) study focuses on a large manufacturing factory in China where many suicides have occurred. 79 factory workers photographed 237 outdoor factory sites and then answered questions about the environmental qualities of the photographed sites, as well as their stress and anxiety status.

However, no vaccine is currently available to prevent ZIKV infection. Here, we report the development of a yeast-derived subunit protein vaccine for ZIKV. The envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV was produced as a secretory protein in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The yeast-derived EDIII could inhibit ZIKV infection in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it had acquired an appropriate conformation to bind to cellular receptors of ZIKV. Immunization with recombinant EDIII protein effectively induced antigen-specific binding antibodies and cellular immune responses. The resulting anti-EDIII sera could efficiently neutralize ZIKV representative strains from both Asian and African lineages. Passive transfer with the anti-EDIII neutralizing sera could confer protection against lethal ZIKV challenge in mice. Importantly, we found that purified anti-EDIII antibodies did not cross-react with closely related dengue virus (DENV) and therefore did not enhance DENV infection. Collectively, our results demonstrate that yeast-produced EDIII is a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine candidate. ? 2019 The Authors",EDIII domain; Neutralizing antibody; Vaccine; Yeast; Zika virus,envelope protein; neutralizing antibody; Zika virus vaccine; animal experiment; animal model; antigen binding; Article; cellular immunity; controlled study; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; vaccine production; yeast; Zika fever,2-s2.0-85070515769

In this single-arm, open-label, phase 3, deferred treatment study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir among patients randomized to the placebo group in the ASTRAL-1 study. Patients received sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400/100?mg) once daily for 12?weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response 12?weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12). The primary safety endpoint was any adverse events (AEs) leading to the permanent discontinuation of study drug. Overall, 108/111 (97%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 92%-99%) achieved SVR12, and only one patient had virological failure. SVR12 was achieved by 61/63 (97%, 95%CI, 89%-100%) genotype 1 patients, 20/20 (100%; 95%CI, 83%-100%) with genotype 2, 19/19 (100%; 95%CI, 82%-100%) with genotype 4 and 8/9 (89%; 95% CI, 52%-100%) with genotype 6.

Methods: The PubMed database was searched to identify MR cancer studies until December 31, 2017. Two of the authors independently selected and evaluated reporting quality of the studies. Reporting quality in MR studies before 2016 and in 2016/17 was compared. Results: Cancer studies with MR analyses in 2016 and 2017 accounted for 55.8% of the total number of studies identified. In the 77 eligible articles, 39 (50.6%) did not report subjects’ characteristics, 53 (68.8%) did not conduct power estimation, 40 (51.9%) did not state all of the first three MR assumptions (i.e., genetic instrument is associated with exposure, is not associated with confounders, and acts on outcome only through exposure), and 31 (40.3%) did not exclude SNPs that diverged from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. More studies estimated power in 2016/2017 than before 2016 (p = 0.028). Conclusions: Some MR cancer studies did not sufficiently report essential information, posing obstacles for critical appraisal.

Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) was identified as one of the most downregulated genes by transcriptomic analysis of normal esophageal/ESCC paired tissue samples. ECM1 plays oncogenic roles in cancer development in various cancer types. However, little is known about its role in ESCC. In vivo and in vitro functional assays coupled with analyses on public datasets and detailed molecular and mechanistic analyses were used to study the gene. We demonstrate that as opposed to the previously identified oncogenic role of ECM1a, ECM1b is a novel tumor suppressor in ESCC. ECM1 is significantly downregulated in ESCC and several other squamous cell carcinomas. ECM1b encodes a cellular protein that suppresses MYC protein expression and MTORC1 signaling activity. MTORC2 inactivation leads to suppressed MYC expression and MTORC1 signaling. ECM1b localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and suppresses MTORC2 activation by inhibiting MTORC2/ribosome association. By regulating MTORC2/MYC/MTORC1 signaling, ECM1b suppresses general protein translation and enhances chemosensitivity. We provide evidence establishing a novel role of ECM1 in cancer that suggests ECM1b as a biomarker for ESCC disease management. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.Significance of the results outlined in no more than 5 sentences: We demonstrate a novel tumor-suppressive role of ECM1 in ESCC, as opposed to the previously well-established oncogenic role in other cancer types.

Ultrasound spinous process angle (USSPA) and ultrasound laminae angle (USLA) were measured on sagittal ultrasound images, while the Cobb angle (XCA) was measured on sagittal X-ray images. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for the intra- and inter-observer variability, linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman method, including mean absolute difference (MAD), were investigated to evaluate the reliability and validity of the two ultrasound angles compared with XCA. Excellent measurement reliabilities were demonstrated for both ultrasound angles (ICC ? 0.91). Moderate to good and significant linear correlations and good agreement were demonstrated between the ultrasound methods and XCA (Thoracic [R2 ? 0.574] / Lumbar [R2 ? 0.635]). No significant differences were found for the MADs between both corrected ultrasound angles and XCA. Sagittal ultrasound angles were demonstrated to be reliable for assessing sagittal curvature using spinous processes and laminae and to have good and significant correlations with XCAs.

Twenty-five studies were identified with a total of 1918 participants. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index was the most commonly used outcome measurement tool, and moderate-intensity walking was the most frequently used intervention. The majority of the included subjects were breast cancer patients. Overall, walking significantly improved sleep disturbance compared to yoga (p = 0.01). Statistically significant moderators included adherence rate for walking (p < 0.001) and allocation concealment and outcome measurement tool for yoga (p = 0.04; p = 0.03).

A total of 583 and 431 patients were surveyed and completed SF-12v2 at baseline and at 12-month follow-up interviews, respectively. Using global rating of change scale as an external anchor, the responsiveness was assessed by linear mixed effect models, multiple linear regression models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: SF-12v2 managed to detect negative changes among hypertensive patients in worsened general health group but failed to identify changes among hypertensive patients in improved general health group. Meanwhile, some domains of SF-12v2 detected a significant difference in difference between patients of worsened and stable/improved group and between patients of stable and improved group, but none of the domains and the summary scales reached the recommended standard of 0.7 in any comparisons in ROC analysis. Conclusions: The SF-12v2 was responsive to worsening of HRQOL but not to improvements in HRQOL among hypertensive patients. The overall responsiveness of SF-12v2 in hypertensive patients is unsatisfactory. Further studies are needed to identify HRQOL measures with good internal and external responsiveness for hypertensive patients. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Health-related quality of life (HRQOL); Hypertension (HT); Primary care; Responsiveness; Short Form-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2),adult; article; Chinese; controlled study; female; follow up; human; hypertensive patient; interview; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; multiple linear regression analysis; primary medical care; prospective study; quality of life; receiver operating characteristic; Short Form 12; Asian continental ancestry group; health survey; middle aged; primary health care; procedures; quality of life; questionnaire; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85067196186

We study the potential mental health consequences of migration by comparing Mexican migrants to the United States who have since returned to Mexico with Mexicans who have never migrated. Methods: Data from the Mexican Migration Project were used to compare returned migrants and non-migrants in Mexico for the years 2007–2016 (N = 7716). Random intercept logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between characteristics of migration and psychiatric problems. Coarsened exact matching was implemented to account for the selection bias inherent to migration. Results: Relatively healthier Mexicans were more likely to migrate to the United States, regardless of their documentation status. Returned migrants in Mexico who traveled to the United States while undocumented were significantly more likely to report that they experienced psychiatric problems when compared with non-migrant Mexicans, even after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, pre-migration health, and community-level factors. Conclusions: Undocumented return migrants in Mexico are at-risk of developing psychiatric problems, despite evidence that suggests migrants tend to be healthier than non-migrants before they travel to the United States. Mental health services should encompass strategies for migrants on both sides of the border. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Mental health; Mexico; Migration; Selection bias,adult; ethnology; female; health status; human; male; mental disease; Mexico; migration; psychology; statistical model; undocumented immigrant; United States; Adult; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Disorders; Mexico; Transients and Migrants; Undocumented Immigrants; United States,2-s2.0-85064217045

This study examined the associations between acculturative stress, disability, and health treatment utilization among Asian and Latin American immigrants in the United States. Methods: Data were from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a nationally representative survey of Asians and Latinos living in the United States. The analytic sample contained 2653 immigrants. We utilized multivariable logistic regression and negative binomial regression analyses to examine the associations between acculturative stress and disability domains. We also examined the association between acculturative stress and treatment utilization, as this may have implications for how to best intervene to address any functional disability related to acculturative stress. Results: Acculturative stress was significantly associated with self-reported disability across five domains: self-care, cognition, mobility, time out of role, and social interaction. Additionally, acculturative stress was significantly associated with a greater frequency of disability domains. Acculturative stress was not significantly associated with utilization of services from mental health or general health sectors, but was significantly and positively associated with utilization of non-health care services. The findings were robust regarding the inclusion of everyday discrimination as well as demographic and socioeconomic covariates. Conclusions: Acculturative stress may be an important yet overlooked correlate of disability among immigrants in the United States. Non-health care services may provide an effective pathway for intervening for these individuals. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Acculturative stress; Disability; Discrimination; Migration; Treatment,"adult; Asian American; cultural factor; disabled person; epidemiology; ethnology; female; Hispanic; human; male; mental stress; middle aged; migrant; patient attitude; psychology; self report; statistical model; United States; young adult; Acculturation; Adult; Asian Americans; Disabled Persons; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Self Report; Stress, Psychological; United States; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85063230421

Burnout has been shown to negatively affect both the personal lives and professional performance of doctors. Orthopaedic surgery is a challenging specialty, and while burnout has been studied in orthopaedic surgeons, a comprehensive review article in this area is lacking. Hence we performed a systematic review to summarise the evidence regarding burnout in orthopaedic surgeons. We conducted a systematic literature review using the terms “orthopaedic surgeons” and “burnout” and related terms. Studies were reviewed by two independent reviewers. English articles that were (a) peer-reviewed original research articles; (b) measures burnout directly in study participants; (c) uses validated scales for burnout assessment; and (d) on orthopaedic surgeons, were included. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by panel discussion. 216 papers were identified and 14 papers were selected for qualitative synthesis. The prevalence of burnout varied considerably between orthopaedic surgeons from different centres and of different seniority. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the burnout rate in orthopaedic surgeons is different from doctors in other specialties. A range of risk factors and protective factors associated with burnout were identified. Similar to prior studies in the general medical population, key determinants of burnout included personal, family, working environment and career factors. One paper identified an association between burnout and irritable behaviour during operation, yet no studies have assessed the effect of burnout on orthopaedic patient outcomes. We did not identify papers on the management of burnout in orthopaedic surgeons. To conclude, the evidence on burnout in orthopaedic surgeons is preliminary and key methodological limitations have been noted in the current studies. Large-scale prospective studies are warranted to better understand the determinants and effects of burnout in orthopaedic surgeons, in order to guide appropriate interventions against this occupational mental health hazard. ? 2019 Delhi Orthopedic Association",Orthopaedic surgeon; Orthopaedics; Professional burnout; Psychological stress,career; emotional stress; family; human; irritability; mental health; orthopedic surgeon; prevalence; priority journal; professional burnout; Review; risk factor; systematic review; work environment,2-s2.0-85061082708

Method: Ninety-six adult participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (52 participants) or the wait-list control group. The role of self-transformation, measured by the Perceived Self-Transformation Scale, in the relationship between affects and mental health problems was examined using mediation analyses. Results: After the workshop, the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of self-transformation (η2 =.308, p &lt;.001), as well as significant improvement (p &lt;.001) in positive (η2 =.557) and negative (η2 =.293) affects, self-esteem (η2 =.538), spirituality (η2 =.473), and mental health problems (η2 =.386). Importantly, increased self-transformation after the workshop partially mediated the relationship between reduced negative affect and mental health problems in the intervention group (indirect effect: β = 0.163, 95% confidence interval [0.035, 0.343]).

A combination of chemotherapy with indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibition was explored to enhance the chemotherapeutic efficacy in vivo. Hydrophobic celastrol (CLT) and hydrophilic 1-methyltryptophan (MT) were concurrently loaded in HA coated cationic albumin nanoparticles (HNPs) with an average size of ?300 nm. The size of HNPs was reduced in the presence of hyaluronidase to facilitate penetration into deep tumor tissues. Also, the biodistribution study in the C57BL/6 mice xenograft model showed enhanced tumor accumulation and prolonged circulation of HNPs. Compared with CLT solution, the combination of CLT with MT showed significantly enhanced tumor inhibition in both xenograft and orthotopic pancreatic cancer mice models via downregulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the combination of CLT with MT administered via HNPs represents a highly promising strategy for targeted pancreatic cancer therapy. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chemotherapy; Diseases; Drug delivery; Mammals; Nanoparticles; Tumors; Albumin nanoparticles; Hierarchical assemblies; Hierarchical Nanostructures; Negatively charged; Pancreatic cancers; Small-molecule drugs; Tumor accumulation; Tumor microenvironment; Hyaluronic acid; 1-methyltryptophan; albuminoid; biocompatible coated material; hyaluronic acid; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; nanoparticle; tripterine; triterpene; tryptophan; tumor protein; animal; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; enzymology; female; human; immunology; immunotherapy; mouse; pancreas tumor; pathology; tumor cell line; tumor microenvironment; Albumins; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Immunotherapy; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Mice; Nanoparticles; Neoplasm Proteins; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Triterpenes; Tryptophan; Tumor Microenvironment; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85072133915

Radical prostatectomy is a common treatment option in patients with localised disease. Post-prostatectomy incontinence (PPI) is not uncommon, with a significant impact on the quality of life. However, it is often under-reported and undertreated. There are no standard international guidelines specifically for investigation and diagnosis of PPI. The routine use of urodynamic studies (UDS), with an attempt to assess urinary incontinence aetiology and to predict success prior to invasive surgical treatment, has been widely adopted but remains controversial. Recent Findings: Literature concerning the pros and cons of pre-operative UDS is reviewed. There are conflicting results on UDS findings post-prostatectomy. Few studies demonstrated that UDS findings are not predictive of outcomes of the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS). Other studies have shown the presence of detrusor overactivity (DO) to be an adverse prognostic factor, especially for PPI patients treated with male sling success. Currently, there is no consensus on the indication for UDS in patients with PPI. Summary: Despite conflicting results on the usefulness of UDS prior to PPI surgery, the majority of surgeons still routinely perform UDS pre-operatively. Further prospective and randomised controlled studies would be beneficial in determining if routine UDS is required before surgical treatment for PPI. The authors also gave their perspective on the application of personalised UDS in investigating patients PPI prior to treatment. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Post-prostatectomy incontinence; Radical prostatectomy; Urodynamics; Voiding dysfunction post-prostatectomy,bladder obstruction; conservative treatment; dysuria; electrostimulation; erectile dysfunction; hematuria; human; inflammation; lifestyle modification; lower urinary tract symptom; male; minimally invasive procedure; nocturia; overactive bladder; pelvic floor muscle training; physical examination; post prostatectomy incontinence; postvoid residual urine volume; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; quality of life; Review; sphincterotomy; stress incontinence; urinalysis; urine incontinence; urine retention; urodynamics,2-s2.0-85069665955

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the role of DLC2 and its downstream cascade of RhoA/ROCK in formalin-induced inflammatory pain using DLC2-knockout (DLC2?/?) mice and compared them with DLC2 wild-type (DLC2+/+) mice. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated using von Frey filament aesthesiometer and Hargreaves test, respectively. The spinal cord dorsal horn (L3-L5) was selected for molecular and cellular identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence. DLC2?/? mice showed increased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Expression of ROCK1, ROCK2 and IL-1β was significantly higher in DLC2?/? mice. Intrathecal administration of RhoA inhibitor (C3 exoenzyme) or ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) significantly attenuated formalin-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia in DLC2?/? mice. ROCK2 and IL-1β expression were reduced by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632. Spinal p38 activation was also inhibited by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632. Double-labelling immunofluorescence demonstrated co-localization of DLC2 with spinal dorsal microglia. The number of activated microglia in the spinal dorsal horn was significantly higher in DLC2?/? mice, but was reduced by Y27632. These findings indicate that DLC2 deficiency increased formalin-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia through regulating RhoA/ROCK2, and IL-1β may be a downstream effector. Our results also suggest that RhoA/ROCK enhanced p38 activation plays an important role in formalin-induced inflammatory pain. The finding that DLC2 attenuated inflammatory pain through inhibiting RhoA/ROCK2 suggests that the DLC2/RhoA/ROCK2/p38/IL-β pathway may be a potential therapeutic target to reduce inflammatory pain. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Deleted in Liver Cancer 2 (DLC2); IL-1β; Inflammatory pain; Microglia; p38; RhoA ROCK,4 (1 aminoethyl) n (4 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; deleted in liver cancer 2; exoenzyme C3; interleukin 1beta; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; synaptophysin; tumor protein; unclassified drug; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; formalin-induced pain; Hargreaves test; hyperalgesia; immunofluorescence; inflammatory pain; knockout mouse; male; mechanical allodynia; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; spinal cord dorsal horn; thermal hyperalgesia; von Frey test; Western blotting; wild type mouse,2-s2.0-85069665583

Methods: Forty LADA patients, 29 T2DM patients, 26 obesity patients without diabetes, and 76 healthy controls were enrolled in Department of Metabolism & Endocrinology, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Serum PR3 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The differences of serum PR3 among the four groups were compared. The correlation between serum PR3 and other metabolic indexes was analyzed. The value of serum PR3 in the differential diagnosis between LADA and T2DM was evaluated. Results: There was no significant difference in age among LADA patients, T2DM patients, obesity patients without diabetes and healthy controls [(50±13) years, (49±6) years, (49±6) years vs (47±7) years, P=0.254], while there was significant difference in gender among the four groups (χ(2)=18.28, P<0.001).

As new biologics become increasingly widespread in treatment regimens, it is important to understand their safety and utilization in the post-marketing context. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate long-term prescribing patterns and the safety of biologics in real clinical settings in Hong Kong. Methods: This was a population-based drug utilization study in Hong Kong using a territory-wide electronic medical database Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS). Patients who received biologic treatments from 2001 to 2015 were identified and their corresponding demographic and clinical details retrieved from CDARS. The annual prevalence of biologic prescriptions, the long-term retention rates and incidence rates of infections associated with biologic treatments were evaluated. Results: A total of 30,298 patients (male: 44%) prescribed biologic treatments were identified from CDARS from 2001 to 2015. The annual prevalence of biologic prescriptions increased from 0.1 to 16.1 per 100 persons for both sexes. Infliximab had the highest first-year retention rate of 95.6% among all biologics and continuously attained the highest retention rate from second to fifth year. The overall incidence rate of serious infections was less than five per 100 person-years. Specifically, the incidence rates of tuberculosis, upper and lower respiratory infections and herpes zoster were 0.52, 3.24, 4.99 and 1.01 per 100 person-years, respectively. Conclusion: This population-based study revealed an increasing prevalence of biologic prescribing. Results from the study described the long-term retention rates and incidence rates of serious infections of biologic treatments for all indications, and confirmed the safety of biologic treatments. Since this study provides an overview of all biologic utilization, further studies on cost effectiveness, safety and compliance of treatment in different patient groups are still warranted. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,abatacept; adalimumab; aflibercept; basiliximab; bevacizumab; biological product; cetuximab; denosumab; etanercept; golimumab; infliximab; palivizumab; panitumumab; ranibizumab; rituximab; thymocyte antibody; tocilizumab; trastuzumab; ustekinumab; adult; aged; arthralgia; Article; chronic kidney failure; cost effectiveness analysis; drug safety; drug utilization; female; health care personnel; herpes zoster; Hong Kong; human; infant; infection; infection risk; leukemia; lower respiratory tract infection; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; population research; prescription; priority journal; psoriasis; respiratory syncytial virus infection; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; treatment duration; tuberculosis; upper respiratory tract infection,2-s2.0-85067227323

Areas covered: In this article, we give a brief overview of the most important molecular technologies we use for identification of emerging microbes associated with unexplained infectious syndromes, including 16S rRNA and other conserved targets sequencing for bacteria, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and other target gene sequencing for fungi, polymerase and other gene sequencing for viruses, as well as deep sequencing. Then, we use several representative examples to illustrate how these techniques have been used for the discoveries of a few notable bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens associated with unexplained infectious syndromes in the last 20–30 years. Expert opinion: In the past and present, characterization of emerging pathogens of unexplained infectious disease syndromes has relied on a combination of conventional culture- and phenotype-based technologies and nucleic acid amplification and sequencing. In the next era, we envisage more widespread adoption of next generation technologies that can detect both known and previously undescribed pathogens. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",bacterium; fungus; Infectious disease; novel microbe; virus,antifungal agent; internal transcribed spacer; RNA 16S; antifungal resistance; Candida auris; candidiasis; community acquired infection; critically ill patient; epidemic; gastroenteritis; Gram negative bacterium; hospital infection; human; infection; infection control; intestine lipodystrophy; Laribacter hongkongensis; microbial identification; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; molecular diagnosis; molecular genetics; nonhuman; onychomycosis; Review; SARS coronavirus; traveller diarrhea; Tropheryma whipplei; viral respiratory tract infection,2-s2.0-85070525670

Etiology-associated dysregulation of immune-associated (IA) genes may be central to the development of this differential clinical response. We identified immune-associated genes potentially dysregulated by alcohol or viral hepatitis B in HCC and validated alcohol-induced dysregulations in vitro while using large-scale RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thirty-four clinically relevant dysregulated IA genes were identified. We profiled the correlation of all genomic alterations in HCC patients to IA gene expression while using the information theory-based algorithm REVEALER to investigate the molecular mechanism for their dysregulation and explore the possibility of genome-based patient stratification. We also studied gene expression regulators and identified multiple microRNAs that were implicated in HCC pathogenesis that can potentially regulate these IA genes’ expression. Our study identified potential key pathways, including the IL-7 signaling pathway and TNFRSF4 (OX40)-NF-κB pathway, to target in immunotherapy treatments and presents microRNAs as promising therapeutic targets for dysregulated IA genes because of their extensive regulatory roles in the cancer immune landscape. ? 2019 by the authors.

We examined six potential associations of objectively-measured access to private recreational facilities (e.g., fitness centres, swimming pools) and parks with adults’ non-walking LTPA (e.g., swimming, cycling, tennis), using data gathered with consistent methods from adults living in international cities with a range of environment attributes. The potential effects of socio-demographic moderators and between-city variations were also examined. Data from 6725 adults from 10 cities (6 countries) were gathered. Adults were more likely to engage in non-walking LTPA if they had a greater number of private recreational facilities within 0.5 or 1 km of the home, particularly in women, and if they lived closer to a park. The amount of non-zero LTPA was only associated (positively) with the number of recreational facilities within 1 km. Relationships between amount of LTPA and park proximity appear complex, with likely contextual and cultural differences. Improving access to private recreational facilities could promote non-walking LTPA, especially in women. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Geographic information systems; Moderation; Parks; Physical activity; Recreation facilities,accessibility; data set; GIS; physical activity; private land; recreational facility; sport; womens status; adult; article; city; female; geographic information system; health center; human; human experiment; major clinical study; recreation; swimming pool; tennis,2-s2.0-85071866469

To obtain a better understanding of the emergence of MRSL, this study characterized the structure and content of the SCCmec elements harboured by 36 MRSL isolates obtained from diverse sources in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2017. The isolates were investigated by whole-genome sequencing. SCCmec types and subtypes were assigned according to the guidelines from the International Working Group on the Classification of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome Elements. The sequence type (ST)-SCCmec combinations in the 36 MRSL isolates were as follows: ST3-SCCmec IV (n=2), ST3-SCCmec V (n=28), ST27-SCCmec V (n=5) and ST42-SCCmec V (n=1). The two SCCmec IV elements were highly similar to the SCCmec IV element harboured by the community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strain, JCSC6668. The J3-mec complex-J2 regions in the SCCmec V elements were highly similar to the corresponding regions in the CA-MRSA strains PM1 (n=13) or WIS (n=21). Based on the J1 to J3 sequences, the SCCmec V elements can be categorized into nine different subtypes.

However, the key components of coal that drive lung cancer risk have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the relationship between lifelong exposure to the constituents of smoky coal (and other fuel types) and lung cancer. METHODS: Using a population-based case-control study of lung cancer among 1,015 never-smoking female cases and 485 controls, we examined the association between exposure to 43 household air pollutants and lung cancer. Pollutant predictions were derived from a comprehensive exposure assessment study, which included methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have never been directly evaluated in an epidemiological study of any cancer. Hierarchical clustering and penalized regression were applied in order to address high colinearity in exposure variables. RESULTS: The strongest association with lung cancer was for a cluster of 25 PAHs [odds ratio (OR): 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.67, 2.87 per 1 standard deviation (SD) change], within which 5-methylchrysene (5-MC), a mutagenic and carcinogenic PAH, had the highest individual observed OR (5.42; 95% CI: 0.94, 27.5). A positive association with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was also observed (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.49). By contrast, neither benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) nor fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ?2:5 lm (PM2:5) were associated with lung cancer in the multipollutant models. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the association between lung cancer and household air pollution (HAP) constituents estimated over the entire life course. Given the global ubiquity of coal use domestically for indoor cooking and heating and commercially for electric power generation, our study suggests that more extensive monitoring of coal combustion products, including methylated PAHs, may be warranted to more accurately assess health risks and develop prevention strategies from this exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4913. ? 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Genome analysis revealed that the structurally and functionally important features of other NDVs were also present in this dromedary NDV genome. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and complete polyprotein showed that the virus belonged to sub-genotype VIg of class II NDV and is most closely related to pigeon NDVs in Egypt in the same year.

Methods: This was a retrospective study involving patients with cervical myelopathy who underwent ACDF surgery with stand-alone tricortical iliac autograft between 2006 and 2016, with a minimum 2-year postoperative follow-up. Outcomes included the change in Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores clinically and timing of fusion, graft height and C2–7 angle measured on lateral radiographs. Any complication such as neurological deterioration, non-union, graft collapse or loss of angle was recorded. Delayed union was considered as radiological union identified only beyond postoperative 6 months. Risk factors including age, smoking, drinking, comorbidities and operative levels were analysed through a multivariate regression for their respective influences on the various outcomes. Results: Of the 69 patients studied, none of the patients had non-union, while 33 (47.1%) achieved fusion in 6 months. The most common complications were anterior protrusion of graft (5.8%) and hoarseness (2.9%). The 1-year mean change in JOA score was 3.9 ± 2.7. The C2–7 angle gradually became more kyphotic, despite an initial lordosis correction intraoperatively. The graft height also gradually collapsed during subsequent follow-ups. Multivariate regression model suggested that diabetics (cumulative odds ratio 7.4) and drinkers (cumulative odds ratio 8.6) were associated with delayed union. Conclusion: ACDF using tricortical iliac crest autograft has satisfactory outcomes with low occurrence of complications. Diabetics and drinkers were predictors of delayed union. ?

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a territory-wide cohort study of patients aged ?45 years who had received clarithromycin-based triple therapy for HP infection between 2003 and 2012 in Hong Kong. Data were retrieved from a public electronic health database. Observation started from receipt of therapy for HP infection to GC diagnosis, death, or the end of the study (December 2015). Exclusion criteria included type 1 DM, GC diagnosed within the 1st year of HP therapy, prior GC or gastrectomy, and retreatment for HP infection. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of GC with type 2 DM was calculated by using a Cox model that adjusted for 20 covariates (age, sex, comorbidities, and medications) through propensity score regression. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 7.1 years (interquartile range 4.8-9.3 years), 153 of 46,460 patients (0.33%) developed GC at a median age of 72.4 years. Type 2 DMwas associated with an increased risk of GC (aHR 1.73 [95% CI 1.08-2.79]).

One reason could be that right-sided adenomas are frequently missed in colonoscopy examinations. We reanalyzed data from tandem colonoscopies to assess adenoma miss rates in relation to location and other factors. Methods: We pooled data from 8 randomized tandem trials comprising 2218 patients who had diagnostic or screening colonoscopies (adenomas detected in 49.8% of patients). We performed a mixed-effects logistic regression with patients as cluster effects with different independent parameters. Factors analyzed included location (left vs right, splenic flexure as cutoff), adenoma size, form, and histologic features. Analyses were controlled for potential confounding factors such as patient sex and age, colonoscopy indication, and bowel cleanliness. Results: Right-side location was not an independent risk factor for missed adenomas (odds ratio [OR] compared with the left side, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75–1.17). However, compared with adenomas ?5 mm, the OR for missing adenomas of 6–9 mm was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44–0.87), and the OR for missing adenomas of ?10 mm was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.33–0.77). Compared with pedunculated adenomas, sessile (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.16–2.85) and flat adenomas (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.49–4.10) were more likely to be missed. Histologic features were not significant risk factors for missed adenomas (OR for adenomas with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.34–1.37 and OR for sessile serrated adenomas, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.47–1.64 compared with low-grade adenomas). Men had a higher number of adenomas per colonoscopy (1.27; 95% CI, 1.21–1.33) than women (0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93). Men were less likely to have missed adenomas than women (OR for missed adenomas in men, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.94). Conclusions: In an analysis of data from 8 randomized trials, we found that right-side location of an adenoma does not increase its odds for being missed during colonoscopy but that adenoma size and histologic features do increase risk. Further studies are needed to determine why adenomas are more frequently missed during colonoscopies in women than men. ? 2019 AGA Institute",Colorectal Cancer; Comparison; Detection; Endoscopy,Article; colonoscopy; colorectal adenoma; human; Medline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; systematic review; tumor localization; tumor volume; adenomatous polyp; aged; cancer grading; colon polyp; colorectal tumor; diagnostic error; early cancer diagnosis; female; male; middle aged; pathology; predictive value; procedures; sex factor; time factor; Adenomatous Polyps; Aged; Colonic Polyps; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diagnostic Errors; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Predictive Value of Tests; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Tumor Burden,2-s2.0-85070739610

However, studies examining the use of eHealth applications in the Chinese population are scarce. The study reports on the characteristics of eHealth applications in Hong Kong information and communication technology (ICT) users, their attitudes towards eHealth, and their reasons for not using eHealth applications. A cross-sectional random-digit dialing survey targeting adults using ICT was conducted in Hong Kong to elicit information on respondents’ use of and attitudes towards eHealth. A total of 495 ICT users completed the survey, of whom 353 (71.3%) were eHealth users. A smartphone was the most frequent way of performing eHealth activities (71.7%). The most prevalent eHealth activity was reading about health/illness (86.4%), with 93.5% indicating that eHealth applications improved their understanding of health care issues. People with less education were less likely to use eHealth applications. Non-eHealth users indicated that the main reasons for not using eHealth applications were lack of interest in health information (49.3%) and lack of confidence in the reliability of online information (45.1%). Quality monitoring of health information available on ICTs and tailoring the design and readability are recommended to meet the needs of those seeking health resources and to promote eHealth. Evidence from the study demonstrates the potential of eHealth to improve the dissemination of health information in Hong Kong, and it provides a basis for improving eHealth integration. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cell phone; eHealth; Health information; Information science; Internet; Smartphone; Survey,adult; Article; attitude to health; chronic disease; cross-sectional study; disability; female; health status; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; medical informatics; medical information; patient education; random digit dialing; telehealth; adolescent; attitude; consumer health information; Internet; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; smartphone; socioeconomics; telemedicine; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Consumer Health Information; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Smartphone; Socioeconomic Factors; Telemedicine; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85069433487

High doses of TCDD were commonly employed in experimental animals to illustrate its diabetogenic effects. Data linking the epigenetic effects of low doses of TCDD on embryonic cells to T2D susceptibility risks is very limited. To address whether low dose exposure to TCDD would affect pancreatic development, hESCs pretreated with TCDD at concentrations similar to human exposure were differentiated towards pancreatic lineage cells, and their global DNA methylation patterns were determined. Our results showed that TCDD-treated hESCs had impaired pancreatic lineage differentiation potentials and altered global DNA methylation patterns. Four of the hypermethylated genes (PRKAG1, CAPN10, HNF-1B and MAFA) were validated by DNA bisulfite sequencing. PRKAG1, a regulator in the AMPK signaling pathway critical for insulin secretion, was selected for further functional study in the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1E cells. TCDD treatment induced PRKAG1 hypermethylation in hESCs, and the hypermethylation was maintained after pancreatic progenitor cells differentiation. Transient Prkag1 knockdown in the INS-1E cells elevated glucose stimulated insulin secretions (GSIS), possibly through mTOR signaling pathway. The current study suggested that early embryonic exposure to TCDD might alter pancreatogenesis, increasing the risk of T2D. ? 2019 The Authors",GSIS; hESCs; PRKAG1; TCDD; Type 2 diabetes (T2D),"Alkylation; Animals; Cell culture; DNA; Endocrine disrupters; Gene encoding; Insulin; Methylation; Stem cells; GSIS; hESCs; PRKAG1; TCDD; Type-2 diabetes; Cell signaling; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; cell; diabetes; endocrine disruptor; health risk; pollution effect; pollution exposure; TCDD; AMPK signaling; animal cell; Article; CAPN10 gene; cell differentiation; cell function; cell lineage; concentration (parameter); controlled study; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; embryonic stem cell; exposure; gene; gene knockdown; HNF 1B gene; insulin release; MAFA gene; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; organogenesis; pancreas cell; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; PRKAG1 gene; rat; validation process; animal; cell differentiation; cell line; cytology; drug effect; embryonic stem cell; human; metabolism; pancreas islet beta cell; pollutant; toxicity; Animalia; Rattus; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; DNA Methylation; Embryonic Stem Cells; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Insulin Secretion; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Rats",2-s2.0-85069087263

Methods: 1-month suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts together with their sociodemographic and clinical associates were analyzed by retrospective data on 263 elderly patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders at the Kangning Hospital, Shenzhen, China. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to examine the differences between patients with and without suicidality. Backward stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify the associated factors. Results: Among the selected patients, 17.87% had 1-month suicide ideation and 7.60% had lifetime suicide attempts. It was further observed that the elderly patients with schizophrenia who had 1-month suicide ideation were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts, suffer from severe hopelessness and negative symptoms, and have no pension. However, the backward stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that lifetime suicide attempts and negative symptoms were most significantly associated with 1-month suicide ideation. In contrast, lifetime suicide attempters were more likely to be men, receive a pension, display symptoms of hopelessness, have longer duration of illness and poor family relationships. The regression analyses also indicated that only hopelessness, relatively long duration of schizophrenia, and poor family relationships were the most significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts. Limitations: The retrospective design do not allow for causal inferences. Conclusions: Early interventions designed to decrease hopelessness, control negative symptoms, and improve family relationships may result in reduced risks of suicide among elderly Chinese patients with schizophrenia. ? 2019",Elderly Chinese patients; Risk factors; Schizophrenia spectrum disorders; Suicide attempts; Suicide ideation,aged; aging; alcohol abuse; Article; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; China; daily life activity; demography; disease duration; family relation; female; hopelessness; human; lifespan; major clinical study; male; married person; migrant; negative syndrome; pension; positive syndrome; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; sex difference; smoking; socioeconomics; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; terminal disease,2-s2.0-85068513813

To date, a nomogram has not been used to predict clinical outcome during oral potentially malignant disorder (PMD) treatment. The aim of this study was to create a nomogram for use by clinicians to predict the probability of MT, thereby facilitating accurate assessment of risk and objective decision-making during individual patient management. Methods: Clinico-pathological data from a previously treated cohort of 590 newly presenting PMD patients were reviewed and clinical outcomes categorized as disease free, persistent PMD or MT. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict the probability of MT in the cohort using age, gender, lesion type, site and incision biopsy histopathological diagnoses. Internal validation and calibration of the model was performed using the bootstrap method (n?=?1000), and bias-corrected indices of model performance were computed. Results: Potentially malignant disorders were predominantly leukoplakias (79%), presenting most frequently at floor of mouth and lateral tongue sites (51%); 99 patients (17%) developed oral squamous cell carcinoma during the study period. The nomogram performed well when MT predictions were compared with patient outcome data, demonstrating good bias-corrected discrimination and calibration (Dxy?=?0.58; C?=?0.790), with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity 63%, and a positive predictive value of 32% and negative predictive value 96%. Conclusion: The “Newcastle Nomogram” has been developed to predict the probability of MT in PMD, based on an internally validated statistical model. Based upon readily available and patient-specific clinico-pathological data, it provides clinicians with a pragmatic diagrammatic aid for clinical decision-making during diagnosis and management of PMD. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study including 1125 patients with HCC underwent curative hepatic resection. They were randomly divided into training (n = 562) and validation (n = 563) sets. Early intrahepatic recurrence within 18 months from surgery is the primary outcome. In the training set, a prediction scoring model (Recurrent Liver Cancer Score RLCS) was developed, which was legitimised in the validation set. Results: RLCS was developed based on four clinicopathologic risk factors (serum alpha fetoprotein, tumor size, multiple tumors or satellite nodules, and microvascular invasion). Low-risk and high-risk groups had statistically significant differences in early recurrence rates (18% vs. 43.8%). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of low risk and high risk groups were 52.9% and 27.8%, respectively.

Cervical cytology practices in China have been changing over the last decade with introduction of The Bethesda System reporting terminology, liquid-based cytology (LBC), and programs for cervical cytology screening of underserved rural populations. An effort was undertaken for the first time to collect nationwide data on cervical cytology laboratory practices in China, a possible first step toward increased standardization and potential development of nationwide cytology quality benchmarks. Materials and methods: Data on cervical cytology practices from 1572 laboratories operating in 26 nationwide Provisional Level Administrative Divisions was collected in an online survey approved through the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai. Results: Over 90% of cervical cytology laboratories in China now solely use Bethesda System reporting terminology. LBC is now the most commonly utilized form of cervical cytology, with lower-cost Chinese-manufactured LBC formulations used in almost 70% of laboratories. Nationwide, significantly higher abnormal cytology rates were reported with LBC than with the conventional Papanicolaou smear (CPS); however, the CPS remains a useful low-cost alternative as China strives to extend cervical screening to large underserved rural areas. Conclusions: Abnormal cytology rates were not significantly different when different levels of hospitals were compared. The survey identified nationwide opportunities for cytology quality improvement, including low rates of reporting of unsatisfactory cases and low rates for atypical glandular cells. ? 2019 American Society of Cytopathology",Cervical cancer screening; China; National survey; Papanicolaou smear; TBS report rate,Article; cancer screening; China; clinical laboratory; clinical practice; health care cost; health survey; human; human tissue; liquid based cytology; nomenclature; online analysis; Papanicolaou test; priority journal; rural area; standardization; total quality management; uterine cervix cytology,2-s2.0-85063761903

The stem cell pluripotent transcriptional factor SOX family play critical roles in governing tumor plasticity and lineage specification. This study aims to establish a novel SOX signature to monitor the extent of tumor dedifferentiation and predict prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LIHC project were chronologically divided into the training (n = 188) and testing cohort (n = 189). LIRI-JP project from International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal was used as an independent validation cohort (n = 232). Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox analyses were used to examine the clinical significance and prognostic value of the signature genes. Results: The SOX gene family members were found to be aberrantly expressed in clinical HCC patients. A five-gene SOX signature with prognostic value was established in the training cohort. The SOX signature genes were found to be closely associated with tumor grade and tumor stage. Liver cancer dedifferentiation markers (AFP, CD133, EPCAM, and KRT19) were found to be progressively increased while hepatocyte terminal differentiation markers (ALB, G6PC, CYP3A4, and HNF4A) were progressively decreased from HCC patients with low SOX signature scores to patients with high SOX signature scores. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis further indicated that the newly established SOX signature could robustly predict patient overall survival in both training, testing, and independent validation cohort. Conclusions: An oncogenic dedifferentiation SOX signature presents a great potential in predicting prognostic significance in HCC, and might provide novel biomarkers for precision oncology further in the clinic. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Oncogenic dedifferentiation; Prognostic value; Stem cell-like properties,"ALB protein; CD133 antigen; cytochrome P450 3A4; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; G6PC protein; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha; KRT19 protein; transcription factor Sox; tumor marker; unclassified drug; transcription factor Sox; tumor marker; Article; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; gene expression; high risk patient; human; human tissue; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; oncological parameters; overall survival; personalized medicine; prediction; process development; risk assessment; RNA sequence; SOX gene; survival analysis; tumor dedifferentiation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; pathology; procedures; prognosis; sequence analysis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Precision Medicine; Prognosis; Sequence Analysis, RNA; SOX Transcription Factors; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-85071619942

Along the journey of recovery, people with bipolar disorder (BD) struggle to cope with recurring mood fluctuations between depression and mania. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have the potential to result in improvements in personal recovery outcomes. Thus, this protocol will evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of a brief MBI for helping individuals with BD with their personal recovery. It is hypothesized that adults with BD randomly assigned to a brief MBI intervention will report greater improvements in personal recovery than those in a waiting list control condition. In addition, it is hypothesized that such benefits will be mediated by improvements in emotion awareness, emotion regulation, and illness acceptance. Moreover, the specific stage of BD is hypothesized to moderate the beneficial effects of the brief MBI, such that those in the early stage of BD will report more benefits regarding emotion awareness and emotion regulation, whereas those in the late stage of BD will report more advantages concerning illness acceptance. Method: One hundred and fifty-four adults with BD will be recruited from hospitals and community settings for this research project. This study will use a mixed methods design. A randomized-controlled trial will be conducted to compare a brief MBI (four sessions in total) group and a waiting list control group. Assessments will be made at baseline, after intervention, and at six-month follow-up. In addition, a qualitative and participatory research method called Photovoice will be employed to further understand the experiences of the participants who receive the brief MBI along their personal recovery journey. Discussion: If the study hypotheses are supported, the findings from this research project will provide empirical support for an alternative treatment.

We developed an integrated health and protection intervention to reduce psychological distress and intimate partner violence (IPV), and tested its delivery by lay facilitators in a low-resource refugee setting. Methods: Formative research to develop the intervention consisted of a structured desk review, consultation with experts and local stakeholders (refugee incentive workers, representatives of humanitarian agencies, and clinical experts), and qualitative interviews (40 free list interviews with refugees, 15 key informant interviews). Given existing efforts by humanitarian agencies to prevent gender-based violence in this particular refugee camp, including with (potential) perpetrators, we focused on a complementary effort to develop an integrated intervention with potential to reduce IPV and associated mental health impacts with female IPV survivors. We enrolled Congolese refugee women with elevated psychological distress and past-year histories of IPV (n = 60) who received the intervention delivered by trained and supervised lay refugee facilitators. Relevance, feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were evaluated through quantitative and qualitative interviews with participants. We assessed instrument test-retest reliability (n = 24), inter-rater reliability (n = 5 interviews), internal consistency, and construct validity (n = 60). Results: We designed an 8-session intervention, termed Nguvu ('strength'), incorporating brief Cognitive Processing Therapy (focused on helping clients obtaining skills to overcome negative thoughts and self-perceptions and gain control over the impact these have on their lives) and Advocacy Counseling (focused on increasing autonomy, empowerment and strengthening linkages to community supports). On average, participants attended two-thirds of the sessions. In qualitative interviews, participants recommended adaptations to specific intervention components and provided recommendations regarding coordination, retention, safety concerns and intervention participation incentives. Analysis of the performance of outcome instruments overall revealed acceptable reliability and validity. Conclusions: We found it feasible to develop and implement an integrated, multi-sectoral mental health and IPV intervention in a refugee camp setting. Implementation challenges were identified and may be informative for future implementation and evaluation of multi-sectoral strategies for populations facing ongoing adversity.

Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) has recently emerged as a non-inferior new tracer in sentinel lymph node mapping with fewer disadvantages. This study represents the first and the largest cohort of superparamagnetic iron oxide application in Asian population. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed from August 2016 to December 2017. All patients with SLN localization by SPIO were included in this study. Results: A total of 328 breast cancer patients with 333 SLNB procedures were included in this study. Median age was 54?years (range 32–86). Median tumor size was 1.9?cm (range 0.1–12?cm).There were 138 breast-conserving surgeries and 195 mastectomies. All patients received injection of SPIO 1?day prior to operation. A total of 329 successful sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures were undertaken with 1514 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identified. One hundred and fifty-three (10.1%) of the SLNs were positive for malignancy. There were 54 patients with macrometastases, 26 with micrometastases and 24 with isolated tumor cells. Sixty-seven patients underwent subsequent axillary dissection. Four patients failed sentinel lymph node identification with SPIO. The success rate of SPIO in sentinel lymph node localization was 98.8%. Conclusion: SPIO represents a feasible alternative in sentinel lymph node mapping with comparably high nodal detection rate. ? 2019, Soci?t?

Here, we described the previously unidentified role of selenocysteine insertion sequence-binding protein 2 (SBP2) in maintaining insulin sensitivity in obesity. SBP2 was suppressed in ATMs of diet-induced obese mice and was correlated with adipose tissue inflammation. Loss of SBP2 initiated metabolic activation of ATMs, inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species content and inflammasome, which subsequently promoted IL-1-associated local proliferation and infiltration of proinflammatory macrophages. ATM-specific knockdown of SBP2 in obese mice promoted insulin resistance by increasing fat tissue inflammation and expansion. Reexpression of SBP2 improved insulin sensitivity. Last, an herbal formula that specifically induced SBP2 expression in ATMs can experimentally improve insulin sensitivity. Clinical observation revealed that it improved hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. This study identified SBP2 in ATMs as a potential target in rescuing insulin resistance in obesity.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey design study, with two questionnaires developed and distributed to patients and medical staff. Convenience and stratified random sampling methods were applied to patient and medical staff samples. Findings: A 5-dimension, 21-item patient questionnaire and a 4-dimension, 16-item staff questionnaire were identified and confirmed, with 1020 patients (91.07 percent) and 202 staff (90.18 percent) as effective survey participants. The results revealed that patient resistance mainly stems from a lack of personal experiences with visiting general practice (GP) and being educated or having lived overseas; while staff resistance came from occupation, education, GP training certificate, and knowledge and experience with specialists. Living in overseas and knowledge of GP concepts, gender and education are associated with resistance of accepting the new practice model for both patients and staff. Originality/value: There are few Chinese studies on process reengineering in the medical sector; this is the first study to adopt this medical consultation model and change in patients’ consultation culture in Mainland China. Applying organizational change and process reengineering theories to medical and healthcare services not only extends and expands hospital management theory but also allows investigation of modern hospital management practice. The experience from this study can serve as a reference to promote this new consultation model in Chinese healthcare reform. ? 2019, Xiao Ping Xu, Dong Ge Ke, Dong Ning Deng, Shannon H.

Plasma proteins relevant to HBsAg seroclearance remain undetermined. METHODS: We prospectively recruited treatment-naive CHB patients with spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance and matched HBsAg-positive controls. Plasma protein profiling was performed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based proteomics, with the expression of candidate proteins validated in a separate cohort. The predictive value of fibronectin was assessed at 3 years, 1 year (Year -1) before, and at the time (Year 0) of HBsAg seroclearance. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven plasma proteins were identified via proteomics, with 97 proteins showing altered expression. In the verification cohort (n = 90), median plasma fibronectin levels in patients with HBsAg seroclearance was higher than in controls (P = .009). In the longitudinal cohort (n = 164), patients with HBsAg seroclearance, compared with controls, had a higher median fibronectin levels at Year -1 (413.26 vs 227.95 ?g/mL) and Year 0 (349.45 vs 208.72 ?g/mL) (both P < .001). In patients with an annual HBsAg log reduction >0.5, Year -1 fibronectin level achieved an area under the receiving operator characteristic of 0.884 in predicting HBsAg seroclearance. CONCLUSIONS: Using proteomics-based technology, plasma fibronectin may be associated with HBsAg seroclearance and a potential predictor of ""functional cure"". ? The Author(s) 2019.

However, the anticancer effects of RSM on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of RSM in the treatment of HCC using a network pharmacology approach. In vivo and in vitro experiments were also performed to validate the therapeutic effects of RSM on HCC. Results: In total, 62 active compounds from RSM and 72 HCC-related targets were identified through network pharmacological analysis. RSM was found to play a critical role in HCC via multiple targets and pathways, especially the EGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In addition, RSM was found to suppress HCC cell proliferation, and impair cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that RSM induced cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis, and western blot analysis showed that RSM up-regulated the expression of BAX and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in MHCC97-H and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, RSM administration down-regulated the expression of EGFR, PI3K, and p-AKT proteins, whereas the total AKT level was not altered. Finally, the results of our in vivo experiments confirmed the therapeutic effects of RSM on HCC in nude mice. Conclusions: We provide an integrative network pharmacology approach, in combination with in vitro and in vivo experiments, to illustrate the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of RSM action on HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Hepatocellular carcinoma; Network pharmacology; Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae,antineoplastic agent; Chinese drug; cryptotanshinone; epidermal growth factor receptor; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; liver protective agent; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein Bax; protein kinase B; Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae extract; tanshinone IIA; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell cycle G2 phase; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; chemical composition; Chinese medicine; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug megadose; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene ontology; Hep-G2 cell line; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; liver protection; low drug dose; male; MHCC97-H cell line; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; Pi3K/Akt signaling; plant root; protein binding; protein expression level; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; tumor invasion; upregulation; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85070474906

Camels are mostly bred in East African countries then exported into Africa and Middle East for consumption. To understand the distribution of MERS-CoV among camels in North Africa and the Middle East, we conducted surveillance in Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. We also performed longitudinal studies of three camel herds in Egypt and Jordan to elucidate MERS-CoV infection and transmission. Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 4027 nasal swabs and 3267 serum samples were collected from all countries. Real-time PCR revealed that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples from Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. Microneutralization assay showed that antibodies were detected in all countries. Positive PCR samples were partially sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was built. The tree suggested that all sequences are of clade C and sequences from camels in Egypt formed a separate group from previously published sequences. Longitudinal studies showed high seroprevalence in adult camels. These results indicate the widespread distribution of the virus in camels. A systematic active surveillance and longitudinal studies for MERS-CoV are needed to understand the epidemiology of the disease and dynamics of viral infection. ? 2019 by the authors.

Using voxelwise heritability mapping, we found that activation of the bilateral NAcc during the anticipation of monetary gains had significant heritability (h2 =.20–.49). Moreover, significant shared genetic covariance was observed between pleasure and NAcc activation during the anticipation of monetary gain.

Nevertheless, the actual prevalence of and a screening strategy for PAH in methamphetamine users have not been established. We plan to study the prevalence of PAH and identify its independent risk factors among methamphetamine users. Methods and analysis: The Screening Of Pulmonary Hypertension in Methamphetamine Abusers (SOPHMA) study will be a multicentre, cross-sectional screening study that will involve substance abuse clinics, hospitals and rehabilitation facilities in Hong Kong that cater to more than 20 methamphetamine users. A total of 400 patients who (1) are ?18 years at enrolment; (2) report methamphetamine use in the last 2 years; (3) are diagnosed with methamphetamine use disorder; and (4) voluntarily agree to participate by providing written informed consent will be included. Patients will undergo standard echocardiography-based PAH screening procedures recommended for those with systemic sclerosis. Right heart catheterisation will be offered to participants with intermediate or high echocardiographic probability of PAH. For participants with a low echocardiographic probability of PAH, rescreening will be performed within 1 year. The primary measure will be the prevalence of PAH in methamphetamine users. The secondary measures will be the risk factors and a prediction model for PAH in methamphetamine users. Ethics and dissemination: The SOPHMA study has been approved by the institutional review board. The findings of this study will provide the necessary evidence to establish universal guidelines for screening of PAH in methamphetamine users. Our results will be disseminated through immediate feedback to study participants, press release to the general public, as well as presentation in medical conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals to healthcare providers and academia worldwide. ? 2019 Author(s).",methamphetamine; pulmonary hypertension; screening,methamphetamine; Article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cross-sectional study; Doppler echocardiography; echocardiography; false negative result; heart catheterization; human; major clinical study; methamphetamine dependence; multicenter study; prevalence; pulmonary hypertension; receiver operating characteristic; rescreening; risk factor; screening; secondary analysis; systemic sclerosis; systolic blood pressure,2-s2.0-85070241230

A J-shape association between baseline systolic blood pressure and risks of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease was observed. Using repeated systolic blood pressure, a positive and log-linear association was identified. There was no evidence of a threshold down to the repeated systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg. Increases of 10 mm Hg of repeated systolic blood pressure was associated with a 16% (hazard ratio, 1.15; [95% CI, 1.13-1.16]), 11% (1.11; [1.08-1.13]), and 22% (1.22; [1.20-1.24]) higher risk of composite of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, individual cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, respectively. Strength of the associations was similar across different subpopulations. This study showed that hypertensive patients with elevated repeated systolic blood pressure are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, irrespective of different characteristics. Very low single measurement of systolic blood pressure may be a potential indicator for poor health, but there seems to be no threshold for usual systolic blood pressure. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.",blood pressure; cardiovascular diseases; cohort studies; diabetes mellitus; mortality,"adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; correlation analysis; female; follow up; hazard ratio; high risk patient; Hong Kong; human; hypertension; hypertensive patient; loglinear model; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; population research; priority journal; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk assessment; systolic blood pressure; age distribution; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; comorbidity; hypertension; prevalence; prognosis; severity of illness index; sex ratio; survival rate; antihypertensive agent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure Determination; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Distribution; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85069620691

In Hong Kong, the Early Psychosis Foundation (EPISO) was established in 2007 to tackle this issue by providing educational and mental health promotional activities, among other aims and services. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based interventional programme, the School Tour, developed by EPISO. Methods: The School Tour differentiates itself from other interventional programmes by supplementing a traditional psychoeducational talk with 2 additional elements: an engaging drama performance and exercise demonstrations. Twelve secondary schools, with a total of 4520 students, participated in the study. Knowledge and attitudes towards psychosis were evaluated before and after the school programme. Results: The School Tour was found to improve both students' knowledge of psychosis (P <.001) and their attitude (P <.001) towards the illness. Conclusions: Its effectiveness in reducing the stigma towards psychosis validates the use of novel strategies like drama performances to engage adolescent students, and urges the government to support increased student participation in the programme by providing funding to the relevant organizations. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",adolescents; intervention; psychosis; school-based programme; stigma reduction,adolescent; Article; attitude to health; child; controlled study; health care organization; health education; health promotion; high school student; Hong Kong; human; mental health; priority journal; program effectiveness; psychoeducation; psychosis; school; social stigma; counseling; cultural factor; education; exercise; female; health literacy; health promotion; male; mental health; program evaluation; psychology; student; Adolescent; Counseling; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Exercise; Female; Health Literacy; Health Promotion; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Program Evaluation; Schools; Social Stigma; Students,2-s2.0-85068241222

Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors such as abdominal obesity, raised blood pressure, and elevated glucose. Existing studies have not explicitly examined the urbanization effect on metabolic syndrome. Objective: The present study aims to examine the temporal effects of urbanization on metabolic syndrome in the Chinese context and evaluate dietary intake and physical activity as potential mediating factors. Method: The study sample comprised 6,217 Chinese adults aged between 30 and 65 recruited in 218 communities from 2000 to 2009 waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Growth in urbanization of the communities was derived using latent growth modeling on continuous urbanization index from 2000 to 2009. The participants reported their physical activity and dietary intake. Body mass index and biomarkers were measured at 2009 for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Multilevel mediation analysis with novel latent centering approach was conducted across gender to evaluate direct and indirect effects of urbanization on metabolic syndrome via changes in dietary intake and physical activity. Results: The sample displayed linear increasing trends in urbanization, intakes of red meat, dairy products and fast food and declining cereal intake and physical activity with significant inter-individual variations. Controlling for individual-level and community-level covariates, urbanization showed a positive but non-significant direct effect on metabolic syndrome across gender. There were significant and positive indirect effects from urbanization to metabolic syndrome via changes in physical activity in males and via changes in fast food intake in females. Conclusions: The present results highlight the health impact of urbanization as a dynamic process at the community level on metabolic syndrome via different indirect pathways of lifestyle factors across gender. Methodological and practical implications are discussed in relation to these modifiable lifestyle factors in the urbanizing Chinese society. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",BMI; China; Diet and nutrition; Indirect effects; Lifestyle factors; Longitudinal; Modernization; Multilevel modelling,adult; body mass; dietary intake; health risk; lifestyle; longitudinal gradient; metabolism; modernization; nutrition; physical activity; public health; risk factor; urbanization; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cereal; China; Chinese; controlled study; dairy product; dietary intake; disease marker; fast food; female; food analysis; health survey; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; nutritional health; physical activity; red meat; trend study; urbanization; China,2-s2.0-85067865095

Methods: A cohort of 127 HNC patients who received free flap reconstruction between November 2010 and June 2014 at a hospital were recruited. Pre-treatment QoL was measured by the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire, which contains six physical domains, including speech, swallowing, appearance, saliva, taste and chewing, as well as the six social-emotional domains of pain, activity, recreation, shoulder, mood, and anxiety. Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: Results showed that pre-treatment QoL was predictive of OS and DMFS. Of the domains, swallowing, chewing, speech, taste, saliva, pain and shoulder were demonstrated to be significant predictors of OS. Additionally, swallowing, chewing, speech, pain and activity were demonstrated making significant contributions to DMFS. Conclusion: Our data supported that physical domains of pre-treatment QoL were predictors for OS and DFMS in HNC patients with free-flap reconstruction. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the prognostic abilities of social-emotional domains. Information on pre-treatment QoL should be taken into account to individualize care plan for these patients, and hence prolong their survival. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Head and neck cancer; Metastasis; Oncological outcome; Quality of life,adult; aged; cohort analysis; female; free tissue graft; head and neck tumor; human; male; metastasis; middle aged; preoperative care; prognosis; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reconstructive surgery; survival; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Free Tissue Flaps; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Preoperative Care; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survival,2-s2.0-85066275417

This study aims to develop an early warning system of possible suicide outbreaks in Hong Kong using Google Trends and suicide-related media reporting. Methods: Data on 3,534 suicides from 2011 to 2015 were obtained from Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, and the Coroner's Court. Using data from Google Trends and features extracted from media reporting on suicide news, we fitted Poisson regression models to predict the number and estimate the intensity of suicides on a weekly basis, for six subgroups, defined by gender and age. We adopted the cumulative sum (CUSUM)control chart-based method to identify outbreaks of suicide. Results: The proposed model was able to predict the number of suicides with reasonably low normalized root mean squared errors, ranging from 15.6% for young females to 24.16% for old females. The suicide intensity curves were well captured by the proposed models for young males and females, but not for other groups. The Sensitivity, Precision and F1 Score of the CUSUM-based method were 50%, 100% and 67% for young females, and 93%, 54% and 68% for young males. Limitations: This study focused only on predicting the number of suicides in the current week, not in the future weeks. The model did not include social media, socioeconomic and climate data. Conclusions: Our results indicate that Google Trends search terms and media reporting data may be valuable data sources for predicting possible outbreak of suicides in Hong Kong.

The disease leads to impaired myelin formation and extensive myelin damage in the brain. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of KD but insofar few information is available. The gray and white matter of the brain are rich in docosahexaenoic acid and adrenic acid respectively and under non-enzymatic oxidative stress, release isoprostanoids, i.e. F4-neuroprostanes (F4-NeuroPs) and F2-dihomo-isoprostanes (F2-dihomo-IsoPs). In this study, the formation of isoprostanoids in brain tissue was investigated in a well-established KD mouse model (twitcher) that recapitulates the human pathology. According to the genotype determinations, three groups of mice were selected: wild-type control mice (n = 13), heterozygotes mice (carriers of GALC mutations, n = 14) and homozygous twitcher mice (n = 13). Measurement of F2-dihomo-IsoP and F4-NeuroP levels were performed on whole brain tissue obtained at day 15 and day 35 of the life cycle. Brain isoprostanoid levels were significantly higher in the twitcher mice compared to the heterozygous and wild-type control mice. However, F2-dihomo-IsoP and F4-NeuroP levels did not differ in brain of day 15 compared to day 35 of the heterozygote mice. Interestingly, isoprostanoid levels were proportionally enhanced with disease severity (F2-dihomo-IsoPs, rho = 0.54; F4-NeuroPs, rho = 0.581; P values ? 0.05; n = 13).

The present study extends previous work relating to patients’ behaviours by assessing healthcare providers’ own behaviours in supporting PA. Method: 50 items were generated: half assessed a PA approach; half reflected a non-patient-activation approach. 105 healthcare providers working in cardiac rehabilitation who were participants in a CDSM online training program completed the items pre- and post-training. Factor analysis determined the presence of higher order factors. Item responses pre- and post-training were compared to assess sensitivity to change. Results: Results indicated the presence of two factors: ‘patient-activation approach’ and ‘non-patient-activation approach’. While both demonstrated good internal consistency, the’ non-PA approach’ had superior discriminatory validity and sensitivity to change. Conclusion: Healthcare providers’ beliefs about the importance of patient-activation behaviours can be measured by 40-item Healthcare Provider-Patient Activation Scale (HP-PAS). The scale could be easily converted to measure healthcare providers’ actual PA behaviours.

Biomedical literature data mining can offer insights into putative linkage mechanisms toward hypothesis development, based on information discovery. The aim of this study was to explore potential Periodontitis-Rheumatoid Arthritis biological links by analysing “overlapping” genes reported in biomedical abstracts. Material and Methods: PubMed abstracts for terms: (a) “Periodontitis” or “Periodontal Diseases” (PD), (b) “Rheumatoid arthritis” (RA), and (c) their combination with “AND” (RA+PD), were each text-mined to extract genes using “Human Genome Nomenclature Committee” (HGNC) symbols. A gene-set common to RA and PD abstracts was determined (RA∩PD). Gene ontology (GO) profiles of RA∩PD and RA+PD were compared using “GoProfiler.” Minimum order protein-protein interaction (PPI) and gene-miRNA networks of “differential genes” between RA∩PD and RA+PD were constructed with “networkAnalyst.”. Results: Among 1676 genes documented in RA (10?5241 abstracts), and 893 genes in PD (80?982 abstracts), 535 genes were common (RA∩PD), from which 35 genes were also documented in RA+PD (415 abstracts). 41 GO-terms significantly different between RA∩PD and RA+PD GO profiles represented 38 biological processes including; nitric oxide metabolism, immunoglobulin production, hormonal regulation, catabolic process down-regulation, and leukocyte proliferation. The 500 differential genes’ PPI and gene-miRNA networks showed REL, TRAF2, AQP1 genes, and miRNAs 335-5p, 17-5p, 93-5p with genes HMOX1 and SP1 as hub nodes. Conclusions: Text-mining biomedical abstracts revealed potentially shared but un-investigated links between PD and RA, meriting further research. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The time required for volumetric assessments was evaluated statistically with respect to the potential influence of gender, age, sinus side, sinus volume, sequence of measurement, and selection threshold of the software. The resulting average sinus volume of the 174 sinuses from 87 patients was 16.9 cm3. The average time required to measure one sinus volume was 91.8 s. Sinuses from male patients required a longer time (median of 95.5 s) for the measurements than their female counterparts (median of 87.5 s). Measurement time increased with increasing age, sinus volume and selection threshold based on calculated grey values provided by the software. The volumetric measurements and measurement times exhibited a high intra-observer agreement. The volumetric measurements were highly reproducible. Each measurement was completed within 4 minutes, though there was a marked difference in the mean measurement time between the two observers. Semi-automated volumetric measurement of the maxillary sinus with commercially available software is feasible, efficient, and reproducible.

This study aims to identify a novel therapeutic target of DR from the OMICs studies of a traditional anti-DR botanical products TNTL. Methods: Hyperglycemic mice were treated with TNTL. The anti-hyperglycemic effect of TNTL was validated to confirm the biological consistency of the herbal products from batches. Improvement of DR by TNTL was examined by various assays on the retina. Next-generation transcriptome sequencing and cytokine array was used to identify the therapeutic targets. In vitro study was performed to validate the target. Results: We observed that TNTL at its high doses possessed anti-hyperglycemic effect in murine type I diabetic model, while at its doses without reducing blood glucose, it suppressed DR incidence. TNTL restored the blood-retina barrier integrity, suppressed retinal neovascularization, and attenuated the retinal ganglion cell degeneration. Transcriptomic analysis on the retina tissue of hyperglycemic mice with or without TNTL revealed that the inflammatory retina microenvironment was significantly repressed. TNTL treatment suppressed pro-inflammatory macrophages in the retina, which resulted in the inactivation of endothelial cell migration, restoration of endothelial cell monolayer integrity, and prevention of leakage. Cytokine array analysis suggested that TNTL could significantly inhibit the secretion of MIP1γfrom pro-inflammatory macrophages. Prevention of endothelial dysfunction by TNTL may be mediated by the inhibition of MIP1γ/CCR1 axis. More specifically, TNTL suppressed MIP1γrelease from pro-inflammatory macrophages, which in turn inhibited the activation of CCR1-associated signaling pathways in endothelial cells. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that TNTL might be an alternative treatment to DR, and the primary source of potential drug candidates against DR targeting MIP1γ/CCR1 axis in the retinal microenvironment. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Diabetic retinopathy; Endothelial dysfunctions; Inflammation; MIP1γ/CCR1 axis; Retina macrophages; Tang-Ning-Tong-Luo,chemokine receptor CCR1; herbaceous agent; macrophage inflammatory protein 1; macrophage inflammatory protein 1 gamma; tang ning tong luo; unclassified drug; analysis of variance; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; antiinflammatory activity; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; diabetic retinopathy; glycemic control; immunoblotting; in vitro study; in vivo study; incidence; microenvironment; neovascularization (pathology); nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; proteomics; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; retina ganglion cell; signal transduction; transcriptomics,2-s2.0-85069762958

The clinicopathological characteristics of HCC in elderly patients and in younger patients are different. Elderly patients, in general, also have more comorbidities. Evaluation of the efficacy of different HCC treatment options in elderly patients is necessary to optimize treatment outcomes for them. Treatment modalities for HCC include hepatectomy, liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and molecular-targeted therapy with sorafenib. In this review, current evidence on the risks and outcomes of the different HCC treatments for elderly patients are discussed. According to data in the literature, elderly patients and younger patients benefited similarly from HCC treatments. More clinical data are needed for the determination of selecting criteria on elderly HCC patients to maximize their chance of getting the most appropriate and effective treatments. As such, further studies evaluating the outcomes of different HCC treatment modalities in elderly patients are warranted. ?The Author(s) 2019.",Aged; Clinical outcome; Hepatectomy; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Surgery,"checkpoint kinase inhibitor; sorafenib; antineoplastic agent; cancer immunotherapy; chemoembolization; evidence based medicine; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation; Review; treatment outcome; age; aged; comorbidity; comparative study; disease free survival; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; molecularly targeted therapy; mortality; patient selection; procedures; survival rate; treatment outcome; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; Comorbidity; Disease-Free Survival; Hepatectomy; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Middle Aged; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Patient Selection; Radiofrequency Ablation; Sorafenib; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85069976489

About 210,000 persons (2.9% of the population) currently live in such tiny and poorly ventilated dwellings. With a median floor area of merely 9.3?m2 (100?ft2), most SDUs do not have space for a partitioned kitchen to contain the air pollutants generated by cooking, posing a serious indoor air quality issue that affects all members living in the SDU. The CO, CO2, PM10, PM2.5 and VOC concentrations in seven SDUs were monitored for 72?h to capture the emissions from their routine cooking activities. All SDUs used induction or electric cookers and 32 cooking events were recorded. Under natural ventilation, the mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations during cooking were 36 and 20?μg/m3, which were 136% and 82% higher than the pre-cooking levels respectively. Their mean maximum concentrations reached 1644 and 749?μg/m3 respectively. The mean PM10 concentration exceeded the local guideline (excellent class) by 1.82 times. However, cooking activities did not contribute to substantial changes in CO, CO2 and VOC concentrations. When the air conditioner was turned on to relieve the heat from cooking, it took 90?min for air pollution to return to pre-cooking levels after a cooking event because of poor ventilation, which significantly increased the occupants’ exposure to the cloistered air pollutants. Lacking a partitioned kitchen and effective ventilation in SDUs may pose chronic health threats to their occupants, particularly children. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Indoor air quality; Open-plan cooking; Particulate matter; Public health; Subdivided units,air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; cooking appliance; guideline; particulate matter; pollution incidence; public health; ventilation; volatile organic compound,2-s2.0-85065730724

Invasion chamber assay, scratch-wound assay and orthotopic liver tumor implantation mice were introduced to investigate the potential pharmacological effects of matrine on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our results showed that matrine at non-toxic dose could significantly suppress PLC/PRF/5 and MHCC97L cells migration and invasion. Furthermore, matrine treatment (5 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased lung metastasis in orthotopic HCC mouse models. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, gelatin zymography and immunoblotting assay indicated that matrine could inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 without down-regulating its protein expression in HCC. The docking approach, site-directed mutagenesis, and surface plasmon resonance were applied to identify residues involved in matrine binding in matrix metalloproteinase-9. The biophysical and cell-based assays showed that Pro415, Arg424 residue might contribute to the binding affinity of matrine on matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity.

Organisational culture is thus an essential consideration for hospital accreditation, a practice of systematically assessing the quality of hospital care against accepted standards. This study assesses the interplay between accreditation and hospital professional staff perception of organisational culture. Methods: A prospective cohort study design was used to explore the influence of accreditation on organisational culture within a large, publicly-funded, university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. All full-time hospital and academic physicians, nurses and allied health professionals were invited to participate. Organisational culture was evaluated using the Competing Values Framework through the Quality Improvement Implementation Survey. Organisational culture was assessed longitudinally at 9 months prior to accreditation, 3 months following and 15 months after accreditation. To capture potential shifts in staff perception of organisational culture through the accreditation process, we conducted a between time-point comparison using a linear trend model. Results: 545 clinical staff completed the organisational culture survey pre-accreditation, 378 three- months post-accreditation and 141 15-months post-accreditation. Hierarchical culture was the dominant organisational culture domain pre-accreditation, followed by rational, developmental and group culture, respectively. Following accreditation, hierarchical culture declined but remained dominant, while group and developmental culture increased. However, the decline in hierarchical culture was U-shaped with scores increasing at 15-months post-accreditation, though not to pre-accreditation levels. When stratified by professional group, hierarchical culture declined following accreditation with corresponding increases in group culture and developmental culture among physicians and nurses, respectively. While allied health professionals did not perceive any significant cultural differences directly following accreditation, a significant increase in hierarchical culture and corresponding decrease in group culture was found 15-months post-accreditation. Conclusions: This study suggests the hospital accreditation process may contribute to shifts in staff perception of organisational culture. Our findings also indicate differential views of organisational culture across professional groups. Finally, we note the striking dominance of hierarchical culture in this Hong Kong hospital across all time points, far surpassing other studies, even those in which hierarchical culture prevailed. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Accreditation; Hospital medicin; Organizational theory,"accreditation; article; cohort analysis; doctor nurse relation; Hong Kong; human; organizational culture; organizational theory; perception; prospective study; staff; teaching hospital; total quality management; adult; female; health care quality; hospital; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; organization and management; organizational culture; young adult; Accreditation; Adult; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Organizational Culture; Prospective Studies; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Quality Improvement; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85068869690

However, the cultural context that affects the socialisation process in clinical placements is less discussed. We aimed to explore nursing students' learning and professional socialisation during clinical placements by considering the socio-cultural contexts in South Korea. Methods: A grounded theory approach was used for this research. Four rounds of in-depth and intensive interviews were carried out, with the recruitment of 16 nursing students, four nurses and two university lecturers in South Korea (29 interviews in total). A constructivist grounded theory framework was adopted to analyse the interview data. NVivo 11 was used to manage the interview data for analysis. Results: The researchers identified the process of learning and professional socialisation under three core themes: 1) Struggling at the bottom of the hierarchy, 2) Acceptance and conformity, and 3) The need for 'nunchi' (in Korean, it means to study the atmosphere and discover the embedded intention of others' behaviour). The results offered insights into the challenges encountered by nursing students on clinical placements and how students attempt to adapt and conform to the difficulties encountered in clinical education to maximise their learning and for their professional socialisation. The significance of the hidden curriculum was discussed. Conclusions: While experiential learning is a great opportunity for students to build on their coping skills and professional socialisation, a lack of support can result in failure to manage the hidden curriculum and theoretical and practical skills. Nursing educators therefore need to orientate students to the professional culture prior to beginning clinical placements. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Clinical; Collectivism; Culture; Curriculum; Education; Healthcare; Nursing; Placement; Professional; Socialisation,"article; atmosphere; clinical article; clinical education; coping behavior; curriculum; experiential learning; grounded theory; human; human experiment; interview; nursing student; qualitative research; scientist; skill; South Korea; theoretical study; adult; clinical competence; curriculum; epidemiology; female; health personnel attitude; nursing education; psychology; public relations; qualitative research; socialization; workplace; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Grounded Theory; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Qualitative Research; Republic of Korea; Socialization; Students, Nursing; Workplace",2-s2.0-85068840003

Using a T cell-transfer model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), we found that IFN-α/β treatment inhibited the migration of IFN-γ-producing pathogenic CD4+ T cells to effector sites. IFN-α/β upregulated the expression of the cognate ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, causing ligand-mediated downregulation of CXCR3 expression and effector T cell retention in the spleen. Accordingly, type I IFN did not alter EAU progression in CXCR3?/? mice. In uveitis patients, disease exacerbations correlated with reduced serum IFN-α concentrations. IFN-α/β reduced CXCR3 expression and migration by human effector T cells, and these parameters were associated with the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-α in uveitis patients. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis of type I IFN therapy for CNS autoimmune diseases and identify CXCR3 as a biomarker for effective type I IFN immunotherapy. The mechanisms by which type I IFN therapy limits CNS autoimmune diseases remain unclear.

The derived estimates of the marginal treatment effect are uniformly consistent under general conditions when data are from randomized clinical trials. For data from observational studies, however, these statistical quantities are often biased due to treatment-selection bias. Propensity score-based methods estimate the survival function by adjusting for the disparity of propensity scores between treatment groups. Unfortunately, misspecification of the regression model can lead to biased estimates. Using an empirical likelihood (EL) method in which the moments of the covariate distribution of treatment groups are constrained to equality, we obtain consistent estimates of the survival functions and the marginal treatment effect. Equating moments of the covariate distribution between treatment groups simulate the covariate distribution that would have been obtained if the patients had been randomized to these treatment groups. We establish the consistency and the asymptotic limiting distribution of the proposed EL estimators. We demonstrate that the proposed estimator is robust to model misspecification. Simulation is used to study the finite sample properties of the proposed estimator. The proposed estimator is applied to a lung cancer observational study to compare two surgical procedures in treating early-stage lung cancer patients. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Balance of covariates distribution; Kaplan–meier curve; marginal treatment effect; observational study; subsets of covariates; survival function; time-to-event outcome,Article; bootstrapping; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; data analysis; disease free survival; early cancer; empirical likelihood; gender; health disparity; health insurance; human; Kaplan Meier method; lung cancer; observational study; priority journal; propensity score; race; rank sum test; selection bias; simulation; statistical bias; survival rate; therapy effect; tumor volume; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery,2-s2.0-85068700520

Although communication and hearing complications have been documented in survivors, they have not been widely investigated across different types of cancer. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study at Queen Mary Hospital on 318 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), stage-4 neuroblastoma (NB), head and neck (H&N) cancers, or brain tumours (BTs) to describe the prevalence, type, onset time, and associated factors of communication and hearing complications in each group. Communication deficit and hearing loss (overall prevalence rates, 13.8% and 10.7%, respectively) were most prevalent in the BT group. Dysarthria, language impairment, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss were the most common complications. Diagnosis type was a predictive factor for developing complications, while the younger age of diagnosis was a protective factor against developing communication complications. Complications tended to occur within 5 years after diagnosis in the stage-4 NB and ALL groups, but after the fifth year in the H&N cancer and BT groups. Our findings suggest that tumour location and treatment method are associated with different risks of developing complications in patients with certain diagnoses. Neuroplasticity may act to protect younger patients from developing communication difficulties. These findings can help optimize the long-term care of cancer survivors in terms of treatment selection, counselling, and appropriate long-term follow-up and can guide future research in preventive measures and corresponding interventions. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cancer treatment; Childhood cancer; dysarthria; hearing loss; long-term complications; onset time; prevalence; protective factor,,2-s2.0-85057519592

This qualitative study aims to understand dental care-seeking behaviours of pregnant women and their oral health-related information acquisition, to identify barriers to and motivators for, dental visits, and further explore their expectations and possible strategies to improve oral health care during pregnancy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 pregnant women (after 32 gestational weeks) enrolled in the antenatal care programme in a public hospital in Hong Kong. Two main areas of interest were probed: Dental care-seeking behaviour and oral health information acquisition. Their expectations and suggestions on oral health care service for pregnant women were also explored. An inductive thematic approach was adopted to analyse the data. Results: Pregnant women’s dental care-seeking behaviour was deterred by some internal factors, such as misunderstandings on oral health, and priority on other issues over oral health. External factors such as inconvenient access to dental service during pregnancy also affected their care-seeking behaviours. Oral health information was passively absorbed by pregnant women through mass media and the social environment, which sometimes led to confusion. Oral health information acquisition from antenatal institutions and care providers was rare. Greater attention was paid to dental visit when they obtained proper information from previous dental visit experience or family members. A potential strategy to improve oral health care suggested by the interviewees is to develop a health care system strengthened by inter-professional (antenatal-dental) collaboration. Efficient oral health information delivery, convenient access to dental service, and improved ‘quality’ of dental care targeting the needs of pregnant women were identified as possible approaches to improve dental care for this population. Conclusion: Dental care-seeking behaviour during pregnancy was altered by various internal and external factors. A lack of, or conflict between, information sources result in confusion that can restrict utilisation of dental service. Integrating dental care into antenatal service would be a viable way to improve dental service utilisation. ? 2019 by the authors.",Antenatal care; Dental care seeking; Information behaviour; Oral health; Pregnancy; Qualitative methods,"dental health; health services; hospital sector; pregnancy; qualitative analysis; womens health; adult; article; attention; clinical article; controlled study; dental procedure; expectation; female; health care system; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; mass medium; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal care; public hospital; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; semi structured interview; social environment; attitude to health; health; information seeking; patient attitude; pregnancy; psychology; qualitative research; young adult; China; Hong Kong; Adult; Dental Care; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Oral Health; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Care; Qualitative Research; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85070516202

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a potentially life- or organ-threatening syndrome that can be induced by several disorders or medical interventions. There is overlap between the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and to a lesser extent, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We describe a case to illustrate the potential diagnostic difficulty, especially at initial presentation. CASE SUMMARY We reported a case of a 44-year-old woman that presented with diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and acute kidney injury. While the clinical presentation resembled that of Shiga toxin-induced HUS, the disease course was more consistent with gastrointestinal infection-related DIC. To aid in the accurate diagnosis of TMA and other associated disorders, we have undertaken a review and provided a clear interpretation of some typical biomarkers including schistocytes, LDH and platelet count, coagulation profile and more specific indexes of ADAMTS13, complement profile, and the isolation of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli CONCLUSION The use and correct interpretation of classical indexes of schistocyte, LDH, and platelet count is vital in diagnosing TMA and associated disorders. Understanding the characteristics of these biomarkers in the context of thrombocytopenia purpura, HUS and DIC will facilitate the accurate diagnosis and early initiation of appropriate treatment. ?

DNA methylation phenotypic age (DNAmPhenoAge) is a new aging biomarker and predictor of chronic disease risk. While smoking is a strong risk factor for chronic diseases and influences methylation, its influence on DNAmPhenoAge is unknown. We investigated associations of self-reported and epigenetic smoking indicators with DNAmPhenoAge acceleration in a longitudinal aging study in eastern Massachusetts. DNA methylation was measured in whole blood samples from multiple visits for 692 male participants in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study during 1999–2013. Acceleration was defined using residuals from linear regression of the DNAmPhenoAge on the chronological age. Cumulative smoking (pack-years) was significantly associated with DNAmPhenoAge acceleration, whereas self-reported smoking status was not. We observed significant validated associations between smoking-related loci and DNAmPhenoAge acceleration for 52 CpG sites, where 18 were hypomethylated and 34 were hypermethylated, mapped to 16 genes. The AHRR gene had the most loci (N = 8) among the 16 genes. We generated a smoking aging index based on these 52 loci, which showed positive significant associations with DNAmPhenoAge acceleration. These epigenetic biomarkers may help to predict age-related risks driven by smoking. ? 2019 by the authors.",Aging acceleration; Aging biomarker; DNA methylation phenotypic age; Smoking-related DNA methylation,"biomarker; disease; DNA; methylation; phenotype; risk factor; smoking; adult; aged; aging; Article; blood sampling; clinical indicator; controlled study; DNA methylation; epigenetics; gene locus; genetic association; human; Massachusetts; phenotype; risk assessment; self report; smoking; aging; CpG island; genetics; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; phenotype; smoking; very elderly; veteran; Massachusetts; United States; biological marker; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Biomarkers; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Massachusetts; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Self Report; Tobacco Smoking; Veterans",2-s2.0-85069268978

The current accuracy in distinguishing these diseases is unsatisfactory, leading to delays or unnecessary treatments. We compared the molecular signature of IOC and LMP cases by analysing their transcriptomic data and re-clustered them according to these data rather than the pathological dissection. We identified that FAM83D was highly expressed in IOC. To verify the role of FAM83D in the progression and metastasis, we used the isogenic ovarian cancer metastatic models, highly metastatic cells (HM) and non-metastatic cells (NM). Overexpression of FAM83D significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration and spheroid formation. This was consistent with previous data showing that high FAM83D expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Moreover, similar to the HM cells, the FAM83D-overexpressing NM cells demonstrated stronger phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Raf. This indicates that the action of FAM83D is mediated by the activation of the EGFR pathway. Taken together, this report suggested that FAM83D might be an excellent molecular marker to discriminate between IOC and LMP. ? 2019 The Authors.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit promising therapeutic effects on SLE, but whether MSCs phagocytose ACs and contributes to the underlying mechanism in the treatment of SLE remain unknown. Methods: Human umbilical cord (UC) MSCs were co-cultured with ACs, and the engulfment of ACs by MSCs was either detected by flow cytometry or observed under confocal laser scanning microscope. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls (HCs) were cultured in MSC conditioned medium (MCM) or MSC exposed to ACs (AC-MSC) conditioned medium (ACMCM), and then CD4+ T cell proliferation was detected. Soluble factors including prostaglandin (PG)E2 in the supernatants of MSCs and AC-MSCs, as well as in the mouse peritoneal lavage fluids (PLF) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cyclooxygenase (COX)2 inhibitors and siRNA transfection were utilized to determine the function of COX2/PGE2 in AC-MSC-mediated immunosuppression. PGE2 metabolites (PGEM) in the plasma of SLE patients were measured before and 24 h after MSC transplantation respectively. Findings: Human UC MSCs possessed the ability to engulf ACs. AC-MSCs increased MSC-mediated suppression of CD4+ T cell proliferation compared to MSCs alone. Mechanistically, ACs stimulated MSCs to express COX2 and consequently produced PGE2 that inhibited T cell responses. NF-κB signalling pathway mediated the activation of COX2/PGE2 in AC-MSCs. Importantly, in patients with SLE, the plasma PGEM levels increased significantly in those with reduced apoptotic mononuclear cells in peripheral blood after MSC transplantation. Interpretation: Clearance of ACs by MSCs contributes to immunosuppressive function via increasing PGE2 production. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of MSC-mediated phagocytosis of ACs in MSC-based immunotherapy.

Although great achievements have been made in diagnostic strategies and combination therapies in recent years, the prognosis of ESCC is still poor. Metastasis/recurrence has been the major factor responsible for poor prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism of ESCC dissemination remains elusive. Membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that degrades a number of substrates. This study's results indicated that the down-regulation of MME is significantly associated with advanced clinical stage (P < 0.05) and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). The down-regulation of MME in ESCC tumor tissues is correlated to poorer prognosis of the patients. Functional studies demonstrated that MME could significantly inhibit ESCC tumor cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo. MME overexpression could also interrupt ESCC tumor cell adhesion. Mechanistically, MME inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK thus interrupting the FAK-RhoA axis, which is important in cell movement. Taken together, these data show that MME regulates ESCC via FAK-RhoA axis. High expression of MME may indicate a beneficial outcome for patients. ? 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology",,focal adhesion kinase; membrane metalloendopeptidase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cell adhesion; cell motility; controlled study; correlation analysis; down regulation; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; FAK RhoA signaling axis; female; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; metastasis inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction,2-s2.0-85067551044

Mixed modeling was used to investigate within-subject differences. Results: Results indicated that SMCM was effective in helping users progress toward their recovery goals and in alleviating emotional exhaustion among caseworkers. However, it was ineffective in improving, hope, well-being, work alliance, and psychiatric symptoms. High intervention fidelity was associated with positive outcomes. Conclusions: Conceptually, SMCM has the potential to improve service users’ functional but not personal recovery. It is also potentially conducive to the well-being of caseworkers. ?

This study evaluated whether C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation biomarker, mediated the effects of growth (annual increase) in body mass index (BMI) on glycated hemoglobin (HbA). Methods: BMI and biomarker data were used from wave I to wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health study; 4,545 adolescents; mean age = 14.9 years; 55.7% female) with valid CRP data. A causal moderated mediation analysis evaluated the direct and indirect effects of BMI slope on HbA via CRP across gender, with demographic and clinical characteristics as model covariates. Results: The participants displayed a linear BMI growth of 0.53-0.58 kg/m2/year throughout adolescence, with substantial interindividual variation. The BMI slope showed positive direct and indirect effects on HbA via CRP across gender, and there was a significant exposure-mediator interaction effect. A standardized increase in the BMI slope raised the probability of an abnormal HbA value by 6.0-8.5% in participants with various profiles. The total natural indirect effect accounted for 13.3-15.9% of the total effect in males and 21.2-22.7% in females. Conclusions: The findings provide support for the inflammation mechanism in the effects of adiposity on glucose homeostasis. In adolescents, excess BMI growth was linked with a higher risk of glucose dysregulation either directly or indirectly via chronic inflammation. ? 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Data on long-term secondary atherothrombotic risk stratification are limited. Objectives To stratify post-NSTEMI patients for risk of recurrent cardiovascular events to maximise benefit from aggressive secondary prevention strategies using the TIMI Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS 2°P) score in a real-world cohort of NSTEMI patients. Methods and results This was a single-centre observational study of 891 post-NSTEMI patients (73.7 ± 12.7 years; male: 54.2%). The TRS 2°P is a nine-point risk stratification tool to predict cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal ischaemic stroke. After a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR: 11.4 - 60.2), 281 patients (31.5%) had developed a primary outcome (13.3%/year) including 196 cardiovascular deaths, 94 non-fatal MIs and 22 non-fatal strokes. The TRS 2°P score was strongly associated with the primary outcome. The annual incidence of primary composite endpoint for patients with TRS 2°P score =0 was 1.6%, and increased progressively to 47.4% for those with a TRS 2°P score ?6 (HR: 20.18, 95% CI: 4.85 to 84.05, p<0.001). Similar associations were also observed between the TRS 2°P score and cardiovascular death and MI (fatal and non-fatal), but not non-fatal ischaemic stroke. Conclusion The TRS 2°P score stratified post-NSTEMI patients for risk of future cardiovascular events and potentially help guide the selection of more aggressive secondary prevention therapy. ?

Here, we conducted a study on 21,008 older adults aged 65 years and above in Hong Kong to examine the cross-sectional associations of neighborhood economic disadvantage, recreational resources, walkability, library accessibility and physical activities on cognitive function and dementia. Both smaller and larger census tracts were adopted as proxies for neighborhoods. Using multilevel regression, neighborhood economic disadvantage was found to be associated with cognitive decline, net of individual features. This association was not explained by neighborhood built environment. Recreational environment was not a significant factor for older adults' cognitive function while library accessibility was. Neighborhood walkability was only related to dementia but not the cognitive function score. Physical activity can partly explain the relationship between neighborhood environment and cognitive function. No significant interaction effect was identified except on the educational level and neighborhood library accessibility.

We evaluated the transmission risk along the poultry supply chain. Methods: During October 2015 and July 2016, four rounds of cross-sectional surveys were performed to characterize AIV spread in farms, transport vehicles, slaughterhouses, wholesale and retail live poultry markets (LPMs). Poultry cloacal and oral swabs, environmental swabs, bioaerosol samples and human sera were collected. Poultry and environmental samples were tested for AIVs by rRT-PCR, further subtyped by next generation sequencing. Previous human H9N2 infections were identified by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization tests. Logistic regression was fitted to compare AIV transmission risk in different settings. Results: AIVs was detected in 23.9% (424/1771) of the poultry and environmental samples. AIV detection rates in farms, transport vehicles, wholesale and retail LPMs were 4.5%, 11.1%, 30.3% and 51.2%, respectively. 5.2%, 8.3% and 12.8% of the poultry workers were seropositive in farms, wholesale and retail LPMs, respectively. The regression analysis showed that virus detection and transmission risk to human increased progressively along the poultry supply chain. Conclusions: Strengthening control measures at every level along the poultry supply chain, using a one health approach, is crucial to control AIV circulation. ? 2019",Avian influenza virus; One health; Poultry supply chain; Poultry worker; Prevalence; Transmission risk,agricultural land; article; avian influenza virus; case report; China; clinical article; hemagglutination inhibition; human; Influenza A virus (H9N2); market; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; poultry; prevalence; risk assessment; slaughterhouse; virus detection; worker,2-s2.0-85066118828

Moreover, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors restrain the activity of HDAC and cause increased histone acetylation, which may be related to alcohol dependence. Methods: Ethanol dependence was modelled in animals by persistent alcohol exposure and tested in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. To induce CPP, the alcohol-treated rats were given orally gradient concentration (3%, 6%, and 9% v/v) alcohol administration for 20 consecutive days. The sodium butyrate (NaB)-treated rats were injected daily. Cognitive flexibility was evaluated using an attentional set-shifting task (ASST) in which the rats performed a series of seven consecutive discriminations after the final CPP paradigm. Results: Ethanol administration induced alcohol dependence behaviors, with more time spent in the ethanol-paired compartment. Compared with the CPP scores of the control group, the scores of the ethanol- and NaB-treated groups were significantly higher. In the ASST, alcohol-treated rats had significantly increased number of trials to reach criteria (TTC) in most phases, higher error rate, and lower cognitive levels compared to the control group. Moreover, the present findings demonstrated that NaB combined with ethanol caused cognitive deficits as the result of an increased number of TTC during the ASST. Conclusions: The attentional/cognitive flexibility of the prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent rats was damaged and the NaB administration procedure itself did not produce cognitive deficits, but instead exacerbated cognitive impairment in alcohol-dependent rats. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Alcohol dependence; Attentional set-shifting; Cognitive flexibility; Sodium butyrate,alcohol; butyric acid; alcoholism; animal experiment; Article; attentional set shifting task; behavior change; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; male; nonhuman; olfactory discrimination; place preference; priority journal; rat; task performance; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test,2-s2.0-85065061444

WASp is the first identified and most widely studied protein belonging to the actin nucleation-promoting factor family and plays significant role in integrating and transforming signals from critical receptors on the cell surface to actin remodeling. WASp functions in immune defense and homeostasis through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton-dependent cellular processes as well as processes uncoupled with actin polymerization like nuclear transcription programs. In this article, we review the mechanisms of WASp activation through an understanding of its structure. We further discuss the role of WASp in adaptive immunity, paying special attention to some recent findings on the crucial role of WASp in the formation of immunological synapse, the regulation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and in the prevention of autoimmunity. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Autoimmunity; BCR signaling; Follicular helper T cells; T-cell activation; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein,B lymphocyte receptor; F actin; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein; actin filament; actin polymerization; adaptive immunity; autoimmune disease; B lymphocyte; cell adhesion; cell migration; cytokine release; human; immunoglobulin production; immunological synapse; lymphocyte function; microtubule organizing center; nonhuman; priority journal; prophylaxis; protein conformation; protein structure; Review; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; Tfh cell,2-s2.0-85064755252

Strategies, including the prescribing of colony-stimulating growth factors (CSFs), are adopted when a high risk (&gt; 20%) of neutropenic complications are seen in the clinical trial setting. With a diverse treatment population that may differ from the patient groups recruited to studies, appropriate prescribing decisions by clinicians are essential. At present, results are conflicting from studies evaluating the risks of certain patient attributes on neutropenic events; we aimed to aggregate these associations to guide future management. Design: A systematic review with a meta-analysis was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Studies were identified through a literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases from inception to December 1, 2017. Studies were included into a meta-analysis if they adjusted for confounders; analyses were conducted in STATA v 15.1 SE. Results: A total of 4415 articles were retrieved by the search with 37 meeting the inclusion criteria and 12 eligible for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted for increasing age and yielded a pooled odds ratio of 1.39 (1.11, 1.76, I2 = 24.1%), in our subgroup analysis of 4814 patients. Odds ratios for studies were pooled that reported associations for one co-morbidity compared to none and resulted in an overall odds of 1.54 (CI 1.09–2.09, I2?= 13.1%), including 9189 patients in total. Conclusions: Results can enhance current guidance in prescribing primary prophylaxis for treatments that either fall marginally under the internationally recognised 20% neutropenia risk. ? 2019, The Author(s).",Cancer; Chemotherapy; Neutropenia; Neutropenic sepsis; Risk,hemoglobin; age; bone marrow suppression; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; chemoprophylaxis; comorbidity; hemoglobin blood level; human; neutropenia; priority journal; Review; risk factor; systematic review; blood; chemically induced; meta analysis; neoplasm; neutropenia; Humans; Neoplasms; Neutropenia,2-s2.0-85064640820

Methods: Microarray data of HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC were retrieved from NCBI GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified by performing differential expression analysis. A functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore the biological processes and signaling pathways that DEGs and DE-miRNAs were involved in, respectively. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed to identify hub genes. miRNA-target network and miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network were each constructed in order to identify risk-marker miRNAs. An miRNA-target-pathway network was constructed in order to explore the function of identified risk-marker miRNAs. Results: Microarray data from 3 datasets (GSE39366, GSE40774, and GSE55550) was included and analyzed. The PPI network identified 3 hub genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2). MiR-107 and miR-142-3p were found to play the most significant role in both the DE-miRNA-target network as well as in the miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network. MiR-107 was involved in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting many genes (CAV1, CDK6, MYB, and SERPINB5) and regulating the p53 signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the autophagy pathway. In addition, miR-142-3p was implicated in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting the PPFIA1 gene and regulating transcriptional dysregulation and other cancerous pathways. Conclusion: Three genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2), two miRNAs (miR-107 and miR-142-3p), and four pathways (p53, PI3K-Akt, autophagy, and transcription dysregulation in cancer) were identified to play critical roles in distinguishing HPV-positive OPSCC from HPV-negative OPSCC. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Genes; Human papillomavirus; miRNAs; Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; Pathways,"caveolin 1; cyclin dependent kinase 6; microRNA; microRNA 107; microRNA 142 3p; ppfia1 protein; protein Myb; protein p53; rpa2 protein; serpinb5 protein; tumor protein; ubiquitin; ubiquitin D; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; microRNA; MIRN107 microRNA, human; MIRN142 microRNA, human; PPFIA1 protein, human; replication factor A; RPA2 protein, human; signal transducing adaptor protein; UBD protein, human; ubiquitin; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; Article; autophagy; bioinformatics; carcinogenesis; controlled study; down regulation; epigenetics; gene function; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; gene targeting; genetic difference; microarray analysis; molecular pathology; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma; papillomavirus infection; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; transcription regulation; upregulation; Wart virus; biology; gene expression; genetic epigenesis; genetics; human; information processing; metabolism; oropharynx tumor; Papillomaviridae; protein analysis; squamous cell carcinoma; virology; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Computational Biology; Datasets as Topic; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression; Humans; Microarray Analysis; MicroRNAs; Oropharyngeal Neoplasms; Papillomaviridae; Protein Interaction Maps; Replication Protein A; Ubiquitins; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1",2-s2.0-85064601254

We consider how the use of a second or subsequent language impacts on these consultations, and on discussions and decisions about further action. The presence or absence of shared first language did not appear to affect the extent to which particular courses of action were promoted or recommended. Recommendations were a common occurrence across consultations with and without shared first language. However, we argue that the routine use of recommendations can be consequential, as second language speakers may have more limited resources to interrogate or contest these.

ZTEx refers to the integration of simple strength- and stamina-enhancing physical activity into daily life, which can be done anytime, anywhere and by anyone. This paper presents the development, feasibility, and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention under the Hong Kong Jockey Club FAMILY Project. Needs assessments were conducted with social workers from the?Christian Family Services Center(CFSC) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD). This single group prospective ZTEx intervention trial, guided by the Health Action Process Approach, included a 3-hr core session at baseline and a 1-hr booster session at 1-month follow-up. Fifty-six participants?(social and service-related workers) from CFSC (n?=?28) and SWD (n?=?28) received the intervention and completed the self-administered questionnaires at baseline. Forty-nine and 43 participants completed the 1-month and 3-month self-administered questionnaires, respectively. Fifteen participants attended the focus group interviews to share their feedback on ZTEx intervention after implementing their community-based ZTEx activities. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted with missing data replaced by baseline values. Participants reported significant decreases in sitting time by 27 (2, 52) minutes (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 36 (0.2, 71) minutes on a weekday, increases in physical activity while seated by 0.7 (0.2, 1.4) days and 1.1 (0.6, 1.7) days in a week, and improvements in perceived knowledge, outcome expectancies and plan on doing ZTEx at the 1-month and 3-month follow-up, respectively. Balance and muscle strength significantly improved at the 1-month follow-up. The effect ranged from small to large?(Cohen's d: 0.27–1.05, all p?<?0.05). The qualitative feedbacks support the quantitative findings. Our findings show early evidence that ZTEx effectively reduced sedentary behaviour and enhanced physical activity and fitness. Further trials on this simple and low-cost intervention as the first step to promote higher intensity exercise are warranted. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",brief intervention; physical activity; sedentary behaviour; Zero-time Exercise,adult; article; controlled study; exercise; expectancy; family service; feasibility study; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; intervention study; interview; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; needs assessment; physical activity; prospective study; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; sedentary time; social welfare; social worker,2-s2.0-85062364559

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of two sequential applications in larger-sized nodules. Methods: Fifty patients underwent ablation of a large-sized nodule (baseline volume ? 20?mL and diameter ? 50?mm). Thirty-one (62.0%) patients underwent single application (group I) while 19 (38.0%) underwent two sequential applications (group II). Nodule shrinkage (by volume reduction ratio or VRR), pain scores during and after ablation, and rate of vocal cord palsy (VCP), skin burn, and nausea/vomiting were compared between the two groups. t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables while chi-square test was used for categorical variables. To determine factors for VRR, multivariate analysis was done by logistic regression analysis. Results: Total energy delivered and treatment time were significantly more in group II (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Total energy per nodule volume (kJ/mL) was also significantly greater in group II (1.01?kJ/mL vs. 0.57?kJ/mL, p < 0.001). The 6-month VRR was significantly greater in group II (56.74 ± 11.47% vs. 43.49 ± 12.03%, p = 0.004). Pain severity and rates of VCP, skin burn, and nausea/vomiting were comparable between the two groups (p > 0.05). Sequential application was an independent determinant of 6-month VRR (OR = 13.936, 95% CI = 1.738–197.399, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Sequential application led to better 6-month treatment efficacy than single application in large-sized nodules. Patients undergoing sequential application are not at greater risks of treatment-related side effects afterwards. Key Points: ? Sequential application produces better 6-month efficacy over single application for large-sized nodules. ? Sequential HIFU application is well-tolerated and safe in patients with large-sized nodules. ?

It is important to know which older patients would be candidates for aggressive therapy based on their prognosis, and to develop a model that can help determine prognosis. Methods: Data on older patients (?70 years) enrolled on 38 NCI cooperative group trials of advanced NSCLC from 1991 to 2011 were analyzed. Multivariable Cox PH model was built with a stepwise selection. We derived a prognostic score using the estimated Cox PH regression coefficient. We then calculated the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of survival in the testing set. Results: The final analysis included 1467 patients, who were randomly divided into a training (n = 963) and a testing set (n = 504). The prognostic risk score was calculated as: 3 (if male) + 3 (if PS = 1) + 8 (if PS = 2) + 11 (if initial stage = IV) + 4 (if weight loss). Patients were classified into two prognostic groups: good (0–8) and poor (?9). The median survival in the two groups in the testing set were 13.15 (95% CI, 10.82–15.91) and 8.52 months (95% CI, 7.5–9.63), respectively. The model had area under the 1-year and 2-year ROCs (0.6 and 0.65, respectively) that were higher than existing models. Conclusions: Male gender, poor performance status, distant metastases and recent weight loss predict for poor overall survival (OS) in older patients with advanced NSCLC.

Intravenous insulin with or without heparin, and plasmapheresis are available regimens. However, there is no consensus on first-line therapy. Methods/design: The Bi-TPAI trial is a multicenter, parallel group, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial in patients with early HTG-AP. The Bi-TPAI trial will include 220 patients with HTG-AP from 17 large tertiary hospitals in China. Patients assigned to the intensive insulin group will be administered an intravenous continuous infusion of regular human insulin at a rate of 0.1 units/kg·h and up to 0.3 units/kg·h. Patients allocated to the plasmapheresis group will receive standard-volume plasmapheresis. The primary endpoint is the time it takes for the TG level to reduce to 500 mg/dl. The secondary endpoints are ICU and hospital lengths of stay, 28-day mortality, severity of HTG-AP, incidence of hypoglycemia, HTG-AP complications, and cost-effectiveness. Discussion: The Bi-TPAI trial will prove that intensive insulin therapy is non-inferior to plasmapheresis. Intensive insulin therapy should be an effective, safe, available, and cheaper triglyceride-lowering therapy for hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis.

Recent Findings: Nutrition can change gene expression via epigenetics such as DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histones. A growing number of both experimental and clinical studies suggested that histone modifications are very sensitive to changes in nutritional availability and potentially impact the development and progression of metabolic disorders. Recent advances in proteomic studies provided evidence linking histone modifications to over-nutrition and metabolic dysregulation. In this review, we will summarize the recent findings on two classical histone modifications, i.e., acetylation and methylation and the related findings from clinical studies and potential applications. Summary: The involvement of histone modifications in the progression of metabolic diseases is now widely appreciated. Over the recent years, mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches discovered and mapped different kind of histone modifications linking obesity and metabolic diseases. The list of these modifications is evergrowing; however, their functions and roles in obesity are not well understood. Same as for the most well studied histone modifications, namely acetylation and methylation. Although much has been learnt from these two modifications, their contributions in regulation of metabolism are still largely unknown. It will be necessary to carry out more studies to further dissect the importance of the availability of substrates and activities of the enzymes for histone acetylation and methylation in the metabolic tissues. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Acetyl-CoA; Acetylation; Diabetes; Histone modifications; Methylation; Obesity; S-Adenosylmethionine,3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; betaine homocysteine methyltransferase; CCAAT enhancer binding protein; diacylglycerol; histone acetyltransferase; histone H3; homocysteine; metformin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; RNA polymerase; s adenosylhomocysteine; transcription factor FKHR; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; adipogenesis; AMPK signaling; body mass; chromatin immunoprecipitation; conformational transition; disease exacerbation; DNA methylation; DNA repair; energy expenditure; enzyme activity; gene control; gene expression; gene expression level; histone acetylation; histone methylation; histone modification; human; lipolysis; mass spectrometry; metabolic disorder; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; nutrient availability; obesity; overnutrition; priority journal; proteomics; Review; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85071422112

Most of these compounds showed moderate-to-obvious cytotoxicity against five cancer cell lines (A549, HepG2, MDA-MB-231, MKN-45, HCT116). Among these cell lines, compounds had obvious effects on HCT116. Especially for 8Ae, the IC50 was low to 0.25 μM. 8Ae can inhibit the viability and induce the apoptosis of HCT116 cells but exhibit no cytotoxic activity in noncancerous NCM460 colon cells. 8Ae can also arrest the G2/M cell cycle in HCT116 cells by inhibiting the α-tubulin expression. Zebrafish bioassay-guided screen showed the 22 moscatilin derivatives had potent anti-angiogenic activities and compound 8Ae had better activities than positive compound. Molecular docking indicated 8Ae interacted with tubulin at the affinity of ?7.2 Kcal/mol. In conclusion, compound 8Ae was a potential antitumor and anti-angiogenesis candidate for further development. ? 2019",Anti-angiogenesis; Antitumor; Bibenzyl; Moscatilin derivatives; Tubulin,"1,2 dimethoxy 4 (4 nitrophenethyl)benzene; 1,2 dimethoxy 4 phenethylbenzene; 2 (3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl)pyridine; 2, 6 dimethoxy 4 [2 (pyridin 2 yl)ethyl]phenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 (2 methoxyphenethyl)phenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 (4 nitrophenethyl)phenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 phenethylphenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 [2 (pyridin 4 yl)ethyl]phenol; 4 (2 chlorophenethyl) 1,2 dimethoxybenzene; 4 (2 chlorophenethyl) 2, 6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2 chlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2 fluorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2,3 dichlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2,4 dichlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (3 fluorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (3,4 dichlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl) 2 methoxyphenol; 4 (4 bromophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (4 chlorophenethyl) 1,2 dimethoxybenzene; 4 (4 chlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (4 fluorophenethyl) 1,2 dimethoxybenzene; 4 (4 fluorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (4 hydroxy 3 methoxyphenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 5 (3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl) 2 methoxyphenol; alpha tubulin; angiogenesis inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; moscatilin derivative; semaxanib; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; antiangiogenic activity; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; binding affinity; cancer inhibition; cell viability; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug design; drug potency; drug protein binding; drug screening; drug synthesis; effective dose (pharmacology); G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; HCT 116 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MKN45 cell line; molecular docking; NCM460 cell line; protein expression",2-s2.0-85064848072

We examined the time trends of daily television (TV) viewing and video game playing and the associated socioeconomic factors in Chinese children in Hong Kong, the most developed and westernized city in China. Methods: In a panel data study involving 538,300 primary four and 510,294 primary six students from 1999/2000 to 2008/09, data on socioeconomic status, sedentary behaviors (TV viewing and video game playing) and other lifestyle habits were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Trends in sedentary behaviors over time were assessed. Their socioeconomic disparities were examined by interactions in generalized estimating equations with the adjustment for weight status and extracurricular physical activities. Results: The age and sex-standardized prevalence of ?2 h daily TV viewing decreased from 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51.1-51.8%) in 1999/2000 to 43.8% (95% CI 43.4-44.2%) in 2008/09 (P for trend < 0.001), whereas that of ?1 h daily video game playing increased from 8.2% (95% CI 7.9-8.4%) to 22.4% (95% CI 22.0-22.7%). Both sedentary behaviors were more prevalent in boys than girls, but the disparities decreased over time (Ratio of odds ratio [ROR] = 0.996 and 0.924 for TV viewing and video game playing, respectively). In contrast, both sedentary behaviors were increasingly more prevalent in children whose parents had lower education levels or non-managerial/professional occupations (ROR 1.006-1.082). Conclusions: Children in lower socioeconomic families in Hong Kong were increasingly at risk of having sedentary behaviors over years and thus deserve more attention. Effective strategies targeting children and/or their parents of lower socioeconomic status are needed to reduce sedentary behaviors. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Health disparity; Sedentary behavior; TV viewing; Video game playing,article; attention; child; China; controlled study; education; female; girl; habit; health disparity; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; occupation; physical activity; prevalence; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; social status; socioeconomics; student; television viewing; video game; child behavior; epidemiology; psychology; statistics and numerical data; television; time factor; video game; Child; Child Behavior; Female; Health Status Disparities; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Sedentary Behavior; Socioeconomic Factors; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Television; Time Factors; Video Games,2-s2.0-85067287481

Thyroid autoimmunity has been associated with endometriosis. This work investigated the potential pathophysiological link between endometriosis and thyroid disorders. Transcripts and proteins involved in thyroid metabolism are dysregulated in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of endometriotic patients, leading to resistance of ectopic endometrium to triiodothyronine (T3) action and local accumulation of thyroxine (T4). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) acts as a proliferative and prooxidative hormone on all endometria of endometriosis patients and controls, whereas T3 and T4 act to specifically increase ectopic endometrial cell proliferation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mouse studies confirmed the data gained in vitro since endometriotic implants were found to be bigger when thyroid hormones increased. A retrospective analysis of endometriosis patients with or without a thyroid disorder revealed an increased chronic pelvic pain and disease score in endometriotic patients with a thyroid disorder. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Human mobility and travel patterns influence the spread of infection between cities and countries. We find that the infection severity in downstream cities during outbreaks is related to transmission rate, recovery rate, travel rate, travel duration and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day. The peak value of the infected population in downstream cities is slightly higher than that in source cities. However, as the number of cities increases, the severity increase percentage during outbreaks between end and source cities is constant. The surveillance of important nodes connecting cities, such as airports and train stations, can help delay the occurrence time of infection outbreaks. The city-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to these cities, but also to cities that are strongly connected (i.e., have a high travel rate) to them. The city-exit surveillance of hub cities contributes to other downstream cities, but only slightly to itself. Surveillance conducted in hub cities is highly efficient in controlling infection transmission. Only strengthening the individual immunity of frequent travellers is not efficient for infection control. However, reducing the number of person-to-person contacts per day effectively limits the spread of infection. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",City; Human mobility; Infectious disease transmission; Severity increase percentage; SIR model; Travel pattern,disease control; disease severity; disease transmission; infectious disease; mobility; tourist behavior; travel behavior; Article; bacterial transmission; disease severity; disease surveillance; disease transmission; human; immune response; infection; infection control; influenza A (H1N1); mathematical analysis; patient monitoring; priority journal; probability; quantitative analysis; simulation; tourism,2-s2.0-85062880140

Here, we used linkage disequilibrium score regression and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine the genetic associations between BMI, breast size and breast cancer risk. Methods: Summary-level genotype data from 23andMe, Inc (breast size, n = 33 790), the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (breast cancer risk, n = 228 951) and the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (BMI, n = 183 507) were used for our analyses. In assessing causal relationships, four complementary MR techniques [inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, weighted mode and MR-Egger regression] were used to test the robustness of the results. Results: The genetic correlation (rg) estimated between BMI and breast size was high (rg = 0.50, P = 3.89x10-43). All MR methods provided consistent evidence that higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with larger breast size [odds ratio (ORIVW): 2.06 (1.80-2.35), P = 1.38x10-26] and lower overall breast cancer risk [ORIVW: 0.81 (0.74-0.89), P = 9.44x10-6]. No evidence of a relationship between genetically predicted breast size and breast cancer risk was found except when using the weighted median and weighted mode methods, and only with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative risk. There was no evidence of reverse causality in any of the analyses conducted (P &gt; 0.050). Conclusion: Our findings indicate a potential positive causal association between BMI and breast size and a potential negative causal association between BMI and breast cancer risk. We found no clear evidence for a direct relationship between breast size and breast cancer risk. ? 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

This study examined if Twitter users from countries with various income levels responded differently to World AIDS Day. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models as classifiers of relevant tweets was evaluated. A manual coding of 1,826 randomly sampled HIV/AIDS-related original tweets from November 30 through December 2, 2014 was completed. Logistic regression was applied to analyze the association between the World Bank-designated income level of users’ self-reported countries and Twitter contents. To identify the optimal SVM model, 1278 (70%) of the 1826 sampled tweets were randomly selected as the training set, and 548 (30%) served as the test set. Another 180 tweets were separately sampled and coded as the held-out dataset. Compared with tweets from low-income countries, tweets from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries had 60% lower odds to mention epidemiology (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.404; 95% CI: 0.166, 0.981) and three times the odds to mention compassion/support (aOR = 3.080; 95% CI: 1.179, 8.047). Tweets from lower-middle-income countries had 79% lower odds than tweets from low-income countries to mention HIV-affected sub-populations (aOR = 0.213; 95% CI: 0.068, 0.664). The optimal SVM model was able to identify relevant tweets from the held-out dataset of 180 tweets with an accuracy (F1 score) of 0.72.

We observed that albeit adhesion is not required for cells to migrate in such a confined microenvironment, the migrating velocity of cells is strongly influenced by the interactions between the cells and the channel wall, with a stronger adhesion leading to diminished cell motility. Furthermore, through examiningmore than 20 different types of cancer cells, we found a linear positive correlation between the protein concentration of the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and the cell migrating speed. Knockdown of AQP4 in invasive re-populated cancer stem cells reduced their migration capability down to the level that is comparable to their parental cancer cells. Interestingly, these observations can all be quantitatively explained by the osmotic engine model where the cell movement is assumed to be driven by cross-membrane ion/water transport, while adhesion acts as a frictional resistance against the cell motility. By providing versatile and controllable features in regulating and characterizing themigration capability of cells, our systemmay serve as a useful tool in quantifying how cell motility is influenced by different physical and biochemical factors, as well as elucidating the mechanisms behind, in the future. ? 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

However, the dynamics of EBV episome maintenance in infected nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) cells remain largely undefined. Here, we report the establishment of a highly efficient cell-free EBV infection method for NPE cells. By using this method, we have defined some of the dynamic events involved in the early stage of EBV infection in NPE cells. We report, for the first time, a rapid loss of EBV copies from infected NPE cells during the first 12–72 h post-infection. The rate of EBV loss slowed at later stages of infection. Live cell imaging revealed that the freshly infected NPE cells were delayed in entry into mitosis compared with uninfected cells. Freshly infected NPE cells transcribed significantly higher levels of lytic EBV genes BZLF1 and BMRF1 yet significantly lower levels of EBER1/2 than stably infected NPE cells. Notably, there were very low or undetectable levels of protein expressions of EBNA1, LMP1, Zta and Rta in freshly infected NPE cells, whereas EBNA1 and LMP1 proteins were readily detected in stable EBV-infected NPE cells. The kinetics of EBV loss and the differential EBV gene expression profiles between freshly and stably infected NPE cells are in line with the suggestion of epigenetic changes in the EBV genome that affect viral gene expression and the adaptation of host cells to EBV infection to maintain persistent EBV infection in NPE cells. ? 2019 The Authors.",Cell-free infection; Dynamics; Early events; Epstein-Barr virus; Gene expression; Nasopharyngeal epithelial cells,"Article; cell cycle; epigenetics; epithelium cell; Epstein Barr virus infection; gene expression profiling; host cell; kinetics; live cell imaging; mitosis; nonhuman; pharyngeal cell line; priority journal; virus gene; virus genome; virus infection; cell line; epithelium cell; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; genetic epigenesis; genetics; human; nasopharynx; virology; BZLF1 protein, Herpesvirus 4, Human; EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1; Epstein Barr virus antigen; transactivator protein; transcriptome; Cell Line; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epithelial Cells; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Nasopharynx; Trans-Activators; Transcriptome",2-s2.0-85067494831

Although the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) polymorphism (rs671: Glu>Lys) has a strong effect on acetaldehyde metabolism, the association of rs671 with BC risk and its interaction with alcohol intake have not been fully elucidated. We conducted a pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies, with individual data on Asian ancestry women participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Methods: We included 12,595 invasive BC cases and 12,884 controls for the analysis of rs671 and BC risk, and 2,849 invasive BC cases and 3,680 controls for the analysis of the gene-environment interaction between rs671 and alcohol intake for BC risk. The pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with rs671 and its interaction with alcohol intake for BC risk were estimated using logistic regression models. Results: The Lys/Lys genotype of rs671 was associated with increased BC risk (OR?=?1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.30, p?=?0.014). According to tumor characteristics, the Lys/Lys genotype was associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p?=?0.008), progesterone receptor (PR)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.03–1.36, p?=?0.015), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative BC (OR?=?1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.48, p?=?0.012). No evidence of a gene-environment interaction was observed between rs671 and alcohol intake (p?=?0.537). Conclusion: This study suggests that the Lys/Lys genotype confers susceptibility to BC risk among women of Asian ancestry, particularly for ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-negative tumor types. ? 2019 The Authors.

Methods: We followed a standard five-stage process: forward translation, synthesis, backward translation, expert panel review and field-testing to achieve linguistic and conceptual equivalence. The version was officially known as Chinese (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong version) DASH. (Chinese QMH,HK version DASH) (http://www.dash.iwh.on.ca/sites/dash/public/translations/DASH_Chinese_HK_2013.pdf). Results: Its internal consistency was then evaluated with 138 participants suffering from upper extremity musculoskeletal conditions. The results were high in DASH-Disability/Symptom module (DASH-DS) (Cronbach alpha 0.97), DASH-Work module (DASH-W) (Cronbach alpha 0.97) and DASH-Sports / Performing Arts module (DASH-SM) (Cronbach alpha 0.99). The test-retest reliability was evaluated with a subgroup of participants who had completed the Chinese (QMH,HK version) DASH on two occasions, with a median interval of 6.5 days. The results were excellent among DASH-DS Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.98 and DASH-W (ICC = 0.90). Good test-retest reliability was found in DASH-SM (ICC = 0.89). Construct validity of DASH-DS showed good correlation with the sub-domains of physical functioning (r = ?.564) and social functioning (r = ?.544) of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Similarly, construct validity of DASH-W also showed good correlation with the sub-domains of physical functioning (r = ?.510) and bodily pain (r = ?.503) of SF-36.

Our results showed that, during the observed period, the major contribution to the improvement in life expectancy in Hong Kong was attributable to the older population for both males and females. Contributions of malignant neoplasms in the period of 1986– 1995, 1996–2005 and 2006–2015 were 0.613, 0.279 and 0.887 years in males and 0.391, 0.312 and 0.226 years in females, respectively. For circulatory diseases, the corresponding figures were 1.452, 0.202 and 0.832 years in males and 0.675, 0.192 and 1.069 years in females, with the largest contribution also shifting to older ages. However, these positive contributions were partly offset by the negative contribution of pneumonia, especially among those at advanced ages. Furthermore, although the impact was limited, attention should also be paid to the prevalence of some chronic diseases among the younger age groups in recent years. ? 2019 by the authors.

Reactive oxygen species take part in the disease progression, but it is unknown if antioxidant rich garlic arrests lipid and cholesterol oxidation in hypercholesterolemia. This study provides fermented garlic or non-fermented garlic to mild hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol: 5.2–6.2 mmol L?1) and determines its ability to relieve in vivo oxidative stress by measuring multiple oxidized lipid products of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) in plasma. Plasma fatty acids levels are also analyzed. After 13 weeks supplementation, both groups show a significant increase in α-linolenic acid level (p &lt; 0.05). Levels of arachidic acid increase and palmitoleic acid decreases in the group supplemented with non-fermented garlic. Of the oxidized PUFA products, notably those derived from enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid, namely hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), show a significant difference. Levels of lipoxygenase mediate 5-HETE and 12-HETE, and CYP-P450 mediates 9-HETE and 11-HETE decreases after non-fermented garlic supplementation only (p &lt; 0.05). Non-enzymatic PUFA oxidation and COPs are not altered by garlic supplementation. Overall, only non-fermented garlic intake shows selective antioxidant properties in mild hypercholesterolemia where limited effect is found in reducing lipid oxidation. Practical Applications: Current research provides a new insight for the use of garlic extract as a nutraceutical to reduce in vivo oxidative stress. The modified enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid in mild hypercholesterolemia after non-fermented garlic extract intake potentially preventes the progression of chronic inflammation that can lead to complicated pathologies such as arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Garlic is a claimed functional food. The fermented form is proposed to have stronger antioxidant properties. Analysis of mild hypercholesterolemia plasma before and after fermented or non-fermented garlic extract intake for 13 weeks revealed augmented α-linolenic acid. Garlic appeared to be selective in the antioxidant property. Pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (5-, 9-, 11-, and 12-HETE) released via enzymatic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oxidation reduced after non-fermented garlic extract intake only. However, intake of both garlic types did not reduce non-enzymatic PUFA oxidation status. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With the advance of tissue engineering, hydrogel injection therapy is introduced as an alternative treatment. Therapeutic drugs and growth factors can be carried by hydrogels and delivered to patients. Abaloparatide, as an analog of human recombinant parathyroid hormone protein (PTHrp) and an alternative to teriparatide, has been considered as a drug for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis since 2017. Since only limited cases of receiving abaloparatide with polymeric scaffolds have been reported, the effects of abaloparatide on pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 are investigated in this study. It is found that in vitro abaloparatide treatment can promote pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells’ viability, differentiation, and mineralization significantly. For the drug delivery system, 3D porous structure of the methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel is found effective for prolonging the release of abaloparatide (more than 10 days). Therefore, injectable photo-crosslinked GelMA hydrogel is used in this study to prolong the release of abaloparatide and to promote healing of defected bones in rats. Overall, data collected in this study show no contradiction and imply that Abaloparatide-loaded GelMA hydrogel is effective in stimulating bone regeneration. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although KD has been reported in almost all populations, it is especially common in North East Asia such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan which has the highest incidence worldwide that in contrast to the US, Europe and Australia. It is reported that more than 1 in 100 Japanese have had KD by 12 years of age. KD is a potentially life-threatening condition because it can cause serious pediatric-acquired heart disease such as asymptomatic coronary artery ectasia or an aneurysm. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a routine and effective treatment for KD and significantly reduces risk of coronary artery abnormalities during the acute phase of illness from approximately 15%–25% to 5%–8%. In spite of its effectiveness, some patient do not respond to this therapy and still develop coronary aneurysms. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) as a therapy alone for KD was rare. The success of this patient with KD treated by CHM provided a new way of thinking for harmonizing Eastern-Western drug for KD and the potential utilization of CHM as a source of new drugs could be an alternative. Clinical features and outcome: A 17 month-old boy suffered from persistent fever, poor appetite, vomiting diarrhea, slight cough, running nose and throat congestion for 2 days and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection. He had taken cefprozil suspension plus ankahuangmin 2 days for his symptoms before his final diagnosis of KD, but it was unsuccessful. He continued to have a fever, in addition, he presented with bilateral bulbar conjunctival congestion without exudate, labial and lingual erythema and was diagnosed with KD before his first CHM visit, his parents refused to continue receiving Western medicine. Therefore, his parents sought CHM for further intervention. His symptoms subsided, and the blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiographies show completely normal after regular therapy with Xiao Chai Hu Tang (小柴胡?) combined with Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang (???五?), Huang Lian Jie Du Tang (??解毒?), and Wu Ling San (五苓散) for approximately 21 days. Neither complications nor side-effects were noted during the CHM treatment. Conclusions: In this case, CHM may be an effective alternative therapy for the treatment of KD, and furthermore, may also be applied as an option to salvage failed intravenous immunoglobulin procedures.

The recovery movement has gradually transformed mental health services, for example, through the introduction of peer support services (sharing of expert-by-experience knowledge), and it has challenged the prevailing view that people with mental illness cannot recover. Aims: Through this study, the researchers explored how family caregivers in a Chinese context conceptualise recovery, how caregivers interact with peer support workers (PSWs) and how they perceive peer support services. Methods: Fourteen family caregivers from community settings participated in individual semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed through thematic analysis. Results: Family caregivers had multifaceted definitions of recovery and had various degrees of contact with PSWs. The views and experiences shared by PSWs were hope-instilling for caregivers and changed their perception of BD and their loved ones. Some limitations of PSWs were also identified. Conclusion: Social connectedness and functional outcomes were important indicators of recovery among Chinese family caregivers. Caregivers began to understand the benefits of PSWs after experiencing their services. Peer-led services could be a helpful support for both service users and family caregivers. ?

Aim: To contribute to the discussion of recovery-oriented service with a study on the experience of Chinese people using UK mental health services. Methods: In-depth life history interviews were carried out with the users. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four themes emerged as hindrances to personal recovery: (1) language difficulty creates hurdles, (2) diagnostic label is experienced as a double-edged sword, (3) treatment-related stigma and (dis)empowerment are identified, and (4) grievances are found in hospitalisation. Discussion: Having mental illness and being an ethnic minority in the UK experienced double hazard in their recovery journey. While the deprivation of agency and the stigma process in the health care system hinders their recovery, they are further disadvantaged by their ethnic minority status.

Methods: In the population-representative Hong Kong Chinese “Children of 1997” birth cohort (n = 8327), the relation of initial size (weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at birth, length/height-for-age z score (LAZ) at 3 months or body-mass-index-for-age z score (BAZ) at 3 months based on the World Health Organization growth standards/references) and growth at different phases (WAZ gains from 0 to 2 and 2 to 8 years, LAZ or BAZ gains from 3 months to 3 years, 3 to 8 years and 8 to 14 years) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at ~17.5 years, was assessed using adjusted partial least squares regression. Additional analyses further considered growth in late and early infancy. Results: This study included 3276 of the cohort participants. Higher WAZ gain from 2 to 8 years, LAZ and BAZ gains from 3 to 8 years were consistently associated with higher FPG, adjusted for maternal and infant characteristics, family history of diabetes and household income. Also, higher BAZ gain from 3 to 8 years was associated with higher HbA1c. These associations did not differ by sex. Conclusions: Our findings suggest different mechanisms could underlie the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance. Factors that drive specific growth at different phases need to be evaluated to better inform child growth management for long-term health outcomes. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Design: A secondary analysis of PCOSAct with 21 sites in China. A total of 1000 women with PCOS were enrolled; 936 women with baseline homocysteine (HCY) were analysed. Results: Higher HCY was associated with higher body mass index, free testosterone and lower FSH, fasting glucose (P < 0.001; P < 0.001; P = 0.005; P < 0.001) and ovulation rate among all participants (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.86; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83 tertiles 2 and 3 versus tertile 1, respectively). The HHCY group had lower oestradiol and higher free testosterone (P = 0.04; P < 0.001) than the controls. In the metabolic syndrome group, LH, LH–FSH ratio and sex hormone-binding globulin were lowest in the metabolic syndrome group (all P < 0.001). In the HHCY group, ovulation rate decreased and the second or third trimester pregnancy loss rate increased compared with controls (OR 1.678, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.70; OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42) with treatment adjustment.

This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and ethical consideration of Chinese couples toward PGT. Methods: Couples requesting PGT between June 2013 and March 2014 were invited to complete a questionnaire. Results: Total 49 couples (49 women, 47 men) completed the questionnaires. Eighteen couples (37%) were waiting for PGT (pre-PGT group), 15 couples (31%) were undergoing PGT (PGT group) and 16 couples (32%) had completed at least one PGT cycle (post-PGT group). Only 53% of the couples could tell the recurrent risk, and 31% (with monogenic disorders) could tell the mode of inheritance of their condition. The acceptability of PGT (>80%) and attitude toward the embryo fate (58–78%) were good. The post-PGT group had more concern than the PGT and pre-PGT groups on the prenatal diagnostic testing (**P = 0.007). 12.5% of the couples worried about the transfer of healthy embryos with carrier state and they all had monogenic disorders. If the prenatal testing confirmed an affected fetus, a higher percentage (32%) in the Post-PGT group disagreed to terminate the pregnancy in contrast to a much lower 6% in the pre-PGT group (**P = 0.02). Three-quarter of the couples opted to tell their child about their conception through PGT. Conclusion: Chinese couples in Hong Kong had an overall good acceptability and positive attitude toward PGT. We appreciate the difficulties the couples have gone through PGT.

Method: Consecutive HCC patients admitted for hepatectomy between 1994 and 2014 were enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they had recurrent HCC or tumors beyond the Milan criteria. Patients were randomized and assigned to the derivation and validation sets in a 1:1 ratio. Independent factors for disease-free survival were identified using the Cox regression model. A nomogram was derived and validated with the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves. Results: There were 617 eligible patients included in the analysis. The median age was 59 years, 481 were male, and 87.8% of the patients were hepatitis B virus carriers. The median follow-up was 68.7?months. The 5-year overall survival rate was 73.3% and HCC recurrence was detected in 55% of the patients. In the derivation set, a nomogram was constructed based on the seven independent factors for disease-free survival: age, alpha-fetoprotein, preoperative prothrombin time, magnitude of hepatectomy, postoperative complication, number of tumor nodules, and presence of microvascular invasion. A satisfactory discrimination ability was observed in both the derivation and validation sets (c-stat 0.672 and 0.665, respectively). The calibration plot yielded agreement between the predicted and observed outcomes, using the derived nomogram. Conclusion: A validated nomogram quantifies the risk of recurrence after hepatectomy for HCC within the Milan criteria, and assists with the planning of individual postoperative surveillance protocols. ? 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Hepatocellullar carconoma; Nomogram; Prediction; Recurrence,"alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alpha fetoprotein; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; entecavir; indocyanine green; adult; antiviral therapy; Article; blood cell count; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; disease free survival; female; follow up; hepatitis B; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; nomogram; overall survival; postoperative complication; preoperative evaluation; prothrombin time; recurrence free survival; recurrent disease; retrospective study; aged; disease free survival; epidemiology; forecasting; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; liver tumor; middle aged; mortality; nomogram; patient selection; procedures; risk; tumor recurrence; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Forecasting; Hepatectomy; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Nomograms; Patient Selection; Retrospective Studies; Risk",2-s2.0-85059938145

Individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) have poor oral health and limited access to dental care. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of strategies in caries and gingivitis prevention among children and adolescents with ID. Methods: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched from their commencement date to 17 April 2017. Randomised or non-randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions in caries and gingivitis prevention were included if the participants were children and adolescents with ID. Gingival index and caries experiences were reported in the format of mean difference and standard error. Meta-analysis was conducted if data could be pooled from two or more studies using similar outcome measurements and intervention. Results: A total of 1455 articles published in English were identified. Fourteen studies formed the basis of qualitative analysis; six studies were feasible to perform quantitative analysis. Meta-analysis favoured fluoride to placebo in caries prevention [Z?=?2.02, P?<?0.05, 95% CI: ?0.71 (?1.40, ?0.02)], while the effectiveness of chlorhexidine remained elusive. Conclusions: Both mechanical and chemical approaches had been applied to caries and gingivitis prevention among children and adolescents with ID.

This study compared self-screening by pregnant women with screening by health care workers in a largely Chinese population. Methods: A randomized crossover study was conducted in Hong Kong. All women attending the GBS screening visit at 35–37 weeks gestation between May and October 2015 were approached for recruitment. Consenting participants underwent both self-screening and screening by health care workers. Group 1 had health care worker screening swabs first, and group 2 had self-screening first. A positive GBS diagnosis was made if either swab was positive. The sensitivity of each approach was calculated by comparison with this gold standard. Acceptance of GBS self-screening and neonatal outcomes was analyzed (Canadian Task Force Classification I). Results: Of the 672 women approached, 428 (63.7%) consented to the study. The prevalence of GBS was 19.7% (83 of 422). Sensitivities of self-screening and screening by health care workers were 61.4% (51 of 83) and 97.6% (81 of 83), respectively (P < 0.05). Women who used vaginal pessaries and non-Chinese women had a higher positive concordance rate with health care workers (P < 0.05). Neonatal outcomes of GBS-positive mothers were similar in the concordant and discordant groups. Conclusion: The sensitivity of self-screening of GBS in Hong Kong was lower than the sensitivity of screening by health care workers. Cultural difference needs to be considered when implementing self-screening in different populations. ? 2018 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Soci?t? des obst?triciens et gyn?cologues du Canada.",Infection; pregnancy; prenatal care; screening,adult; Article; controlled study; crossover procedure; female; gestational age; group B streptococcal infection; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prevalence; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; screening; self screening; sensitivity analysis,2-s2.0-85055743785

Some studies have shown that acupuncture might be effective in treating primary insomnia and insomnia related to depression and stroke. Although there are some programs supporting insomnia during the menopausal transition, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCT) to provide evidence regarding their effectiveness. We design a RCT of suitable sample size to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with insomnia during the menopausal transition and to form an optimized acupuncture treatment protocol. Method/Design: In this randomized, single-site, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 84 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group (n = 42) or the sham control group (n = 42) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will receive a total of 18 treatment sessions for eight consecutive weeks. Treatments will be given three times per week in the first four weeks, twice a week for the next two weeks, and finally once weekly for the final two weeks. Treatment will utilize eight main acupoints (GV20, GV24, GV29, RN6, RN4, SP6, HT7, EX-HN22) and extra two acupoints based on syndrome differentiation. The primary outcome will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary outcomes will be measured by sleep parameters recorded in the Actigraphy (SE, TST, SA), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Menopause Quality of Life (Men-QOL). The primary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and the first and third month after the end of treatment. Discussion: If the results confirm that acupuncture is effective and safe for the treatment on insomnia in menopausal women, this positive outcome could provide evidence for clinical application.

Results: Heat-related risks and AFs increased continuously for total respiratory, pneumonia and COPD hospitalizations during the past 17 years, respectively. Cold-hospitalization associations and cold-related AFs showed heterogeneous patterns, showing a decreasing trend for pneumonia but a general increasing trend for COPD for both the associations and AFs. The total temperature-related AFs remained stable for total respiratory (p for trend = 0.136) and pneumonia (p for trend = 0.406), but showed an increasing trend for COPD (p for trend < 0.001) from 10% (95% empirical CI: 2%, 17%) in 2000 to 17% (95% empirical CI: 11%, 22%) in 2016. Conclusions: Our findings indicate an increased susceptibility to heat but a decreased susceptibility to cold for respiratory hospitalizations during the past 17 years. The overall temperature-related hospitalization burden for respiratory diseases was generally stable in Hong Kong. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Emergency department; Extreme temperatures; Respiratory disease; Temporal change,"Hospitals; Attributable fraction; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Emergency departments; Extreme temperatures; Hospital admissions; Optimum temperature; Temporal change; Temporal variation; Pulmonary diseases; nitrogen dioxide; extreme event; hospital sector; mortality; respiratory disease; temperature effect; aged; air pollution; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease association; disease burden; disease predisposition; environmental temperature; female; Hong Kong; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; ozone layer; particulate matter; pneumonia; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; risk factor; seasonal variation; breathing disorder; chronic obstructive lung disease; heat; hospitalization; middle aged; pneumonia; season; statistics and numerical data; China; Hong Kong; Aged; Female; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiration Disorders; Risk Factors; Seasons",2-s2.0-85061778335

Here, we performed a molecular survey of Anaplasma in Ankang, Northwest China. Methods: Hard ticks were collected and identified using morphological and molecular methods. Human-pathogenic Anaplasma species were tested using nested polymerase chain reaction. The nearly complete rrs, gltA, and groEL genes sequences from revealed Anaplasma species were amplified and sequenced to determine their molecular characteristics and their phylogeny. Results: All ticks collected in Ankang belonged to the Rhipicephalus microplus. Novel unclassified Anaplasma strains genetically related to A. platys and A. capra were detected in these ticks. Co-infection of these two organisms was also found. The novel unclassified Anaplasma strains identified in this study formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage based on the groEL gene and two lineages based on the gltA gene within A. platys and related strains group. The revealed A. capra strains identified in this study were most closely related to those detected in humans and other vertebrate animals. Conclusion: We revealed the presence of A. capra, a novel human pathogens in R. microplus ticks in previously unrecognized endemic regions. We also detected a novel unclassified Anaplasma species genetically related to A. platys. The epidemiology of anaplasmosis caused by these two Anaplasma species in humans should be assessed in future studies. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Anaplasma capra; Anaplasma platys-like strains; And groEL genes; China; gltA; Rhipicephalus microplus ticks; Rrs,Anaplasma; Anaplasma capra; Anaplasma platys; Article; bacterial strain; China; controlled study; domestic animal; gene; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic identification; gltA gene; groEL gene; mixed infection; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus; rrs gene; Anaplasma; anaplasmosis; animal; epidemiology; genetics; human; isolation and purification; livestock; microbiology; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Rhipicephalus; transmission; zoonosis; bacterial protein; chaperonin 60; Anaplasma; Anaplasmosis; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Chaperonin 60; China; Humans; Livestock; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rhipicephalus; Zoonoses,2-s2.0-85065910526

Young children’s parents can influence their children’s PA behavior through different PA-related parenting practices. This cross-sectional study examined the independent contributions of socio-demographic, family/home and parent-perceived neighborhood environmental characteristics explaining PA-related parenting practices encouraging or discouraging PA among Hong Kong preschool-aged children (3–5 years-old). Methods Hong Kong Chinese preschoolers’ parents were recruited from pre-selected kindergartens and Maternal and Child Health Centers located in areas stratified by residential density and socio-economic status. They self-completed socio-demographic, family/home and perceived neighborhood characteristics and PA-related parenting practices questionnaires. Generalized linear models were used to examine associations of socio-demographic, family/home and neighborhood variables with PA-related parenting practices. Results Socio-demographic and family/home characteristics were significantly correlated with parenting practices encouraging and discouraging PA. Parent-perceived neighborhood characteristics were significantly correlated with parenting practices discouraging PA only. Conclusions for Practice This study identified correlates of PA-related parenting practices among parents of Hong Kong Chinese preschoolers. The findings suggest future PA-promoting interventions among Chinese preschoolers via the promotion of parenting practices encouraging children’s PA should consider multiple factors, including family relationships and childcare sharing, promotion of PA and its benefits among parents, and neighborhood social cohesion, traffic safety and safety from crime. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Chinese; Family; Neighborhood environment; Parenting practices; Socio-demographics,"article; child; child parent relation; crime; cross-sectional study; female; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; kindergarten; neighborhood; pediatric hospital; physical activity; questionnaire; social status; traffic safety; adult; child parent relation; demography; exercise; family relation; family size; Hong Kong; male; preschool child; procedures; psychology; social class; Adult; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Exercise; Family Characteristics; Family Relations; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Parenting; Residence Characteristics; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85059469326

Methods: A validated questionnaire was administered to dental students who were in their clinical years (the third, fourth, fifth and sixth year of study) in 2017 at the University of Hong Kong. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: (1) awareness towards practicing tobacco cessation counselling (TCC), (2) preparedness in terms of confidence, knowledge and clinical practices when managing tobacco-using patients, and (3) perceived barriers to counselling. Results: All 206 invited students had participated this study. Most (93%) agreed that dentists should deliver TCC. However, only around a quarter (26%) of students were well-prepared to help patients in tobacco cessation. While 60% of students agreed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was helpful for patients to quit tobacco use, only 28% understood its mechanism of action, and merely 16% were knowledgeable enough to introduce NRT to their patients. Two-thirds (62%) of students felt they did not have sufficient skills at this stage of their training. Conclusions: Most Hong Kong dental students had good awareness that dental professionals had an important role to promote tobacco cessation in their patient pools. However, not many of them were well-prepared to manage tobacco-using patients. Common barriers were found to be patients’ apathy and students’ inadequate familiarity with NRT. ? 2019 by the authors.

Both pathologies modify host immune status and it is possible that HIV infection may modulate the frequency and pathogeny of cysticercosis of the central nervous system (i.e., neurocysticercosis [NCC]). Objective: To describe published cases of NCC among HIV-positive patients and to evaluate whether the characteristics of NCC, including frequency, symptoms, radiological appearance, and response to treatment differed between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Methods: Forty cases of NCC/HIV co-infected patients were identified in the literature. Clinical and radiological characteristics, as well as response to treatment, were compared with non-matching historical series of NCC patients without HIV infection. Results: Most of these patients had seizures and multiple vesicular parasites located in parenchyma. Clinical and radiological characteristics were similar between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with NCC, as well as between immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised HIV-positive patients. Conclusion: Our review did not reveal clear interactions between HIV and NCC. This may be partially due to the small number of cases and reliance on published research. A systematic, multi-institutional effort aiming to report all the cases of this dual pathology is needed to confirm this finding and to clarify the possible relationship between both pathogens. ? 2019, Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria.

Unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKA) have been used for management of isolated OA of the medial tibiofemoral joint. This is the first study on the usage of UKA in Hong Kong. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing medial compartment UKA in a tertiary referral center since 2003. Preoperative and postoperative International Knee Society Knee Scores (KSKS) and Knee Societal Functional Assessment (KSFA) scores, range of motion, flexion deformity, and lower limb mechanical alignment were measured. Statistical analysis using paired sample t-tests was performed. Revision operations, rate of revisions, and causes of failure were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of risk factors for revision operation were performed against patient demographics, type of prosthesis, postoperative alignment, and degree of correction. Results: There were 94 UKA performed with an average follow-up of 4.3 years (range: 0.5–15.2 years). The KSKS and KSFA scores improved from 54.5 and 54.0 to 85.6 and 64.5 (p < 0.01), respectively. There was no significant improvement in the range of motion (p = 0.87) and fixed flexion deformity (p = 0.14). Mechanical alignment improved from 172.1° to 174.9° varus postoperatively (p < 0.01). Six cases required revision operation with a revision rate of 1.50 per 100 observed component years. Causes of revision included two cases of tibial tray loosening and one case each of progressive OA, mechanical failure, persistent pain, and infection. Logistic regression analysis for risk factors showed no statistical significance. Conclusions: UKA offers good functional improvement but further long-term studies are required to evaluate survivorship. ?

Strengths model case management (SMCM), developed by Rapp and Goscha through collaborative efforts at the University of Kansas, offers a structured and innovative intervention. As evidence of the effectiveness of strengths-based interventions come from Western studies, which lacked rigorous research design or failed to assure fidelity to the model, we aim to fill these gaps and conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of SMCM for individuals with mental illness in Hong Kong. Methods and analysis This will be an RCT of SMCM. Assuming a medium intervention effect (Cohen's d=0.60) with 30% missing data (including dropouts), 210 service users aged 18 years or above will be recruited from three community mental health centres. They will be randomly assigned to SMCM groups (intervention) or SMILE groups (control) in a 1:1 ratio. The SMCM groups will receive strengths model interventions from case workers, whereas the SMILE groups will receive generic care from case workers with an attention placebo. The case workers will all be embedded in the community centres and will be required to provide a session with service users in both groups at least once every fortnight. There will be two groups of case workers for the intervention and control groups, respectively. The effectiveness of the SMCM will be compared between the two groups of service users with outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months after recruitment. Functional outcomes will also be reported by case workers. Data on working alliances and goal attainment will be collected from individual case workers. Qualitative evaluation will be conducted to identify the therapeutic ingredients and conditions leading to positive outcomes. Trained outcome assessors will be blind to the group allocation. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Hong Kong has been obtained (HRECNCF: EA1703078). The results will be disseminated to service users and their families via the media, to healthcare professionals via professional training and meetings and to researchers via conferences and publications.

Data were drawn from Waves 2 and 7 from the NEXT Generational Health Study, a nationally representative cohort of U.S. adolescents (n = 2012). Multiple linear regressions were used to examine differences between sexual orientation subgroups (defined based on sexual attraction) in five cyber behaviors and five health indicators. Mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether cyber behaviors mediated the associations between bisexual attraction and health indicators. Relative to heterosexual peers, bisexual youth spent more time engaging in cyber behaviors and social media, and reported more psychosomatic symptoms and poorer general health. Gay and questioning males spent less time playing video games than heterosexual males. Bisexual females reported more depressive symptoms and less optimism and happiness than heterosexual females. Time spent on cyber behaviors and social media was a significant mediator of adolescent bisexual attraction and worse health outcomes in young adulthood. Frequency of cyber behaviors differed between sexual minority subgroups. Bisexual youth in particular had more psychosomatic symptoms and poorer general health.

AN is associated with individual vulnerability, societal and family factors. There has been limited research in Asia regarding the patients or their families’ perceptions on its treatment. This study explored the perceived treatment outcomes among Chinese families having adolescents with AN. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted on parents of adolescents with AN recruited through an eating disorder association in Hong Kong to understand their views and experiences regarding the help-seeking and treatment process. Results The parents expressed dissatisfaction towards help-seeking and treatment outcomes, including relationships with health professionals, hospitalization, health professionals’ knowledge of AN, understanding of the treatment model and parents’ role, amount of psychological support, and coordination among health professionals. The parents were unclear about the treatment plan as they received little explanation from the health professionals. The parents perceived that the AN treatment only focused on weight restoration with limited psychological support. Home diet monitoring was seen as a harsh task which worsened the relationship with their children. The parents often needed to take up the coordinator role and search around for different health professionals and integrate their advices by themselves. Conclusions The study shows that limited psychoeducation, communication and coordination in the treatment for AN are major problems in a Chinese context. Open communication between the health professionals and the parents about the expected treatment outcomes and limitations is needed to enhance their mutual trust. Besides, treatment should emphasize not only family involvement but also empower them to fight against AN. ? 2019 Sun et al.

The present study aimed to investigate the expression and prognostic value of GRHL1 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). GRHL1 mRNA and protein levels were detected in ESCC cell lines and clinical ESCC tissues. The expression of GRHL1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 266 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ESCC samples with the help of Pearson’s?2 test, and Cox regression analysis was employed in order to distinguish independent prognostic factors. The functional role of GRHL1 in ESCC cell lines was assessed by a lentiviral construct containing overexpressed GRHL1, which was then examined by cell growth and foci formation assays. The expression of GRHL1 was downregulated in the majority of examined ESCC cell lines and clinical tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the low expression of GRHL1 was fundamentally associated with a reduced overall survival rate (log-rank test, P<0.001, hazard ratio, 2.073; 95% confidence interval, 1.491-2.881). Additionally, Cox regression analysis revealed that the low expression of GRHL1, together with poor differentiation, constituted independent prognostic factors for the poor survival of patients with ESCC (P<0.05). The results indicated that the GRHL1-overexpressing cells attenuated the invasive capacity of the ESCC cells in vitro. Accordingly, the low expression of GRHL1 is associated with a reduced OS in ESCC, and the overexpression of GRHL1 inhibited cell invasion in ESCC cells.

Methods: Index cases were the first symptomatic person in a household with influenza-like illness, testing influenza positive on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from household contacts every 4 days were tested by rRT-PCR. Factors associated with SIR were evaluated using logistic regression. Results: We enrolled 28 HIV-infected and 57 HIV-uninfected index cases. On multivariable analysis, HIV-infected index cases were less likely to transmit influenza to household contacts (odds ratio [OR] 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-0.6; SIR 16%, 18/113 vs 27%, 59/220). Factors associated with increased SIR included index age group 1-4 years (OR 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-11.3) and 25-44 years (OR 8.0; 95% CI, 1.8-36.7), and contact age group 1-4 years (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2-10.3) compared to 5-14 years, and sleeping with index case (OR 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.5). HIV infection of index case was not associated with SI. Conclusions: HIV-infection was not associated with SI. Increased infectiousness of HIV-infected individuals is likely not an important driver of community influenza transmission. ?

Subjects and methods: This was designed as a cross-sectional study. Dental examination was provided to 383 children at Special Child Care Centres. Covariates of interest included children's age, developmental profile, oral health-related behaviours and family social-economic status. The association between children's dental caries experiences, dental plaque deposition and gingival health status were analysed by negative binomial regression, multiple factor ANOVA and binary logistic regression when appropriate. Results: The proportion of children with caries, gingival inflammation and plaque were 30.3%, 89.6% and 95.0%, respectively. Final regression models indicated that (a) tooth decay was associated with dental visit experiences, night bottle-feeding habit, fluoridated toothpaste and monthly income; (b) plaque deposition was associated with intellectual functioning, practical skills, night bottle-feeding habit, use of toothpaste, initiation of toothbrushing habit, toothbrushing duration and additional cleaning habit; (c) gingival status was associated with children's intellectual functioning and toothbrushing frequency. Conclusions: Poor oral hygiene status existed among preschool children with special healthcare needs.

Seven cases of talaromycosis were observed since commencement of hospital service in 2012. Three patients were local Shenzhen residents, whereas the other four were immigrants from other parts of China. Two patients were HIV-negative, but with underlying diseases requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Two of the seven patients succumbed. All the seven isolates were successfully identified as T.?marneffei by MALDI–TOF MS using Bruker database expanded with in-house generated T.?marneffei mass spectra. MLST showed that the seven strains belonged to six different, novel sequences types. Phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated five-locus sequence revealed that the seven strains were scattered amongst other T.?marneffei strains. The MICs of itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole against the seven clinical isolates were low but MICs of anidulafungin were high.

Methods: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS) participants were classified by spirometric patterns and presence of dyspnea into 6 groups: normal spirometry (NS), restriction on spirometry (ROS) and airflow obstruction (AO), each with and without dyspnea. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated for mortality using Cox models. Results: Among 16777 subjects, 1595 (9.5%) had ROS, 1036 (6.2%) had AO and 1009 (6.0%) had dyspnea. A total of 1993 deaths (11.9%) occurred during 11-year follow-up. Using NS without dyspnea as reference, NS with dyspnea was significantly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality risk (aHRs 1.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18–2.19); ROS with and without dyspnea were associated with increased risks of all-cause (aHRs 1.46 (95% CI 1.28–1.66) and 1.81 (95% CI 1.33–2.47)) and cardiovascular mortality (aHRs 1.89 (95% CI 1.55–2.31) and 1.85 (95% CI 1.12–3.03)), but not of lung cancer mortality (aHRs 1.33 (95% CI 0.91–1.94) and 1.35 (95% CI 0.49–3.70)); AO with and without dyspnea were associated with increased risks of all-cause (aHRs 1.59 (95% CI 1.36–1.86) and 2.36 (95% CI 1.77–3.15)), cardiovascular (aHRs 1.43 (95% CI 1.08–1.90) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.91–2.82)) and lung cancer mortality (aHRs 1.91 (95% CI 1.29–2.84) and 3.01 (95% CI 1.46–6.23)). These associations did not vary by sex or smoking status (all P-values for interaction >0.05). Conclusion: Both ROS and AO, with and without dyspnea, were associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. The increased risk of all-cause was greater and that of cardiovascular mortality was lower for AO than ROS. AO showed significantly increased risk of lung cancer but ROS did not.

Their views may be affected by clinical, social and cultural factors. Objective This study explored the views of Chinese psychiatrists on stigmatisation of psychiatric patients. Methods Focus group discussions with psychiatrists were conducted in Hong Kong. Their views towards stigmatisation of psychiatric patients and strategies to reduce stigmatisation were discussed. Findings The psychiatrists perceived the clinical needs to classify the patients according to the diagnoses and they did not see it as stigmatisation. They believed that some mental illnesses are characterised with violence or deviance, and were not completely curable. Instead of trying to eliminate stigma, they managed in ways that took social expectations into consideration. They might offer a relative vague diagnostic label to save the a  face' of the patients and secure greater acceptance for the illness from the public. They tended to accept family members to make decisions on behalf of the patients. Reconciling public interest and patients' autonomy, they encouraged stable psychotic patients to live in the community but agreed to institutionalise those patients with violent behaviours. Conclusion While the psychiatrists argued that the diagnosis was not a form of stigma, they were sensitive enough and framed responses to patients in ways to minimise stigma. They tended to believe that stigma was inevitable given the nature of some psychotic disorders. Disguising the stigma appeared to be the common approach to deal with stigma in a Chinese context. Clinical Implications The psychiatrists, especially those practicing in a Chinese context, may consider a wider perspective of community mental health rehabilitation which is not limited to social stability but also social life. ?

We aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic features of CGD in Chinese pediatric patients. Methods: Pediatric patients with CGD from Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, China, were enrolled from January 2006 to December 2016. Results: A total of 159 pediatric patients with CGD were enrolled. The median age of clinical onset was 1.4?months, and 73% (116/159) had clinical onset symptoms before the 1?year of age. The most common site of invasion was the lungs. The lymph nodes, liver, and skin were more frequently invaded in X-linked (XL) CGD patients than in autosomal recessive (AR) CGD patients (P?<?0.05). Approximately 64% (92/144) of the pediatric patients suffered from abnormal response to BCG vaccination. The most frequent pathogens were Aspergillus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Gene analysis indicated that 132 cases (89%, 132/147) harbored CYBB pathogenic variants, 7 (5%, 7/147) carried CYBA pathogenic variants, 4 (3%, 4/147) had NCF1 pathogenic variants, and 4 (3%, 4/147) had NCF2 pathogenic variants. The overall mortality rate in this study was 43%, particularly the patients were males, with CYBB mutant and did not receive HSCT treatment. Conclusions: Chronic granulomatous disease is a rare disease affecting Chinese children; however, it is often diagnosed at a later age, and thus, the mortality rate is relatively high. The prevalence and the severity of disease in XL-CGD are higher than AR-CGD. ? 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to validate these findings in a large cohort of Chinese with ischaemic stroke. Methods: In 959 Chinese with ischaemic stroke who received a brain magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Hong Kong, we determined the age-specific associations of renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) with neuroimaging markers of SVD as well as with the SVD score. Results: Although renal impairment was associated with the SVD score in univariate analysis in all patients (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.24-2.09, P &lt;.0001), these associations were attenuated after adjusting for age and sex (P =.38). Similar findings were noted in patients with ischaemic stroke due to SVD and non-SVD subtypes. However, in 222 of 959 patients aged &lt;60, renal impairment was independently associated with an increasing microbleed (adjusted odds ratio 6.82, 2.26-20.59), subcortical (4.97, 1.62-15.24) periventricular white matter hyperintensity (3.96, 1.08-14.51) and global SVD burden (3.41, 1.16-10.04; all P &lt;.05) even after adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Nevertheless, there were no associations between renal impairment and individual neuroimaging markers of SVD nor with the SVD score in patients aged ?60 after adjusting for age and sex (all P &gt;.05). Conclusions: In Chinese with ischaemic stroke, renal impairment was independently associated with microbleed, white matter hyperintensity and global SVD burden in individuals aged &lt;60, but not in those aged ?60, suggesting that there may be shared susceptibilities to premature systemic disease. ? 2019 The Authors",Cerebral small vessel disease; Chronic kidney disease; Magnetic; Renal impairment; Resonance imaging; Stroke,"danaparoid; age; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular disease; Chinese; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease burden; ethnic difference; female; glomerulus filtration rate; human; kidney dysfunction; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perivascular space; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; white matter; age; Asian continental ancestry group; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; epidemiology; ethnology; glomerulus filtration rate; Hong Kong; kidney; kidney disease; middle aged; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Brain Ischemia; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Hong Kong; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke",2-s2.0-85062463367

Contributing factors for mortality include the development of cerebral contusions and delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma. Currently, there is no established specific treatment for these conditions. Object: This study aimed to investigate the impact of independent factors on the mortality rate of traumatic brain injury with contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods: Data were collected from consecutive patients admitted for cerebral contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage at an academic trauma center from 2010 to 2016. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate. Independent factors for analysis included patient factors and treatment modalities. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent factors related to mortality. Secondary outcomes included thromboembolic complication rates associated with the use of tranexamic acid. Results: In total, 651 consecutive patients were identified. For the patient factors, low Glasgow Coma Scale on admission, history of renal impairment, and use of warfarin were identified as independent factors associated with higher mortality from univariate and multivariate analyses. For the treatment modalities, univariate analysis identified tranexamic acid as an independent factor associated with lower mortality (P = 0.021). Thromboembolic events were comparable in patients with or without tranexamic acid. Conclusion: Tranexamic acid was identified by univariate analysis as an independent factor associated with lower mortality in cerebral contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Further prospective studies are needed to validate this finding. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Cerebral contusion; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Tranexamic acid; Traumatic brain injury; Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage,"acetylsalicylic acid; mannitol; tranexamic acid; warfarin; tranexamic acid; acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain contusion; cerebrovascular accident; comorbidity; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; emergency health service; female; Glasgow coma scale; human; hypertension; kidney disease; liver cirrhosis; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality rate; neurosurgery; prospective study; subarachnoid hemorrhage; thrombocyte transfusion; thromboembolism; traumatic brain injury; very elderly; adolescent; brain contusion; brain hemorrhage; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; subarachnoid hemorrhage; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Contusion; Cerebral Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Female; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Tranexamic Acid; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85062229322

DEXA, however, has many systemic side effects and can interact negatively with glioma therapy. Progesterone (PROG), however, is a well-tolerated and readily accessible anti-inflammatory and antiedema agent, with potent neuroprotective properties. We investigated whether PROG could serve as a viable alternative to DEXA in the management of peritumoral brain edema. Methods: We used an orthotopic C6 glioblastoma model with male Sprague-Dawley rats. Tumor grafts were allowed to grow for 14 days before drug treatment with DEXA 1 mg/kg, PROG 10 mg/kg, or PROG 20 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days. The overall animal survival and neurologic function were evaluated. Mechanistic studies on blood–brain barrier permeability and angiogenic responses were performed on the ex vivo tumor grafts. Results: We found that all drug treatments prolonged overall survival to different extents. PROG 10 mg led to significantly longer survival and better preservation of neurologic function and body weight. The blood–brain barrier permeability was better preserved with PROG 10 mg than with DEXA, possibly through downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and aquaporin-4 expression. Antiangiogenic responses were also observed in the PROG group. Conclusions: The present proof-of-concept pilot study has provided novel information on the use of PROG as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in brain tumor management.

Study design: Chinese children (n = 17 318; aged 6-11 years) from the Shanghai Children's Health, Education and Lifestyle Evaluation study in 2014 were the source of data. Children reported the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (MVPA) during weekdays and weekends. Parents rated their children's socioemotional and behavioral difficulties. Head teachers rated the academic performance of each student. A mediation analysis with multiple mediators was performed to test the mediation effects of 5 socioemotional and behavioral variables (emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention, peer relationship, and prosocial behaviors) in the association between MVPA and academic achievement, adjusting for demographic and health-related variables. Results: Results revealed that MVPA was positively associated with academic performance (b = 0.78; SE =.01; P <.001). Conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention, and peer problems showed significant mediating effects in the association between MVPA and academic achievement, with hyperactivity and inattention being the strongest mediator (b = 0.38; SE = 0.04; P <.001) accounting for 49% of the total effect. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that MVPA is associated with fewer socioemotional difficulties, which, in turn, is associated with better academic achievement.

However, this ageing population is not homogeneous; individuals have different levels of functionality and psychosocial status, and some are members of at-risk or high-risk groups. As such, studies on the functional, psychological, and environmental factors of falls among community-dwelling older adults are imperative. By investigating the effect of life satisfaction, as well as environmental and functional factors, on falls among community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong, this study aims to address this concern. Methods: The study recruited 249 participants. Both self-reported questionnaires and home safety assessments were administrated. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that life satisfaction and instrumental activities of daily living were significant predictors of falls. Significant differences between fallers and non-fallers were found in functional and psychological areas. The presence of home hazards was low and not associated with falls in this population. However, this variable was negatively associated with life satisfaction and predicted by one of its domains, satisfaction of possession.

Past research in Western settings have demonstrated the efficacy of self-determined or autonomous forms of motivation in predicting health-related behaviours, and that association between these variables could possibly be moderated by individual differences in mindfulness. In terms of mindfulness, individuals from different cultures may vary in their familiarity and acceptance of mindfulness in daily life. Moreover, the ways though which individuals exhibit qualities of mindfulness are often intertwined with their capacity for self-control. In this correlational study utilizing cloud-based online survey, samples of Indonesian undergraduates (N =?411, mean age?=?20.202, SD?=?1.406) completed self-report measures of trait mindfulness, trait self-control, autonomous motivation, and physical activity.

G6PD deficiency has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and higher risk of diabetes, which could be etiologically informative, but these relations are uncertain. To clarify, we assessed the associations of G6PD deficiency with serum metabolite profiles in late adolescence. Methods: In a nested case-control study of 50 G6PD-deficient late adolescents (~17.5 years) and 150 sex-matched non-G6PD-deficient controls from a Chinese birth cohort: “Children of 1997”, we compared 80 serum metabolites analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry using adjusted linear regression with Bonferroni correction for testing 12 traits (p < 0.0042). Results: G6PD-deficiency was inversely associated with serum levels of total cholesterol (?0.27 mmol, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.46, ?0.09, p = 0.004), free cholesterol (?0.08 mmol, 95% CI ?0.13, ?0.03, p = 0.003) and creatinine (?0.004 mmol, 95% CI ?0.007, ?0.001, p = 0.003), adjusted for sex and parental education.

Further classification may help characterize its heterogeneity. We previously have shown differential metabolomic profiles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostic subtypes of MDD. We further determined brain connectomic associations with TCM subtypes of MDD. Methods: In this naturalistic study, 44 medication-free patients with a recurrent depressive episode were classified into liver qi stagnation (LQS, n = 26) and Heart and Spleen Deficiency (HSD, n = 18) subtypes according to TCM diagnosis. Healthy subjects (n = 28) were included as controls. Whole-brain white matter connectivity was analyzed on diffusion tensor imaging. Results: The LQS subtype showed significant differences in multiple network metrics of the angular gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, calcarine sulcus, and Heschl's gyrus compared to the other two groups. The HSD subtype had markedly greater regional connectivity of the insula, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus than the other two groups, and microstructural abnormalities of the frontal medial orbital gyrus and middle temporal pole. The insular betweenness centrality was strongly inversely correlated with the severity of depression and dichotomized the two subtypes at the optimal cutoff value with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: The LQS subtype is mainly characterized by aberrant connectivity of the audiovisual perception-related temporal-occipital network, whereas the HSD subtype is more closely associated with hyperconnectivity and microstructural abnormalities of the limbic-paralimbic network. Insular connectivity may serve a biomarker for TCM-based classification of depression.

This study investigated the experience of hearing voices and its relationships with psychosocial variables in four independent Chinese samples, including two college student samples (n =?328), a sample of patients with depression (n =?71) and a sample of females with disabilities (n =?94). Self-report survey data were analyzed. Around 26% to 28% of participants in the three non-psychiatric samples reported hearing voices. Evidence for the differences in age, trauma exposure, overall psychopathology, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms between VHs and non-VHs is insufficient or inconsistent across samples. There is some evidence for voice-hearing being associated with poor mental well-being, dissociation and ‘borderline personality’ symptoms.

Naltrexone, a ?-opioid receptor antagonist, has been suggested as a promising treatment for amfetamine and methamfetamine use disorder. Objective: To review the current evidence for the efficacy and safety of naltrexone as a pharmacological treatment for amfetamine and methamfetamine use disorder. The primary outcome was defined as abstinence or reduction of use. Secondary outcomes were, attenuated “positive” subjective effects (e.g., “feel good,” “craving,” etc.) of amfetamine or methamfetamine after naltrexone treatment, adverse events and physiological changes (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate). Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A systematic literature search was conducted on 2 April 2017, and updated on 31 March 2018. Records were retrieved from databases including PubMed, EMBASE Classic plus EMBASE 1980 via Ovid, and the databases were searched using keywords and/or headings: (naltrexone AND amfetamine AND dependence) OR (naltrexone AND amfetamine AND craving) OR (vivitrol AND amfetamine) OR (revia AND amfetamine) OR (naltrexone AND amfetamine) OR (naltrexone AND methamfetamine dependence) OR (naltrexone AND methamfetamine AND craving) OR (vivitrol AND methamfetamine) OR (revia AND methamfetamine) OR (naltrexone AND ice) OR (naltrexone AND crystal meth) OR (naltrexone AND methamfetamine). Studies investigating the effects of naltrexone on amfetamine or methamfetamine use were eligible for inclusion. All studies were rated as low risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for risk of bias. Results: Among 591 identified studies, there were four randomized controlled trials. Two studies investigated the effects of naltrexone on amfetamine use disorder and two on methamfetamine use. Compared to placebo, the abstinence rate was increased significantly (p < 0.05) by naltrexone in one of two amfetamine studies, whereas there was no statistical difference in the only study reporting methamfetamine use. In one out of two amfetamine studies, naltrexone significantly attenuated either craving levels or subjective effects (e.g., “want more,” “like effect”) relative to placebo (p < 0.05). Additionally, only in one of two methamfetamine studies did naltrexone produce a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in craving levels or attenuated subjective effects. Both amfetamine and methamfetamine studies showed good tolerability of naltrexone, with few adverse events seen. Conclusions: There is presently insufficient evidence to support the use of naltrexone in amfetamine and metamfetamine use disorders. There is a compelling need for high-quality studies to further evaluate the potential use of naltrexone. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Amfetamine; methamfetamine; naltrexone; safety; tolerability,alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; amphetamine; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; gamma glutamyltransferase; methamphetamine; naltrexone; placebo; amphetamine; methamphetamine; naltrexone; narcotic antagonist; abstinence; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; amphetamine abuse; amphetamine dependence; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; automutilation; bilirubin blood level; clinical evaluation; controlled drug release; creatinine blood level; dehydration; diastolic blood pressure; drug craving; drug efficacy; drug safety; Embase; fatigue; follow up; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; heart rate; human; hyperglycemia; hypoalbuminemia; hypocalcemia; hypokalemia; injection; injection site pain; injection site pruritus; intention to treat analysis; medical literature; Medline; methamphetamine dependence; monotherapy; nausea; outcome assessment; patient compliance; patient counseling; peripheral edema; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); relapse; Review; risk assessment; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration; upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract disease; urine sampling; amphetamine dependence; treatment outcome; Amphetamine; Amphetamine-Related Disorders; Humans; Methamphetamine; Naltrexone; Narcotic Antagonists; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85063964707

One hundred and forty-seven Hong Kong children (mean age = 13.5 ± 2.5 years) with PD from three special schools participated. We used BEACHES (Behaviors of Eating and Activity for Children’s Health: Evaluation System) to assess their PA and associated variables at home (before dinner) and during four school settings (before classes, recess, lunch breaks, after classes) on four school days. Overall, the children were typically inactive and spent little time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), range = 6.3% to 17.0% across settings. At home, children were more active when fathers were present (p < 0.001). At school, prompts to be active contributed to their MVPA% before classes (p < 0.01) and during recess and lunch breaks (both p < 0.001). The presence of a child’s mother was positively associated with MVPA% before classes (p < 0.001) and the presence of other children was associated with MVPA% during recess and lunch breaks (both p < 0.05). With children with PD accruing small amounts of MVPA in both home and school settings, multifaceted interventions reflecting both contextual and personal factors should be considered in order to increase the health-enhancing PA of this population. ? 2019 by the authors.",Family; Observation; Peers; Sedentary behavior; Youth,child; disability; education; environmental factor; physical activity; adolescent; Article; child; child behavior; controlled study; environmental factor; father; female; human; leisure; major clinical study; male; mother; observational study; patient participation; peer group; physical activity; physical disability; population research; school child; social behavior; social environment; exercise; handicapped child; Hong Kong; school; China; Hong Kong; Adolescent; Child; Disabled Children; Exercise; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Schools,2-s2.0-85065022101

Whether ATP depletion can enhance the efficacy and potency of anti-cancer effects of herbal compounds is so far unknown. We examined the enhancing effect of ATP depletion on anti-cancer actions of tetrandrine (TET) in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. A 24-h incubation of A549 cells with tetrandrine caused a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect (LC 50 = 66.1?μM). Co-incubation with 20?mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, glycolysis inhibitor) caused only a very slight enhancement of tetrandrine cytotoxicity. By contrast, inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production with oligomycin (10?μM, ATP synthase inhibitor) and FCCP (30?μM, uncoupling agent) (thus, oligo-FCCP) on its own caused only slight cell cytotoxicity but strongly potentiated tetrandrine cytotoxicity (tetrandrine LC 50 = 15.6?μM). The stronger enhancing effect of oligo-FCCP than 2-DG on TET toxicity did not result from more severe overall ATP depletion, since both treatments caused a similar ATP level suppression. Neither oligo-FCCP nor 2-DG synergized with tetrandrine in decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. TET on its own triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and oligo-FCCP, but not 2-DG, potentiated TET in causing ROS production. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibiting ATP production from mitochondria, but not from glycolysis, appears to be a very effective means in augmenting TET-triggered ROS production and hence toxicity in A549 cells. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",A549; ATP depletion; Glycolysis; Mitochondria; Tetrandrine,adenosine triphosphate; carbonyl cyanide 4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; deoxyglucose; oligomycin; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reactive oxygen metabolite; tetrandrine; A-549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; Article; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; cytotoxicity; glycolysis; human; human cell; lung carcinoma; mitochondrial membrane potential,2-s2.0-85058490787

Post-transplant HCC recurrence rate is relatively low but significant, ranging from 10%-30% according to different series. When recurrence happens, it is usually extrahepatic and associated with poor prognosis. A predictive model that allows patient stratification according to recurrence risk can help to individualize post-transplant surveillance protocol and guidance of the use of anti-tumor immunosuppressive agents. AIM To develop a scoring system to predict HCC recurrence after LT in an Asian population. METHODS Consecutive patients having LT for HCC from 1995 to 2016 at our hospital were recruited. They were randomized into the training set and the validation set in a 60:40 ratio. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to identity factors associated with HCC recurrence. A risk score was assigned to each factor according to the odds ratio. Accuracy of the score was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS In total, 330 patients were eligible for analysis (183 in training and 147 in validation). Recurrent HCC developed in 14.2% of them. The median follow-up duration was 65.6 mo. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 78% and 80%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, alpha-fetoprotein > 400 ng/mL [P = 0.012, hazard ratio (HR) 2.92], sum of maximum tumor size and number (P = 0.013, HR 1.15), and salvage LT (P = 0.033, HR 2.08) were found to be independent factors for disease-free survival. A risk score was calculated for each patient with good discriminatory power (c-stat 0.748 and 0.85, respectively, in the training and validation sets). With the derived scores, patients were classified into low- (0-9), moderate- (> 9-14), and high-risk groups (> 14), and the risk of HCC recurrence in the training and validation sets was 10%, 20%, 54% (cstat 0.67) and 4%, 22%, 62% (c-stat 0.811), accordingly. The risk stratification model was validated with chi-squared goodness-of-fit test (P = 0.425). CONCLUSION A validated predictive model featuring alpha-fetoprotein, salvage LT, and the sum of largest tumor diameter and total number of tumor nodule provides simple and reliable guidance for individualizing postoperative surveillance strategy. ?

Eight HIV-positive male participants were recruited and completed the therapy. Using an existential-phenomenological framework, the therapy aimed to facilitate participants to make existential meaning from a creative process, which in turn help them overcome challenges and enhance their well-being in the domains of physical health, psychological health and social relationships. A mixed-methods study design was employed. Qualitative data were obtained through clinical observation by the therapist intern, participants’ written reflection, and semi-structured interviews with the participants. Quality of life, affects, and group cohesion were measured by self-report questionnaires. The results showed that most participants found a way to make existential meaning and benefited from increased quality of life and creativity. They displayed significant improvement in the physical health domain of the quality of life (Z = ?1.980, p =.048, r = 0.50)and positive affect (Z = ?2.103, p =.035, r = 0.53).

Acupuncture is a widely recognised therapy to treat depression and sleep disorders in clinical practice. This multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) is aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of depression patients with insomnia. Methods and analysis We describe a protocol for a multicentre RCT. A total of 270 eligible patients in three different healthcare centres in Shanghai will be randomly assigned to one of these three groups: treatment group (EA + standard care), control A group (sham electroacupuncture + standard care) and control B group (standard care). Treatment will be given three times per week for 8 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The secondary outcomes are sleep parameters recorded in the actigraphy, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score and Self-rating Anxiety Scale score. Daily dose of patients' antidepressant and sedative-hypnotic medication will be recorded in the dairy. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment and 8 weeks post-treatment, as well as at 1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-up.

Conventional devices that are used for colonoscopies are rigid and require a high level of expertise from endoscopists to perform the procedure. Advances in robot-assisted colonoscopic systems now produce softer, more slender, automated designs that no longer require the operator to use forceful pushing to advance the colonoscope inside the colon, reducing risks to the patient of perforation and pain. It is challenging to reprocess these scopes for reuse as the materials used can be damaged during decontamination, leading to the possible risks of cross-infection by pathogenic microorganisms when reused by patients. An ideal solution is to eliminate these contamination risks to patients by adopting sterile, single-use scopes straight from the manufacturer's package to the patient. With this idea in mind, emerging developments that push the boundaries in this area will benefit patients and encourage the public to participate in and adhere better to colonoscopy screening to reduce the development of colorectal cancer. Thus, in light of these concerns and challenges, to encourage patients undergoing colorectal screening to comply with colonoscopy procedures that they are less invasive, changes in the design and materials are necessary. One of the more promising technological advances in this area is the advent of robotic colonoscopy. ? 2019 The Authors.

RT-qPCR was used to analyze human fetal, healthy, and degenerated IVD tissues for the gene expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1. The primary IVD cell cultures were stimulated with either interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) alone or in combination with TRPA1/V1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, 3 and 10 ?M), followed by analysis of calcium flux and the expression of inflammation mediators (RT-qPCR/ELISA) and matrix constituents (RT-qPCR). The matrix structure and composition in caudal motion segments from TRPA1 and TRPV1 wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice was visualized by FAST staining. Gene expression of other TRP channels (A1, C1, C3, C6, V1, V2, V4, V6, M2, M7, M8) was also tested in cytokine-treated cells. TRPA1 was expressed in fetal IVD cells, 20% of degenerated IVDs, but not in healthy mature IVDs. TRPA1 expression was not detectable in untreated cells and it increased upon cytokine treatment, while TRPV1 was expressed and concomitantly reduced. In inflamed IVD cells, 10 ?M AITC activated calcium flux, induced gene expression of IL-8, and reduced disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) and collagen 1A1, possibly via upregulated TRPA1. TRPA1 KO in mice was associated with signs of degeneration in the nucleus pulposus and the vertebral growth plate, whereas TRPV1 KO did not show profound changes. Cytokine treatment also affected the gene expression of TRPV2 (increase), TRPV4 (increase), and TRPC6 (decrease). TRPA1 might be expressed in developing IVD, downregulated during its maturation, and upregulated again in degenerative disc disease, participating in matrix homeostasis. However, follow-up studies with larger sample sizes are needed to fully elucidate the role of TRPA1 and other TRP channels in degenerative disc disease. ? 2019 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention on health behaviour (walking) and health outcomes. Design: A non-randomized controlled trial with waitlisted control and pre-and post-measures. Setting: Community centres for the elderly. Participants: A total of 204 older adults with diabetes and/or hypertension were recruited. They were assigned to either the intervention group (IG) or waitlisted to the control group (CG). Intervention: Under the supervision of a nurse, six weekly group meetings were arranged in community centres for the elderly in which the participants freely exchanged their views regarding the barriers and facilitators of regular physical activity. Participants were encouraged to take photos in their neighbourhood or at home and brought these photos to share at the group meetings. The photos showed both the barriers and the facilitators to PA. In the last meeting, each participant worked out a plan to perform PA in the coming four weeks. Measures: PA referred to the number of steps taken per day and it was measured by a Garmin Accelerometer at baseline, Week 6 and Week 10. Other measures included the nine-item Self-Efficacy Scale for Exercise–Chinese version (SEE-C), and the 23-item Chinese Barriers to Exercise Scale and Senior Fitness Tests. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) models compared the outcomes over time between IG and CG. Results: A statistically significant difference in the changes in the average number of steps taken daily between the two groups at Week 10 (mean difference = 965.4; 95% confidence interval: 92.2, 1838.6, p = 0.030) was observed, although the difference at Week 6 was non-significant (mean difference = 777.6; 95% confidence interval: ?35.3, 1590.5, p = 0.061). IG participants also showed significant improvements in lower body strength (mean difference = 0.967; 95% confidence interval: 0.029, 1.904, p = 0.043) and lower limb flexibility (mean difference = 2.068; 95% confidence interval: 0.404, 3.731, p = 0.015) at Week 10 compared to CG participants. Conclusion: This multi-component intervention improved the participants’ physical activity level and physical fitness, particularly in lower limb flexibility and body strength. ? 2019 by the authors.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration model of the cognitive-behavioral approach and positive psychology by using digital game-based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention to magnify the social and emotional health and well-being of the school children in Hong Kong aged 9 to 11 years. Methods: A quasi-experimental design method was used to evaluate this digital game and school-based intervention. The Adventures of DoReMiFa was piloted in 4 primary schools where students were allocated to either an intervention or a control group. The participants were assessed at pre- and postintervention with a 6-month follow-up measuring their mental health knowledge, levels of anxiety symptoms, positive and negative thinking, perspective-taking, and self-esteem. Results: A total of 459 primary school students from 4 primary schools participated in the study. The response rate on the questionnaires answered on the Web was up to 85.1% (391/459). Compared with the control group, the intervention group was found to have significant association with improved mental health knowledge at the time immediately after the intervention (beta=.46; P=.01) and in the 6-month postintervention period (beta=.66; P 001); for perspective-taking, the intervention group had exhibited a significant improvement 6 months after the completion of the universal program (beta=1.50; P=.03). The intervention, however, was found not to be effective in reducing the rates of anxiety symptoms and negative thinking among the participating students. Conclusions: The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration of a digital game-based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention, was shown to be effective in elevating the knowledge of mental health and promoting perspective-taking in the primary school students of Hong Kong. Although there was insufficient evidence to support a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and negative automatic thoughts, the overall results were still encouraging in that a preventive effect was found, indicating that the program has the potential to enhance the mental well-being of schoolchildren. It also suggests that knowledge enhancement may not necessarily lead to behavior change, and more focused effort may be needed to achieve the translation. The implications and limitations of this study and suggestions for future research were also discussed. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

We investigated whether there is an additive hypotensive effect when exercise is combined with subsequent breaks in sitting. Sex differences and changes in plasma catecholamines as a potential candidate mechanism underlying BP responses were also examined. Sedentary older adults (n=67; 67±7 years; 31.2±4.1 kg/m2) completed 3 conditions in random order-sitting (SIT): Uninterrupted sitting (8 hours, control); exercise+sitting (EX+SIT): Sitting (1 hour), moderate-intensity walking (30 minutes), uninterrupted sitting (6.5 hours); exercise+breaks (EX+BR): Sitting (1 hour), moderate-intensity walking (30 minutes), sitting interrupted every 30 minutes with 3 minutes of light-intensity walking (6.5 hours). Serial BP and plasma epinephrine/norepinephrine measurements occurred during 8 hours. The 8-hour average systolic and diastolic BP (mm Hg 95% CI) was lower in EX+SIT-3.4 (-4.5 to-2.3),-0.8 (-1.6 to-0.04), and EX+BR-5.1 (-6.2 to-4.0),-1.1 (-1.8 to-0.3), respectively, relative to SIT (all P &lt;0.05). There was an additional reduction in average systolic BP of-1.7 (-2.8 to-0.6) in EX+BR relative to EX+SIT (P=0.003). This additional reduction in systolic BP was driven by women-3.2 (-4.7 to-1.7; P&lt;0.001 EX+BR versus EX+SIT). Average epinephrine decreased in EX+SIT and EX+BR in women (-13% to-12%) but increased in men (+12% to +23%), respectively, relative to SIT (P&lt;0.05). No differences in average norepinephrine were observed. Morning exercise reduces BP during a period of 8 hours in older overweight/obese adults compared with prolonged sitting. Combining exercise with regular breaks in sitting may be of more benefit for lowering BP in women than in men. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: Https://www.anzctr.org.au.

However, the effectiveness of PTC cardioprotection is reduced or lost in diabetes and the mechanisms are largely unclear. Hyperglycemia can induce overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthesis (iNOS) in the myocardium of diabetic subjects. However, it is unknown whether or not iNOS especially its overexpression plays an important role in the loss of cardioprotection of PTC in diabetes. C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice were treated with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Part of diabetic C57BL6 mice were also treated with an iNOS specific inhibitor, 1400 W. Mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion with/without PTC. The hemodynamic parameters, plasma levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT), TNF-α, IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO) were monitored. The myocardial infarct size, superoxide anion (O 2 [rad]? ) generation, nitrotyrosine production and apoptosis were measured. The expression of phosphorylated Akt, endothelial NOS (eNOS), iNOS and Erk1/2 in ischemic heart were detected by immunoblot analysis. In diabetic C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice, the post-ischemic hemodynamics were impaired, the cTnT, TNF-α, IL-6 level, myocardial infarct size, apoptotic index, O 2 [rad]? and nitrotyrosine generation were increased and the Akt/eNOS signal pathways were inhibited. PTC improved hemodynamic parameters, reduced cTnT level, myocardial infarct size, apoptotic index, O 2 [rad]? and nitrotyrosine generation and activated Akt/eNOS and Erk1/2 signal pathways in both non-diabetic C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice as well as diabetic iNOS ?/? mice, but not in diabetic C57BL6 mice. PTC also increased NO production in both non-diabetic and diabetic C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice, and enhanced iNOS expression in non-diabetic C57BL6 mice. 1400 W restored the cardioprotection of PTC in diabetic C57BL6 mice. Our data demonstrated that PTC reduced myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in non-diabetic mice but not C57BL6 diabetic mice.

Design: A randomized controlled multicenter trial. Setting: In three hospitals in Beijing, China. Subjects: A total of 216 patients with VCIND were recruited. Interventions: Patients with VCIND (mean age of 65.4 years) were randomized to receive acupuncture (two sessions per week) or oral citicoline (100 mg three times daily) over three months. Main measures: The primary outcome was the change from baseline to three months in cognitive symptom, measured by Alzheimer’s disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline to six months in ADAS-cog, executive function measured by the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and functional disability measured by the Ability of Daily Living (ADL) scale at three and six months. Results: At three months, the acupuncture group had a greater decrease in mean ADAS-cog score (?2.33 ± 0.31) than the citicoline group (?1.38 ± 0.34) with a mean difference of ?0.95 (95% CI, ?1.84 to ?0.07, P = 0.035). The mean change from baseline to six months in ADAS-cog also significantly favored acupuncture treatments (acupuncture change ?2.61 vs citicoline ?1.25, difference: ?1.36 points; 95% CI, ?2.20 to ?0.51; P = 0.002). There was no difference between the two groups on CDT and ADL scores at either time point. Conclusion: Compared with citicoline, acupuncture has comparable and even superior efficacy with improved cognitive and daily living performance as a complementary and alternative medicine treatment for VCIND. ?

Breastfeeding provides numerous benefits to infants and could potentially offset the effects of early-term birth. However, the effect of early-term birth on any and exclusive breastfeeding duration among healthy normal weight infants is unclear. Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the association between early-term birth and breastfeeding duration and exclusivity among healthy term infants. Methods: Two prospective cohorts of 2704 healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited in Hong Kong in 2006–07 and 2011–12. Participants were followed prospectively for 12 months or until they stopped breastfeeding. Results: Approximately one-third (32.8%) of the infants were born early-term. More than one-half of all participants had stopped breastfeeding by three months postpartum and approximately one-half of the infants were not being exclusively breastfed by two weeks postpartum. There was no significant difference in the odds of any (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.05; 95% 0.85, 1.31) or exclusive (aOR = 0.89; 95% 0.73, 1.08) breastfeeding at one-month postpartum between infants born early-term and at full-term. There was also no significant difference in the duration of any (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.0; 95% 0.91, 1.10) or exclusive (aHR = 1.0; 95% 0.91, 1.09) breastfeeding between early-term and full-term infants. Conclusion: In this cohort, early-term birth was not associated with breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. This suggests that, in the absence of neonatal complications, early-term birth itself may not lead to a shorter duration of any or exclusive breastfeeding. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Breastfeeding; Chinese; Gestational age; Hong Kong; Term birth,"adult; breast feeding; cohort analysis; female; gestational age; Hong Kong; human; newborn; outcome assessment; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; procedures; proportional hazards model; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; term birth; time factor; Adult; Breast Feeding; Cohort Studies; Female; Gestational Age; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Term Birth; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85060450175

The present study was conducted to educate and motivate visually impaired children to maintain their oral health using specially designed methods that are easy for these children to understand. Additionally, the study evaluated the effectiveness of these methods over a 6-month period. Methodology: The investigation was done on 148 visually impaired children who were residents of two institutes for the visually impaired. The efficacy of a specially designed oral health education programme and two different motivational techniques utilising tactile (Group I: braille + plastic models) or auditory sensations (Group II: audio story + JAWS ? , i.e. Job Access With Speech) was evaluated over 6 months based on the children's plaque and gingival scores. Results: Significant improvement in mean plaque and gingival scores was evident in both the groups at the 6-month evaluation, validating the effectiveness of both the programmes. In Group I, the mean plaque score decreased from 1.34 ± 0.29 at baseline to 1.09 ± 0.26 at 3 months, with a further decrease to 1.04 ± 0.31 at 6 months post-implementation (P &lt; 0.01).

Biogenic silica in millet bran was linked to ESCC in the early 1980s but the hypothesis was largely dismissed because of the lack of geographic correlation between millet consumption and ESCC. Later epidemiological studies disclosed the linkage of wheat consumption in North China to ESCC instead. Now, we hypothesize silica phytoliths (silicified bodies that have definite shapes) from wheat chaff are a major etiologic factor of ESCC in this region. This hypothesis is supported by the potentially high abundance of silica phytoliths on the bracts of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in North China due to favorable Si-accumulation genotype, arid climate, and siallitic soil with bioavailable Si. These silica phytoliths can contaminate wheat flour and cause repeated local injuries in the esophagus and stimulate proliferation by providing anchorage. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Aridity; Biogenic silica; Environmental geochemistry; Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); Siallitic soil; Silica phytolith; Wheat chaff,aridity; biogenic material; cancer; crop residue; epidemiology; geochemistry; phytolith; silica; China; Triticum aestivum; silicon dioxide; chemically induced; chemistry; China; dietary exposure; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; genetics; genotype; human; incidence; risk factor; soil; wheat; China; Dietary Exposure; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Genotype; Humans; Incidence; Risk Factors; Silicon Dioxide; Soil; Triticum,2-s2.0-85061047375

However, TLUSG failed to detect about 6–15% laryngoscopic examination (LE)-confirmed VCP. It is unclear whether the outcome of patients with VCP missed by TLUSG [false negative (FN)] is different from those with VCP diagnosed by TLUSG [true positive (TP)]. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and prognosis between patients with FN results and TP results. Methods: Over 46?months, all consecutive patients undergoing thyroidectomy or endocrine-related neck procedure were recruited. They underwent pre-operative and post-operative voice assessments on symptoms, voice-specific questionnaire [voice handicap index questionnaire (VHI-30)], TLUSG and LE. For patients with post-operative vocal cord palsy, reassessment LE would be arranged at second, fourth, sixth and twelfth?months post-operatively until VCP recovered. Results: In total, 1196 patients, including 74 post-thyroidectomy VCP, were recruited. For those with assessable vocal cords (VC), 58 VCP were correctly diagnosed by TLUSG (TP) and 10 VCP were missed by TLUSG (FN). Sensitivity and specificity of detecting a VCP by TLUSG were 85.3% and 94.7%, respectively. VHI-30 score was significantly increased after operation in TP group [31 (range ? 6–105), p < 0.001] but not in FN group [20 (14–99), p = 0.089]. Comparing to TP group, VCP recovered earlier (69 vs. 125?days, p < 0.001) and less patients suffered from permanent VCP in patients with FN results. (34.5% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.027). Conclusion: The VCP missed by TLUSG had a milder course of disease. Early recovery of VC function and non-permanent palsy were expected. ? 2018, Soci?t?

We aimed to evaluate its role in assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) with reference to liver stiffness measurement (LSM). Methods: CHB patients with LSM by transient elastography technology and retrievable serum samples were recruited. Ten-year re-assessments of LSM and M2BPGi were repeated in a patient subgroup. Results: 240 CHB patients (M:F = 116:124; median age 47.5?years) were recruited. The median M2BPGi values for F0/F1/F2, F3 and F4 progressively increased with more advanced stages of liver fibrosis: 0.39, 0.46 and 0.82 COI, respectively (p < 0.01). M2BPGi levels correlated well with liver stiffness (r = 0.611), FIB-4 (r = 0.616), and strongly with APRI (r = 0.825) (all p < 0.001). Using cut-off values of 0.605 and 0.615 COI, the AUROCs were 0.754 and 0.799 for ? F3 and F4, respectively. M2BPGi identified one-quarter patients at risk of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis otherwise classified into ‘grey area’ by LSM. In 86 patients with reassessment LSM, 21 (24.4%) showed significant fibrosis regression with corresponding decline in median M2BPGi level (??0.11 COI) compared with the increase of +0.03 COI in patients without significant fibrosis regression (p = 0.011). Male gender, older age, use of potent antiviral therapy and change in serum M2BPGi were independently associated with significant fibrosis regression. Conclusions: Serum M2BPGi can risk-stratify CHB patients whose liver stiffness fell into the ‘grey area’. Significant fibrosis regression occurring in one-quarter patients was reflected by a reduction in M2BPGi levels at 10-year interval. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.",Cirrhosis; Elastography; Hepatitis B; Liver fibrosis; M2BPGi,"alanine aminotransferase; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; entecavir; hepatitis B(e) antigen; Mac 2 binding protein glycosylation isomer; tenofovir disoproxil; unclassified drug; biological marker; membrane protein; TAA90K protein, human; tumor antigen; adult; age distribution; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; chronic hepatitis B; correlation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; disease course; female; follow up; human; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein analysis; protein blood level; protein function; seroconversion; sex difference; transient elastography; area under the curve; blood; chronic hepatitis B; complication; diagnostic imaging; elastography; glycosylation; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; middle aged; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; virology; Adult; Antigens, Neoplasm; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Glycosylation; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; ROC Curve",2-s2.0-85060606790

Further, high AGTR1 levels are associated with poor epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) outcomes. However, the mechanistic basis for these effects is unknown. Recent studies have suggested that ovarian cancer metastasis is highly dependent on the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS). To understand the associations between the ANGII/AGTR1 pathway and cancer outcomes, we evaluated the effects of ANGII on MCS formation by ovarian cancer cells and used a proteomic approach to analyze the mechanistic basis. Methods: We used the data from the GENT database and immunohistochemistry staining to assess the AGTR1 expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and to assess its role in cancer progression. Colony formation assay, 3D culture assay, and transwell assays were used to analyze the effect of ANGII on the MCS formation and cell migration. The signaling pathways of AGTR1 and transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation were investigated by the western blotting analysis. Xenograft models were used to determine the role of AGTR1 in ovarian cancer metastasis. ANGII release from ovarian cancer cells and ANGII levels in the EOC ascites fluid were measured by immunoassay. A shotgun proteomic approach was used to explore the detail molecular mechanism. Modulation of lipid desaturation and endoplasmic reticulum stress were verified by the in vitro and in vivo functional assays. Results: AGTR1 expression was negatively correlated with EOC prognosis. AGTR1activation significantly enhanced the MCS formation and cell migration. ANGII triggered both of the classical AGTR1 pathway and the EGFR transactivation. ANGII administration increased peritoneal metastasis. In addition, ovarian cancer cells secreted ANGII and enhanced cancer metastasis in a positive feedback manner. Based on the proteomic data, lipid desaturation was activated by induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which suggests that inhibition of SCD1 may significantly reduce MCS formation by increasing endoplasmic reticulum stress. Conclusions: ANGII promotes MCS formation and peritoneal metastasis of EOC cells. AGTR1 activation increases the lipid desaturation via SCD1 upregulation, which ultimately reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress in MCS. This mechanism explained the association between high levels of AGTR1 and poor clinical outcomes in EOC patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Angiotensin II; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Lipogenesis; Ovarian cancer; Spheroid formation,"angiotensin II; epidermal growth factor receptor; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; AGTR1 protein, human; angiotensin 1 receptor; angiotensin II; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; lipid; SCD1 protein, human; AGTR1 gene; animal experiment; animal model; Article; ascites fluid; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cell migration; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fatty acid desaturation; female; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; oncogene; ovarian cancer cell line; ovary carcinoma; peritoneum metastasis; priority journal; proteomics; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; cell motion; drug screening; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; metastasis; mouse; multicellular spheroid; pathology; peritoneum tumor; prognosis; secondary; Angiotensin II; Animals; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Cell Movement; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; ErbB Receptors; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Prognosis; Proteomics; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1; Spheroids, Cellular; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85062629736

Venting the smoke outdoors by installing chimneys was found to be effective at reducing the lung cancer risk in a cohort study of 21,232 farmers in central Xuan Wei. However, the lung cancer mortality rates in all 1.2?million residents of Xuan Wei have been increasing dramatically over the last four decades. It was higher than that in Yunnan Province and China overall, with significant heterogeneities in the geographic patterns of Xuan Wei. Intervention measures targeting certain types of coal or certain carcinogenic components in coal smoke need to be explored. To inform targeted intervention policies, it is essential to pinpoint the specific substance (particulate matter, organic extract, PAHs, free radicals, crystalline silica, and inorganic matter) that might account for the carcinogenicity of bituminous coal smoke. Exploring the underlying carcinogenesis mechanisms would also contribute to the intervention and control of the lung cancer epidemic in Xuan Wei, China. Here we review the suspected carcinogens and carcinogenesis mechanisms and discuss future research directions towards a better understanding of the etiology of lung cancer in Xuan Wei, China. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bituminous coal smoke; Lung cancer; Particulate matter; Xuan Wei,bituminous coal; carcinogen; coal; free radical; fuel; iron; organic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; radioactive material; silicate; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; alkylation; cancer epidemiology; cancer susceptibility; carcinogenesis; China; combustion; epigenetics; gene mutation; genetic susceptibility; human; inflammation; lung cancer; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particulate matter; priority journal; radioactivity; Review; toxicology,2-s2.0-85060182400

A well-designed lighting environment is critical for work efficiency and human health. Lighting design is commonly based on designer's previous experience and computational lighting simulation results. Although simulations can provide relatively accurate calculation results, several difficulties exist in terms of measuring actual users' experience and reflecting their feedback into the design. In this traditional approach, users are unable to experience or feel realistic lighting effects until the installation phase. This lack of user experience in the design phase leads to increasing risk of redesign and revision, which are extremely time-consuming and reduce the efficiency of lighting design. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the gap between the lighting design and users' satisfaction. This research aims to enhance visualization of lighting design and thus improve the design efficiency by developing a real-time interactive lighting design approach using building information modeling (BIM) and virtual reality (VR) technologies. By integrating these technologies, the proposed approach is able to support user interactions, actual activities simulation, and personalized lighting design. In addition, the proposed approach can provide users with immersive and sensory experiences to evaluate their lighting design alternatives. The whole process of the approach includes 3D modeling in Revit, texture mapping in 3ds Max, simulation analysis in DIALux, and interactions development and VR realization in Unity. A case study was conducted to implement and validate the proposed approach. In this case study, users were able to experience realistic lighting effects and provide their feedback for improving the design in a sensory way while lighting simulation was automatically conducted simultaneously. The approach enables better user experience and provides a practical way to apply BIM and VR technologies to improve the efficiency of real-time interactive lighting design. ? 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Methods and materials: This study has retrospectively compared the healthcare utilization and associated costs of pre- and post-PPIM treatment in 413 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder recruited from three major public hospitals providing psychiatric services in Hong Kong. Patients were categorized into early treatment (?3 years since diagnosis) and chronic (>3 years) groups, and also whether they were receiving polypharmacy (POP). Results: It was found that patients who were started on early therapy with no POP had the most favourable outcomes. Overall results of the entire cohort, including both early and late treatments, indicate that there was a slight increase in annual in-patient days (IP) per patient and outpatient visit (OP) by 3.18 and 1.87, respectively, and a decrease in emergency room visit (ER) of 0.9 (p < 0.05). For non-polypharmacy (NP) patients receiving early PP1M therapy, there was a significant decrease in IP and ER of 21.56 (p < 0.05) and 1.15 (p < 0.05), respectively, but an increase in OP of 1.88 (p < 0.05). For patients with POP, there was an all-across increase in IP and all-across decrease in OP and ER. In monetary terms, a NP patient receiving early therapy may have an overall saving of HKD40,878 (USD5,241, 1USD = 7.8HKD) per year compared to HKD6,224 (USD798) in patients where therapy was given after 3 years. For patients with POP, there was an all-across increase in overall spending despite reductions in OP and ER. Conclusions: From the 413 patients studied, potential annual savings is higher by early administration of PPIM in patients with NP. Analysis using multivariate linear regression based on generalized estimating equations and sensitivity analysis using a linear mixed model supported the findings. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cost analysis; cost savings; duration of hospitalization; early treatment; Paliperidone; polypharmacy,paliperidone; neuroleptic agent; paliperidone; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost control; early intervention; emergency ward; female; health care cost; health care utilization; Hong Kong; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental health service; outcome assessment; outpatient care; polypharmacy; public hospital; retrospective study; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; cost; delayed release formulation; drug administration; economics; health care cost; health care planning; middle aged; patient attitude; psychosis; schizophrenia; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; Costs and Cost Analysis; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Resources; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paliperidone Palmitate; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Polypharmacy; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Schizophrenia; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85060058320

In view of this, it is important to prepare students for collaborative work when they become professionals through a students’ team training at the preregistration level. As intervention programs are implemented to promote students’ collaboration, instruments like Team Experiences Questionnaire (TEQ)?are needed. In this connection, this study which involved 335 Chinese students enrolled in eight health and social care programs from two universities in Hong Kong investigated the factor structures of the TEQ using construct validation approach. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we examined the fit of three competing models: unidimensional model, first-order correlated model, and second-order hierarchical model. The results demonstrated that the second-order hierarchical model obtained the best fit, with a higher-order construct called total team experiences subsuming the following first order factors: overall satisfaction with team experiences, team impact on quality of learning, satisfaction with team evaluation, team impact on clinical reasoning ability, and professional development. The “total team experience” construct explained from 21.1% to 35.7% of the variance in predicting students’ future perception of team competency and autonomy, perceived need for cooperation, and perception of actual cooperation. Results support the applicability of the TEQ second-order hierarchical model.

Heterogeneous clinical presentations make the diagnosis challenging. We aim to identify the underlying genetic causes of a pediatric cohort with drug-resistant epilepsy and evaluate whether the findings can provide information on patient management. Methods: We include patients with drug-resistant epilepsy onset before 18?years of age. Singleton clinical chromosomal microarray (CMA) followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed using genomic DNA. In the first-tier analysis of the exome data, we aimed to identify disease-causing mutations in 546 genes known to cause, or to be associated with, epilepsy. For negative cases, we proceeded to exome-wide analysis. Rare coding variants were interrogated for pathogenicity based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Results: We recruited 50 patients. We identified 6 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations, giving a diagnostic yield of 12%. Mutations were found in 6 different genes: SCN8A, SCN1A, MECP2, CDKL5, DEPDC5, and CHD2. The CDKL5 variant was found to be mosaic. One variant of unknown significance (VUS) in KCNT1 was found in a patient with compatible clinical features. Of note, a reported pathogenic SCN5A mutation known to contribute to Brugada syndrome, was also found in the patient with an SCN1A mutation. Significance: Our study suggests that singleton WES is an effective diagnostic tool for drug-resistant epilepsy. Genetic diagnosis can help to consolidate the clinical diagnosis, to facilitate phenotypic expansion, and to influence treatment and management options for seizure control in our patients. In our study, a significant portion of the genetic findings are known to be associated with an increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). These findings could assist with more appropriate management in patients with epilepsy. ? 2018 The Authors.

Measurements: The measures were MDS 2.0 items and mortality data from the discharge tracking forms. The nine items in the IRD scale (decline in cognitive status, decline in activities of daily living, cancer, renal failure, congestive heart failure, emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, edema, shortness of breath, and loss of weight), were selected based on bivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: The IRD scale was a strong predictor of mortality in both Sample 1 (HRsample1 = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.65) and Sample 2 (HRsample2 = 1.31, 1.19-1.43), after adjusting for covariates. Hazard ratios (HRs) for residents who had an IRD score of 3 or above for Sample 1 and Sample 2 were 3.32 (2.12-5.21) and 2.00 (1.30-3.09), respectively. Conclusions: The IRD scale is a promising tool for identifying nursing home residents at increased risk of death. We recommend the tool to be incorporated into the care protocol of long-term care facilities in Hong Kong. ?

Little is known about the prevalence of EIV in Saudi Arabia especially the H3N8 serotype. Objectives: To assess prevalence of equine influenza in horse populations in Eastern and Central Saudi Arabia. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We collected 145 sera, 323 nasal and 323 rectal swabs from horses from six major cities in Eastern and Central regions. None of the horses were vaccinated against EIV. Sera were tested in ELISA assays for influenza A type-specific antibodies and by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using equine H3N8. The swabs were tested by RT-qPCR assay targeting a conserved region of the influenza A matrix gene that detects influenza A viruses of all subtypes. Results: None of the swabs had detectable influenza A virus RNA. Of the 145 serasamples tested by ELISA, 81 (55.9%) were positive and 98 (67.6%) of 145 sera tested by HI tests were positive for equine H3. Main limitations: Our failure to detect and sequence any EIV prevents identification of the lineage of virus that circulates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: These results confirm that EIV H3N8 is circulating in Saudi Arabia and should be considered as a possible cause when investigating horses with respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia. ? 2018 EVJ Ltd",equine influenza virus; H3N8; haemagglutination inhibition; horse; Saudi Arabia,"animal experiment; Article; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; equine influenza (H3N8); hemagglutination inhibition test; horse; Influenza A virus (H3N8); nonhuman; nose smear; prevalence; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Saudi Arabia; animal; blood; horse disease; Influenza A virus (H3N8); orthomyxovirus infection; seroepidemiology; veterinary medicine; virology; virus antibody; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Horse Diseases; Horses; Influenza A Virus, H3N8 Subtype; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Saudi Arabia; Seroepidemiologic Studies",2-s2.0-85061117422

The results revealed that ICG-001-mediated inhibition of tumor cell migration involved downregulated mRNA and protein expression of the Wnt target gene cluster of differentiation (CD)44. It was also demonstrated that ICG-001 downregulated the expression of CD44, and this effect was accompanied by restored expression of microRNA (miRNA)-150 in various NPC cell lines. Using a CD44 3'-untranslated region luciferase reporter assay, miR-150 was confirmed to be a novel CD44?targeting miRNA, which could directly target CD44 and subsequently regulate the migration of NPC cells.

Study design: The study is a retrospective analysis. Methods: Pregnant HBV carriers and their infants were followed up for 9–12 months after delivery. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to investigate what medical care they received for HBV before, during and after pregnancy. Results: Data were available for 412 HBV carriers. A total of 375 (91.0%) women were known HBV carriers before pregnancy. Routine antenatal screening picked out the remaining 37 (9.0%) HBV carriers; these women were younger, more likely to be smokers and had a lower level of education (P < 0.05) than known HBV carriers. In total, 356 of 412 (86.4%) HBV carriers did not receive any medical care for HBV during pregnancy. Known HBV carrier status, history of medical check-up and the use of antiviral treatment before pregnancy were significant predictors for HBV medical care during pregnancy (P < 0.05). The results show that 217 of 412 (52.6%) HBV carriers did not receive medical care for HBV after delivery. HBV medical care before pregnancy, use of antiviral treatment before pregnancy and a higher level of education were significant predictors for postpartum HBV medical care (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that HBV medical care before pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 7.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.21–18.65; P < 0.001) and the use of antiviral treatment (OR, 5.02; 95% CI, 1.41–17.81; P = 0.013) were associated with medical care during pregnancy. Medical care before pregnancy was also associated with postpartum HBV medical care (OR, 5.05; 95% CI, 3.29–7.51; P < 0.001). Conclusions: A significant proportion of HBV carriers did not receive HBV-related medical check-ups during and after pregnancy in Hong Kong despite the majority being aware of their carrier status. Medical care before pregnancy predicted antenatal and postpartum HBV medical care. ? 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health",Hepatitis B virus; Infection; Infectious disease transmission; Pregnancy; Vertical,"disease transmission; disease vector; health care; health status; hepatitis; infectious disease; medical geography; pregnancy; adult; antiviral therapy; article; controlled study; education; female; Hepatitis B virus; Hong Kong; human; infant; interview; male; medical examination; nonhuman; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; retrospective study; smoking; virus carrier; hepatitis B; heterozygote; isolation and purification; postnatal care; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal care; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; vertical transmission; China; Hong Kong; Hepatitis B virus; antivirus agent; hepatitis B surface antigen; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Carrier State; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Postnatal Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prenatal Care; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85060351105

Methods: 98 consecutive patients with rHCC who underwent abdominal CT and subsequent TAE between January 2007 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The CT scans were reviewed by two radiologists blinded to the patient outcome. Clinical parameters including serum bilirubin, albumin, INR, creatinine, and hemoglobin were recorded. Independent risk factors for 30-day mortality after TAE were identified using multivariate binary logistic regression, for development of a scoring system. The scoring system was then validated in 20 patients between January 2017 and May 2018. Results: In the development cohort, bilobar tumor distribution (OR = 29.6), clinical parameters of bilirubin > 2.5?mg/dL (OR = 5.9), and albumin < 30?g/L (OR = 4.1) were independent predictors for 30-day mortality. A 6-point score was derived and yielded area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 0.904. A score ? 4 resulted in sensitivity of 80.5% and specificity of 91.2% for 30-day mortality. In the validation cohort, AUC for 30-day mortality was 0.939. A score ? 4 resulted in sensitivity of 81.2% and specificity of 88.9%. In both development and validation cohorts, the proposed scoring system was better than biochemical components of Child–Pugh score and serum bilirubin to predict 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Imaging and clinical parameters can be combined into a scoring system to accurately predict 30-day mortality after TAE in rHCC patients. The score may help identify and counsel high-risk patients. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Hepatocellular carcinoma; Prognostic factors; Spontaneous rupture; Therapeutic embolization,albumin; bilirubin; creatinine; gelfoam; hemoglobin; polyvinyl alcohol; adult; aged; arterial embolization; Article; bilirubin blood level; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; Child Pugh score; chronic hepatitis; cohort analysis; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; follow up; hepatitis B; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver failure; major clinical study; male; multiple organ failure; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; radiologist; retrospective study; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; shock; transarterial embolization; treatment outcome; validation study,2-s2.0-85059864304

Objective: It aimed to assess whether the ultrasound-na?ve ambulance personnel could acquire the skills and knowledge of point-of-care ultrasound following a tailor-made training programme. Methods: This was a prospective observational study. The training programme was a 1-day course consisted of didactic lectures and hands-on practice. Each participant was assessed by a written test and a skills test. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the ambulance personnel and their results of the written and skills test. Significance testing was by Mann–Whitney U test and Spearman correlation test where appropriate. Results: Seventeen members of Ambulance Service Institute (Hong Kong Branch) participated in the programme. All of them currently are the ambulance personnel and they joined the programme via the captioned institute. Enrollment was voluntary. The median score in the written test was 20 out of 25. The median time to complete the four views of the focused assessment with sonography in trauma scan was 3.4 min. There was no significant relationship between test performance and educational background and work experience of the ambulance personnel.

We examined the associations of growth at different phases from birth to puberty with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years. In the population-representative “Children of 1997” birth cohort, growth was measured as (i) weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at birth and WAZ gains from 0 to 2 and 2 to 8 years and (ii) body-mass-index-for-age z score (BAZ) and length/height-for-age z score (LAZ) at 3 months and BAZ and LAZ gains from 3 months to 3 years, 3 to 8 years and 8 to 14 years, based on the World Health Organization growth standards/references. Adjusted partial least squares regression was used to assess simultaneously the associations of growth with height-, age- and sex-specific systolic (SBPZ) and diastolic blood pressure z scores (DBPZ), low- (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TG) at ~17.5 years. Among 3410 children, higher WAZ, BAZ and LAZ gains from initial size to 8 years were associated with higher SBPZ. Higher gains in WAZ and BAZ from 2 to 8 years were consistently associated with higher DBPZ, LDL and TG and lower HDL. Lower LAZ at 3 months and higher LAZ gain from 3 months to 3 years were associated with lower HDL and higher TG. Greater growth in weight, body mass index and length/height had negative associations with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years, but the differences by growth measure, phase and outcome suggest a complex underlying process. ? 2018, The Japanese Society of Hypertension.",blood pressure; body mass index; length/height; lipids; Weight,cholesterol oxidase; growth factor; high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; peroxidase; triacylglycerol; adolescent; age; Article; birth weight; blood pressure; body height; body mass; breast feeding; child; child growth; colorimetry; diastolic blood pressure; education; female; human; hypertension; immunization; infant; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; obesity; partial least squares regression; passive smoking; prevalence; risk factor; sex difference; sphygmomanometry; systolic blood pressure; underweight,2-s2.0-85058837021

Background: Dental diseases and disabilities among older people are serious public health concerns in China. Methods: A facilitator conducted eight focus groups, three in Hong Kong and five in Guangzhou, involving a total of 51 participants. She encouraged discussions about lifetime events to explain dental experiences and beliefs. Transcripts were coded and analysed using a constant comparative approach to identify themes that explained the regulators of dental experiences throughout the participants’ lives. Results: Participants explained the influence of culture and history through critical events, and how external and internal factors regulated their current oral health status and beliefs. They emphasised the role of Traditional Chinese Medicine and family, and the stress of social upheaval compounded by a scarcity of dental services. They revealed also how current choice of dental services and health promotional programs, helped by personal food choice, self-reliance, and scepticism, helped them to adjust and cope with dental diseases and disabilities and the commercialisation of dental services. Conclusions: Dental experiences and beliefs of older people living in Guangzhou and Hong Kong were regulated strongly during personal development by culture and history during critical events, and by various controlling factors, such as health promotion and choice of services supplemented by food choice, nutritional balance, self-reliance, scepticism and social adjustments. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S and The Gerodontology Association.

Methods: 909 Hong Kong Chinese older adults aged 65 + years and living in pre-selected communities stratified by walkability and socio-economic status participated in this cross-sectional observational study. Exposure variables were objectively-quantified neighborhood attributes. The outcome measure was presence of depressive symptoms. Scores on validated Chinese versions of international PA questionnaires were examined as mediators of environment-depressive symptoms associations and of the moderating effects of living arrangements (living alone vs. living with others) on these associations. Results: Neighborhood connectivity, prevalence of public transport, and pedestrian infrastructure were positively related to depressive symptoms; and frequency of walking for transport was identified as a suppressor of these positive associations. Living arrangements moderated the associations of a considerable number of measures of access to destinations of daily living with depressive symptoms, and most of these moderating effects were partially mediated by frequency of walking for transport. Conclusions: Ultra-dense, well-connected, pedestrian-friendly, destination-rich neighborhoods may contribute to lowering the risk of depressive symptoms in Hong Kong older adults by enabling them to frequently walk to local destinations of daily living and, thus, maintain their independence and bond with the community. These potential pathways of influence appear to be particularly important for older adults living alone. Future studies need to identify mechanisms other than PA that contribute to unexplained environment-depression relationships. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental audits; Geographic information systems; Living arrangements; Mental health; Walkability; Walking,aged; Article; Asian; Chinese; community; cross-sectional study; depression; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; observational study; physical activity; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; social status; walkability; walking,2-s2.0-85057821622

Patients and Methods: Patients with asymptomatic renal calculi electing active surveillance of their stones were retrospectively reviewed. Patients underwent annual ultrasonography and clinical visits with standardised questions regarding the development of symptoms or complications from calculi. Spontaneous stone passage, stone growth, development of stone-related symptoms, and requirement for intervention during follow-up were deemed as stone-related events. Results: Between 2007 and 2017, 293 patients were reviewed to evaluate the natural history of asymptomatic renal calculi. The mean follow-up was 4.2 years. Overall incidences of spontaneous passage, stone growth, development of stone-related symptoms, and requirement of intervention were 32.1%, 16.7%, 28.3% and 12.3%, respectively. Stones >5 mm and lower pole stones were significantly less likely to pass spontaneously. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperuricaemia or non-lower calyceal stone were more likely to experience stone growth. Stones >5 mm or non-lower pole stones were more likely to become symptomatic. Significant predictors of surgical intervention were stone size (>5 mm) and patients' age (>60 years). Primary therapy was extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in 33 patients and flexible ureteroscopy in three. Conclusion: The natural history of asymptomatic renal stones rarely requires intervention, although they do have a slightly higher rate of symptomatic events and growth over the intermediate term. In particular, patients with stones >5 mm, DM, hyperuricaemia, or non-lower calyceal stones are at higher risk of developing stone-related events, and should therefore be recommended for regular follow-up. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International ? 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",#KidneyStones; asymptomatic; kidney stone; nature history; observation,adult; age; Article; asymptomatic disease; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; echography; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; female; follow up; human; hyperuricemia; incidence; major clinical study; male; nephrolithiasis; observational study; outcome assessment; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; ureteroscopy; urologic surgery; asymptomatic disease; diagnostic imaging; echography; follow up; lithotripsy; middle aged; nephrolithiasis; pathophysiology; prognosis; time factor; watchful waiting; Adult; Asymptomatic Diseases; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Lithotripsy; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Ultrasonography; Watchful Waiting,2-s2.0-85055265775

A quantitative value, that is time saved in editing the auto-segmented contours, was used to compare the effectiveness of two other commonly used indices in this study.Methods The relationship between the proposed index and the amount of the contouring time that could be saved was studied. The performances of two other commonly used similarity indices, namely Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the modified normalised average Hausdorff distance (MNAHD), were also evaluated. Ten nasopharyngeal cases and ten prostate cases that were previously treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique were recruited as the validation cases in this study. Three observers were invited to contour four structures (bladder, rectum, brain stem and parotid gland) on computed tomography images of the validation cases without any aids. The time taken for contouring was recorded as the manual contouring time. By using an atlas-based auto-segmentation software, three sets of contours were generated for each validation case with different library sizes to produce different degrees of similarity level. The values of the three similarity indices of the auto-segmented contours were calculated. The observers were asked to edit the auto-segmented contours and the editing time was recorded. The correlation between the editing time and the similarity indices was studied. The amount of time saved was calculated by subtracting the editing time from the manual contouring time. The performances of PBI, DSC and MNAHD were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficient and receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.Results The PBI showed a positive linear relationship with the amount of contouring time saved. Pearson correlation coefficient ranged from 0·73 to 0·86 for the four structures. The PBI had a stronger correlation than the DSC in bladder and parotid gland, while there was no significant difference between the two indices in rectum and brain stem. The MNAHD had an inferior correlation than the proposed index. For the ROC analysis, the cut-off values for the PBI were 0·549, 0·401 and 0·301 for the three levels of contouring time saved, namely 50, 25 and 0%, respectively. The accuracy of PBI was over 77% and the Youden index was >0·6 for all three levels.Conclusions The proposed index showed a stronger relationship to the amount of contouring time saved. It was a simple tool that could be used to evaluate the performance of different segmentation algorithms. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.",auto-segmentation; contour similarity index; dice similarity index; radiation therapy planning; structure contouring,female; human; psychosocial disorder; quality of life; Review; sexuality; social isolation; social stigma; systematic review; vulva cancer,2-s2.0-85054960167

However, there is conflicting data regarding the impact of anaemia on postoperative recovery in patients with repaired hip fractures. It is hypothesised that for a given baseline functional status and fracture type, lower postoperative haemoglobin will increase rehabilitation time and prolong total length of hospital stay. Methods: This is a retrospective study on data collected prospectively on patients entered into the Clinical Pathway aged >65 years admitted to Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) with a fractured neck of femur during 2011–2013. Potential predictor variables were analysed with linear regression with respect to total length of stay and those that reached a significance level of 0.05 were included in further analysis. Results: 1092 patients were admitted to QMH with a suspected fractured neck of femur; data from 747 patients were analysed. The fracture sites were neck of femur (50%), intertrochanteric (48%) and subtrochanteric fracture (2%). Approximately 30% of patients received blood transfusions. Of these only the development of postoperative medical complications statistically prolonged hospital stay. No relationship was seen with haemoglobin levels cut-off above and below 10 g/dl with the result remaining non-significant down to a cut-off of above and below 8 g/dl. Discussion: This study revealed that post-surgical haemoglobin level of between 8 g/dl and 10 g/dL did not have an impact on the total length of hospital stay. The development of postoperative medical complications was the only factor that prolonged the total length of stay. ?

Method: A matched-pair comparison approach was adopted. Twenty-seven experimental group participants received recovery-oriented CBA, while 25 participants received standard counseling services. Assessments were administered at preintervention and at 6 and 12 months of intervention. Results: Repeated measures analyses of covariance indicated that the recovery-oriented CBA was more effective than the control condition in improving the mental health recovery process (basic functioning, finding new potentials, and spirituality) and a sense of hope (planning in achieving goals). Conclusion: Given these initial positive results, more vigorous studies and refinement of this recovery-oriented CBA are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of this combined intervention approach. ?

The bovine brucellosis surveillance program was further extended to beef cattle farms with more than 10 heads of cattle on June 2006 (Intervention 2). Methods: To quantify the temporal relationship between bovine and human brucellosis, a time-series analysis was conducted using Korean national notification data reported between January 2004 and December 2014. Results: Our findings indicate that while during the pre-intervention phase (January 2004 to March 2005) there was no significant temporal relationship between the incidences of bovine and human brucellosis, significant temporal relationships were observed after Intervention 1 (June 2005 to June 2006, no lag, β = 0.57, p = 0.04), and Intervention 2 (July 2006 to June 2007, 1-month lag, β = 0.65, p = 0.03).

This study aimed to determine the cardiac and non-cardiac outcomes of adult survivors after biventricular repair of PAIVS and PS. The cardiac, neurodevelopmental and liver problems of 111 adults, 40 with PAIVS and 71 with PS, were reviewed. The median follow-up duration of our patients was 26.5?years (range 14.8–55?years). The freedom from reintervention at 30?years was 17.4% and 73.3% for PAIVS and PS patients (p < 0.001), respectively. Compared with PS patients, PAIVS patients had significantly greater prevalence of right atrial and right ventricular (RV) dilatation, and moderate to severe tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation (all p < 0.05), and cardiac arrhythmias (22.5% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.047). The freedom from development of cardiac arrhythmias at 30?years of 68.4% and 91.6%, respectively, in PAIVS and PS patients (p = 0.03). Cox proportional hazards model identified PAIVS as an independent risk factor for reintervention (HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.1–7.6, p < 0.001) and development of arrhythmias (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1–14.4, p = 0.03). Neurodevelopmental problems were found in 17.5% of PAIVS patients and 7.0% of PS patients (p = 0.11). Liver problems occurred in 2 (5%) PAIVS patients, both of whom required conversion to 1.5 ventricular repair. In conclusion, long-term problems, including the need for reinterventions, cardiac arrhythmias, RV dilation, pulmonary regurgitation, and neurodevelopmental and liver issues are more prevalent in adult PAIVS than PS survivors. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Adult congenital heart; Arrhythmias; Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum; Pulmonary stenosis,"adult; Article; biventricular repair; controlled study; disease severity; female; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium enlargement; heart dilatation; heart right atrium; heart right ventricle dilatation; heart right ventricle outflow tract obstruction; heart surgery; high risk population; human; liver disease; major clinical study; male; mental disease; prevalence; pulmonary valve atresia; pulmonary valve atresia with intact ventricular septum; pulmonary valve insufficiency; pulmonary valve stenosis; retreatment; risk factor; survivor; tricuspid valve regurgitation; complication; congenital heart malformation; echocardiography; heart arrhythmia; heart surgery; heart ventricle; procedures; pulmonary valve atresia; pulmonary valve stenosis; reoperation; statistics and numerical data; survivor; treatment outcome; Adult; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Echocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Defects, Congenital; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Pulmonary Atresia; Pulmonary Valve Stenosis; Reoperation; Risk Factors; Survivors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85058236766

This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifetime. Methods: We built a Discrete Event Simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifespan from public health service provider’s perspective. Transition probabilities among disease states were extrapolated from a cohort of 17,140 propensity score matched participants in RAMP-DM and those under usual primary care over 5-year’s follow-up. The mortality of patients with specific DM-related complications was estimated from a cohort of 206,238 patients with diabetes. Health preference and direct medical costs of DM patients referred to our previous studies among Chinese DM patients. Results: RAMP-DM individuals gained 0.745 QALYs and cost US$1404 less than those under usual care. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that RAMP-DM had 86.0% chance of being cost-saving compared to usual care under the assumptions and estimates used in the model. The probability of RAMP-DM being cost-effective compared to usual care would be over 99%, when the willingness to pay threshold is HK$20,000 (US$ 2564) or higher. Conclusion: RAMP-DM added to usual primary care was cost-saving in managing people with diabetes over lifetime.

Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are considered to be beneficial to patients with cognitive impairment. However, it is still unknown whether the combination of the two therapies could optimize the therapeutic effect for MCI. This trial is aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of acupuncture and the herbal formula Yishen Granule (YSG) for elderly patients with MCI. Methods/design: This is a multi-sited, patient-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Two hundred and forty eligible patients will be randomly divided into four groups: A. acupuncture with YSG, B. acupuncture with placebo herbal medicine, C. sham acupuncture with YSG or D. sham acupuncture with placebo herbal medicine. Acupuncture treatment will be given twice a week for 8 weeks and then once a week for 4 weeks. The herbal treatment patients will be given granules daily for 12 weeks, 8 weeks of standard-dose followed by 4 weeks of mid-dose. The primary outcome is scored by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The secondary outcomes will be scored by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and event-related potential (ERP). All the assessments will be conducted at baseline, and at the eighth and 12th week after intervention starts. The follow-up assessments will be performed with the MoCA in the 12th, 24th, and 36th weeks after intervention ends. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be used in this RCT.

In this paper, we first identify the fixed subgroup problem with the current round-robin slot assignment. To address it, a novel AID shuffle mechanism is proposed for each STA to distributedly find a different and distinct temporary AID in each RAW. Each STA then reuses the round-robin slot assignment with its temporary AID. As a result, the set of STAs assigned to each subgroup/slot are randomized, yet with the same subgroup size. Simulation results show that the transmission fairness problem with the original round-robin assignment is solved and the system throughput is also improved. ? 2018 IEEE.",,Computer networks; Medium access control; Round Robin; Round-Robin assignments; Slot assignment; System throughput; Transmission fairness; IEEE Standards,2-s2.0-85062847976

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study carried out at Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China. Patients with uncontrolled glaucoma who underwent AGV implantation alone or combined with phacoemulsification (AGV-Phaco) in the hospital from April 1, 2013 to July 31, 2016 were included. The preoperative and postoperative CCD was defined when the detachment between ciliary body and choroid was detected by the ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) respectively. The main outcomes included the incidence of CCD and the success rate at 6 months after surgery. Results: In total, 97 male and 56 female patients were included. CCD was observed in 92 (57.8%) eyes. The glaucoma diagnosis in the Non-CCD and CCD group included primary open angle glaucoma (21(31.3%) vs 33(35.9%)), primary angle closure glaucoma (10(14.9%) vs 13(14.1%)), secondary glaucoma (25(37.3%) vs (28(30.4%)) and so on. The preoperative median IOP (interquartile range) were 21.7(16.0,32.0) mmHg and 23.0(16.0,33.0) mmHg in the Non-CCD group and CCD group. Previous surgical history (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 13.34; odds ratio (OR) 4.06; p = 0.02) and shorter axial length (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97 OR 0.78; p = 0.02) were the two risk factors of CCD. The success rate between the CCD and Non-CCD group was not significantly different (64.3% vs 62.5%, p = 0.86) at 6 months. Conclusions: The incidence of CCD is 57.8% after AGV surgery. Eyes with previous surgical procedure was prone to CCD occurrence and longer axial length was protective against CCD. But at 6 months postoperatively, CCD did not reduce the success rate of AGV surgery and may not be a worrisome complication. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Ahmed glaucoma valve; Ciliochoroidal detachment; success rate,"acoustic microscopy; adult; adverse device effect; aged; choroid disease; ciliary body; eye axis length; female; glaucoma; glaucoma drainage implant; human; intraocular pressure; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; pathology; physiology; postoperative complication; retrospective study; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Axial Length, Eye; Choroid Diseases; Ciliary Body; Female; Glaucoma; Glaucoma Drainage Implants; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Logistic Models; Male; Microscopy, Acoustic; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tomography, Optical Coherence",2-s2.0-85061249810

Objective: This systematic review aims to examine the use of e-learning analytics data in health care studies with regards to how the analytics is reported and if there is a relationship between e-learning analytics and learning outcomes. Methods: We performed comprehensive searches of papers from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and ERIC) to identify relevant papers. Qualitative studies were excluded from this review. Papers were screened by 2 independent reviewers. We selected qualified studies for further investigation. Results: A total of 537 papers were screened, and 19 papers were identified. With regards to analytics undertaken, 11 studies reported the number of connections and time spent on e-learning. Learning outcome measures were defined by summative final assessment marks or grades. In addition, significant statistical results of the relationships between e-learning usage and learning outcomes were reported in 12 of the identified papers. In general, students who engaged more in e-learning resources would get better academic attainments. However, 2 papers reported otherwise with better performing students consuming less e-learning videos. A total of 14 papers utilized satisfaction questionnaires for students, and all were positive in their attitude toward e-learning. Furthermore, 6 of 19 papers reported descriptive statistics only, with no statistical analysis. Conclusions: The nature of e-learning activities reported in this review was varied and not detailed well. In addition, there appeared to be inadequate reporting of learning analytics data observed in over half of the selected papers with regards to definitions and lack of detailed information of what the analytic was recording. Although learning analytics data capture is popular, a lack of detail is apparent with regards to the capturing of meaningful and comparable data. In particular, most analytics record access to a management system or particular e-learning materials, which may not necessarily detail meaningful learning time or interaction. Hence, learning analytics data should be designed to record the time spent on learning and focus on key learning activities. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies. ?

The aim of the present study was investigate the dose-response effect of SDF on demineralized dentine in basal medium mucin (BMM) saliva substitute and human saliva. METHODS: Dentine discs stored in saliva substitute, BMM, and human unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) were chemically demineralized, and 10?μL of 10 wt%, 24 wt%, or 38 wt% SDF was applied and then stored in its respective saliva (BMM or UWS) for 5?days. Dentine disc samples were digested in 70% HNO3 , and silver was quantitatively detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. RESULTS: For both the BMM and UWS groups, the presence of silver increased proportionally with increasing concentrations of SDF (P?<?0.05). For the 38 wt% SDF application, the mean absorption percentage of silver in dentine was 3.90% for the UWS group and 6.61% for the BMM group. The BMM group was found to yield a significantly higher amount of silver compared to UWS at 10 wt% and 38 wt% SDF application (α?=?0.05); 38 wt% SDF interacts more with BMM with higher silver deposition than UWS. CONCLUSION: The amount of silver found in dentine was in proportion to the concentration of SDF. Extrapolation of in vitro investigations using artificial saliva for SDF tooth interactions should be interpreted with caution. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",artificial saliva; dentine; inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy; silver; silver diammine fluoride,"ammonia; anticaries agent; fluoride; fluoride varnish; quaternary ammonium derivative; silver; silver derivative; silver diamine fluoride; silver diammine; chemistry; dental caries; dentin; dose response; drug effect; human; in vitro study; pathology; saliva; surface property; tooth disease; topical drug administration; Administration, Topical; Ammonia; Cariostatic Agents; Dental Caries; Dentin; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fluorides; Fluorides, Topical; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Saliva; Silver; Silver Compounds; Surface Properties; Tooth Demineralization",2-s2.0-85061382709

This evaporation leads to tear hyperosmolarity, eventually triggering the onset of dry eye disease.

We formulated a hierarchical Bayesian model that synthesized data on diseases/events associated with EV-A71 and EV-A71 antibody responses to infection among unvaccinated children from large clinical trials of EV-A71 vaccination, which were conducted in Jiangsu and Beijing during 2012 and 2013, to reconstruct the severity profile in a unified framework. On average, 15.1% of the children aged 6-35 months were infected by EV-A71 during 1-year follow-up in a mild epidemic season. We estimated that 9.7%, 2.2%, and 0.6% of children infected with EV-A71 were diagnosed with EV-A71-associated diseases, were hospitalized, and showed severe complications, respectively. We estimated on average 1 death per 10,000 EV-A71 infections for children aged 6-35 months. Approximately 70% of children had ?4-fold rises in antibody titers after infection. Most EV-A71 infections in young children are mild, and overall 2.2% of the infected patients were hospitalized in the 2 trials.

When transporting interventions such as MeST from research to routine clinical practices (RCPs), modifications are inevitable, with potentially a decrease in effectiveness, so called voltage drop. We examined the transportability of MeST to RCPs as an add-on to treatment as usual with depressed in- and out- patients. Methods: We examined whether 1) MeST was adaptable to local needs of RCPs by implementing MeST in a joint decision-making process in seven Belgian RCPs 2) without losing its effect on rAMS. The effectiveness of MeST was measured by pre- and post- intervention measurements of memory specificity. Results: Adaptations were made to the MeST protocol to optimize the fit with RCPs. Local needs of RCPs were met by dismantling MeST into different subparts. By dismantling it in this way, we were able to address several challenges raised by clinicians. In particular, multidisciplinary teams could divide the workload across different team members and, for the open version of MeST, the intervention could be offered continuously with tailored dosing per patient. Both closed and open versions of MeST, with or without peripheral components, and delivered by health professionals with different backgrounds, resulted in a significant increase in memory specificity for depressed in- and out- patients in RCPs.

The percentages of MDRO contamination were also significantly lower on antimicrobial curtain B than the standard curtain: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5% vs 24% (P &lt;.001); carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp, 0.2% vs 22.1% (P &lt;.001); multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp, 0% vs 13.2% (P &lt;.001). Notably, the median time to first contamination by MDROs was 27.6 times longer for antimicrobial curtain B than for the standard curtain (138 days vs 5 days; P =.001).Conclusions Antimicrobial curtain B (QAC plus polyorganosiloxane) but not antimicrobial curtain A (built-in silver) effectively reduced the microbial burden and MDRO contamination compared with the standard curtain, even after extended use in an active clinical setting. The antimicrobial curtain provided an opportunity to avert indirect costs related to curtain changing and laundering in addition to improving patient safety. ? 2018 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence, perception, and predictors of AD completion in the Hong Kong general population with a diverse culture. Through random-digit dialing, a population-based telephone survey was conducted with participants aged 18 or above. Socio-demographic characteristics, self-perception and health status, prevalence of AD, and perceptions related to AD were assessed. The acceptance on completing AD was measured by the summed score on the level of agreement in making AD. In total, 2002 participants completed the survey, with only 0.5% having made AD. However, the majority of those who had heard about AD had made or intended to make AD (80.2%). Multivariable regression analysis showed that being religious, being optimistic, and agreeing to respect patients’ wishes are independently associated with higher AD acceptance. Being a student is associated with lower AD acceptance. The extremely low completion rate of AD, but high acceptance of AD urges for more active promotion of AD to the public and education on end-of-life care among university students. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive 2-stage systematic review using multiple electronic databases, from inception until July 2018. In the stage 1 review, we sought to identify all self-report physical activity instruments used in individuals with joint pain attributable to OA in the foot, knee, hip, or hand. In the stage 2 review, we searched for and appraised studies investigating the measurement properties of the instruments identified. In both stages of the review, we screened all articles for study eligibility criteria, completed data extraction using the Qualitative Attributes and Measurement Properties of Physical Activity questionnaire checklist, and conducted methodology quality assessments using a modified COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) checklist. Measurement properties for each physical activity instrument were evaluated and combined, using narrative synthesis. Results: In the stage 1 review, we identified 23 unique self-report physical activity instruments. In the stage 2 review, we identified 54 studies that evaluated the measurement properties of 13 of the 23 instruments identified. Instrument reliability varied from inadequate to adequate (intraclass correlation coefficient ?0.7). Instrument construct and criterion validity assessment showed small to moderate correlations with direct measures of physical activity. Instrument responsiveness was assessed in only 1 instrument and was unable to detect changes in comparison to accelerometers. Conclusion: Although many instruments were identified as being potentially suitable for use in patients with OA, none demonstrated adequate measurement properties across all domains of reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Further high-quality assessment of self-report physical activity instruments is required before such measures can be recommended for use in OA research. ? 2018, American College of Rheumatology",,checklist; construct validity; correlation coefficient; criterion related validity; electronic health record; foot pain; hand pain; hip pain; human; knee pain; measurement; musculoskeletal disease assessment; osteoarthritis; physical activity; qualitative analysis; questionnaire; reliability; Review; self report; systematic review; adult; evaluation study; exercise; osteoarthritis; physiology; qualitative research; self report; Adult; Exercise; Humans; Osteoarthritis; Qualitative Research; Self Report,2-s2.0-85060767942

Patients and Methods: A retrospective study of breast cancer patients who had surgery at a university hospital from 2000 to 2015 was performed. Stage on presentation, tumour characteristics and modalities of treatment for patients aged >70 years were compared with those aged <70 years. Factors affecting breast cancer specific survival were assessed by multivariate Cox regression. Results: In total, 3825 patients with breast cancer underwent surgery during the study period; 510 patients (13.3 per cent) were aged >70 years. The 5-year overall survival for elderly patients was 76.9 per cent, which was poorer than their younger counterparts (89.5 per cent, P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy (P = 0.001, hazard ratio: 0.481), advanced T-stage (P < 0.05) and advanced N-stage (P < 0.001) were the independent factors affecting breast cancer-specific survival in elderly patients. Conclusions: Elderly breast cancer patients had worse overall and breast cancer-specific survival. Stage on presentation and the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy were independent factors affecting survival among elderly patients.

Misconceptions of antibiotics contribute to antibiotic misuse behaviors. This study aims to examine whether university students hold the misconception that Antibiotic is a Xiaoyanyao (literally means anti-inflammatory drug in Chinese), and association between this misconception and antibiotic misuse behaviors. A cross-sectional study was conducted among university students using the cluster random sampling method in six universities of six regions in China (one university per region). The Chi-square test was used to assess the relationship between the misconception and antibiotic misuse behaviors. Logistic regression was conducted to identify the risk factors for antibiotic misuse behaviors. 11,192 of university students completed the entire questionnaire. There were 3882 (34.7%) students who were considered to have the misconception. Female students were more likely to have the misconception compared with males (36.7% vs. 32.6%, P < 0.001). Those students with a background of social science/humanities were more likely to have the misconception compared with those from science and medicine (44.1% vs. 30.3% vs. 20.1%, P < 0.001). Students came from rural areas compared with those from urban areas (37.5% vs. 32.5%, P < 0.001) were more likely to have the misconception. Students who had the misconception were 1.51 (95% CI 1.21–1.89, P < 0.001) times, 1.34 (95% CI 1.21–1.48, P < 0.001) times, and 1.36 (95% CI 1.24– 1.50, P < 0.001) times more likely to report self-medication, request to obtain antibiotics, and take antibiotics prophylactically than those who did not have this misconception, respectively. The high proportion of university students' misconception on Antibiotic is a Xiaoyanyao is worth more attention. Effective health education and interventions need to be promoted among university students and the whole population. ? 2018 by the authors.

Methods: All patients receiving delayed open repair of infrarenal and juxtarenal aortic aneurysms after endovascular repair from July 2001 to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients’ baseline characteristics, indications for delayed open conversion, and time between endovascular repair and open conversion are described. Early outcomes included operative approach, morbidity, and mortality. Midterm outcomes included survival. Results: Twenty-two (3.3%) of 667 patients with prior infrarenal endovascular aortic aneurysm repair had delayed open conversion (20 elective and 2 emergency). The time from endovascular repair to open conversion was 60 ± 36 months. The indications were 6 (27%) type Ia endoleaks, 6 (27%) type II endoleaks with enlarging sac size, 2 (9%) endotensions, 7 (32%) unknown types of endoleak, and 1 (5%) graft infection. The 7 minutes unknown endoleaks were confirmed as lumbar leaks in 4 cases and fabric leaks in 3. Operative time was 222 ± 48 min with blood loss of 2211 ± 2057 mL. Hospital stay after conversion was 12 ± 8 days. There was no 30-day mortality. Estimated survival rates were 96%, 91%, 86%, 79% and 57% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years postoperatively. Conclusion: Delayed conversion to open surgery after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair by endograft explantation appears to be safe with good short- and mid-term outcomes. With careful preoperative assessment, open conversion remained a realistic and viable option in patients with failed endovascular treatment. ?

Every year, seasonal influenza epidemics lead to substantial hospitalizations and pose intense pressure on blood transfusion service worldwide, especially in an ageing population of Hong Kong which often see bi-annual influenza outbreaks. However, limited quantitative studies have been performed to assess the impacts of influenza and other respiratory infections on blood supply. Methods: We estimated the impacts of respiratory infections on donor attendance and blood inventory, considering the confounding effects of weather conditions. The method only required influenza-like illness data from the existing sentinel surveillance network, local weather data, donor attendance records from blood transfusion service and blood inventory levels from local healthcare system. Results: We estimated the number of donor attendance dropped by 6–10% when the number of consultations with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) reported by sentinel general outpatient clinics exceeded five per 1000 consultations, which is a moderate activity level and has been observed frequently in Hong Kong. Blood inventory decreased with increased ILI consultation rates reported by sentinel general outpatient clinics. Adverse weather conditions had negative impacts on both donor attendance and blood inventory. Conclusion: Epidemics of influenza and other respiratory infections coupled with adverse weather conditions affected blood supply in Hong Kong. The pressure on blood transfusion service to maintain a stable and sufficient blood supply during influenza seasons should not be overlooked, especially in an ageing population of Hong Kong. ? 2019 International Society of Blood Transfusion",adverse weather; blood donation; blood inventory; donor; influenza; respiratory infection; temperature,"Article; blood; blood donor; blood inventory; blood transfusion; consultation; epidemic; flu like syndrome; health care system; Hong Kong; human; outpatient; priority journal; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract infection; retrospective study; season; sentinel surveillance; statistical analysis; weather; blood bank; blood donor; Hong Kong; hospitalization; influenza; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; Blood Banks; Blood Donors; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Humans; Influenza, Human; Seasons; Weather",2-s2.0-85059699612

To address this gap, we focused on couple dynamics and support in type 2 diabetes in U.S.-born Chinese Americans. Acculturation processes, particularly biculturalism, that is, the capacity to enact habits and practices from both the heritage and U.S. mainstream culture, were explored. Employing interpretive phenomenological methods, we conducted multiple narrative interviews with each of 15 couples regarding illness challenges and couple responses. Interviews were conducted in varied contexts, including with the couple, and in group interviews with people with diabetes or spouses. The unit of analysis was the couple, and narrative themes within the text were explored within the context of holistic couple summaries. We identified three key aspects of couple support: (i) Assisting with the diabetes treatment regimen; (ii) Moderating social and contextual factors that impede diabetes care; and (iii) Providing relational care and empathy for living with this challenging chronic condition. Support reflecting cultural maintenance of Chinese beliefs and practices include other directedness, family centeredness, and concerns for harmony and balance. Bicultural support patterns were also apparent in spousal communication that was both indirect and direct, and relationships marked by both interdependence and respect for independence or autonomy, reflecting both Chinese and U.S. cultural orientations, respectively. Working clinically with second and third generation Chinese immigrants requires clinical assessment of and responsiveness to couples’ acculturation levels and bicultural skills. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",acculturation; biculturalism; Chinese American; couple; diabetes; interpretive phenomenology; support,"adult; Asian American; coping behavior; cultural factor; ethnology; family; female; human; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; psychology; socioeconomics; spouse; verbal communication; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Asian Americans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Narration; Socioeconomic Factors; Spouses",2-s2.0-85059666284

Methods: One hundred three survivors (55% men) aged 25.0 ± 5.8 years at 15.2 ± 5.8 years after chemotherapy and 61 healthy control subjects (52% men) were studied. Tissue Doppler–derived mitral and tricuspid systolic (s) and early diastolic (e) velocities and LV myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction (IVA) were determined at rest and during bicycle exercise. The slope of the LV force-frequency relationship was derived from changes in IVA with heart rate during exercise (ΔIVA/Δ[heart rate]). LV and RV functional reserves were further assessed by the systolic functional reserve index (Δs × [1 ? 1/s at baseline]) and diastolic functional reserve index (Δe × [1 ? 1/e at baseline]). Results: At baseline, mitral annular tissue Doppler indices were similar between survivors and control subjects (P >.05 for all), while tricuspid s and e velocities were significantly lower in survivors (P <.05 for both). The force-frequency relationship slope (P <.001), LV systolic functional reserve index (P <.001), and RV systolic functional reserve index (P =.001) were significantly lower in survivors than control subjects. For diastolic functional reserve, LV but not RV diastolic functional reserve index was significantly lower in survivors (P <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed survivor status (β = ?0.39, P <.001) and baseline LV IVA (β = 0.15, P <.044) as significant determinants of the LV force-frequency relationship. Conclusions: LV and RV functional reserves during exercise are impaired in anthracycline-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer. ? 2018 American Society of Echocardiography",Childhood cancer survivors; Ventricular functional reserve,anthracycline; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular parameters; childhood cancer survivor; controlled study; diastolic velocity; exercise; female; functional reserve index; heart contraction; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; human; isovolumic contraction; left ventricular force frequency relationship; left ventricular myocardial acceleration; long term survival; major clinical study; male; systolic velocity; ventricular diastolic functional reserve impairment; ventricular systolic functional reserve impairment,2-s2.0-85059196623

We compared preferences for psychosocial care in Mainland breast cancer women with their Hong Kong counterparts to determine core preferences for, and correlates of, clinical psychosocial care implementation. Methods: Two hundred eighty breast cancer patients from 23 hospitals located in 15 provinces across Mainland China were recruited to complete the 55-item Chinese version of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's National Breast Cancer Centre assessment. Items ranked by proportions of women endorsing them as “essential” for care were compared with similar rankings by Hong Kong Chinese women with breast cancer. Results: Valid response rate was 83% (231/280). Among 231 breast cancer patients, greater than 40% endorsed 15/55 items as essential for effective psychosocial care. Of the top 10 ranked “repeatable” items, seven items were common to both Chinese and Hong Kong breast cancer women, while of the top 10 ranked “once-only” items, nine were common. Mainland breast cancer women ranked help with anxiety and social roles higher than did their Hong Kong counterparts. Demographic factors significantly associated with psychosocial care needs included ethnicity, age, income source and level, religious beliefs, education level, marital status, residential status, and current therapies. Conclusions: Chinese breast cancer patients prioritize both disease and treatment information and psychosocially sensitive care, making these core items in comprehensive psychosocial care implementation by clinicians and nurses. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Chinese, breast cancer; psychosocial care preferences",adult; age; anxiety; Article; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council National Breast Cancer Centre assessment; breast cancer; cancer patient; China; Chinese; clinical assessment; controlled study; demography; education; ethnicity; family income; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; marriage; patient preference; psychosocial care; religion; social aspect; aged; breast tumor; comparative study; middle aged; patient attitude; psychology; psychotherapy; therapy; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; China; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Preference; Psychotherapy,2-s2.0-85058976131

Patients and Methods: We conducted a territory-wide, multicenter, age- and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-matched cohort study comparing chemohormonal therapy and hormonal therapy alone in Chinese men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Patient and disease characteristics were reviewed. The primary outcome was PSA progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included clinical progression-free survival and castration resistance-free survival. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: From January 2015 to July 2016, 32 Chinese men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were treated with chemohormonal therapy, and they were matched to 32 Chinese men who were treated with hormonal therapy alone. Patient and disease characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The chemohormonal therapy group had a significantly better PSA progression-free survival (P =.001) and castration resistance-free survival (P =.002) than the hormonal therapy group. There was no significant difference in the clinical progression-free survival between the 2 groups. Upon multivariate Cox regression analyses, the use of chemohormonal therapy was significantly associated with a longer time to PSA progression (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.73; P =.008) and a longer time to castration resistance (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.83; P =.015), but was not associated with clinical progression.

Skull base repair is usually performed transnasally by using a nasal septal flap. But when NSF is not available and failed repeated transnasal repair, a cranionasal repair with frontal pericranial flap (PF) can be attempted to achieve the highest successful chance. We performed a dual layer/split PF repair of a skull base defect using cranionasal approach and here we describe the technique. Case Description: A 74-year-old man suffered from CSF leak and ventriculitis after multiple transnasal surgeries for pituitary macroadenoma despite multiple repairs with intranasal vascularized flaps. We performed repair by cranionasal approach and using frontal PF. The frontal PF was divided into left and right halves. The left half went intradural, through the chiasmatic window to reach the sella and cover the tubercular and sellar defect from above. The right half went through the nasion into the nose to cover the defect from below. So the defect was covered by two vascularized flap from a single frontal PF. The repair was successful with no CSF leak and infection successfully treated by antibiotics. Conclusion: We introduced the cranionasal dual layer/split PF technique to repair anterior skull base and successfully stopped the CSF leak in a patient after multiple EEA surgeries. This technique should only be considered in specific difficult situation where usual repair by EEA is impossible. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Cerebrospinal fluid leakage; Endoscopic surgical procedure; Pedicled flap; Skull base,antibiotic agent; fibrinogen plus thrombin; tissue adhesive; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; aspiration pneumonia; brain ventricle peritoneum shunt; brain ventriculitis; cancer surgery; case report; cerebrospinal fluid drainage; cerebrospinal fluid fistula; clinical article; craniotomy; cytoreductive surgery; endoscopic endonasal surgery; excision; human; hypophysis adenoma; limited mobility; liquorrhea; macroadenoma; male; pedicled skin flap; pericranial flap; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; skull defect; skull surgery; transsphenoidal surgery; adenoma; brain ventriculitis; fatality; hypophysis tumor; liquorrhea; postoperative complication; procedures; reoperation; skull base; surgical flaps; Adenoma; Aged; Cerebral Ventriculitis; Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak; Craniotomy; Fatal Outcome; Humans; Male; Pituitary Neoplasms; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Skull Base; Surgical Flaps,2-s2.0-85056609690

This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs). Methods: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus ?60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models. Results: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543–1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501–2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035–1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191–1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099). Conclusions: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",Adverse events; Combined modality therapy; Doses; Field design; Non-small cell lung cancer; Toxicity,adult; advanced cancer; adverse outcome; Article; cancer radiotherapy; chemoradiotherapy; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; death; ective nodal irradiation thoracic radiotherapy; follow up; human; involved field thoracic radiotherapy; major clinical study; middle aged; mortality rate; non small cell lung cancer; patient risk; priority journal; radiation dose; risk factor; survival rate; toxicity; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85056510211

The aim of this study is to explore the predictive value of the early stage clinical factors on the clinical remission and functional recovery at 10-year follow-up of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who received a 2-year EI service. Patients who received the EI service throughout the region of Hong Kong between 1st July 2001 and 30th June 2002 and with a diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were identified from the centralized hospital database (Clinical Management system, CMS). Semi-structured clinical interview was conducted at 10-year follow-up with a successful interview rate of 74.3% (n = 107). Clinical data was systematically retrieved each month for the first three years from the CMS and written clinical records using a standardized data entry form based on operationalized definitions. Results found shorter duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) predicted long-term clinical remission; higher educational level and shorter period of unemployment during the initial three years of the illness predicted functional recovery. Higher educational level, longer period of employment and planned medication discontinuation during the initial three years predicted complete recovery. The current study demonstrates the long-term impact of DUP and suggests improvement of employment during the early stage of illness could be a potential target for further improvement of the service. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Long-term outcomes; Recovery; Remission; Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders,"adolescent; adult; Article; controlled study; database management system; disease course; educational status; female; follow up; Hong Kong; hospital; human; information retrieval; major clinical study; male; medical record; medication compliance; mental health service; mental patient; predictive value; priority journal; remission; risk factor; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; semi structured interview; time to treatment; unemployment; early intervention; employment; follow up; psychosis; schizophrenia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Early Medical Intervention; Educational Status; Employment; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Psychotic Disorders; Remission Induction; Schizophrenia; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85051660352

Recent attention has been drawn recently to gene microarray analysis for understanding disease onset and progression. In this paper, we extend our previous work to develop a new large-scale partial least squares based multivariate regression approach for the identification of putative interacting partners of gene markers for high-throughput gene microarray and other related data. Preliminary analysis of the interacting gene partners of a marker gene of frontotemporal dementia show that the identified genes are significantly enriched in innate immune and inflammatory response processes, which align well with the nature of the disease. These suggest that the proposed approach may serve as a valuable tool for inferring putative gene interacting partners in biological studies involving gene microarray data and other related datasets. ? 2018 IEEE.",Caenorhabditis elegans; distributed computing; gene regulatory networks (GRNs); large-scale DNA microarray dataset; time course data analysis,Diagnosis; Digital signal processing; Distributed computer systems; Large dataset; Least squares approximations; Neurodegenerative diseases; Regression analysis; Caenorhabditis elegans; DNA micro-array; Frontotemporal dementias; Gene regulatory networks; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Multivariate regression; Partial least square (PLS); Time course datum; Genes,2-s2.0-85062794600

The Lisu is a minority group in China of more than 702,000 people located primarily in Yunnan Province. The present study was aimed at studying the status of dental caries status, as well as its risk factors, among Lisu children aged 5 years in Yunnan Province, China. Methods: A multistage cluster sampling method was employed for participants' recruitment. Two calibrated dentists carried out the clinical examination with dental mirrors and CPI probes under an LED headlight. The dental caries experience was assessed by the dmft index. Oral hygiene status was evaluated using the visible plaque index (VPI). Information on the child's socio-demographic characteristics and oral health-related practices were collected using a parental questionnaire. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB) was employed to analyse the associations between the dental caries status and the children's social-demographic status and their oral health-related behaviours. Results: In all, 470 Lisu children aged 5 were invited, and 404 were examined. Their mean dmft (±SD) and caries prevalence were 5.6 ± 4.8 and 80%, respectively. Their mean VPI scores were 58% ± 21%. Lisu children who brushed their teeth at least once daily had higher dmft scores, and children from high-income families were more likely to have dental caries. Conclusion: The prevalence of dental caries among Lisu children aged 5 years in Yunnan, China was high, and their caries status was severe, with a majority of carious teeth untreated. The dental caries experience of Lisu children aged 5 was related to their brushing frequency and families' economic backgrounds. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Child; China; Dental caries; Ethnic; Minority,"China; cross-sectional study; dental caries; DMF index; female; health; human; male; mouth hygiene; preschool child; prevalence; Child, Preschool; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Caries; DMF Index; Female; Humans; Male; Oral Health; Oral Hygiene; Prevalence",2-s2.0-85059940034

A voice recording was made, which was later converted into a text transcript and then preceded for content analysis with co-occurrence and similarity matrix interpretation. Two males and nine females with a history of self-harm aged between 24 and 58 years were recruited for the interviews. Result: The participants had diverse experiences and backgrounds, and attitudes toward community social services. However, there was a shared perception of the need to enhance community social services. There were four main themes and 12 sub themes identified. The main theme included the service availability, service accessibility, affordability and acceptability. For details, participants were unaware of the available types of care/social services in the community, and were unaware about the nearby social services. They also suggested extending service hours and focused services should be offered to help people with different backgrounds and needs. Actually, those with experience of service utilization had both positive and negative perspectives and they gave suggestions for service delivery, mainly extending service hours and offering focused services such as for gambling control and financial planning. In view of interaction with service providers, counseling skills and trust were highly appreciated by the participants.

To ensure healthier lives for youths, healthcare professionals need to increase awareness among the youth of the health risks and addictive nature of smoking, strengthen their ability to resist negative peer influence and curiosity, and help those who smoked to quit. The Smoke-free Teens Programme was launched in 2012 to equip youngsters with up-to-date information about smoking and global trends in tobacco control and to encourage them to play a pioneering role in tobacco control. This paper describes the process and outcomes of this programme for youths in Hong Kong. Methods: The Smoke-free Teens Programme contained three major components: (i) a 2-day-1-night training camp; (ii) creative activities to promote smoke-free messages in schools and the community; and (iii) an award presentation ceremony to recognize the efforts of outstanding Smoke-free Teens in establishing a smoke-free culture. All secondary school students or teenagers aged 14 to 18 years from secondary schools, youth centres and uniform groups were invited to join the programme. The outcome measures were changes in (1) knowledge about smoking hazards; (2) attitudes towards smoking, tobacco control, and smoking cessation; and (3) practices for promoting smoking cessation. Results: A total of 856 teenagers were recruited during the study period (July 2014 to March 2017). The results showed statistically significant changes in participants' knowledge about smoking hazards, attitudes towards tobacco control, and practice for promoting smoking cessation. Conclusions: The Smoke-free Teens Programme demonstrated effectiveness in equipping youngsters with up-to-date information about smoking and global trends in tobacco control and in encouraging them to play a pioneering role in tobacco control. The trained Smoke-free Teens not only promoted the smoke-free messages among their schoolmates, friends, and families, but also gathered community support for a smoke-free Hong Kong. The programme has been instrumental in fostering a new batch of Smoke-free Teens to advocate smoke-free culture and protect public health. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Ambassadors; Attitudes; Knowledge; Practice; Tobacco control; Youth smoking,"adolescent; adult; article; awards and prizes; ceremony; controlled study; friend; health science; high school; Hong Kong; human; juvenile; night; outcome assessment; public health; smoking cessation; student; tobacco; transcription initiation; attitude to health; female; Hong Kong; male; organization and management; organizational culture; procedures; program evaluation; school; smoking ban; smoking cessation; smoking prevention; Adolescent; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Organizational Culture; Program Evaluation; Schools; Smoke-Free Policy; Smoking Cessation; Smoking Prevention",2-s2.0-85059758173

Objective: To test whether a qigong intervention would increase telomerase activity and improve mental health in Chinese women who survived intimate partner violence. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-blind randomized clinical trial among Chinese women (N?=?271) who survived intimate partner violence in the past 2 years recruited from a community center in Hong Kong, China. The trial was conducted from March 12, 2014, to May 26, 2016. Data analysis was by intention to treat and performed from June 7 to August 24, 2018. Interventions: Randomization (1:1) to a 22-week qigong intervention (n?=?136) that included 22 weeks of Baduanjin qigong group training (1-6 weeks: 2-hour sessions biweekly; 7-22 weeks: 1-hour follow-up sessions weekly) and self-practice (30 minutes per day for 22 weeks) or to a wait-list control group (n?=?135) that received optional monthly health education sessions unrelated to qigong after 6 weeks (posttraining period) and qigong training after 22 weeks (postintervention period). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The secondary outcomes included levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6) in peripheral blood plasma, depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II score; score range, 0-63; higher scores represent more severe depressive symptoms), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale; score range, 0-40; higher scores represent higher stress), and perceived coping (Perceived Coping Scale; score range, 0-13; higher scores represent use of more coping strategies). Results: From 1611 Chinese women screened (mean [SD] age, 42.0 [8.8] years), 247 of 271 randomized participants completed the study (intervention group, 120; wait-list control group, 127). Telomerase activity of the intervention group participants after 22 weeks was not significantly different from that of the wait-list control group participants (5.18 U [95% CI, 5.05-5.31 U] in the intervention group vs 5.14 U [95% CI, 5.01-5.27 U] in the wait-list control group; P?=?.66). The mean change in telomerase activity from baseline was marginally significant in the intervention group (effect size [d],?0.13; 95% CI, 0.001-0.27) but not in the wait-list control group (d, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.16 to 0.10). Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group after 6 weeks (between-group differences: perceived stress: d,? -1.81; 95% CI, -3.27 to -0.34; depressive symptoms: d,? -3.57; 95% CI, -6.25 to -0.90), but not after 22 weeks (between-group differences: perceived stress: d, -1.03; 95% CI, -2.50 to 0.43; depressive symptoms: d,? -1.78; 95% CI, -4.26 to 0.70). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study do not support a significant benefit of Baduanjin qigong on telomerase activity in women who have survived intimate partner violence. However, outcomes related to mental health seem to be improved, which should be confirmed by additional studies.

This study therefore aimed to examine the measurement properties of the IEPS by testing the four a priori models using the data from 335 Chinese students from eight prelicensure health and social care programs from two universities in Hong Kong.

SUMOylation is a post-translational modification process mediated by a family of ubiquitin-like proteins called small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins. Multiple sequence alignment of 78 representative flaviviruses showed that most (72/78, 92.3%) have a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) at their non-structural 5 (NS5) protein’s N-terminal domain. The putative SIM was highly conserved among 414 pre-epidemic and epidemic Zika virus (ZIKV) strains, with all of them having a putative SIM core amino acid sequence of VIDL (327/414, 79.0%) or VVDL (87/414, 21.0%). Molecular docking predicted that the hydrophobic SIM core residues bind to the β2 strand of the SUMO-1 protein, and the acidic residues flanking the core strengthen the binding through interactions with the basic surface of the SUMO protein. The SUMO inhibitor 2-D08 significantly reduced replication of flaviviruses and protected cells against ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects in vitro. A SIM-mutated ZIKV NS5 failed to efficiently suppress type I interferon signaling. Overall, these findings may suggest SUMO modification of the viral NS5 protein to be an evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification process among flaviviruses to enhance virus replication and suppress host antiviral response. ? 2019 by the authors.

Here, we show that oncolysis of mesothelioma by modified vaccinia Tiantan (MVTT) induces damage-associated molecular patterns exposure. Although MVTT leads to regression of established mesothelioma dose-dependently, antitumor CTLs are rarely induced. Mechanistically, MVTT virotherapy generates C-X-C chemokines that recruit CXCR2-expressing polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) into tumor microenvironment, where they suppress dendritic cells (DCs) by producing IL-10 and halt CTL responses. During the virotherapy, however, depletion of PMN-MDSCs but not of monocytic (M)-MDSCs results in the induction of potent antitumor CTLs that not only eradicate established mesothelioma but also prevent the second tumor challenge. Our findings suggest that vaccinia virotherapy may combine strategies that prevent the chemotactic recruitment of PMN-MDSCs, block their suppression on DCs or deplete PMN-MDSCs in order to induce potent CTLs for tumor eradication. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",CTLs; MDSCs; mesothelioma; Modified vaccinia Tiantan; virotherapy,chemokine receptor CXCR2; gamma interferon; high mobility group B1 protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 10 receptor; Twist related protein 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell infiltration; cell proliferation; cell viability; chemotaxis; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; flow cytometry; immunohistochemistry; immunotherapy; mesothelioma; mouse; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; nonhuman; oncolytic virotherapy; polymorphonuclear cell; protein expression; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85055125548

Many studies have demonstrated that people with adverse childhood experiences, such as child abuse, are likely to develop suicidal behavior. This study evaluates the connection between child abuse and suicidal behavior in the Hong Kong community where incidents of child abuse have been on the rise over the past decade. Aims: To determine the association between child abuse and attempted suicide in the child population of Hong Kong using hospital electronic medical records system. Method: From January 1, 1995 to July 31, 2016, patients with admission age < 18 years with the diagnosis of child abuse or influenza infection (comparison group) were included in this study (n = 54,256). In secondary data analysis, an association was found between children who had experienced child abuse and the outcome measure of hospital admission for attempted suicide compared with influenza infection. Results: The adjusted hazard ratio of attempting suicide in children who experienced sexual abuse and physical abuse compared with the influenza-infected group was 6.48 (95% CI [4.56, 9.19]) and 4.83 (95% CI [3.67, 6.34]). The age at onset of adverse incidents was negatively associated with the attempted suicide timing. Female patients had a 1.64 higher risk of repeating attempted suicide. In addition, nearly 5% of children who had experienced child abuse attempted suicide in the 10 years after their admission, and more than 36% of patients had a record of repeated suicide attempt in the 20 years after the initial admission. Limitations: The accuracy of the diagnosis, selection bias, insufficiency of study period, Berkson's bias, incomplete socioeconomic status, as well as the absence of psychiatric diagnosis are the limitations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that there is a significant association between child abuse and suicide attempts in Hong Kong. If confirmed, the study (a) demonstrates that hospital admission records are a critical source for identifying children with a high risk for suicidal behavior; (b) may inform policy makers that additional and long-term intervention programs should be provided to children so as to reduce subsequent suicide attempts. ? 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",attempted suicide; child abuse; electronic patient record; influenza infection,,2-s2.0-85072247067

Estimation and inference procedures in these models often center on the nonparametric maximum likelihood method and its numerical implementation via the EM algorithm. Despite its success in dealing with incomplete data problems, the algorithm may not fare well in high-dimensional situations. To address this problem, we propose a class of profile MM algorithms with good convergence properties. As a key step in constructing minorizing functions, the high-dimensional objective function is decomposed as a sum of separable low-dimensional functions. This allows the algorithm to bypass the difficulty of inverting large matrix and facilitates its pertinent use in high-dimensional problems. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms perform well in various situations and converge reliably with practical sample sizes. The method is illustrated using data from a colorectal cancer study. ? 2019 Institute of Statistical Science.

However, comparisons of cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency of different systems are complex because the incidences of different cancers vary across countries and their chances of cure also differ substantially. We aim to propose a new standardized method for global comparison and to explore its relationship with economic indicators. Methods: Cancer statistics from all 184 countries and 27 cancers listed in GLOBOCAN 2012 were analyzed. The complement of age-standardized mortality/incidence ratio [1 - (ASM/ASI)] was taken as the proxy relative survival (RS). Accounting for various country-specific cancer patterns, the cancer site-standardized proxy RS (proxy SS-RS) of individual countries were calculated by weighting the proportion of specific cancer sites as compared with the global pattern of incidence. Economic indicators of different countries listed by the World Bank were correlated with corresponding proxy SS-RS. Results: Substantial variation in site-specific survival and new case distribution supported the use of proxy SS-RS, which ranged from 0.124 to 0.622 (median 0.359). The median total health expenditure per capita (HEpc) increased from US$44 for countries with proxy SS-RS < 0.25, to US$4643 for countries with proxy SS-RS =0.55. Results from logarithmic regression model showed exponential increase in total HEpc for better outcome. The expenditure varied widely among different strata, with the widest difference observed among countries with SS-RS =0.55 (total HEpc US$1412-$9361). Conclusions: Similar to age-standardization, cancer site-standardization adjusted for variation in pattern of cancer incidence provides the best available and feasible strategies for comparing cancer survivals across countries globally. Furthermore, cancer outcome correlated significantly with economic indicators and the amount of HEpc escalated exponentially. Our findings call for more in-depth studies applying cancer-site standardization to provide essential data for sharing of experience and urgent actions by policy makers to develop comprehensive and financially sustainable cancer plan for greater equity. ? 2019 BioMed Central Ltd..

Scutellaria baicalensis (Huangqin or Chinese skullcap) is a widely consumed herbal medicine and has been historically used in anticancer therapy in China and other countries. Chinese skullcap generates many active chemicals in the root and is abundant in polyphenols, which act as its anti-cancer ingredients. It contains around 53 polyphenols in total: 50 flavonoids and 3 stilbenes. The polyphenols have similar chemical structures since they are derived from similar biochemical synthetic pathways. According to the literature, as the active chemicals of the skullcap root, 18 polyphenols exhibit evident anticancer activities. They can be developed not only as novel candidates and precursors in anticancer drug screening, but also as important tools and agents in cancer pharmacology. We comprehensively elaborated the anticancer pharmacological properties of crude polyphenolic extracts and 12 other single compounds excluding the six well-known polyphenols, i.e., baicalein, baicalin, wogonin, wogonoside, chrysin and verbascoside. In this review, we also discussed the possible mechanisms of the anticancer effect of several skullcap polyphenols. Overall, this paper provides a unique path to understand the anticancer properties of Chinese skullcap as well as guidance to find novel anticancer drugs from a natural polyphenolic reservoir.

Mycophenolate inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and is a standard treatment for LN. The mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is activated in LN. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR and is effective in preventing kidney transplant rejection, with the additional merits of reduced incidence of malignancies and viral infections. The effect of mycophenolate or rapamycin on kidney fibrosis in LN has not been investigated. We investigated the effects of mycophenolate and rapamycin in New Zealand Black and White first generation (NZB/W F1) murine LN and human mesangial cells (HMCs), focusing on mechanisms leading to kidney fibrosis. Treatment of mice with mycophenolate or rapamycin improved nephritis manifestations, decreased anti-double stranded (ds) DNA antibody titer and reduced immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition in the kidney. Both mycophenolate and rapamycin, especially the latter, decreased glomerular mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation. Renal histology in untreated mice showed mesangial proliferation and progressive glomerulosclerosis with tubular atrophy, and increased expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin (FN) and collagen. Both mycophenolate and rapamycin ameliorated the histopathological changes. Results from in vitro experiments showed that both mycophenolate and rapamycin decreased mesangial cell proliferation and their binding with anti-dsDNA antibodies. Mycophenolate and rapamycin also down-regulated mTOR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and inhibited fibrotic responses in mesangial cells that were induced by anti-dsDNA antibodies or TGF-β1. Our findings suggest that, in addition to immunosuppression, mycophenolate and rapamycin may reduce fibrosis in LN, which has important implications in preventing CKD in patients with LN. ? 2019 The Author(s).",,alpha smooth muscle actin; collagen; double stranded DNA antibody; fibronectin; immunoglobulin G; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitogen activated protein kinase; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; mycophenolic acid; rapamycin; transforming growth factor beta1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody titer; antiproliferative activity; Article; cell proliferation; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; drug effect; female; glomerulosclerosis; histopathology; human; human cell; human cell culture; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; kidney fibrosis; leukocyte count; lupus erythematosus nephritis; mesangium cell; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; treatment duration,2-s2.0-85071070229

However, methodology for timely and reliable estimation of that impact remains limited because of the delay in mortality data reporting. We explored real-time estimation of influenza-associated excess mortality by types/subtypes in each year between 2012 and 2018 in Hong Kong using linear regression models fitted to historical mortality and influenza surveillance data. We could predict that during the winter of 2017/2018, there were ?634 (95% confidence interval (CI): (190, 1033)) influenza-associated excess all-cause deaths in Hong Kong in population ?18 years, compared to 259 reported laboratory-confirmed deaths. We estimated that influenza was associated with substantial excess deaths in older adults, suggesting the implementation of control measures, such as administration of antivirals and vaccination, in that age group. The approach that we developed appears to provide robust real-time estimates of the impact of influenza circulation and complement surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed deaths. These results improve our understanding of the impact of influenza epidemics and provide a practical approach for a timely estimation of the mortality burden of influenza circulation during an ongoing epidemic. ?

However, how Wnt/β-catenin signaling is regulated in the endometrium remains elusive. We explored possible regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by multi-drug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), a potential target in cancer chemotherapy, and investigated the mechanism. Methods: Knockdown of MRP4 was performed in human endometrial cells in vitro or in a mouse embryo-implantation model in vivo. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used to assess protein interaction and stability. Wnt/β-catenin signaling was assessed by TOPflash reporter assay and quantitative PCR array. Normal and endometriotic human endometrial tissues were examined. Data from human microarray or RNAseq databases of more than 100 participants with endometriosis, endometrial cancer or IVF were analyzed. In vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis was performed. Results: MRP4-knockdown, but not its transporter-function-inhibition, accelerates β-catenin degradation in human endometrial cells. MRP4 and β-catenin are co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated in mouse and human endometrium. MRP4-knockdown in mouse uterus reduces β-catenin levels, downregulates a series of Wnt/β-catenin target genes and impairs embryo implantation, which are all reversed by blocking β-catenin degradation. Analysis of human endometrial biopsy samples and available databases reveals significant and positive correlations of MRP4 with β-catenin and Wnt/β-catenin target genes in the receptive endometrium in IVF, ectopic endometriotic lesions and endometrial cancers. Knockdown of MRP4 also inhibits in vitro and in vivo endometrial tumorigenesis. Conclusion: A previously undefined role of MRP4 in stabilizing β-catenin to sustain Wnt/β-catenin signaling in endometrial cells is revealed for both embryo implantation and endometrial disorders, suggesting MRP4 as a theranostic target for endometrial diseases associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling abnormality. ?

Turmoil in the banking and finance sectors led to downturns in stock markets, resulting in bankruptcies, house repossessions and high unemployment. These crises have been shown to be correlated with a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicides, and it is important to understand the implication of these impacts and how such recessions affect the health of affected populations. With the benefit of hindsight, did lessons learned from the negative effects of the 1997 Asian economic recession impact the aftermath of the 2008 GFC in Asian countries? Utilising a framework based on a simple strata-bootstrap algorithm using daily data–where available–we investigate the trend in suicide rates over time in three different populations (Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea), and examine whether there were any changes in the pattern of suicide rates in each country subsequent to both the 1997 Asian and 2008.

We also aimed at investigating their potential association and impact of those transmission risk groups. Methods: A total of 2,315 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were included. HIV-1 genotypes were determined by REGA Genotyping Tool and phylogenetic analysis with reference sequences. The viral evolutionary rates and time of the most common ancestor (tMRCA) were estimated by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) interference. Results: Apart from the two prevalent HIV-1 genotypes in Hong Kong (subtype B,41.6%, CRF01_AE,40.5%), phylogenetic analysis revealed a broad viral diversity including CRF07_BC(5.1%), subtype C(4.5%), CRF02_AG(1.1%), CRF08_BC(0.8%), subtype A1(0.8%), subtype G(0.4%), subtype D(0.4%), CRF06_cpx(0.4%), subtype F(0.1%), CRF12_BF(0·04%) and other recombinants(4.5%). The top five minority subtypes were further analyzed which demonstrated distinct epidemiological and phylogenetic patterns. Over 70% of subtypes A1, C and CRF02_AG infections were circulated among non-Chinese Asians or African community in Hong Kong and were mainly transmitted between heterosexual regular partners.

This retrospective study investigated to what extent the timing of patient disposition in Metro Vancouver EDs was influenced by a LOS-based P4P program. Methods: We analyzed ED visit records of four major hospitals in Metro Vancouver, Canada. For each ED, we individually tested whether LOS was distributed discontinuously at the LOS target before and after the P4P program was terminated. For the P4P effective period, we examined whether patients discharged just prior to the LOS target had a higher 7-day return-and-admission (RA) rate—the probability that a patient, after being discharged home, returned to any ED within 7 days and was admitted to an inpatient unit—than patients discharged just after the target. Results: Prior to the termination of the P4P program, in all four EDs, the LOS density of admitted patients was discontinuous and had a significant drop at the P4P 10-hours admission LOS target; a similar phenomenon was observed among discharged patients at the 4-hours discharge LOS target, but only in the two lower-volume EDs. Furthermore, in a lower-volume ED, patients who were discharged right before the 4-hours P4P LOS target had a higher 7-day RA rate than patients discharged right after the LOS target. After the termination of the discharge incentive, the discontinuity at the discharge LOS target became less evident, but patients were still more frequently admitted just before 10 hours in three of the four EDs as the local health authority continued to support the admission incentive scheme after the government terminated the P4P program. Conclusions: The LOS-based financial incentive scheme appears to have influenced the timing of ED patient dispositions. The results suggest mixed consequences of the P4P program—it can reduce access block for admitted patients but may also lead to discharges associated with return visits and admissions. ? 2019 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",,adult; article; Canada; emergency ward; female; government; hospital patient; human; length of stay; male; multicenter study; probability; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85069865035

Combined administration of these agents can overcome drug-mitigating responses as well as reduce adverse side effects, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the therapy. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an alkaloid monomer from the medicinal herb Ligusticum chuanxiong hort, is known to exert a variety of antitumor effects including inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. In this research, we investigated antitumor effects of TMP combined with paclitaxel (PTX), a frontline chemotherapeutic drug, in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that TMP enhances the antitumor effects of PTX in ovarian cancer A2780 and SKOV3 cells. Furthermore, we found that combined treatment of TMP and PTX suppressed angiogenesis by inhibiting both ERK1/2 and Akt pathways and promoted apoptosis of tumor cells compared to TMP or PTX treatment alone. Moreover, TMP augmented the antitumor effects of PTX in ovarian cancer A2780 xenograft mouse models by significantly decreasing tumor burden and partially decreasing the toxicity of PTX, as evidenced by the decreased expression of proliferation and angiogenesis markers as well as the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and biochemical indexes assay. Overall, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the efficacy of combining of potent molecules present in traditional Chinese medicine with chemotherapeutic drugs for therapeutic intervention in cancer.

Exposure to MeHg has been shown to associate positively with some chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanism is poorly characterized. MeHg had been shown to affect prostaglandin (PG) regulations in in vitro studies, but neither in vivo nor human studies investigating the effects of MeHg on PG regulations has been reported. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the association between MeHg exposure and serum PG concentrations in a cross-sectional study among human adults followed by a validation investigation on the cause-effect relationship usin a rat model. First a total of 121 women were recruited from two cities: Wanshan and Leishan in Guizhou, China. Statistical analysis of the human data showed a positive association between blood total mercury (THg) levels and serum concentrations of PGF2α, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, and PGE2 after adjusting for site effects. In the animal study, adult female Sprague?Dawley rats were dosed with 40 μg MeHg/kg body weight/day for 12 weeks. Serum 15-deoxy-PGJ2 and 2,3d-6-keto-PGF1α concentrations were found to increase significantly after 6 and 10 weeks of MeHg dosing, respectively, while serum PGF2α concentration increased significantly after 12 weeks of MeHg dosing. Combined results of our human and rat studies have shown that chronic MeHg exposure induced dysregulation of PG metabolism. As PGs are a set of mediators with very diverse functions, its abnormal production may serve as the missing mechanistic link between chronic MeHg exposure and various kinds of associated clinical conditions including neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases. ? 2019 American Chemical Society",,"Cardiology; Mercury compounds; Rats; Abnormal production; Cardio-vascular disease; Cause-effect relationships; Clinical conditions; Cross-sectional study; Neurodegeneration; Population studies; Serum concentration; Sprague-Dawley rats; Neurodegenerative diseases; 15 deoxy delta12,14 prostaglandin J2; 6 oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha; leukotriene A4; mercury; methylmercury; prostacyclin; prostaglandin; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2 alpha; thromboxane A2; thromboxane B2; mercury; methylmercury derivative; prostaglandin; bioaccumulation; experimental study; metabolism; methylmercury; organic compound; physiological response; pollution effect; pollution exposure; rodent; serum; blood; cardiovascular disease; concentration (composition); laboratory method; toxicity; animal experiment; animal model; arachidonic acid metabolism; Article; blood level; China; controlled study; female; hormone metabolism; human; liquid chromatography; long term exposure; maternal plasma; metabolomics; nonhuman; normal human; population research; prostaglandin blood level; prostaglandin release; rat; adult; animal; cross-sectional study; environmental monitoring; Oryza; Sprague Dawley rat; China; Guizhou; Wanshan; Animalia; Pisces; Rattus; Adult; Animals; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Oryza; Prostaglandins; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2-s2.0-85069267172

We evaluate if themes of #pneumonia tweets were associated with retweet frequency. Methods: A total of 28 181 original #pneumonia tweets were retrieved (21 November 2016), from which six subcorpora, 1 mo before and 1 mo after WPD 2011-2016, were extracted (n=6721). Underlying topics were identified via latent Dirichlet allocation and were manually coded into themes. The association of themes with retweet count was assessed via multivariable hurdle regression. Results: Compared with personal experience tweets, tweets that both raised awareness and promoted intervention were 2.62 times as likely to be retweeted (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.62 [95% 1.79 to 3.85]) and if retweeted had 37% more retweets (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.37 [95% CI 1.06 to 1.78]). Tweets that raised concerns about vaccine price were twice as likely to be retweeted (aOR 2.29 [95% CI 1.36 to 3.84]) and if retweeted, had double the retweet count (aPR 2.05 [95% CI 1.27 to 3.29]) of tweets sharing personal experience. Conclusions: The #pneumonia tweets that both raised awareness and promoted interventions and those discussing vaccine price were more likely to engage users than tweets about personal experience. These results help health professionals craft WPD messages that will engage the audience. ? 2018 The Author(s).",health communication; health marketing; machine learning; manual coding; social media,vaccine; awareness; commercial phenomena; economics; health promotion; human; interpersonal communication; odds ratio; pneumonia; procedures; social marketing; social media; Awareness; Commerce; Communication; Health Promotion; Humans; Odds Ratio; Pneumonia; Social Marketing; Social Media; Vaccines,2-s2.0-85069262104

Our objective was to examine the association of drinking patterns with changes in physical and mental well-being across populations. METHODS: We conducted a multilevel analysis with multivariate responses in the population-representative FAMILY Cohort in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, to examine the association between alcohol drinking patterns across 2 waves (2009–2013) (i.e., quitters, initiators, persistent drinkers, persistent former drinkers and lifetime abstainers) and changes in physical and mental well-being (Physical and Mental Component Summary of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]). Analyses were stratified by sex. We validated findings using a nationally representative cohort in the United States, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 2001–2005). RESULTS: In the FAMILY Cohort (n = 10 386; median follow-up 2.3 yr), the change in mental well-being was more favourable in female quitters than in lifetime abstainers (β = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 2.45; mean score change of +2.0 for quitters and +0.02 for lifetime abstainers). This association was validated in the NESARC (n = 31 079; median follow-up 3.1 yr) (β = 0.83, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.58; mean score change of –1.1 for quitters and –1.6 for lifetime abstainers). INTERPRETATION: The change in mental well-being was more favourable in female quitters, approaching the level of mental well-being of lifetime abstainers within 4 years of quitting in both Chinese and American populations. ? 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors",,adult; aged; alcohol abstinence; alcohol consumption; Article; behavior change; cohort analysis; controlled study; drinking behavior; evidence based medicine; family study; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; physical well-being; population research; psychological well-being; quality of life; scoring system; Short Form 12; United States; validation study; wellbeing,2-s2.0-85068888355

Big Data in health care are defined as large datasets that are collected routinely or automatically, and stored electronically. With the rapidly expanding volume of health data collection, it is envisioned that the Big Data approach can improve not only individual health, but also the performance of health care systems. The application of Big Data analysis in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology research has also opened new research approaches. While it retains most of the advantages and avoids some of the disadvantages of traditional observational studies (case-control and prospective cohort studies), it allows for phenomapping of disease heterogeneity, enhancement of drug safety, as well as development of precision medicine, prediction models and personalized treatment. Unlike randomized controlled trials, it reflects the real-world situation and studies patients who are often under-represented in randomized controlled trials. However, residual and/or unmeasured confounding remains a major concern, which requires meticulous study design and various statistical adjustment methods. Other potential drawbacks include data validity, missing data, incomplete data capture due to the unavailability of diagnosis codes for certain clinical situations, and individual privacy. With continuous technological advances, some of the current limitations with Big Data may be further minimized. This review will illustrate the use of Big Data research on gastrointestinal and liver diseases using recently published examples. ?The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Here, a prevention-oriented natural history of distress is proposed, derived from developments in our understanding of the evolution and decay of CRPD. Methods: The literature indicates that at least four classes or natural histories of CRPD are identifiable. These are described in the context of prevention-oriented activities in psycho-oncology: (1) CRPD in persons with good coping resources, resulting from reaction to the diagnosis and treatment lifestyle disruption, which is largely self-limiting and preferably self-managed; (2) CRPD arising from residual, or late effects of disease or treatment, potentially persistent and debilitating; (3) CRPD in persons with preexisting coping difficulties; and (4) CRPD arising from existential issues such as mortality and fear of recurrence. Results: It is hypothesized that different natural histories of CRPD display different evolution, indicating potential causal processes, treatment priorities, and preventive strategies. In particular, the effective management of residual symptoms is crucial to prevent CRPD chronicity. Optimal patient involvement in treatment decision-making is also required. Conclusions: There is a need to develop methods to differentiate if, early in the illness trajectory, the distressed patient is not able to self-manage the stress of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Not all distressed patients want or need help, and addressing just the CRPD may be inadequate where unresolved residual symptoms prevent renormalization after treatment.

Both messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) may be differentially expressed between the sexes in different physiological conditions, and both may be differentially regulated between males and females. Using whole transcriptome data on lymphoblastoid cell lines from 338 samples of European origin, we tried to uncover genes differentially expressed between the two sexes and sex-interacting expression quantitative trait loci (ss-eQTLs). Two miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between the two sexes, both of which were found to be functionally implicated in breast cancer. Using two stage linear regression analysis, 21 mRNA ss-eQTL and 3 miRNA ss-eQTLs were discovered. We replicated two of the mRNA ss-eQTLs (p < 0.1) using a separate dataset of gene expression data derived from monocytes. Three mRNA ss-eQTLs are in high linkage disequilibrium with variants also found to be associated with sexually dimorphic traits. Taken together, we believe the ss-eQTLs presented will assist researchers in uncovering the basis of sex-biased gene expression regulation, and ultimately help us understand the genetic basis of differences in phenotypes between sexes. ? 2019 Shen, Wang and Yang.

Milk consumption has greatly increased in endemic regions of NPC. We investigated the association between NPC and milk consumption across life periods in Hong Kong. Methods: A multicentre case-control study included 815 histologically confirmed NPC incident cases and 1,502 controls who were frequency-matched on age and sex at five major hospitals in Hong Kong in 2014-2017. Odds ratios (ORs) of NPC (cases vs. controls) for milk consumption at different life periods were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for sex, age, socioeconomic status score, smoking and alcohol drinking status, exposure to occupational hazards, family history of cancer, IgA against Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen, and total energy intake. Results: Compared with abstainers, lower risks of NPC were consistently observed in regular users (consuming ?5 glasses of milk [fresh and powdered combined] per month) across four life periods of age 6-12 (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54-0.86), 13-18 (0.68, 0.55-0.84), 19-30 (0.68, 0.55-0.84), and 10 years before recruitment (0.72, 0.59-0.87). Long-term average milk consumption of ?2.5, >2.5, and ?12.5, >12.5 glasses per month yielded adjusted OR (95% CI) of 1.00 (0.80-1.26), 0.98 (0.81-1.18), 0.95 (0.76-1.18), and 0.55 (0.43-0.70), respectively (all P-values for trend <0.05). Conclusion: Consumption of milk across life periods was associated with lower risks of NPC. If confirmed to be causal, this has important implications for dairy product consumption and prevention of NPC. Copyright ? 2019 Mai, Lin, Ngan, Kwong, Ng, Ng, Yuen, Ip, Chan, Lee, Ho, Lung and Lam.

As such, the law and practice of conditional discharge would most likely infringe patients' fundamental rights to private and family life and to liberty and personal security.

However, the underpinnings of the dysregulation of CRs and their downstream effectors remain to be elucidated. Results: Here, we designed an integrated framework based on multi-omics data to identify candidate master regulatory CRs affected by genomic alterations across eight cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Most of them showed consistent activated or repressed (i.e. oncogenic or tumor-suppressive) roles in cancer initiation and progression. In order to further explore the insight mechanism of the dysregulated CRs, we developed an R package ModReg based on differential connectivity to identify CRs as modulators of transcription factors (TFs) involved in tumorigenesis. Our analysis revealed that the connectivity between TFs and their target genes (TGs) tended to be disrupted in the patients who had a high expression of oncogenic CRs or low-expression of tumor-suppressive CRs. As a proof-of-principle study, 14 (82.4%) of the top-ranked 17 driver CRs in liver cancer were able to be validated by literature mining or experiments including shRNA knockdown and dCas9-based epigenetic editing. Moreover, we confirmed that CR SIRT7 physically interacted with TF NFE2L2, and positively modulated the transcriptional program of NFE2L2 by affecting ?64% of its TGs.

Incident diabetes was ascertained using electronic medical records. Serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline and its association with incident diabetes was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional-hazard regression.Participants:Individuals (n 4342) aged 20 years or above (1395 men, 2947 women; mean age 54·3 (sd 16·5) years) from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study, who were free of diabetes at baseline, were included.Results:During 40 124·7 person-years of follow-up (a median of 9·2 years), 443 participants developed diabetes. Mean 25(OH)D was 63·34 (sd 13·07) nmol/l. Age-, sex- and BMI-adjusted Cox proportional-hazard regression showed no significant difference in the risk of incident diabetes between the lowest and the highest quintiles of 25(OH)D. In the analysis of the interaction effect between 25(OH)D and serum Ca, the interaction term did not affect the risk of incident diabetes significantly (P = 0·694). Similarly, there was no significant interaction of different subgroups (age, sex, BMI, femoral-neck T-score, serum Ca levels) with serum 25(OH)D.Conclusions:The present study finds that serum vitamin D level is not associated with the risk of incident diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese and this relationship is not modified by serum Ca level. ?

Accurate molecular genetic diagnosis can improve clinical management, provides appropriate genetic counseling and testing of relatives, and allows potential therapeutic trials. Objective: To establish the clinical utility of panel-based whole exome sequencing (WES) in NMDs in a population with children and adults with various neuromuscular symptoms. Methods: Clinical exome sequencing, followed by diagnostic interpretation of variants in genes associated with NMDs, was performed in a cohort of 396 patients suspected of having a genetic cause with a variable age of onset, neuromuscular phenotype, and inheritance pattern. Many had previously undergone targeted gene testing without results. Results: Disease-causing variants were identified in 75/396 patients (19%), with variants in the three COL6-genes (COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3) as the most common cause of the identified muscle disorder, followed by variants in the RYR1 gene. Together, these four genes account for almost 25% of cases in whom a definite genetic cause was identified. Furthermore, likely pathogenic variants and/or variants of uncertain significance were identified in 95 of the patients (24%), in whom functional and/or segregation analysis should be used to confirm or reject the pathogenicity. In 18% of the cases with a disease-causing variant of which we received additional clinical information, we identified a genetic cause in genes of which the associated phenotypes did not match that of the patients. Hence, the advantage of panel-based WES is its unbiased approach. Conclusion: Whole exome sequencing, followed by filtering for NMD genes, offers an unbiased approach for the genetic diagnostics of NMD patients. This approach could be used as a first-tier test in neuromuscular disorders with a high suspicion of a genetic cause. With uncertain results, functional testing and segregation analysis are needed to complete the evidence. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Pathways triggered by ER stress are protective at early stages and initiate apoptosis when the damage is extensive. Methods: We have previously reported that oxyresveratrol rescues cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis in a cell culture model of PD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the neuroprotective mechanism of oxyresveratrol extends to PD-associated ER stress. For this purpose, we employed two cellular models; to induce severe ER stress, Mes23.5 cells were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and for ER stress driven by chaperones, human neuroblastoma cells were stably transfected to overexpress familial mutants of α-synuclein (α-syn). Results: Our results indicate that oxyresveratrol exhibits distinct modes of protection in both models. In the 6-OHDA model, it inhibited the transcription of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which controls the fate of pro-apoptotic proteins. On the other hand, in the α-syn model, oxyresveratrol suppressed mutant A30P oligomer formation, thereby facilitating a reduction of the ER-chaperone, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78). Discussion: In summary, oxyresveratrol is protective against ER stress induced by two different triggers of PD. Owing to its wide range of defense mechanisms, oxyresveratrol is an ideal candidate for a multifactorial disease like PD. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",6-OHDA; ER stress oxyresveratrol; Parkinson’s disease; α-synuclein,,2-s2.0-85066072913

The loss of essential genetic information causes abortive viral replication, which can be rescued by co-infection with a helper virus that possesses an intact genome. Despite reports of DI particles present in seasonal influenza A H1N1 infections, their existence in human infections by the avian influenza A viruses, such as H7N9, has not been studied. Here we report the ubiquitous presence of DI-RNAs in nasopharyngeal aspirates of H7N9-infected patients. Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing was first applied and long-read sequencing analysis showed that a variety of H7N9 DI-RNA species were present in the patient samples and human bronchial epithelial cells. In several abundantly expressed DI-RNA species, long overlapping sequences have been identified around at the breakpoint region and the other side of deleted region. Influenza DI-RNA is known as a defective viral RNA with single large internal deletion. Beneficial to the long-read property of SMRT sequencing, double and triple internal deletions were identified in half of the DI-RNA species. In addition, we examined the expression of DI-RNAs in mice infected with sublethal dose of H7N9 virus at different time points. Interestingly, DI-RNAs were abundantly expressed as early as day 2 post-infection. Taken together, we reveal the diversity and characteristics of DI-RNAs found in H7N9-infected patients, cells and animals. Further investigations on this overwhelming generation of DI-RNA may provide important insights into the understanding of H7N9 viral replication and pathogenesis. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

Methods: The CEUS was performed to detect the liver function and the prognosis of patients. The expression of Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining. Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin mRNA expression was measured by SYBR green qPCR assay. Results: We found that the mRNA and protein expression of Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin in the HCC tissues were significantly upregulated compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Upregulation of these proteins was associated with tumor differentiation, TNM stage, tumor size, vascular invasion and liver cirrhosis of HCC patients. In addition, we found that decreased time to peak and washout time and increased peak intensity and area under the curve of CEUS in the HCC were also correlated with TNM stage, tumor size and vascular invasion. Moreover, Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin protein were significantly associated with the TTP, PI, AUC, and WOT. Conclusion: This study suggests that quantitative parameters of CEUS and Sall4/Wnt/ β-catenin signaling may be helpful for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of HCC patients. ? 2019 Wang et al.",Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography; Early diagnosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Sall4; Wnt signaling,beta catenin; messenger RNA; RNA; spalt like transcription factor 4; transcription factor; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cancer staging; cancer tissue; clinical feature; contrast-enhanced ultrasound; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver function; liver parenchyma; major clinical study; male; polymerase chain reaction; prognosis; protein expression; RNA extraction; signal transduction; tumor differentiation; tumor volume; upregulation,2-s2.0-85065514998

Using the mixture representation of the CALD, we establish the joint hierarchical likelihood of the model and achieve the iterative weighted least square estimators of unknown parameters via the MCEM (Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization) algorithm.

Additionally, fracture patients with osteoporosis usually need longer time to healing. In order to promote bone remodeling and reduce the healing time, different growth factors and other peptides as well as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), vascular endothelial growth factors, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) had been administration locally via the biomaterials to promote bone regeneration. Abaloparatide, one of the analog of human parathyroid hormone, was approved by FDA in 2017 in postmenopausal women suffered with osteoporosis. When compared to teriparatide, abaloparatide had similar anabolic effects but had fewer effects on bone resorption. More importantly, the risk of hypercalcemia, the most severe side effects caused by PTH related protein, are lower in patients received abaloparatide treatment versus teriparatide. Gelatin as a denatured form of the protein collagen has no antigenity and can be resorbed completely in vivo. Gelatin modified by chemical grafting has a wider range of applications, especially for the delivering of genes and drugs. Methacrylate gelatin (GelMA) which was modified by methacrylic (MA) has better plasticity and mechanical properties. 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) can be used as photoinitiator to initiate the GelMA hydrogel formation.

Previous research shows that brush Chinese calligraphy handwriting (CCH) improves one’s cognitive functions as well as emotional and mental health. Similarly, Guqin, the popular Chinese musical instrument, induces positive emotions and emotional stability. The present study tested the efficacy of using the index finger to achieve similar mind–body changes. Methods. We employed a heart rate variability (HRV) Calligraphy–Guqin biofeedback intervention that was implemented with a Zephyr HxM Bluetooth chest heart rate monitoring device and an Android smartphone. A web-based HRV big database app stored the data from three consecutive sessions: (1) 5 min of Guqin music listening; (2) 5 min of CCH finger writing of calligraphy; and (3) again 5 min of Guqin music listening. The second session was designed to explore additive effects of the finger-writing task. One subject participated with the index finger employed for the writing task. Results. The results showed that the first and third Guqin sessions elicited 55% and 68% HRV coherences, respectively, while the CCH finger writing in the second session elicited 31% of high HRV coherence. The increase in HRV coherence between the two Guqin sessions was attributed to the calligraphy finger writing training effect. The practice of finger writing contributed to increased HRV regulation through heightened attention and concentration. ? 2019.

Increasing evidence shows that microRNAs targeting Dkk-1 might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases. We aim to investigate alterations in expression of miRNAs targeting Dkk-1 in AS patients in this study. Material and methods: The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 20 AS patients and 20 normal controls were collected in our study. Three miRNAs targeting DKK1 including miR-29a, miR-335, and miR-363 were selected and quantitative real-time PCR was used to identify the expression of the three miRNAs in these samples. Correlation analysis was conducted between altered miRNA expression and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Function Index (BASFI), and mSASSS (modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score). Results: The expression of miR-29a was significantly higher in AS patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.01), while no significance was observed in the expression of miR-335 and miR-363 between AS patients and healthy controls (p > 0.05).

Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) in adolescents is associated with having negative psychological impact and impairment to quality of life. A literature review revealed that most studies on the impact of CHD on the psychological well-being and quality of life of adolescents to date have been conducted in Western populations. Method: A cross-sectional design was employed. Adolescents aged 12–18 with CHD attending an outpatient clinic in an acute public hospital were invited to participate. Another similar age group of healthy Chinese adolescents was also invited to participate for comparison purposes. Subjects were asked to respond to the Chinese version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and a demographic sheet. A STROBE checklist was completed. Results: Adolescents with CHD exhibited more depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem and poorer quality of life than their healthy counterparts. Disease severity might affect the self-esteem, depressive symptoms and quality of life of adolescents with CHD. Disease severity, depressive symptoms, self-esteem level and types of treatment received were associated with the quality of life of adolescents with CHD. Conclusions: Hong Kong Chinese adolescents suffering from CHD experience negative impacts on their psychological well-being and quality of life. In this group, disease severity may affect psychological well-being and quality of life. Specifically, quality of life of adolescents with CHD was associated with disease severity, depressive symptoms, self-esteem level and the type of treatment received. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings contribute to clinical care guidelines and serve as a reference in developing nursing intervention to adolescents with CHD so as to uphold quality of care.

Methods: In the new criteria (noninvasive score, NIS) set, classification as “definite SS” is based on the ocular and oral symptoms and signs, autoantibodies and the existence of autoimmune thyroid disease, which were calculated. Patients with a score ?5 were classified as having definite SS and patients with a score <4 were supposed to be excluded from SS. For the patients with a score of 4, LSGB was suggested. Result: 76 patients with suspected SS were recruited between April 2013 and September 2014, 42 of which were definitive diagnosis of SS and 34 were excluded from SS. Sensitivity and specificity for the NIS criteria in the diagnosis of SS were 97.6% and 94.1%, respectively. The Negative Predictive Value (NPV) and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) to detect SS were 97.0% and 95.3% respectively, and the diagnostic accuracy was 96.1%. The area under the ROC curves (AUC; 95% CI) for NIS criteria was 0.959 (0.905-1.000), which performed better than the American-European Consensus Group’s (AECG) criteria and LSGB in the diagnosis of SS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The NIS criteria are an alternative to the AECG criteria in classification diagnosis of SS, which are with high diagnostic efficiency. We recommend using a score <4 and ?5 to rule out or to diagnose SS respectively. For the patients with a score of 4, LSGB is necessary and able to diagnose SS. ? 2019 Jinquan Yu.",Classification criteria; Diagnosis; Noninvasive; PPV; Score; Sj?gren's syndrome,antinuclear antibody; autoantibody; centromere antibody; double stranded DNA antibody; extractable nuclear antigen antibody; La antibody; rheumatoid factor; Ro antibody; RO52 antibody; Sm antibody; unclassified drug; adult; aged; antibody titer; Article; autoimmune thyroiditis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence; major clinical study; male; non invasive measurement; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; salivary gland biopsy; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; Sjoegren syndrome,2-s2.0-85064633878

In existing studies, different diffusive metric maps [B0, fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) maps] have been involved in the segmentation of tissues of the cervical spinal cord. The selection of a diffusive metric map for segmentation may affect the accuracy of segmentation and then affect the validity and effectiveness of the extracted diffusive features. However, there are few discussions on this problem. Therefore, this study would like to examine the effect of segmentation based on different diffusive metric maps for DTI analysis of the cervical spinal cord. Methods: Twenty-nine healthy subjects and thirty patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) were finally included in this study. All subjects accepted DTI scanning at cervical levels from C2 to C7/ T1. For healthy subjects, all cervical levels were included for analysis; while, for each patient, only one compressed cervical level was included. After DTI scanning, DTI metrics including B0, FA, AD, radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated. The evaluation was performed to B0, FA and AD maps from two aspects. First, the accuracy of segmentation was evaluated via a comparison between segmentation based on each diffusive metric map and segmentation based on an average image, which was acquired by averaging B0, FA, AD, RD and MD maps. The segmentation was achieved by a semi-automatic segmentation process, and the similarity between two segmentation results was denoted by the intersection of the union (IOU). Second, the diversity of extracted diffusive features was equalized as their performance in the classification of image pixels of different regions of interest (ROIs) and then was evaluated by mutual information (MI) and area under the curve (AUC). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post hoc tests were applied to compare the evaluation results. Results: One-way ANOVA suggested that there were differences (P<0.001) in IOU, MI and AUC values among the three diffusive metric maps for both healthy subjects and patients. The post-hoc tests further indicated that FA performed the best (P<0.001), i.e., the most substantial accuracy of segmentation and the highest diversity in extracted diffusive features. Conclusions: Different evaluation results had been observed for segmentation based on different diffusive metric maps, suggesting the necessity of selection of diffusive metric maps for segmentation in DTI analysis of the cervical spinal cord. Moreover, FA map is suggested for segmentation due to its best performance in the evaluation. ? Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

We extend the concept of status to the public sector to study how the different status of partners influences their collaboration. Through studying collaboration in the field of HIV/AIDS disease control in China from 2015 to 2017, we assess how status asymmetry (different-status partners) affects collaboration by comparing several dimensions of different-status organizations, including their structure, funding distribution, target population, and service category. We find that, through structure design, a collaboration between high- and low-status organizations improves health service delivery in the epidemic disease control process by providing more integrated health schemes. This article contributes to the body of knowledge on collaboration by studying the dynamic role of status, thereby helping practitioners better understand how to effectively manage collaboration with status asymmetry. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-85063569114

Both the Forkhead box (FOX) M1 transcription factor and the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor Pathway Substrate 8 (EPS8) are known to be activated by mitogenic signaling and their levels upregulated in cancer. Well-known to regulate Rac-mediated actin remodeling at the cell cortex, EPS8 carries a nuclear localization signal but its possible nuclear role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated interaction of FOXM1 with EPS8 in yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays. Immunostaining revealed co-localization of the two proteins during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. EPS8 became nuclear localized when CRM1/Exportin 1-dependent nuclear export was inhibited by Leptomycin B, and a functional nuclear export signal could be identified within EPS8 using EGFP-tagging and site-directed mutagenesis. Downregulation of EPS8 using shRNAs suppressed expression of FOXM1 and the FOXM1-target CCNB1, and slowed down G2/M transition in cervical cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated recruitment of EPS8 to the CCNB1 and CDC25B promoters. Taken together, our findings support a novel partnering role of EPS8 with FOXM1 in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and provides interesting insight into future design of therapeutic strategy to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.

A good understanding of the alignment of the two osseous columns and the lower leg of the ankle and foot complex is essential for evaluating the severity of clubfoot. The purposes of this study were to (1) develop an automated three-dimensional (3D) surface model of severe clubfoot based on two-dimensional (2D) slices of computed tomography (CT) images, (2) evaluate the alignment of foot bones relative to the ankle in severe clubfoot, and (3) examine the structural changes in the shape of the clubfoot. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-dimensional CT image was taken from a four-year-old child with a severe clubfoot. Subsequently, an automated and detailed 3D surface model of the severe clubfoot was developed from the 2D images by using MATLAB software programming. Then, the x, y, and z coordinate angles were automatically calculated for each bone in the foot relative to the ankle (lower end of the tibia) to determine the orientations and relationships among the bones. RESULTS: The relative position or orientation of each bone of the foot to the ankle of the severe clubfoot was objectively measured which was used to determine the orientation of each bone in the foot. Among the x, y, and z axes of the interested tarsal bones, the z axis represents the smallest moment of inertia, and the results showed that the bones in the x axis shifted medially with higher relative angle. CONCLUSIONS: This 3D objective measurement method for assessing clubfoot can be used to determine and classify the severity of clubfoot, as well as evaluate and monitor the progress of the clubfoot intervention based on the relative position of the tarsal bones. The method can also be used to quantify the relationship between the tarsal bones of the foot and lower end of the tibia. In addition, angular measurements can be used to assess other pathological conditions of the foot such as pes cavus and pes planus. ? 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

Methods: Data from adults (weighted n = 5136) who completed 2 × 24-h recalls and had complete data for BP, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed. Associations between percentage energy of FS from all food sources (%EFStotal), beverages only (%EFSbeverages), and non-beverages sources only (%EFSnon-beverages) and obesity measures and BP were examined using linear and non-linear regressions. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) of being classified as overweight and/or obese, having increased cardiometabolic risks, and elevated BP per 5% point increase in %EFStotal, %EFSbeverages, and %EFSnon-beverages. All regression analyses were adjusted for known socio-economic and lifestyle confounders. Results: %EFSbeverage was positively associated with BMI, WC, and WHtR (all p &lt; 0.05), while %EFSnon-beverage was inversely associated with these outcomes. Increases in odds of having an undesirable WC/WHtR were found with increasing %EFSbeverages (OR per 5% point increase in %EFSbeverages: 1.19 for WC; 1.23 for WHtR, both p &lt; 0.001). %EFStotal and %EFSnon-beverages were weakly and negatively associated with diastolic BP. A 5% point increase in %EFStotal and %EFSnon-beverage was associated with a 10–25% reduction in odds of having elevated BP. Conclusions: Our results suggested that only a higher FS intake from beverages may be associated with obesity, and higher FS intake was associated with reduced odds of having elevated BP. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Blood pressure; Diet quality; Free sugar; Obesity; Overweight,,2-s2.0-85062687524

Design: Prospective, cross-sectional study. Methods: Study and control subjects were recruited from the ophthalmology clinic of a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong over an 8-week period in 2013. A total of 80 eyes with NTG diagnosis and 155 healthy eyes randomly selected to be in the control group were included in the final analysis. All subjects underwent corneal biomechanical testing with the Oculus Corvis ST non-contact tonometer. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and central corneal thickness was conducted to assess the relationship between inward and outward applanation velocity and the risk of NTG. Secondary outcome variables included corneal applanation time, length, amplitude, and highest concavity. Results: Inward applanation velocity was faster in the NTG eyes (0.15 ± 0.02 m/s) than in the control eyes (0.14 ± 0.02 m/s) (P = 0.016). The odds ratio for a 0.01 m/s increase in inward applanation velocity when comparing NTG eyes with control eyes adjusted for age and central corneal thickness was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.30) (P = 0.016). There was no evidence that outward applanation velocity or any secondary corneal biomechanical variable differed between the NTG and control eyes.

The sinus volumes in bilateral CBCT images of healthy maxillary sinuses of patients aged 18 years or older were evaluated using dedicated 3D volumetric software. Differences in volume based on gender, age, sinus side, and dental status were analyzed statistically. The study included 174 healthy maxillary sinuses in 87 patients (60 women and 27 men) aged between 18 to 82 years with a mean age of 29.5 years. There were 73 dentate sinuses and 101 partially dentate or edentulous sinuses. Males had significantly larger maxillary sinus volumes compared to females. Subjects below the median age of 24.3 years had a significantly larger sinus volume than older subjects. There was no difference in sinus volume between left and right sides. When partially dentate and edentulous cases were pooled together and compared to dentate cases, there was no difference in sinus volume. Gender and age influence healthy maxillary sinus volume, while sinus side and dental status do not. Neither tooth loss nor increasing age could be correlated with ongoing pneumatization of the maxillary sinus in the present population. Thus, the reported increase of the maxillary sinus volume over life and following extraction of posterior teeth in the upper jaw might be considered a misconception. To prove this hypothesis, prospective studies comparing sinus volumes using standardized time intervals before and after tooth extraction in the posterior maxilla are needed. ? 2019 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.",,"adult; aged; Article; comparative study; cone beam computed tomography; controlled study; female; human; intrarater reliability; major clinical study; male; maxillary first premolar; maxillary sinus; measurement repeatability; nose mucosa; periodontal disease; prospective study; retrospective study; sex difference; tooth extraction; adolescent; age; anatomy and histology; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; maxillary sinus; middle aged; organ size; sex factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Humans; Male; Maxillary Sinus; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85061998784

The current treatment includes antibiotics but no surgery, debridement, prosthesis removal and joint fusion, prosthesis revision or amputation. Success in controlling infection may be less than 50% in implant revision. The overall risk of amputation is more than 20%. We believe that repeated debridement with antibiotic-laden cement wrap (ALCW) may be a reliable alternative for managing the megaprosthesis infection. The purposes of this article are to identify whether ALCW is an effective way of eradicating the megaprosthesis infection, the associated complications and the functional outcome after management by ALCW. Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with megaprosthesis infection. From January 2014 to June 2016, there were five patients with tumour megaprosthesis infection who had undergone the ALCW procedure. Ages ranged from 17 to 59 years of age. Male to female ratio was 4:1. The patients studied had humeral (1), proximal femoral (1), distal femoral (1) and proximal tibial (2) prostheses. All patients had follow-ups more than 1 year (21–52 months) after treatment. Results: All patients recovered from their implant infection and the implants were retained in all patients. There was no sign of infection in the most recent follow-up. One patient died of osteosarcoma recurrence. One patient had a large block of cement causing plastic insert dislodgement in the shoulder joint 1 year after surgery. Another patient with a dislocated hip cup had revision carried out in the final debridement. The most recent Musculoskeletal Tumor society (MSTS) scores ranged from 21 to 30. All patients were satisfied with their treatment. Conclusions: In this preliminary report of a small number of patients, ALCW has achieved 100% infection control. ALCW may be an easy and effective alternative for managing the megasprosthesis infection. The complications associated can be avoidable. The functional outcome is excellent. ?

High metabolic and proliferation rate of tumor cells further depletes the local oxygen supply. Therefore, hypoxia is a common phenomenon in multiple solid malignancies. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) regulate the transcription of a spectrum of genes, which are vitally important for tumor cell adaption under hypoxia, and shape the tumor microenvironment to become more favorable for progression. HIFs are involved in almost every step of cancer development through inducing angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, metastasis, cancer stemness maintenance, chemoresistance, and immune evasion.

However, data on effectiveness of the evidence-based combination pharmacotherapy (EBCP) is limited. Objectives To determine the effect of EBCP on mortality and Cardiovascular events in patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or cerebrovascular disease. Methods Publications in EMBASE and Medline up to October 2018 were searched for cohort and case-control studies on EBCP for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The main outcomes were all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events. Meta-analyses were performed based on random effects models. Results 21 studies were included. Comparing EBCP to either monotherapy or no therapy, the pooled risk ratios were 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.66) for all-cause mortality, 0.70 (0.62 to 0.79) for vascular mortality, 0.73 (0.64 to 0.83) for myocardial infarction and 0.79 (0.68 to 0.91) for cerebrovascular events. Optimal EBCP (all 4 classes of drug prescribed) had a risk ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.50 (0.40 to 0.64). This benefit became more dilute as the number of different classes of drug comprising EBCP was decreased—for 3 classes of drug prescribed the risk ratio was 0.58 (0.49 to 0.69) and for 2 classes, the risk ratio was 0.67 (0.60 to 0.76). Conclusions EBCP reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with CHD or cerebrovascular disease. The different classes of drugs comprising EBCP work in an additive manner, with optimal EBCP conferring the greatest benefit.

However, some western provinces with no human cases for more than 10 years have begun to report rabies cases, and all of the rabies lineages that circulated in western China were found in Inner Mongolia as well. In this study, we generated a phylogenetic tree with all the Inner Mongolia rabies strains available in GenBank and our laboratory, as well as strains from western China and representative viruses from neighboring countries, based on the N gene sequence. Furthermore, the possible relationships underlying the spread of the virus within Inner Mongolia and neighboring regions were analyzed. Three of six rabies lineages of China (China I-VI) were shown to exist in Inner Mongolia, and a spatial cluster analysis supported that the China I lineage, the dominant cluster of China, likely spread to Ningxia from Inner Mongolia. Wild raccoon dog rabies (China IV/Arctic-like-2) may have spread to Inner Mongolia from Russia and likely continued to spread to Qinghai and Tibet. The red fox lineage (China III/Cosmopolitan), which likely spread from Russia and Mongolia, has been shown to circulate in Inner Mongolia and was a serious threat to Xinjiang, which is adjacent to Inner Mongolia. Thus, Inner Mongolia likely became a location where national and international rabies viruses collected and developed into a potential portal for the spread of rabies to western China. To effectively control the spread of rabies in China, both prevention and control of dog and wild animal rabies in Inner Mongolia should be a top priority. ?

SUMMARY ANSWER Brief incubation of gametes does not improve the LBR of IVF when compared with standard incubation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Some small randomized studies showed that brief incubation was associated with a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate than standard incubation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This is a randomized triple blind study of 320 infertile women for their first or repeated cycles undergoing IVF between September 2015 and October 2016. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women were randomized into the brief incubation group (n = 160) or the standard incubation group (n = 160) according to a computer-generated randomization list. Oocytes were incubated with spermatozoa (0.3-1.2 million motile sperm/ml) for 3-4 h in the brief incubation group while oocytes were incubated with spermatozoa at similar concentration for 20 h in the standard incubation group. The primary outcome was the LBR (a baby born alive after 22 weeks gestation) in the fresh cycle. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE There was no significant difference in the LBR between the brief and standard incubation groups based on both intention-to-treat [33.0% (53/160) versus 36.8% (59/160), relative risk (RR) 0.898 (95% CI = 0.666-1.212), P = 0.482] and per protocol [41.4%(53/128) versus 41.0% (59/144), RR1.011 (95% CI = 0.760-1.343), P = 0.942] analyses. Clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and implantation rates were comparable for the two groups. Similar results were found with subgroup analysis of advanced maternal age, abnormal semen analysis and repeated IVF cycles. No differences were observed in cumulative LBR between two groups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Various motile sperm concentrations of 0.3-1.2 million per ml were used for insemination and the reactive oxygen species level in the insemination medium was not measured. The highest level at 1.2 million per ml is still relatively low compared to prior studies, therefore we do not know whether brief incubation can improve the LBR using higher concentrations of spermatozoa. The present sample size may not be adequate to detect a smaller difference in the LBR. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The present study demonstrated that a brief incubation of gametes had no significant beneficial effect on the LBR when compared with the standard incubation. The practice of brief incubation of gametes is not necessary and this can save the already tight manpower in many laboratories.

Despite extensive efforts, there is currently no formally approved vaccine and effective antiviral options against HRSV infection are limited. The development of vaccines and antiviral strategies for HRSV was partly hampered by the lack of an efficient lethal mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of the candidate vaccines or antivirals. In this study, we established a lethal HRSV mouse model by consecutively passaging a clinical HRSV isolate, GZ08-0. GZ08-18 was isolated from mouse bronchioalveolar lavage fluids at the 50th passage of GZ08-0. Importantly, all GZ08-18-inoculated mice succumbed to the infection by day 7 post infection, whereas all GZ08-0-inoculated mice recovered from the infection. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that GZ08-18 replicated to a higher titer in mouse lungs, induced more prominent lung pathology, and resulted in higher expression levels of a number of key pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ, MIP-1α, and TNF-α in comparison to that of GZ08-0. The cyclophosphamide pretreatment rendered the mice more susceptible to a lethal outcome with less rounds of virus inoculation. Full genome sequencing revealed 17 mutations in GZ08-18, some of which might account for the dramatically increased pathogenicity over GZ08-0. In addition, by using ribavirin as a positive control, we demonstrated the potential application of this lethal mouse model as a tool in HRSV investigations. Overall, we have successfully established a practical lethal mouse model for HRSV with a mouse-adapted virus, which may facilitate future in vivo studies on the evaluation of candidate vaccines and drugs against HRSV. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Genome mutation; Human respiratory syncytial virus; Lethal mouse model; Lung pathology,"antivirus agent; cyclophosphamide; gamma interferon; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; ribavirin; tumor necrosis factor; virus vaccine; antivirus agent; cyclophosphamide; ribavirin; animal experiment; animal model; antiviral therapy; Article; gene mutation; HEp-2 cell line; histopathology; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vivo study; inoculation; lung lavage; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory syncytial virus infection; virus culture; virus isolation; virus replication; virus strain; whole genome sequencing; aging; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell line; disease model; Human respiratory syncytial virus; lung; mortality; mutation; pathogenicity; pathology; physiology; respiratory syncytial virus infection; virology; virus genome; Aging; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Cell Line; Cyclophosphamide; Disease Models, Animal; Genome, Viral; Humans; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mutation; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Ribavirin; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85057775335

This study aims to investigate the tumor suppressive effects of TROP-2 in cervical cancer cells and to explain the underlying mechanisms. Methods: The tumor suppressive functions of TROP-2 in cervical cancer cells were examined by in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic functional assays. Downstream factors of TROP-2 were screened using Human Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Array. Small molecule inhibitors were applied to HeLa cells to test the TROP-2 effects on the oncogenicity of IGF-1R and ALK. Protein interactions between TROP-2 and the ligands of IGF-1R and ALK were detected via immunoprecipitation assay and protein-protein affinity prediction. Results: In vitro and in vivo functional assays showed that overexpression of TROP-2 significantly inhibited the oncogenicity of cervical cancer cells; while knockdown of TROP-2 exhibited opposite effects. Human Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Array showed that the activity of IGF-1R and ALK was stimulated by TROP-2 knockdown. Small molecule inhibitors AG1024 targeting IGF-1R and Crizotinib targeting ALK were treated to HeLa cells with and without TROP-2 overexpression, and results from cell viability and migration assays indicated that the oncogenicity of vector-transfected cells was repressed to a greater extent by the inhibition of either IGF-1R or ALK than that of the TROP-2-overexpressed cells. Immunoprecipitation assay and protein-protein affinity prediction suggested protein interactions between TROP-2 and the ligands of IGF-1R and ALK. Conclusions: Collectively, our results support that TROP-2 exhibits tumor suppressor functions in cervical cancer through inhibiting the activity of IGF-1R and ALK. ? 2018 The Authors",ALK; Cervical cancer; IGF-1R; TROP-2; Tumor suppressor,"3 bromo 5 tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzylidenemalononitrile; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; cisplatin; crizotinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; ligand; plasmid vector; protein; protein tyrosine kinase; short hairpin RNA; somatomedin C receptor; STAT3 protein; trop 2 protein; unclassified drug; ALK protein, human; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; cell adhesion molecule; IGF1R protein, human; MDK protein, human; midkine; somatomedin C; somatomedin receptor; TACSTD2 protein, human; tumor antigen; tumor suppressor protein; amino acid sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; binding affinity; cancer inhibition; carcinogenicity; cell migration; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; cell viability; cervical cancer cell line; controlled study; double stranded DNA break; down regulation; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; ligand binding; mouse; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; protein binding; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; tumor volume; TUNEL assay; upregulation; uterine cervix cancer; Western blotting; XTT assay; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; female; HeLa cell line; metabolism; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; uterine cervix tumor; Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase; Animals; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Proliferation; Female; HeLa Cells; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Mice; Midkine; Receptors, Somatomedin; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85056336349

To apply NLP to detect social media posts showing suicide risk, which is a rare event in regular population, is even more challenging. This paper tried different text mining methods to classify comments in Cantonese on YouTube whether they indicate suicidal risk. Based on word vector feature, classification algorithms such as SVM, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM are employed to detect the comments’ risk level. To address the imbalance issue of the data, both re-sampling and focal loss methods are used. Based on improvement on both data and algorithm level, the LSTM algorithm can achieve more satisfied testing classification results (84.3% and 84.5% g-mean, respectively).

The role of SIOPEL and Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration (CHIC) risk stratification was evaluated. Methods: Patients enrolled on the protocol from 1996 to 2014 were included. PRETEXT staging, SIOPEL, and CHIC risk groups were retrospectively assigned. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled with median age at diagnosis of 1.1 years and median follow-up time of 6.8 years. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was raised (>100?ng/mL) in 58 (97%) patients. Five (8%) had metastases at presentation and 7 (12%) experienced tumor rupture prior to or during treatment. Twenty-nine patients (48%) received a first-line cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine regimen only while 23 (38%) also had alternative chemotherapeutic agents. Hepatic resection could be performed in 48 (80%) patients. Three (5%) patients underwent upfront liver transplantation. Five-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 69.2%?±?6.1% and 77.6%?±?5.5% respectively. Among the 16 patients with relapse/progression, 9 had intrahepatic failure only, 5 had distant failure only, and 2 had combined local and distant failure. Predictors of inferior outcome included advanced Evans staging, disease involving both lobes, rupture, low AFP, and suboptimal response to first-line chemotherapy. Assigned in 44 patients, PRETEXT staging, SIOPEL, and CHIC risk groups significantly predicted EFS and OS. Conclusions: Although the consensus HB/HCC 1996 protocol led to cure in three-quarters of pediatric HB patients, an upfront risk stratification system is required to identify and improve the outcome of high-risk patients. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",hepatoblastoma; pediatric; pretreatment extent of disease; relapse; risk stratification,"alpha fetoprotein; APC protein; carboplatin; cisplatin; docetaxel; doxorubicin; etoposide; fluorouracil; ifosfamide; irinotecan; topotecan; vincristine; antineoplastic agent; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; child; consensus; event free survival; female; follow up; hepatoblastoma; high risk population; Hong Kong; human; liver failure; liver resection; liver transplantation; major clinical study; male; metastasis; multimodality cancer therapy; multiple cycle treatment; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; surgical margin; survival rate; treatment failure; treatment outcome; tumor regression; hepatoblastoma; infant; liver tumor; longitudinal study; mortality; pathology; preschool child; prospective study; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Child; Child, Preschool; Combined Modality Therapy; Consensus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatoblastoma; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85054193667

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the demographics, clinical presentation and treatment results of thoracolumbar SEDAVFs. Materials and methods Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched from January 2000 to January 2018 for articles on treatment of SEDAVFs. Pooled data of individual patients were analyzed for demographic and clinical features of SEDAVFs as well as treatment outcomes. Results There were 125 patients from 11 studies included. Mean age was 63.5 years. There was a male sex predilection (69.6%). Sensory symptoms including pain or numbness were the most frequently presenting symptoms. Fistula location was the lumbosacral spine in 79.2% and the thoracic spine in 20.8%. Involvement of intradural venous drainage was more common than extradural venous drainage only (89.6% vs 10.4%). Of the 123 treated patients, endovascular therapy was performed in 67.5% of patients, microsurgery in 23.6%, and combined treatment in 8.9%. The overall complete obliteration rate was 83.5% and did not differ between groups. Clinical symptoms improved in 70.7% of patients, were stable in 25%, and worsened in 1.7% with no difference between treatment modalities. Conclusions Thoracic and lumbosacral SEDAVFs often present with symptoms secondary to congestive myelopathy or compressive symptoms.

The dysphonic participants displayed significantly higher total score and subsection scores than the nondysphonic participants (P < 0.001). There were significant differences in total activity limitation scores and the total participation restriction scores between the two groups (P < 0.001). The cutoff point for screening between the two groups was 36.5, with a sensitivity of 76.80% and specificity of 80.30%. Conclusion: The MC-VAPP is a reliable and valid instrument for the evaluation of voice-related quality of life in Chinese-speaking individuals. It is also recommended that the MC-VAPP would be a useful tool for screening individuals with and without voice disorders based on the cutoff value of 36.5. ? 2019 The Voice Foundation",Dysphonia; Quality of life; Speech language pathology; Validation; Voice,adult; Article; cross-sectional study; disease severity; dysphonia; emotion; female; human; internal consistency; interpersonal communication; major clinical study; male; Mandarin (language); reliability; self concept; sensitivity and specificity; test retest reliability; validity; voice analysis; voice disorder; Asian continental ancestry group; dysphonia; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; validation study; young adult; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dysphonia; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85032739291

Organ-absorbed doses of pediatric patients undergoing DXA whole-body scan have been computer simulated using patient imaging parameters input to the Monte Carlo software PCXMC. Gender- and age-specific effective doses have been calculated with the simulated organ-absorbed doses using the ICRP-103 approach. The associated radiation-induced cancer risk, expressed as lifetime attributable cancer risk (LAR), has been estimated according to the method introduced in the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report. Mathematical fitting for effective dose and for LAR, as a function of age at exposure, has been analytically obtained to quantitatively estimate the cumulated effective dose and LAR for pediatric patients of US and Hong Kong population with repetitive DXA whole-body scan during their follow-up period. The effective dose of a single DXA whole-body scan for patients exposed at the age between 5 and 18 years was calculated as 8.47–17.68 ?Sv. The corresponding LAR for US and Hong Kong population was between the range of 4.57 × 10 ?7 and 7.14 × 10 ?7 . The cumulative effective dose of DXA whole-body scan for patients exposed annually at age between 5 and 18 years was calculated as 180 ?Sv for girls and 168 ?Sv for boys. The corresponding cumulative LAR for US and Hong Kong population was calculated as 3.77 × 10 ?6 to 5.48 × 10 ?6 . Girls would be at a statistically significant higher cumulated cancer risk than boys under the same whole-body DXA protocol (p = 0.03). The probability of cumulative LAR for pediatric populations undergoing annual DXA whole-body scan is regarded as minimal. We demonstrate the use of computer simulation and analytic formulation to quantitatively obtain the cumulated effective dose and cancer risk at any age of exposure, which are useful information for medical personnel to track patient radiation dose and to alleviate patients’ parents concern about radiation safety in repetitive whole-body scan using DXA. ? 2017 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry",Cumulative cancer risk; cumulative effective dose; DXA whole-body scan,adolescent; adult; Article; biological activity; cancer risk; child; clinical assessment; densitometry; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; ionizing radiation; male; pediatric patient; preschool child; priority journal; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation induced neoplasm; repetitive whole body scan; school child; United States; whole body scintiscanning,2-s2.0-85032228729

Herein, promoter methylation status of genes implicated in disease progression (CDKN2A and SHP1) and marrow escape (CDH1, CD56, and CXCR4) was studied in two patients with multi-focal extramedullary relapses. Patient 1 developed simultaneous chest wall and duodenal plasmacytoma at relapse. While SHP1 and CDKN2A were hypermethylated in both plasmacytomas, CDH1 hypermethylation was detected only in the chest wall. In patient 2, SHP1 methylation was found in the extradural plasmacytoma but not bone marrow (BM) at diagnosis, and the circulating PCs but not the BM at relapse. As the clonality, based on sequence of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the immunoglobulin gene, was conserved in plasma cells at diagnosis and relapse, differential methylation of CDH1 in patient 1 and SHP1 in patient 2 was an illustration of spatial epigenetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, subclonal epigenetic heterogeneity was identified by the presence of subclonal SHP1 promoter methylation within the chest wall plasmacytoma of patient 1. In summary, our data showed distinct promoter methylation profile of plasma cells from multiple regions.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional analysis of data from 601 parent-child dyads with children aged three to six years old was conducted. Parents completed questionnaires on child’s FV intake, parenting styles, parental feeding practices, family functioning, television viewing at mealtimes and frequency of family meals. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between various family factors and the likelihood of meeting the child’s daily FV recommendation with adjustment for different demographic variables. Findings: Multivariate model adjusting for sociodemographic data indicated that meeting vegetable recommendation was associated with lower frequency of dining with grandparents (Odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–0.99, p=0.031) and positively associated with parents using more desirable parental feeding practices (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09–1.21, p<0.001). Meeting fruit recommendation was associated with parents using more desirable parental feeding practices (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09–1.17, p<0.001), higher frequency of dining with grandparents (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00–1.10, p=0.041), lower frequency of dining with father (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.98, p=0.014) and higher score on authoritative parenting style (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.08, p=0.009). Originality/value: This study highlights the potential protective roles of various family factors, in particular authoritative parenting style and parental feeding practices, such as role modeling, moderate restrictive practices for less healthy foods, avoidance of forced feeding, and not using junk food as reward in relation to meeting FV recommendation in children. The role of grandparents in influencing the young children’s eating behaviors within the Chinese family warrants further investigation. ? 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Child fruit intake; Child vegetable intake; Family factors; Family feeding practice; Family meal frequency; Parenting style,article; avoidance behavior; child; child parent relation; Chinese; controlled study; cross-sectional study; enteric feeding; family functioning; father; feeding behavior; fruit; grandparent; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; junk food; male; meal frequency; preschool child; questionnaire; reward; television viewing; vegetable,2-s2.0-85056798400

We here intended to investigate the role of ApoA-1 in regeneration of small-for-size fatty liver graft and to explore the underlying mechanism. Methods: The association of ApoA-1 expression with liver regeneration was studied in rat liver transplantation models using small-for-size normal graft or small-for-size fatty graft. The direct role of ApoA-1 in liver regeneration was studied in mouse hepatectomy model in vivo and hepatocytes in vitro. Results: Compared to small-for-size normal graft, decreased expression of ApoA-1 associated with delayed regeneration were detected in small-for-size fatty liver graft after transplantation. In functional study, the expression of ApoA-1 was decreased in hepatocytes with steatosis and was inversely associated with the concentration of oleic acid. The ApoA-1 administration effectively attenuated hepatocytes steatosis and accelerated hepatocytes proliferation. In mouse model, ApoA-1 treatment promoted liver regeneration at day 2 after major hepatectomy. In addition, the treatment of ApoA-1 increased the expressions of PGC-1α and its target genes Tfam, Ucp2 and SDHB. Conclusions: ApoA-1 may accelerate regeneration of small-for-size fatty liver graft at day 2 after transplantation through regulating mitochondrial function. ApoA-1 may be the potential new therapy of promoting liver regeneration. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",ApoA-1; Graft injury; Liver regeneration; Liver steatosis; Liver transplantation,"apolipoprotein A1; mitochondrial transcription factor A; oleic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; succinate dehydrogenase; succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 2; apolipoprotein A1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell proliferation; controlled study; fatty liver; functional assessment; gene targeting; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell; liver function; liver graft; liver regeneration; liver resection; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; rat; animal; C57BL mouse; cell line; disease model; drug effect; fatty liver; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; liver; liver transplantation; metabolism; Animals; Apolipoprotein A-I; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Fatty Liver; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatectomy; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Liver Regeneration; Liver Transplantation; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Rats",2-s2.0-85056230121

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the knowledge, perceptions, and clinical experiences of molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) between general dental practitioners (GDPs) and paediatric dentists (PDs) in Hong Kong. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 557 randomly selected GDPs (approximately 25% of all registered dentists) and all registered PDs (n = 31) were invited. They were asked to complete a 4-section questionnaire adapted and modified from a study by Gambetta-Tessini and co-workers on sociodemographic profiles, knowledge, experience, and perceptions regarding MIH. Data were analyzed with chi-square, Fisher's exact, and multiple factor ANCOVA tests. Results: The overall response rate was 43.37% (255/588). Majority (74.1%) of the respondents encountered MIH in their practices. A significantly higher mean knowledge score (46.33 ± 7.1) was observed among PDs than GDPs (43.09 ± 7.0) (P < 0.01) and among PDs who are 40 years old or younger (P < 0.001). Differences in treatment of MIH were also observed between PDs and GDPs (P < 0.05). Paediatric dentists were more confident in diagnosing and treating MIH (P < 0.001). Most respondents (87.8%) expressed a need for continuing education on MIH. Conclusion: Continuing education on MIH is needed to assure that the highest quality of evidence-based care is given to patients with MIH. Dissemination of latest best evidence on MIH, especially to GDPs, will assure that the condition is accurately diagnosed and well managed. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Children; Dental practitioners; Disturbances in dental development; Molar incisor hypomineralization; Oral health care,"adult; analysis of covariance; article; child; clinical article; continuing education; controlled study; coworker; dental procedure; diagnosis; female; Hong Kong; human; incisor; male; pediatric dentist; perception; physician; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; tooth development; attitude to health; dentist; dentistry; enamel hypoplasia; Hong Kong; middle aged; Adult; Dental Enamel Hypoplasia; Dentists; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pediatric Dentistry; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85058492272

There was no information regarding the restriction of language or publication date. Study selection Four reviewers included both epidemiological and experimental clinical studies that investigated the presence of oral C. albicans in children (age < 6 years), with or without ECC. Studies including children with severe systematic diseases were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis Data were abstracted independently by four reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Meta-analysis was performed. The overall odds ratio of associations between the presence of C. albicans and ECC was calculated. Subgroup analysis on the different sample collection sites (plaque, swab and saliva) was performed. Results Fifteen cross-sectional studies were included for the qualitative assessment and nine studies for meta-analysis. Regarding the quality assessment, all included studies were rated as ‘fair’ or ‘good’. Children with the presence of oral C. albicans had 6.51 times as likely, to have ECC experience, compared to those without C. albicans (95% CI: 4.94–8.57, p<0.01). The odds of experiencing ECC in children with C. albicans versus those without C. albicans were 6.69 for plaque, 6.3 for oral swab, and 5.26 for salivary samples.

Moreover, previous publications indicating that different weight reduction extent might lead to various results. Thus, it is of importance to reassess the cardiovascular benefits of weight management strategies. Objectives: This review is designed to assess the association between weight loss and cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: Clinical trials including randomized control trials, observational studies reported a weight change before and after weight interventions including lifestyle intervention, as well as pharmacotherapies were included. Three major databases will be searched to retrieve the appropriate studies. Dual selection and abstraction of data will be conducted by 2 authors independently. The population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, study characteristics framework will be used to extract all the necessary data from included studies. The risk of bias assessment will be conducted in duplicate based on the Cochrane risk of bias guideline for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement for observational studies respectively. The primary outcomes will be the cardiovascular mortality, and the secondary outcomes are allcause mortality and new cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis will be considered if there is sufficient homogeneity among selected studies. Follow the criteria of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), the quality of the cumulative evidence will be evaluated. Resultsandconclusions: The results of this systematic review could provide reliable and concrete evidence for weight loss and its cardiovascular benefits.

Little is known about local EDs’ processes of care for sepsis, adoption of international recommendations, and the impact of the new Sepsis-3 definitions. Methods: Structured telephone interviews based on the United Kingdom Sepsis Trust ‘Exemplar Standards for the Emergency Management of Sepsis’ were conducted from January to August 2017 with nominated representatives of all responding public hospital EDs in Hong Kong, followed by a review of hospital/departmental sepsis guidelines by the investigators. Results: Sixteen of the 18 public EDs in Hong Kong participated in the study. Among various time-critical medical emergencies such as major trauma, sepsis was perceived by the interviewees to be the leading cause of in-hospital mortality and the second most important preventable cause of death. However, only seven EDs reported having departmental guidelines on sepsis care, with four adopting the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score or its modified versions. All responding EDs reported that antibiotics were stocked within their departments, and all EDs with sepsis guidelines mandated early intravenous antibiotic administration within 1 to 2 hours of detection. Reported major barriers to optimal sepsis care included lack of knowledge and experience, nursing human resources shortages, and difficulty identifying patients with sepsis in the ED setting. Conclusion: There are considerable variations in sepsis care among EDs in Hong Kong. More training, resources, and research efforts should be directed to early ED sepsis care, to improve patient outcomes. ? 2018 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.",,"aminoglycoside; antibiotic agent; bilirubin; carbapenem; cephalosporin; creatinine; dopamine; epinephrine; hemoglobin; lactic acid; macrolide; noradrenalin; oxygen; penicillin derivative; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; antiinfective agent; acute confusion; antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial guideline; Article; blood culture; blood pressure monitoring; cause of death; central venous pressure; computer assisted tomography; cross-sectional study; echocardiography; emergency health service; emergency ward; fluid resuscitation; health care personnel; health care survey; heart rate; hospital admission; hospital bed capacity; hospital mortality; human; hypotension; intensive care unit; oliguria; patient care; practice guideline; quality control; sepsis; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; sputum culture; telephone interview; treatment outcome; urinalysis; Hong Kong; hospital emergency service; interview; mortality; organ dysfunction score; practice guideline; public hospital; sepsis; standards; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Hong Kong; Hospital Mortality; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Organ Dysfunction Scores; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Sepsis",2-s2.0-85058474499

This study aimed to report the clinical and genetic characteristics of all young patients diagnosed with LQTS in the only tertiary paediatric cardiology centre in Hong Kong. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all paediatric and young adult patients diagnosed at our centre with LQTS from January 1997 to December 2016. The diagnosis of LQTS was established with a corrected QT interval (QTc) ?480 ms, Schwartz score of >3 points, or the presence of a pathogenic mutation. Results: Fifty-nine patients (33 males) from 52 families were included, with a mean age of 8.17 years (range, 0.00-16.95 years) at presentation. Five patients had concomitant congenital heart diseases. The mean follow-up duration was 5.33 ± 4.65 years. The mean QTc in the cohort was 504 ± 47 ms. They presented with syncope and convulsion (49%), cardiac arrest (10%), bradycardia and neonatal atrioventricular block (12%). Fifteen (25%) patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Thirty-eight (64.4%) patients were confirmed to have a pathogenic mutation for LQTS genes. Forty-five (76.3%) patients received beta blocker therapy. Thirteen (22.0%) patients required implantable cardioverter defibrillator. There was no mortality in the study period. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year breakthrough cardiac event–free rates were 93.0%, 80.7%, and 72.6%, respectively. Conclusion: Identification of the disorder, administration of beta blockers, and lifestyle modification can prevent subsequent cardiac events in LQTS. Genotyping in patients with LQTS is essential in guiding medical therapy and improving prognosis. ? 2018 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.",,"atenolol; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir2.1; metoprolol; mexiletine; nadolol; potassium channel KCNE1; potassium channel KCNE2; potassium channel KCNQ1; propranolol; sodium channel Nav1.5; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; adjuvant therapy; adolescent; adult; Article; bradycardia; cardiogenic shock; child; clinical feature; clinical outcome; congenital heart disease; congenital heart malformation; convulsion; electrocardiogram; faintness; Fallot tetralogy; female; gene; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic trait; genotype; heart arrest; heart atrium septum defect; heart ventricle arrhythmia; heart ventricle septum defect; human; KCNE1 gene; KCNE2 gene; KCNH2 gene; KCNJ2 gene; KCNQ1 gene; lifestyle modification; long QT syndrome; LQTS gene; major clinical study; male; missense mutation; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; next generation sequencing; patient compliance; pediatric cardiology; perception deafness; QT interval; QTc interval; retrospective study; SCN5A gene; seizure; sudden cardiac death; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; young adult; congenital heart malformation; electrocardiography; faintness; follow up; genetics; Hong Kong; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; infant; long QT syndrome; newborn; preschool child; prognosis; Adolescent; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Defibrillators, Implantable; Electrocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Defects, Congenital; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Long QT Syndrome; Male; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Syncope; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85058461935

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of critically ill adult patients with KDIGO Stage 3 AKI with or without RRT during ICU stay between 1/1/2011-31/12/2013. Cox regression analysis and propensity score matching methods were used to determine predictors for 90-day mortality. Results: Among 661 patients, 50.5% received RRT. The unadjusted 90-day mortality rate was 42.5% and 54.1% in patients who had or had not received RRT, respectively. After adjustment with propensity score based on the probability of receiving RRT, the cox regression analysis showed that RRT was associated with a lower 90-day mortality (p<0.001). Among 322 propensity-matched pairs, RRT was associated with lower ICU (23.6% vs. 39.8%, p=0.002), hospital (33.5% vs. 55.9%, p<0.001) and 90-day mortality (34.2% vs. 58.4%, p<0.001), and a higher 90-day renal recovery rate (57.8% vs. 45.3% full recovery, p=0.026) compared with no RRT. When an alternate propensity model was used, the benefits associated with RRT were very similar, except 90-day renal recovery became insignificant. Conclusion: Our observational study found that in critically ill patients with KDIGO Stage 3 AKI, RRT may be associated with lower 90-day mortality. The benefit of RRT on renal recovery was less prominent. Medical futility and practice variations may complicate study interpretation. To avoid these limitations, large-scale multicenter, non-observational study is recommended. ? 2017 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology",acute renal failure; clinical nephrology; continuous renal replacement therapy; haemodialysis,"albumin; bilirubin; creatinine; hemoglobin; hypertensive factor; potassium; acute kidney failure; aged; albumin blood level; APACHE; Article; artificial ventilation; bilirubin blood level; cohort analysis; continuous renal replacement therapy; controlled study; creatinine blood level; critically ill patient; diafiltration; disease course; disease severity; female; hemoglobin blood level; hospital mortality; human; hypovolemia; intensive care unit; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; mortality risk; observational study; platelet count; potassium blood level; priority journal; propensity score; renal replacement therapy; retrospective study; sepsis; survival rate; survivor; sustained low-efficiency dialysis; urine volume; acute kidney failure; convalescence; critical illness; disease exacerbation; middle aged; mortality; pathophysiology; risk assessment; risk factor; severity of illness index; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; Acute Kidney Injury; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Critical Illness; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Propensity Score; Recovery of Function; Renal Replacement Therapy; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85057478373

MSCs can evade immune rejection following allogeneic transplantation setting due to their downregulation of HLA Class II antigen. Therefore, we review the current understanding of using MSCs or MSC-conditioned media as treatment for various diseases. Recent Findings: (1) MSCs regulate the balance of Th17/Treg cells in autoimmune disease models, which is associated with complex interactions among different pro- or anti-inflammation cytokines. (2) With the nature of MSCs migrating to multiple tissues under various homing signals, we also found MSCs are widely used as cell vehicles for gene or chemokine delivery. Summary: MSCs or MSC-conditioned media therapies have been explored with advanced techniques. However, it still requires further investigations on (1) how MSCs respond to various microenvironments and (2) how to isolate, purify and expand enough MSCs ex vivo. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Autoimmune; Cell therapy; Delivery tool; Genetic modification; Mesenchymal stem cells; Paracrine,apoptin; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; chemokine receptor CXCR4; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; neurotrophin; prostaglandin E2; toll like receptor 3; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; allergic encephalomyelitis; antineoplastic activity; CRISPR-CAS9 system; degenerative disease; DNA modification; down regulation; gene editing; gene overexpression; gene therapy; glioblastoma; graft versus host reaction; histopathology; human; immunoregulation; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammatory bowel disease; mesenchymal stem cell; multiple sclerosis; neurologic disease; nonhuman; Notch signaling; priority journal; regeneration; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; stem cell transplantation; stroma cell; systemic lupus erythematosus; tissue repair; tumor microenvironment,2-s2.0-85056320147

When the estimated effect-site concentration at loss of consciousness is accurate, the difference between effect-site concentration at loss of consciousness and at recovery of consciousness should be small. This prospective, randomised, controlled trial was designed to compare this difference (effect-site concentration at loss of consciousness – effect-site concentration at recovery of consciousness) associated with the two techniques. Sixty-seven healthy patients undergoing elective hemithyroidectomy were recruited. Induction of anaesthesia was achieved using effect-site target-controlled infusion with the modified Marsh model and ke0 of 1.2?min?1. The median (IQR [range]) difference between effect-site concentration at loss of consciousness and recovery of consciousness was significantly lower in patients in the titration group at 1.2 (0.8–1.5 [0.1–2.9]) μg.ml?1 compared with the standard group 2.1 (1.9–2.6 [0.2–3.6] μg.ml?1; p?&lt;?0.0001).

In conclusion, using the modified Marsh pharmacokinetic model, the titration method for target-controlled infusion propofol at induction of anaesthesia allows closer matching of propofol concentration to depth of anaesthesia than the standard method. ? 2018 Association of Anaesthetists",general anaesthesia; propofol; target-controlled infusion; titration,"propofol; intravenous anesthetic agent; propofol; adult; anesthesia induction; anesthesia level; anesthesist; anesthetic recovery; Article; artificial ventilation; bispectral index; comparative study; consciousness level; controlled study; elective hemithyroidectomy; elective surgery; female; human; major clinical study; male; pilot study; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; thyroidectomy; unconsciousness; wakefulness; intravenous anesthesia; intravenous drug administration; middle aged; procedures; prospective study; Adult; Anesthesia, Intravenous; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Consciousness Monitors; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Male; Middle Aged; Propofol; Prospective Studies; Thyroidectomy",2-s2.0-85056182844

There was a lack of systematic review covering all fall-related injury or deaths to thoroughly summarise meteorological aspects of fall. This study aimed to systematically review epidemiological studies of fall and fall-related circumstances without restriction to hip fracture. A systematic search in three databases, namely PubMed, CINAHL Plus and EMBASE, was performed. Searches in two Chinese databases named the Wanfang Med Online and the China Journal Net were done in addition. A total of 29 studies were identified. The study site, fall cases identification, meteorological factors and findings of all the selected studies were being extracted. The quality of the studies was critically appraised. We identified some of the environmental risk factors to fall among those studies. Ranging from the lower ambient temperature, the presence of snow cover, seasonal factors, and time of the day to location of fall, these factors have different levels of impact related to higher incidence or mortality of fall. To conclude, a better understanding of injury mechanisms is a prerequisite for preventive interventions. ? 2018, ISB.",Fall; Meteorological factors; Temperature; Weather,falling; human; meteorological phenomena; statistics and numerical data; Accidental Falls; Humans; Meteorological Concepts,2-s2.0-85055957779

Methods: A prospective cohort study was carried out in acute general medical wards in a university-affiliated hospital in Hong Kong. Patients were assessed by the confusion assessment method by geriatricians within 6 h after admission and classified into three mutually exclusive groups, namely delirium, SSD and those without both conditions. Predisposing factors and precipitating factors of delirium and SSD were retrieved from collateral information, clinical charts and electronic clinical records. Results: A total of 575 patients with mean age of 80.8 years were recruited. A total of 73% of the patients did not have delirium, 15.8% of patients had delirium and 11.3% of patients had SSD. On multivariate analysis, patients with delirium or SSD were more likely to be current users of psychotropic medications, had hearing and visual impairment, had a major neurocognitive disorder as defined by the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and with a lower Barthel Index 20 points version than those without both conditions. Significant predisposing and precipitating factors of delirium included psychotropic medications, acute stroke and other causes of organic brain syndromes. Predisposing and precipitating factors of delirium and SSD were almost identical. Conclusions: Delirium and SSD are common among Chinese older adults with acute medical illnesses, with a combined prevalence of delirium and SSD of 27%. Important precipitating and predisposing factors include psychotropic medications, acute ischemic stroke and other causes of organic brain syndromes.

Design: Randomized controlled, participant-blind, parallel-group with subject recruitment after trial registry. Interventions: Sixty participants were randomized to receive 4-week once-weekly 1-hour hypnotherapy with disease-specific suggestions (using counter-hyperarousal hypnotic exercise and screen visualization technique targeted at insomnia-related anxieties) or generic suggestions (using thought distraction technique and suggestions for self-confidence and self-care enhancement). Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was sleep efficiency (SE) derived from 1-week sleep diary at weeks 4, 6 and 9. Secondary outcomes included other sleep-diary parameters, Insomnia Severity Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Sheehan Disability Index. Treatment expectancy, adverse events (AEs), and subjective experiences were obtained after hypnotherapy sessions 2 and 4. Results: Mixed linear modeling showed that time effect was significant for most variables. Within-group effect size of sleep-diary-derived SE from baseline to follow-up ranged from 0.70 to 0.90 for disease-specific suggestions (mean difference: 8.5–10.4%); for generic suggestions, it was 0.65–0.69 (mean difference: 6.8–8.3%); however, no significant between-group difference was found. Discontinuation rate was 10%, report of unpleasantness varied from 5.5 to 7.4%, while the incidence of AEs ranged from 37.0 to 51.8%, depending on session content. Conclusion: Hypnotherapy using disease-specific and generic suggestions produced similar improvements in sleep and daytime functioning. AEs were common but mostly mild. The finding raises doubts about the value of disease-specific suggestions in hypnotherapy for insomnia.

Mice were treated with inactivated (seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1 and H5N1) and vaccinia virus-based H5N1 live-attenuated vaccines in different combinations. Mice were then challenged by viruses of either Group 1 (H1N1) or Group 2 (H3N2, H7N7) influenza virus. All studied sequential 4-dose vaccinations could induce some degrees of heterosubtypic protection in mice.

Routine testing for the harmful pathogen Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) was suspended briefly during the foot and mouth disease epidemic of 2001 in Great Britain. Here we utilize bTB incidence data and mathematical models to demonstrate how a lapse in management can alter epidemiological parameters, including the rate of new infections and duration of infection cycles. Testing interruption shifted the dynamics from annual to 4-year cycles, and created long-lasting shifts in the spatial synchrony of new infections among regions of Great Britain. After annual testing was introduced in some GB regions, new infections have become more de-synchronised, a result also confirmed by a stochastic model. These results demonstrate that abrupt events can synchronise disease dynamics and that changes in the epidemiological parameters can lead to chaotic patterns, which are hard to be quantified, predicted, and controlled. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"bacterial disease; bacterium; disease control; disease incidence; epidemic; epidemiology; foot and mouth disease; infectious disease; synchrony; Article; bovine tuberculosis; disease duration; epidemiological data; Great Britain; incidence; infection rate; mathematical model; nonhuman; predictive value; stochastic model; wavelet analysis; animal; bovine; bovine tuberculosis; epidemic; epidemiological monitoring; isolation and purification; Markov chain; microbiology; Mycobacterium bovis; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical model; transmission; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Bovinae; Animals; Cattle; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemiological Monitoring; Incidence; Models, Statistical; Mycobacterium bovis; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Stochastic Processes; Tuberculosis, Bovine; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85050542398

Methods: This is a consecutive case series of all T-SPOT.TB positive latent TB patients with presumed tuberculous uveitis managed with anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2015. Patients with active TB or other known causes of uveitis, immunocompromised states and those followed up <?12?months were excluded. Descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing were performed, with a significance level of p?<?0.05 taken. Results: Among the 75 T-SPOT.TB tests performed for uveitis, 14 cases were enrolled. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in none of the sputum and intraocular samples. Most cases had posterior uveitis (10/14 cases, 71.4%) and/or intermediate uveitis (9/14 cases, 64.3%).

At 1?year, remission of uveitis was achieved in 92.9%, in which none of them recurred at the last follow-up. High-dose systemic steroid was required in 50% of patients. Only 1 patient was steroid dependent at 18?months. The BCVA improvement in patients treated with or without steroid was comparable. Conclusion: In a TB-endemic region with wide Bacille Calmette–Guerin vaccination coverage, ATT for immunocompetent uveitis patients with latent TB identified from T-SPOT.TB test can improve vision, induce long-term steroid-free remission, and prevent recurrence and systemic reactivation of TB in those who require steroid. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Diagnostic tests; Therapeutics; Tuberculosis; Uveitis,"ethambutol; isoniazid; prednisolone; pyrazinamide; rifampicin; streptomycin; glucocorticoid; tuberculostatic agent; adult; aged; anterior eye chamber; anti-infective therapy; Article; bacterium isolation; best corrected visual acuity; capillaritis; child; clinical article; clinical feature; drug efficacy; female; human; intermediate uveitis; iridocyclitis; laser coagulation; latent tuberculosis; male; middle aged; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; pars plana vitrectomy; remission; school child; sputum; steroid therapy; systemic therapy; tuberculous uveitis; uveitis; very elderly; young adult; aqueous humor; interferon gamma release assay; isolation and purification; latent tuberculosis; microbiology; ocular tuberculosis; procedures; treatment outcome; uveitis; vitreous body; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antitubercular Agents; Aqueous Humor; Child; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Interferon-gamma Release Tests; Latent Tuberculosis; Male; Middle Aged; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Sputum; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis, Ocular; Uveitis; Vitreous Body; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85029797349

Tuberculosis, one of the major causes of mortality, is initiated by the deposition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Accessory sequences shared by a subset of strains of a species play an important role in a species' evolution, antibiotic resistance and infectious potential. Results: Here, with a multiple sequence aligner, we segmented 25 P. aeruginosa genomes and 28 M. tuberculosis genomes into core blocks (include sequences shared by all the input genomes) and dispensable blocks (include sequences shared by a subset of the input genomes), respectively. For each input genome, we then constructed a scaffold consisting of its core and dispensable blocks sorted by blocks' locations on the chromosomes. Consecutive dispensable blocks on these scaffold formed instable regions. After a comprehensive study of these instable regions, three characteristics of instable regions are summarized: instable regions were short, site specific and varied in different strains. Three DNA elements (directed repeats (DRs), transposons and integrons) were then studied to see whether these DNA elements are associated with the variation of instable regions. A pipeline was developed to search for DR pairs on the flank of every instable sequence. 27 DR pairs in P. aeruginosa strains and 6 pairs in M. tuberculosis strains were found to exist in the instable regions. On the average, 14% and 12% of instable regions in P. aeruginosa strains covered transposase genes and integrase genes, respectively. In M. tuberculosis strains, an average of 43% and 8% of instable regions contain transposase genes and integrase genes, respectively. Conclusions: Instable regions were short, site specific and varied in different strains for both P. aeruginosa and M. tuberculosis. Our experimental results showed that DRs, transposons and integrons may be associated with variation of instable regions. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Deletion; Directed repeats; Dispensable genome; Homologous recombination; Insertion; Integrase; Pan-genome; Transposase,"integrase; transposase; integrase; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; chromosome; DNA responsive element; gene deletion; gene insertion; histogram; homologous recombination; integron; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; transposon; antibiotic resistance; bacterial genome; biology; DNA sequence; gene expression regulation; genetic recombination; genetics; human; metabolism; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; sequence alignment; transposon; Computational Biology; DNA Transposable Elements; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Gene Deletion; Genome, Bacterial; Humans; Integrases; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Recombination, Genetic; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2-s2.0-85056802463

Results: The hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause, CHD, and respiratory disease mortality for the highest decile of WBC count (women &gt; 8.2 × 109/L; men &gt; 8.8 × 109/L) was 1.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54, 2.17), 3.02 (95% CI 1.84, 4.98) and 2.52 (95% CI 1.49, 4.27), respectively, after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. The associations were similar when deaths during the first 2 years of follow-up were excluded. After further adjusting for pulmonary function, the highest decile of WBC count was associated with 90% higher risk of respiratory disease mortality (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08, 3.33). No evidence for an association between higher WBC count and cancer mortality was found. Sub-type analysis showed that only granulocyte count remained significantly predictive of all-cause, CHD, and respiratory disease mortality. Conclusions: Elevated WBC, specifically granulocyte, count was associated with all-cause, CHD and respiratory mortality in southern Chinese. Further investigation is warranted to clarify whether decreasing inflammation would attenuate WBC count associated mortality. ? 2018 The Author(s).",All-cause mortality; Cause-specific mortality; Granulocyte count; Prospective cohort study; White blood cell count,aged; biobank; cause of death; China; epidemiology; female; human; leukocyte count; male; middle aged; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Cause of Death; China; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies,2-s2.0-85056113875

Clomiphene is regarded as the first-line medical treatment for ovulation induction in PCOS patients and acupuncture is often used as an alternative and complementary treatment for fertility issues such as those associated with PCOS. The efficacy of acupuncture alone or combined with clomiphene still lacks strong supporting evidence. Factorial 2 × 2 designs can be used for the evaluations of two treatments within a single study, to test the main effects of acupuncture and clomiphene and their interactions. Methods: PCOSAct was designed to test the effect of clomiphene and acupuncture by three two-group comparisons in the original protocol. However, the trial was designed as a standard factorial trial and the factorial analysis approach for analyzing the data that were actually obtained during the trial was found to be more appropriate and more powerful than the three two-group comparisons described in the original protocol, so the statistical analysis approach and different datasets of PCOSAct in the primary publication were accordingly changed. Discussion: Although the statistical analysis approach used in the primary publication deviated from the statistical analysis planned in the study protocol, focusing on the main effects of the two interventions and their interactions was a more standard approach to a factorial trial and proved to be more suitable and consistent with the characteristics of the trial data. Statistically, the revision is more powerful and precise and should be more useful to the journal and the readers. Trial registration: Chinese clinical trial registry, ChiCTR-TRC-12002081.

Design A case-crossover study. Setting Cases were enrolled from the National Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Genetics in Amman, Jordan. Participants Patients were those with diabetes mellitus and reported incident of a hypoglycaemic event in their medical records during the period January 2007 to July 2017. Patients with multiple antidiabetic medications were those with at least two antidiabetic medications. Primary outcome History of antidiabetic medication use was extracted from the pharmacy records. The use of multiple antidiabetic medications during the risk window (before hypoglycaemia) was compared with a control window(s) (earlier time) of the same length after a washout period. Conditional logistic regression was applied to evaluate the OR of hypoglycaemia between the treatment groups. A secondary analysis was performed in patients with a blood glucose measurement of ?70 mg/dL. Results 182 patients (106 females, 58.2%) were included in the study with an average age of 59.9 years (SD=9.9). The patients' average body mass index was 31.7 kg/m 2 (SD=6.2). Compared with monotherapy, the OR of hypoglycaemic events for patients with multiple antidiabetic medications was 5.00 (95% CI 1.10 to 22.82). The OR was 6.00 (95% CI 0.72 to 49.84) for the secondary analysis patient group (n=94). Ten-fold increased risk was found in patients (n=155) with insulin and sulfonylurea-based combination therapy (OR 10.00;95% CI 1.28 to 78.12). Conclusion This study shows that the use of multiple antidiabetic medications appears to increase the risk of hypoglycaemic events. Patients and healthcare professionals should be extra vigilant when patients are on multiple antidiabetic medications therapy, especially the combination of sulfonylurea and insulin. ?

Thirty elite swimmers (mean age ± standard deviation = 23.1 ± 3.5 years) and 21 recreational swimmers (mean age ± standard deviation = 20.8 ± 2.1 years) participated in the study. Maximum muscle strength and time to maximum muscle strength of shoulder flexor, extensor, abductor, and adductor muscles were measured using a handheld dynamometer. Lean mass of the arms and body (excluding the head) were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Results revealed that compared with recreational swimmers, elite swimmers had higher maximum muscle strength of the shoulder flexor, extensor, abductor, and adductor muscles (all P < .001). The time to reach maximum muscle strength of all shoulder muscles showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). The lean mass values in the left arm (P = .037), right arm (P < .001), and whole body (P = .014) were higher in elite swimmers than recreational swimmers. Elite swimmers had greater shoulder maximum muscle strength compared with recreational swimmers though the time taken to reach maximum muscle strength was similar between the 2 groups. Elite swimmers also showed a higher lean mass in both arms and their entire body when compared with recreational swimmers. The results may be useful for recreational swimmers who intend to advance to professional level, and for talent identification and early development of elite swimmers. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

Methods: Consecutive patients with asymptomatic infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms who underwent endovascular repair were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a polymer-filled (n = 20) or self-expanding group (n = 42). Baseline characteristics, operative mortality and morbidity, and follow-up data were compared. Results: Aneurysm diameter, neck and iliac morphologies did not differ between the two groups. Technical success was 100%. The 30-day mortality was 0% and 2.4% in the polymer-filled and self-expanding group, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 17 months, the changes in sac size were ?2.1 mm and ?5.1 mm (p = 0.144) at one year, and ?3.5 mm and ?7.7 mm (p = 0.287) at 2 years in the polymer-filled and self-expanding group, respectively. The polymer-filled group had 7 (35%) type II endoleaks, and the self-expanding group had 1 (2.4%) type Ia and 13 (31%) type II endoleaks. Neck diameter remained stable in the polymer-filled stent-grafts whereas there was progressive neck degeneration in the self-expanding group. The rates of reintervention and overall survival were similar in both groups. The presence of an endoleak was the only predictor of non-regression of the aneurysm (odds ratio = 17.00, 95% confidence interval: 4.46–64.88, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Polymer-filled endografts had similar safety, effectiveness, and durability to other self-expanding endografts. The major advantage is the small iliofemoral access. They also have the potential long-term benefit of a more stable neck. ?

Methods & results A total of 698 subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) and adipocytokine measurements. A comprehensive stepwise selection procedure was performed, followed by c-statistics and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis. In males, adiponectin levels were significantly lower in the IGT group compared to the non-IGT group (Whitney U test, p < 10-4), whereas leptin levels were significantly higher (p = 0.009) in IGT group. In females, adiponectin and leptin levels were not significantly different between groups (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.073 and p = 0.08, respectively). Adjusting for the most informative, sex-specific, clinical and biochemical factors, adiponectin, leptin and their ratio were not found to be significant predictors of the response to the glucose load, when modelled as continuous terms or tertiles. In males, the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for adiponectin was estimated at 0.620 (95% CI: 0.558-0.682) and the addition of adiponectin into the basic model provided a ΔAUC benefit of 0.004, showing no additional discriminatory benefit on top of conventional risk factors (IDI p-value: 0.27), nor did the addition of leptin or their ratio. The results were similar in females. Conclusions In Chinese individuals without diabetes, no significant evidence for the potential discriminatory value of adiponectin, leptin or their ratio in the identification of IGT on top of conventional risk factors was observed.

This study investigates both the pathophysiology of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells in a mouse model of BA and their presence in BA patients. CD11b+Gr-1+ cells were targeted by an anti-Ly6G antibody in murine BA induced by inoculation with rhesus rotavirus. Expression of the Ly6G homolog CD177+ was examined in biopsies from BA patients. The symptoms of BA were ameliorated, and survival was prolonged in those mice receiving 5 to 10 μg of antibody per mouse every 3 days for four times compared with the mice treated with virus alone. However, the mice later developed chronic BA with persistent low body weight and jaundice. Hepatic inflammatory cells were reduced compared with acute BA. Blockade of extrahepatic bile ducts occurred, whereas intrahepatic ductules were partially preserved, and a progressive increase in liver fibrosis was observed. High levels of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells were present in these mice. The administration of an anti-Ly6G antibody again in those chronic BA mice reduced jaundice and restored body weight. In BA patients CD177+ cells were highly expressed in the liver. Our data suggest that the chronic mouse BA model shares key characteristics with clinical BA and indicates the importance of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells in the initiation and progression of BA. ? 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology",,"CD11b antigen; Simian rotavirus vaccine; alloantigen; CD177 protein, human; cell surface receptor; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; Ly antigen; Ly6G antigen, mouse; monoclonal antibody; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bile duct; bile duct atresia; bladder biopsy; blood group rhesus system; body weight loss; bone marrow cell; controlled study; disease course; female; human; immunohistochemistry; jaundice; liver cell; liver fibrosis; liver function; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein blood level; Rotavirus; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bile duct atresia; bone marrow cell; complication; disease model; drug effect; immunology; infant; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; newborn; pathogenicity; pathology; Rotavirus infection; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, Ly; Biliary Atresia; Disease Models, Animal; GPI-Linked Proteins; Humans; Infant; Isoantigens; Liver Cirrhosis; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Myeloid Cells; Receptors, Cell Surface; Rotavirus; Rotavirus Infections",2-s2.0-85055212066

The HRQOL was measured using the Short-Form Six-Dimension instrument and the functional assessment of cancer therapy-colorectal whereas health service utilisation was measured by the number of monthly clinical consultations and the number of monthly hospitalisation. Different count data models (Poisson's regression, negative binomial regression, zero-inflated Poisson's regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression) were used to assess the association between HRQOL and health service utilisation. A performance comparison was made between the models. Goodness-of-fit statistics (the Pearson's chi-squared test statistic, the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria) were used to determine the best-fitting model. The negative binomial model performed the best in assessing the association between HRQOL measures and health service utilisation in patients with colorectal neoplasm and thus recommended. Physical well-being of patients was negatively and significantly associated with the monthly rate of health service utilisation after controlling for patient demographics. Both physical and function well-beings of patients were negatively and significantly associated with the number of monthly hospitalisations. If the data for the condition-specific FACT-C are not available, SF-6D showed a very strong negative relationship with health service utilisation. Such models can be used to guide the allocation of clinical resources and funding for the care of colorectal cancer patients. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",colorectal cancer; count data models; FACT-C; quality of life; zero-inflated models,"adult; aged; ambulatory care; Bayes theorem; colon polyp; colorectal tumor; female; health service; health status; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; regression analysis; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care; Bayes Theorem; Colonic Polyps; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Health Services; Health Status; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Regression Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85054506551

In many of these outbreaks, main transmission routes were healthcare facility-associated and through person-to-person contact. While a majority of existing work on modelling of the spread of infectious diseases focuses on transmission processes at a community level, we propose a new methodology to model the outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which must be considered at an individual level. Our work also contributes to a novel aspect of integrating real-time positioning technologies into the tracking and modelling framework for effective HAI outbreak control and prompt responses. Our proposed solution methodology is developed based on three key components – time-varying contact network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and HAI parameter estimation – and aims to identify the hidden health state of each patient and worker within the healthcare facility. We conduct experiments with a four-month human tracking data set collected in a hospital, which bore a big nosocomial outbreak of the 2003 SARS in Hong Kong. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing epidemic models for characterizing macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected people and epidemic threshold. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Disease outbreak; Healthcare-associated infections; Person-to-person contact analytics; Traceability; Tracking,Article; disease transmission; epidemic; health care facility; health care organization; health care personnel; health status; healthcare associated infection; human; Markov chain; prediction; severe acute respiratory syndrome; steady state; cross infection; epidemic; health survey; Hong Kong; hospital; procedures; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Cross Infection; Disease Outbreaks; Hong Kong; Hospitals; Humans; Population Surveillance; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,2-s2.0-85054145893

Therefore, identifying factors associated with significant brain injury in geriatric patients in A&E triage is crucial in providing timely care to these patients. Objectives: To identify the risk factors for geriatric patients with significant brain injury from ground-level falls and to formulate their association of risk factors with significant brain injury as a consequence from ground-level falls. Methods: This was a retrospective study with data collected from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of Queen Mary Hospital from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015. A total of 1101 cases were identified. Results: There were 76% of the recruited patients with a normal computed tomography scan. However, the remaining 24% had computed tomography scans indicative of brain injury. Severe head injuries were scored 3 -8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale and moderate head injuries were scored 9 -12. Respectively, these were 20 times (p = 0.005) and 5 times (p = 0.002) more likely to have positive computed tomography findings than patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score from 13 to 15. Patients with loss of consciousness were two times more likely to have a positive computed tomography result than those without loss of consciousness (p = 0.001). Although warfarin use is a well-established risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage after head injury, in our dataset, the result was not statistically significant. However, the use of new oral anti-coagulants was associated with positive computed tomography findings with patients taking new oral anti-coagulants 2.3 times more likely to have positive computed tomography findings compared with those with no anticoagulant use (p = 0.033). Conclusions: Early detection of patients with significant brain injury and aggressive management may prevent secondary injury from the complications of brain injury, hence improving patient mortality and morbidity, and reducing hospital stay and health care costs. ?

Method: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on serum samples collected from 451 women diagnosed with PCOS as well as 244 age-matched healthy ovulatory women in a tertiary gynaecology out-patient clinic and a family planning clinic. Results: Serum 25(OH)D level was significantly higher in women recruited during summer and autumn than those recruited in winter and spring. Both serum 25(OH)D and AMH levels peaked during summer in women with PCOS. In ovulatory women, only serum 25(OH)D but not AMH level showed such seasonal variation. Serum 25(OH)D level in women with PCOS significantly correlated positively with AMH, AMH/antral follicle count (AFC) ratio, serum total testosterone, sex-hormone-binding globulin and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index and inversely with body mass index (BMI), insulin, triglycerides and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. After controlling for BMI, 25(OH)D level remained significantly correlated positively with serum AMH, AMH/AFC and total testosterone, and inversely with triglycerides. 25(OH)D level was an independent predictor of serum AMH level after controlling for age, BMI and free androgen index in women with PCOS.

However, existing interval designs typically cannot converge to the optimal dose level since their intervals do not shrink to the target toxicity probability as the sample size increases. The uniformly most powerful Bayesian test (UMPBT) is an objective Bayesian hypothesis testing procedure, which results in the largest probability that the Bayes factor against null hypothesis exceeds the evidence threshold for all possible values of the data generating parameter. On the basis of the rejection region of UMPBT, we develop the uniformly most powerful Bayesian interval (UMPBI) design for phase I dose-finding trials. The proposed UMPBI design enjoys convergence properties because the induced interval indeed shrinks to the toxicity target and the recommended dose converges to the true maximum tolerated dose as the sample size increases. Moreover, it possesses an optimality property that the probability of incorrect decisions is minimized. We conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the competitive finite-sample operating characteristics of the UMPBI in comparison with other existing interval designs. As an illustration, we apply the UMPBI design to a panitumumab and standard gemcitabine-based chemoradiation combination trial. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bayes factor; dose finding; interval design; maximum tolerated dose; uniformly most powerful Bayesian test,"gemcitabine; panitumumab; panitumumab; algorithm; Article; Bayes theorem; chemoradiotherapy; competitive finite-sample operating characteristics; controlled study; drug overdose; drug tolerability; human; hypothesis; intermethod comparison; medical decision making; pancreas cancer; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); probability; sample size; side effect; simulation; statistical analysis; uniformly most powerful Bayesian test; computer simulation; maximum tolerated dose; methodology; pancreas tumor; Bayes Theorem; Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic; Computer Simulation; Humans; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Panitumumab; Probability; Research Design",2-s2.0-85051061984

Artificial tear substitutes may be suitable for the treatment of mild KCS, but no effective treatment currently exists for severe KCS. Therefore, this study evaluated the effectiveness of autologous microvascular submandibular gland transplantation in the treatment of severe KCS. Patients and Methods: A total of 61 eyes (56 patients) with severe KCS were treated with autologous submandibular gland transplantation from June 2002 to June 2017. The cephalic vein or the great saphenous vein was applied to solve the problem of unmatched veins. Results: In 53 cases (53 of 56, 94.6%), 58 glands (58 of 61, 95.1%) were transplanted successfully. The mean Schirmer I test value improved from 0.78 ± 0.84 mm preoperatively to 18.83 ± 5.72 mm in the stable period after transplantation. Epiphora (14 of 58, 24.14%) was the most common complication of this procedure.

The study aimed at examining the association between HbA 1c and the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) for diabetic patients with different characteristics, in order to identify patient-centered treatment targets. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 115,782 Chinese adult primary care patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) but no known CVD history, who were prescribed antidiabetic medications in 2010–2011. The cumulative mean HbA 1c over a median follow-up period of 5.8 years was used to evaluate the relationship between HbA 1c and CVD incidence using Cox analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by stratifying different baseline characteristics including gender, age, smoking status, diabetes duration, body mass index, Charlson's comorbidity index and DM treatment modalities. Results: For patients with a DM duration of &lt; 2years, an exponential relationship between HbA 1c and risk of CVD was identified, suggesting that there was no threshold HbA 1c level for CVD risk. For other diabetic patients, an HbA 1c level of 6.8–7.2% was associated with a minimum risk for CVD and a J-shaped curvilinear association between HbA 1c . The risk of CVD increased in patients with HbA 1c &lt; 6.5% or ? 7.5%. Conclusion: Among Chinese primary care patients at the early (&lt; 2years) disease stage, lower HbA 1c targets (&lt; 6.5%) may be warranted to prevent CVD events whilst for all others, excessively lower HbA 1c levels may not necessarily better and can potentially be harmful. ? 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Cardiovascular diseases; Diabetes mellitus; Haemoglobin A 1c; Management; Primary care,"acarbose; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; metformin; sulfonylurea derivative; antidiabetic agent; glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; Chinese; cohort analysis; diabetic patient; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; groups by age; heart failure; hemoglobin blood level; Hong Kong; human; incidence; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; monotherapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient care; prescription; primary medical care; retrospective study; sex difference; smoking; blood; cardiovascular disease; metabolism; Aged; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Hong Kong; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85044646613

Among numerous applications of WPT technology, the ener-gization of implanted biomedical devices wirelessly and uninterruptedly from external supply is important because it can eliminate possible device replacement due to battery depletion. Given the implanted receiver is invisible from the external transmitter, the coil misalignment occurs easily which results in low transfer efficiency and high magnetic field leakage, and consequently endangers the human health [1]. Thus, the development of accurate position detection of the implanted receiver from the external transmitter is highly desirable. Presently, most studies ofthe position detection in WPT are focused on the application of electric vehicles. Although the corresponding technologies such as coil sets [2] or auxiliary multi-coils [3] have achieved fruitful outcome, they are too bulky and complicated to be used in implant applications. Due to the advantages of high stability, small size, low power consumption and high precision, the magnetoresistive (MR) sensor has been widely used in many industrial applications [4]. Generally, they are arranged in an array style to measure the magnetic field vector [5] or a moving magnetic object [6]. To the best of authors' knowledge, the application of MR sensors in WPT is absent in literature. In this paper, a new position detection approach in WPT is proposed and implemented, which is particularly suitable for implant applications. The key is to use a MR sensor array to directly measure the variation of magnetic field so as to precisely detect the relative position of the implanted receiver from the external transmitter. Therefore, the advantages of efficient and compact WPT for implant applications can be achieved. ?2018 IEEE",,Electromagnetic field effects; Energy transfer; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic leakage; Transmitters; High magnetic fields; Low-power consumption; Magnetic field vectors; Magnetic resonant couplings; Magnetoresistive sensors; Transfer efficiency; Wireless power transfer; Wireless power transfer (WPT); Inductive power transmission,2-s2.0-85066783449

Three different groups of boys aged 6-15 years were included in the analysis: ADHD patients who used MPH for less than 12 months; ADHD patients who used MPH for 12 months or more; and ADHD patients without current MPH treatment. Each of these three groups was compared to a non-ADHD control group regarding low weight (BMI ? 3rd percentile), low height (?3rd percentile) and raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure. For growth outcomes, boys were categorized according to age (< 11 years/?11 years, to account for pubertal maturation). Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to test for associations. Results: 4244 boys were included in the study; MPH < 12 months: n = 65 (n = 36 < 11 years), MPH ? 12 months: n = 53 (n = 22 < 11 years), ADHD controls: n = 320 (n = 132 < 11 years), non-ADHD controls: n = 3806 (n = 2003 < 11 years). Pre-pubertal boys with MPH use less than 12 months and pubertal/postpubertal boys with MPH use of 12 months or greater were significantly more likely to have a BMI ? 3rd percentile compared to non-ADHD controls. Boys from the ADHD control group were significantly less likely to have a raised systolic blood pressure compared to non-ADHD controls. Beyond that, no significant between group differences were observed for any other growth and BP parameter. Conclusion: The analyses of the KiGGS dataset showed that MPH use in boys with ADHD is associated with low BMI. However, this effect was only observed in certain groups. Furthermore, our analysis was unable to confirm that MPH use is also associated with low height (?3rd percentile) and changes in blood pressure. ? 2018 The Author(s).",ADHD; Blood pressure; BMI; Growth; Methylphenidate; Safety,central stimulant agent; methylphenidate; adolescent; attention deficit disorder; blood pressure; body height; body mass; body weight loss; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; drug administration; drug effect; Germany; health survey; human; male; physiology; procedures; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Blood Pressure; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Administration Schedule; Germany; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Methylphenidate; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss,2-s2.0-85054772805

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study used a case-control design. ERCC2 gene rs1799793 (Asp312Asn) and rs13181 (Lys751Gln) polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) both in DLBCL patients and healthy controls. The association between ERCC2 gene polymorphisms and DLBCL risk was assessed by χ? test. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to address the association strength. Subgroup analyses were also performed to investigate the genetic effects of ERCC2 polymorphisms on clinical characteristics of DLBCL patients. RESULTS A significant association was discovered between the rs1799793 A allele and increased DLBCL risk (P=0.031, OR=1.928, 95% CI=1.052-3.534). The C allele of rs13181 was obviously associated with elevated DLBCL susceptibility (P=0.047, OR=1.820, 95% CI=1.002-3.305). The subgroup analysis demonstrated that rs1799793 and rs13181 polymorphisms had no relationship with serum lactate dehydrogenase level, nidus number, B-symptoms, Ann Arbor stages, or immunological types in DLBCL cases (P>0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS Minor allele carriers of ERCC2 gene rs1799793 (Asp312Asn) and rs13181 (Lys751Gln) polymorphisms had higher susceptibility to DLBCL.",,"ERCC2 protein, human; xeroderma pigmentosum group D protein; adult; aged; allele; case control study; China; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; female; gene frequency; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; human; male; middle aged; odds ratio; physiology; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; Case-Control Studies; China; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein",2-s2.0-85054363181

Except for very early tumours where endoscopic therapy can be performed with curative intent, in more advanced but potentially curative cancers, treatment for mid and upper third tumours is primarily surgery with extended lymphadenectomy, together with multimodal therapies such as preoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Definitive chemoradiotherapy is utilized in those who decline surgery or in those who are unfit for major procedures. For cervical oesophageal cancer, the anatomical proximity to the larynx influences the choice of treatment and surgical options. Definitive chemoradiation with the aim of laryngeal preservation has become the treatment of choice; long-term prognosis is believed to be comparable to radical pharyngo-laryngo-oesophagectomy. Selected patients with residual disease or disease recurrence can consider salvage surgery. The decision to operate is a major undertaking as salvage surgery carries high morbidity and even mortality risks. Careful patient selection, choice of treatment, meticulous operative technique and postoperative care are the cornerstones of success. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Chemoradiotherapy; Lymphadenectomy; Oesophageal cancer; Oesophagectomy; Squamous cell carcinoma,antineoplastic agent; cancer prognosis; cancer surgery; cancer therapy; chemoradiotherapy; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus resection; fluorescence angiography; human; lymph node dissection; minimal residual disease; mortality risk; patient selection; preoperative chemotherapy; recurrent disease; recurrent laryngeal nerve; Review; aged; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; male; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; procedures; prognosis; retrospective study; Aged; Chemoradiotherapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Esophagectomy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-85059269322

Methods: Consecutive CRC patients who had undergone surgical resection for curative intent in our hospital between 2001 and 2004 were identified. R-sided colonic cancers refer to cancer proximal to splenic flexure whereas L-sided cancers include rectal cancers. Patients were included only if they had a clearing colonoscopy performed either before or within 6 months after the operation. Findings of surveillance colonoscopy performed up to 5 years after colonic resection were included in the analysis. Results: Eight hundred and sixty-three CRC patients underwent curative surgical resection during the study period. Three hundred and twenty-seven patients (107 R-sided and 220 L-sided) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and had at least 1 postoperative surveillance colonoscopy performed. The proportion of patients who had polyp and adenoma on surveillance colonoscopy was significantly higher among patients with L-sided than R-sided cancers (polyps: 30.9% vs. 19.6%, P=0.03; adenomas: 25.5% vs. 13.1%, P=0.01). The mean number of adenoma per patient on surveillance colonoscopy was also higher for patients with L-sided than R-sided tumors (0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.68 vs. 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.35; P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that L-sided cancers, age, male gender and longer follow-up were independent predictors of adenoma detection on surveillance colonoscopy. Conclusions: Patients with L-sided cancer had a higher rate of metachronous polyps and adenoma than those with R-sided cancer on surveillance colonoscopy. ? 2018.

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of couples undergoing a first IVF cycle between 2004 and 2014 in a tertiary assisted reproduction centre in Hong Kong. Results: We analysed 3549 cases. Paternal age ?40 years was negatively correlated with semen volume, progressive motility, total motility and total normal motile count (P<0.005) and positively correlated with sperm concentration (P<0.001). There was no correlation with sperm count, normal morphology, or total motile count. Subgroup analyses in Chinese men only and in men with normal versus abnormal semen parameters showed the same correlations. Paternal age was positively associated with maternal age (P<0.001) and miscarriage (P=0.006), and negatively associated with ongoing pregnancy and live birth (P<0.001). Logistic regression showed that maternal age, total number of oocytes retrieved, and number of embryos transferred were significant factors which independently predicted the likelihood of live birth from IVF (all P<0.001). Conclusion: Paternal age was negatively correlated with some semen parameters, which showed a significant decline after age 40 years.

DM complication risk assessment and stratification is key to cost-effective management and tertiary prevention for patients with diabetes in primary care. Existing risk prediction functions were found to be inaccurate in Chinese patients with diabetes in primary care. This study aims to develop 10-year risk prediction models for total cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and all-cause mortality among Chinese patients with DM in primary care. Methods and analysis A 10-year cohort study on a population-based primary care cohort of Chinese patients with diabetes, who were receiving care in the Hospital Authority General Outpatient Clinic on or before 1 January 2008, were identified from the clinical management system database of the Hospital Authority. All patients with complete baseline risk factors will be included and followed from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017 for the development and validation of prediction models. The analyses will be carried out separately for men and women. Two-thirds of subjects will be randomly selected as the training sample for model development. Cox regressions will be used to develop 10-year risk prediction models of total CVD and all-cause mortality. The validity of models will be tested on the remaining one-third of subjects by Harrell's C-statistics and calibration plot. Risk prediction models for diabetic complications specific to Chinese patients in primary care will enable accurate risk stratification, prioritisation of resources and more cost-effective interventions for patients with DM in primary care.

Materials and Methods: A total of 3050 patients from 17 public breast cancer data sets containing IHC marker receptor status (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) and their molecular classification (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A or B) were analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy and concordance as measured with the κ statistic were calculated between the IHC and molecular classifications. Simulations were performed to assess the relationship between accuracy of imaging-based IHC markers to predict molecular classification. A simulation was performed to examine effects of misclassification of molecular type on patient survival. Results: Accuracies of intrinsic subtypes based on IHC subtype were 71.7% (luminal A), 53.7% (luminal B), 64.8% (HER2-enriched), and 81.7% (basal-like). The κ agreement was fair (κ = 0.36) for luminal A and HER2-enriched subtypes, good (κ = 0.65) for the basal-like subtype, and poor (κ = 0.09) for the luminal B subtypes. Introduction of image misclassification by simulation lowered image-true subtype accuracies and κ values. Simulation analysis showed that misclassification caused survival differences between luminal A and basal-like subtypes to decrease. Conclusion: There is poor concordance between triple-receptor status and intrinsic molecular subtype in breast cancer, arguing against their use in the design of prognostic genomic-based image biomarkers. ?

To explore the underlining mechanisms of action for SWGJP in liver injury from a holistic view, in the present study, a systems pharmacology approach was developed, which involved drug target identification and multilevel data integration analysis. Using a comprehensive systems approach, we identified 43 candidate compounds in SWGJP and 408 corresponding potential targets. We further deciphered the mechanisms of SWGJP in treating liver injury, including compound-target network analysis, target-function network analysis, and integrated pathways analysis. We deduced that SWGJP may protect hepatocytes through several functional modules involved in liver injury integrated-pathway, such as Nrf2-dependent anti-oxidative stress module. Notably, systems pharmacology provides an alternative way to investigate the complex action mode of TCM. ? 2018 China Pharmaceutical University",Liver injury; Oxidative stress; Sanwei Ganjiang Prescription; Systems pharmacology; Traditional Chinese Medicine,"herbaceous agent; transcription factor Nrf2; herbaceous agent; apoptosis; Article; drug identification; drug mechanism; drug research; human; liver injury; mitochondrion; multilevel analysis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prescription; chemistry; drug effect; gene expression; genetics; injuries; liver; liver cell; liver disease; metabolism; pharmacology; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Gene Expression; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Oxidative Stress; Pharmacology",2-s2.0-85054610096

The CKD burden is envisaged to be high, as reflected by 2 initiatives – SHARE which detected a high prevalence of urine or blood pressure abnormalities among 1,201 asymptomatic individuals who underwent screening, and RISKS that aimed to further characterize the spread of CKD in the asymptomatic population. For CKD prevention, two statutory bodies – the HA and Hong Kong College of Physicians (HKCP), and two non-governmental organizations – Hong Kong Society of Nephrology (HKSN) and Hong Kong Kidney Foundation (HKKF), all have a role to play. The Central Renal Committee (CRC) operated under HA co-produces with HKCP and HKSN a clinical practice guideline for the provision of renal service in Hong Kong which includes CKD care and prevention. HKSN now holds annual educational symposia and a Continuous Medical Education (CME) course in partnership with the HKCP and Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology in addition to its Annual Scientific Meeting. The HKSN also provides a collective International Society of Nephrology (ISN) membership for all its full members to enhance education and other pertinent initiatives. For public education, the HKSN and HKKF participate in the annual World Kidney Day event and organize free blood pressure and CKD surveys in public housing estates to increase public awareness of CKD.

As hepatic steatosis occurs prior to steatohepatitis and other late stage liver conditions, the distribution pattern of hepatic fat and iron concentration should be investigated to prevent sampling variability. The first purpose of this study was to perform comparison and validation of in-house hepatic fat measurements using water-fat MRI and MRS. The second objective was to quantify hepatic fat-fraction and T2* values in left and right liver lobes using water-fat MRI. Method: Fifty-four non-alcoholic adults (27 NAFLD, age: 42.8 ± 11.8), 27 non-NAFLD, age: 45.5 ± 11.2) and 46 non-alcoholic teenagers (23 NAFLD (age: 15.4 ± 2.6), 23 non-NAFLD (age: 13.9 ± 2.3) were recruited. All participants underwent chemical shift water-fat MRI and 1H MRS at 3 T. Hepatic steatosis was defined by intrahepatic triglyceride more than the threshold of 5.56% using MRS (clinical reference) and non-alcoholic was defined by alcohol ingestion of no more than 30 g and 20 g per day for male and female respectively. Hepatic fat-fractions in left and right liver lobes were measured using regions-of-interest (ROIs) approach. Three ROIs were drawn on the fat-fraction images and duplicated on to the co-registered T2* images at the inferior right, superior right and superior left liver lobes. Comparison and validation of water-fat MRI and MRS were performed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot. Hepatic fat-fraction and T2* measured from the ROIs were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Independent t-test was used for between groups analysis. Results: Statistical analysis indicated good correlation (R = 0.987) and agreement (ICC = 0.982) between MRS and water-fat MRI in hepatic fat measurements. Results indicated that hepatic fat was significantly higher in the right lobe compared to the left in NAFLD adults (p < 0.001) and NAFLD teenagers (p < 0.001). For T2* significant difference between left and right lobes was observed in NAFLD adults (p < 0.001) and non-NAFLD adults (p < 0.001) but not in teenagers. Conclusion: Hepatic fat measurements using MRS and water-fat MRI are statistically equivalent. In subjects with NAFLD regardless of their age, hepatic fat is stored preferentially in the right live lobe probably due to the streamline of blood flow to the right liver. T2* value is significantly higher in the right liver lobe in adults but not in the teenagers regardless of their hepatic fat contents probably due to the longer time span of hepatic iron accumulation. ? 2018",Hepatic fat; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; T2*,iron; triacylglycerol; iron; water; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; blood flow; clinical article; controlled study; disease assessment; fatty liver; female; human; image analysis; left liver lobe; lipid storage; male; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; right liver lobe; validation study; adolescent; complication; diagnostic imaging; fatty liver; liver; metabolism; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; Adolescent; Adult; Fatty Liver; Female; Humans; Iron; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Reproducibility of Results; Water,2-s2.0-85051382044

We searched the PubMed databases and identified 10 studies with 14 possible inflight influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreaks. Considering the different mechanisms of the large-droplet and airborne routes, a meta-Analysis of the outbreak data was carried out to study the difference in attack rates for passengers within and beyond two rows of the index case(s). We also explored the relationship between the attack rates and the flight duration and/or total infectivity of the index case(s). The risk ratios for passengers seated within and beyond the two rows of the index cases were 1.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-2.84) for syndromic secondary cases and 4.3 (95% CI 1.25-14.54) for laboratory-confirmed secondary cases. Furthermore, with an increase of the product of the flight duration and the total infectivity of the index cases, the overall attack rate increased linearly. The study indicates that influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 may mainly be transmitted via the airborne route during air travel. A standardised approach for the reporting of such inflight outbreak investigations would help to provide more convincing evidence for such inflight transmission events. ?

Anecdotal reports have described adverse outcomes on surgical wound, implants, and lymphedema during air travel. This review aims to evaluate the best evidence from the literature concerning the air travel safety in breast cancer patients. A comprehensive review was performed of the Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases using a predefined strategy. Retrieved studies were independently screened and rated for relevance. Data were extracted by 2 researchers. We reviewed the best evidence on air travel safety in postoperative breast cancer patients. Evidence was limited in the current literature to suggest adverse effects on postoperative mastectomy wounds and drains by high-altitude travel. Similarly, adverse effects on breast implants were limited to case reports and ex vivo experiments. A systematic review of 12 studies concluded that air travel is not associated with upper limb lymphedema after breast cancer surgery. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a known complication after air travel; in addition, malignancy itself is a known risk factor for DVT. Evidence of safety to continue tamoxifen during the period of air travel is lacking in the literature. Evidence to support the use of systemic DVT prophylaxis in general postoperative breast cancer patients is also limited. Best evidence from a large retrospective study suggested that mechanical antiembolism devices and early mobilization are the only measures required.

The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of HSCR in Bangladesh. Methods: Data from fifty patients were collected prospectively from two hospitals in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Results: The rate of consanguinity (16%) among parents of HSCR patients was higher than that of the general population (10%). Maternal age at the time of birth of the affected child was ? 30 years in all cases except one. No association was found between parents’ occupation and HSCR. No patient was born preterm and only three patients (6%) had low birth weight. Nine patients (18%) had associated anomalies. We found coexistence of bilateral accessory tragi and ankyloglossia in one patient, and coexistence of rectal duplication cyst in another. Neither anomaly had been previously reported in HSCR patients. Conclusions: Our study suggests that consanguinity might increase the risk of HSCR whereas advanced maternal age does not.

This cross-sectional study aimed to analyze the sociodemographic and clinical factors that may influence the OHRQoL of 18-year-old young adults. Methods: A representative sample was selected from Hong Kong. Periodontal status and caries were examined according to WHO criteria. Four orthodontic indices were used to assess malocclusion. The oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) was used to measure OHRQoL. Adjusted OR was calculated by ordinal logistic regression. Results: A total of 300 eligible subjects (165 females, 135 males) were recruited. Females had more severe caries than males; however, gender was not a significant factor of OHRQoL. Household income affected OHRQoL more than parents' education did: household income had effects on physical pain, psychological discomfort, psychological disability, and the total OHIP; while parents' education had some effects on functional limitation, physical pain and psychological discomfort. As for clinical factors, unhealthy periodontal conditions were more prevalent than caries (94.67% vs. 59.00%); however, both of them showed no effect on OHRQoL. Malocclusion had a negative effect on OHRQoL; the most affected subscales were psychological discomfort and psychological disability. Conclusion: In this study, family ecosocial factors and malocclusion had an effect on OHRQoL. Among the family ecosocial factors, it was household income that had the most effect on OHRQoL. Malocclusion mainly affected the subscales of psychological discomfort and psychological disability.

Our findings suggest that dGI and dGL of Australian youths declined between 1995 to 2012, which may be due to increased awareness of the GI concept and healthy diet, widened food choices and immigrants with diverse dietary habits.

Statins are the first line of lipid-lowering drugs for treating FH and other types of hypercholesterolemia, but new approaches are emerging, in particular PCSK9 antibodies, which are now being tested in clinical trials. To explore novel therapeutic approaches for FH, either new drugs or new formulations, we need appropriate in vivo models. However, differences in the lipid metabolic profiles compared to humans are a key problem of the available animal models of FH. To address this issue, we have generated a human liver chimeric mouse model using FH induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocytes (iHeps). We used Ldlr-/-/Rag2-/-/Il2rg-/- (LRG) mice to avoid immune rejection of transplanted human cells and to assess the effect of LDLR-deficient iHeps in an LDLR null background. Transplanted FH iHeps could repopulate 5-10% of the LRG mouse liver based on human albumin staining. Moreover, the engrafted iHeps responded to lipid-lowering drugs and recapitulated clinical observations of increased efficacy of PCSK9 antibodies compared to statins. Our human liver chimeric model could thus be useful for preclinical testing of new therapies to FH. Using the same protocol, similar human liver chimeric mice for other FH genetic variants, or mutations corresponding to other inherited liver diseases, may also be generated. ? 2018, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Main outcome measures: Views on cancer risk and health seeking behaviour. Results: Relatives of advanced cancer patients perceived themselves as having a higher cancer risk. They were henceforth more health conscious and wished to have health checks for cancer prevention. They also wished to seek more information on cancer risk, especially from health care professionals. However there were barriers in getting such information from doctors. Conclusion: Relatives of advanced cancer patients need more reliable information on cancer risk and prevention. Family physicians, with emphasis on holistic and preventive care, are capable of meeting such needs.

This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 418 parents with children aged 2 to 14 years participated in this study from May 2016 to July 2017. This included 221 parents of children with voice disorders (dysphonic group) and 197 parents of children without voice disorders (control group). The scores for the pVHI and the pVRQOL were compared, and correlation analysis was performed. Compared with the control group, the dysphonic group had a significantly higher total score and subscale scores for the pVHI (P < .001), and significantly lower pVRQOL scores (P < .001). The pVHI showed greater differences in subscale scores among the three dysphonic subgroups than the pVRQOL. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the pVHI and pVRQOL was –0.844 (P < .001). The total scores for the pVHI and pVRQOL also correlated significantly for each diagnostic category (P < .001). Voice-related quality of life was poorer in children with voice disorders than in those without voice disorders. The pVHI and pVRQOL scores were moderately- to strongly correlated. These may be useful tools for assessing the voice-related quality of life in children. The pVHI may provide more useful details about the effects of different types of voice disorders on the voice-related quality of life than the pVRQOL. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

The disease runs a highly variable clinical course with frequent involvement of tubulointerstitial damage. A subgroup of IgAN with proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) and tubulointerstitial damage often is associated with rapid progression to end-stage renal failure. Human mesangial cell–derived mediators lead to podocyte and tubulointerstitial injury via mesangial-podocytic-tubular cross-talk. Although mesangial-podocytic communication plays a pathogenic role in podocytic injury, the implication of a podocyte-PTEC cross-talk pathway in the progression of tubulointerstitial injury in IgAN should not be underscored. We review the role of mesangial-podocytic-tubular cross-talk in the progression of IgAN. We discuss how podocytopathy in IgAN promotes subsequent PTEC dysfunction and whether tubulointerstitial injury affects the propagation of podocytic injury in IgAN. A thorough understanding of the cross-talk mechanisms among mesangial cells, podocytes, and PTECs may lead to better design of potential therapeutic options for IgAN. ? 2018",cross-talk; IgAN; mesangial cell; podocyte; tubular,"immunoglobulin A; mitogen activated protein kinase; RANTES; reactive oxygen metabolite; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; cell activity; cell communication; cell damage; disease association; disease exacerbation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; histopathology; human; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; kidney function; kidney tubule; kidney tubule cell; mesangium cell; molecular interaction; nonhuman; podocyte; priority journal; protein expression; Review; urine; cytology; epithelium cell; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; kidney tubule; mesangium cell; metabolism; podocyte; Epithelial Cells; Glomerulonephritis, IGA; Humans; Kidney Tubules; Mesangial Cells; Podocytes",2-s2.0-85052652213

Methods: A consecutive surgical cohort of AIS patients undergoing selective thoracic fusion with alternate-level pedicle screw fixation was prospectively studied. Preoperative anteroposterior, lateral and fulcrum-bending radiographs were analysed. Postoperatively, a minimum of 2?years clinical and imaging follow-up was performed of all patients. PSI was defined as a radiographic shoulder height difference of more than 20?mm. Results: A total of 80 patients were included, and 14 patients (18%) were confirmed with PSI at final follow-up. The flexibility of MT curve was an independent risk factor for PSI (odds ratio (OR) = 3.3 per 10% decrease, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–8.2). Twenty-seven patients had a preoperative MT flexibility of < 55% (OR = 11.5, 95% CI 2.8–46.2). Postoperative T1 tilt was significantly higher in the PSI group (p < 0.001), and a T1 tilt of more than 9° resulted in 7.2 times higher odds of developing PSI (95% CI 2.0–26.0). Fulcrum-bending correction index (FBCI) was significantly higher in the PSI group at final follow-up, and 25 patients had a final postoperative MT FBCI above 120% (OR = 8.5 (95% CI 2.3–31.0). Conclusions: A low preoperative curve flexibility is a significant predictor for PSI. The surgical strategy should consider proximal fusion in presence of low-flexibility MT curves and consider less aggressive MT curve correction. Achieving a level T1 should be a main priority during intraoperative correction and may require fusion of the PT curve. Level of evidence: III.

The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with regular counselling attendance of patients taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, paper-based survey among 880 PLHIV patients on ART attending outpatient clinics of a referral hospital in Jakarta. Patients on ART, above 18 years old, providing written consent were included. The primary outcome was regular counselling attendance (i.e., having attended at least 3 sessions in the previous 3 months) using records from counsellors. Factors associated with regular counselling attendance were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Results: The majority of patients were male (71.1%) and had regular counselling (78.4%).

In the experiment, participants first memorized a positive or a negative word. Then, a dot was presented at the higher or lower position of the screen and was horizontally centered. Participants detected the location of the cue and made behavioral responses while their brain electrical activities were recorded. Results found that (a) when participants memorized a negative word and judged the lower spatial cue, the power of the delta band was suppressed compared with memorizing a positive word; (b) when participants memorized a positive word and judged the higher spatial cue, the power of the theta band was suppressed compared with memorizing a negative word; (c) when participants memorized a negative word and judged the lower spatial cue, the power of the alpha band was suppressed compared with memorizing a positive word. These event-related desynchronization results suggest that the processing of valence-space associations is related to inhibition, attention, working memory, and semantic process. The present study provides the first evidence of cortical oscillations involved in conceptual metaphors. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Very often, the calculated rearrangement scenario is not unique for the same pair of permutations. Hence, how to decide which calculated rearrangement scenario is more biologically meaningful becomes an essential task. Up to now, several mechanisms for genome rearrangements have been studied. One important theory is that genome rearrangement may be mediated by repeats, especially for reversal events. Many reversal regions are found to be flanked by a pair of inverted repeats. As a result, whether there are repeats at the breakpoints of the calculated rearrangement events can shed a light on deciding whether the calculated rearrangement events is biologically meaningful. To our knowledge, there is no tool which can automatically identify rearrangement events and check whether there exist repeats at the breakpoints of each calculated rearrangement event. Results: In this paper, we describe a new tool named GRSR which allows us to compare multiple unichromosomal genomes to identify ""independent"" (obvious) rearrangement events such as reversals, (inverted) block interchanges and (inverted) transpositions and automatically searches for repeats at the breakpoints of each rearrangement event. We apply our tool on the complete genomes of 28 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and 24 Shewanella strains respectively. In both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Shewanella strains, our tool finds many reversal regions flanked by a pair of inverted repeats. In particular, the GRSR tool also finds an inverted transposition and an inverted block interchange in Shewanella, where the repeats at the ends of rearrangement regions remain unchanged after the rearrangement event. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a phenomenon for inverted transposition and inverted block interchange is reported in Shewanella. Conclusions: From the calculated results, there are many examples supporting the theory that the existence of repeats at the breakpoints of a rearrangement event can make the sequences at the breakpoints remain unchanged before and after the rearrangement events, suggesting that the conservation of ends could possibly be a popular phenomenon in many types of genome rearrangement events. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Block interchange; Comparative genomics; Genome rearrangement; Reversal; Transposition,"Comparative genomics; Genome rearrangement scenarios; Genome rearrangements; Inverted block interchanges; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains; Reversal; Transposition; Genes; article; clinical article; controlled study; gene deletion; gene rearrangement; genetic linkage; genome; genomics; inverted repeat; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; Shewanella; algorithm; bacterial genome; chromosomal mapping; gene translocation; genetics; procedures; Algorithms; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Rearrangement; Genome, Bacterial; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Shewanella; Translocation, Genetic",2-s2.0-85051583489

The emerging wireless technologies facilitates the network expansion by connected all various kinds of devices, sensors, algorithms, and applications together. Therefore, a huge number of wearable sensors such as smart watches, headbands, chest straps etc. have been developed recently. The integration of those wearable sensors is usually defined as wireless body network (WBN). WBN facilitates real-time monitoring humans' status in numerous applications such as worker safety and patient tracking. As such, it is found that more than 60% of adult drivers felt sleepy while driving and more than 40% of traffic accidents are caused by drunk drivers. In this paper, an electrocardiogram (ECG) based humans' status detection (ECG-HSD) scheme is proposed to detect both drowsy and drunk status. The proposed ECG-HSD extracted similarities of ECG signals under normal, drowsy and drunk conditions and the corresponding feature vector was built. Then, the important data points on ECG samples were weighted and this improves the detection accuracy. Besides, two criteria of classifier which are accuracy and testing were considered with the aid of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). After that, K-fold validation was carried out for training and validating the classifiers. The results revealed that the proposed ECG-HSD achieved satisfied accuracy and short testing time. ? 2018 IEEE.",Electrocardiogram; Humans' status detection; Kernel,Accident prevention; Decision making; Electrocardiography; Industrial electronics; Risk management; Wireless telecommunication systems; Detection accuracy; Emerging wireless technologies; Kernel; Multiple criteria decision making; Network expansion; Real time monitoring; Smart transportations; Status detections; Wearable sensors,2-s2.0-85052386952

This study aims to evaluate the persistence, remission, relapse, and incidence rates of insomnia symptoms and insomnia disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th and 5th edition (DSM-IV and DSM-5). A total of 398 community dwellers were interviewed annually over two years using the Brief Insomnia Questionnaire, a validated questionnaire for deriving insomnia diagnoses. Normal sleepers were defined according to the DSM-5 quantitative criteria as having insomnia symptoms at most twice per week. Estimates were weighted against population age and sex distribution. Persistence for two consecutive years was 26.3, 26.4, and 23.0% for insomnia symptoms, DSM-IV, and DSM-5 insomnia disorders; remission rate was 55.8, 22.9, and 26.1%, relapse rate was 21.8, 1.3, and 0%, while incidence rate was 62.4, 19.6, and 4.5%. The common trajectories for DSM-IV insomnia disorder were to remain the same (26.4%), followed by a change to insomnia symptoms at the second year (25.7%), and at the third year (17.3%). For DSM-5 insomnia disorder, a change to insomnia symptoms at the second year was the commonest (28.3%), followed by continuing the same (23.0%), and a change to insomnia symptoms at the third year (14.0%). Over a two-year naturalistic follow-up, persistence of insomnia disorder was roughly 25%. Changes from insomnia disorder to insomnia symptoms were common; however, remission only occurred in about 25%, highlighting the chronic course of insomnia, perhaps due to a lack of treatment, under-treatment, or resistance to treatment. Incidence of insomnia symptoms was 62.4%, suggesting a high risk of developing insomnia in the general population. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Diagnosis; Incidence; Insomnia; Persistence; Prognosis; Remission; Sleep disorder,adult; age distribution; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; chronic disease; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; disease exacerbation; female; Hong Kong; human; incidence; insomnia; longitudinal study; male; methodology; middle aged; pathophysiology; questionnaire; recurrent disease; sex ratio; sleep; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chronic Disease; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Disease Progression; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Incidence; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Research Design; Sex Distribution; Sleep; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85027057608

Questions would include: feelings of care and support from their close relatives during childhood, the status of separation from their mothers for 1 year, and the current status of their parents. Linear regression, unconditional and multinomial logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations between the received childhood care and cognitive function (i.e., MMSE scores and cognitive impairment) in middle and old age, of this population under study. Results After adjusting for age, gender, education, place of residence, marital status, physical activity, smoking, drinking, occupation, personal incomc, childhood socioeconomic position and depressive symptoms etc., factors as feeling lack of concern and support from close relatives (LC), status of separation from the mother for 1 year (SM), and the current status of their parents etc., were all negatively associated with the MMSE score when in middle and old age, with partial regression coefficient /3 (95% CI) as -0.44 (-0.65- -023), -0.26 (-0.38- -0.14) and -0.61 (-0.96- -027), respectively. The presence of LC, SM or PD were associated with the increased risks of cognitive impairment, and the adjusted odds ratio OR (95%CI) appeared as 1.43 (1.15-1.78), 1.26 (1.08-1.47) and 1.64 (1.16-2.31) respectively in all the participants, but 1.27 (1.01-1.62), 1.29 (1.09-1.55) and 1.75 (1.19-2.55) respectively, in those with education level of primary school or below.

Consecutive patients admitted for either sLT or RR for recurrent HCC were recruited. All patients in the present series received either prior hepatectomy, ablative therapy, or both before RR or sLT. Patient demographic, perioperative, and outcome data were analyzed. A survival analysis was performed after propensity score matching. There were 277 eligible patients recruited, and 67 and 210 of them underwent sLT and RR, respectively. Significant differences in preoperative hemoglobin, albumin, Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and tumor number were found between the sLT and RR groups. After 1:3 propensity score matching, there were 36 sLT and 108 RR patients for comparison. The median age, MELD, alpha fetoprotein, and tumor size and number of the matched population were 57 years, 7.5, 16 ng/mL, 2.5 cm, and 1, respectively. There was no difference in the hospital mortality and complication rate (Clavien IIIa or above) between the groups. The recurrence rate after RR was significantly higher than for the patients who received sLT (72.2% versus 27.8%; P < 0.001). Following RR, 3 patients received liver transplantation for further recurrence, and 54.6% of the patients developed nontransplantable recurrence. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were both superior in the sLT group (DFS, 71.6% versus 32.8%, P < 0.001; OS, 72.8% versus 48.3%, P = 0.007). In conclusion, sLT is superior to RR for treatment of recurrent HCC in terms of DFS and OS.

Subsequent sections examine the regulatory approaches with respect to five aspects of responsible use and sharing of genomic data, namely, consent, privacy, security, compatible processing, and oversight. It argues that substantial centralised control exerted by the state is, and would probably remain, the dominant feature of genomic data governance in China, though concerns of individual protection are gaining momentum. Rather than revolving around a simplistic antinomy between privacy preservation and open science, the regulatory landscape is mainly shaped by the tension between government desires for national security, state competitiveness, and public health benefits. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,China; computer security; electronic data interchange; genetic privacy; genomics; information dissemination; information processing; informed consent; law; licensing; policy; priority journal; Review; computer security; genetic privacy; genetics; human; identifiable information; legislation and jurisprudence; standards; China; Computer Security; Genetic Privacy; Genetic Research; Humans; Personally Identifiable Information,2-s2.0-85049965972

Methods: The translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the English ThyPRO-39 were performed using the double forward translation, reconciliation, single backward translation, and cognitive debriefing, followed by a panel review. Cross-sectional data of 308 patients with benign thyroid diseases were utilized for this psychometric evaluation of ThyPRO-39 instrument. Convergent validity between similar construct in the ThyPRO-39, SF-6D, and SF-12v2 was assessed using Spearman correlations. The internal construct validity was assessed by corrected item-total correlations. Sensitivity of the ThyPRO-39 domain scores was determined by performing known group comparisons by independent t test. The internal consistency reliability was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Results: Significant floor effects were observed in 9 out of 13 domains of the ThyPRO-39. The hypothesized correlations between similar constructs in the ThyPRO-39 and the SF-12v2 and SF-6D were generally observed, supporting convergent validity. The internal construct validity was supported in most items, except eight items in six scales. Scale score of hyperthyroid symptoms of the ThyPRO-39 was significantly higher in the group with Graves’ disease or hyperthyroid disease than the group without Graves’ disease nor hyperthyroid disease. Scale scores of eye symptoms and impaired daily life were significantly higher in the incidental group than the non-incidental group. For six domains (hyperthyroid symptoms, hypothyroid symptoms, eye symptoms, tiredness, depressivity, and emotional susceptibility), Cronbach’s alpha did not reach the recommended standard of 0.7. Conclusions: This was the first psychometric study to translate and adapt the ThyPRO-39 instrument for non-Caucasian patients, and report its validity and reliability for use in Chinese patients with benign thyroid diseases. Given the low item-total correlations in eight items and low internal consistency reliability in respective scales of the ThyPRO-39, we suggest that the improvement of those eight items should produce a more valid and reliable ThyPRO-39 instrument. ? 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Chinese; Quality of life; ThyPRO; Thyroid,"adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Chinese; comparative study; construct validity; controlled study; convergent validity; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; female; fine needle aspiration biopsy; Graves disease; health survey; human; internal consistency; item total correlation; major clinical study; male; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; psychometry; quality of life; Short Form 12; teaching hospital; thyroid disease; Thyroid specific Patient Reported Outcome short form; Asian continental ancestry group; comprehension; evaluation study; language; middle aged; patient-reported outcome; psychology; publication; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; thyroid disease; translating (language); validation study; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Comprehension; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thyroid Diseases; Translating; Translations; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045624026

We explored the impact of HBV carrier status on outcomes of surgical treatment of colorectal liver metastases. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for consecutive patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal liver metastases from 2000 to 2016. HBV carriers were matched with controls by propensity scoring. Results: 304 patients with known HBV carrier status who underwent resection of colorectal liver metastases were studied. From the 21 (6.9%) hepatitis B carriers, a more prolonged prothrombin time (12.1 vs. 11.3?s, OR 1.42, p?=?0.027) was observed, and fewer major resections were performed (19.0 vs. 47.3%, OR 0.262, p?=?0.018). After 1:5 propensity score matching, they were compared with 105 controls with similar liver function, tumour status and receiving similar treatments. Patients with chronic hepatitis B enjoyed better median?disease-free survival (15.8 vs. 9.20?month, p?=?0.032). Overall survivals (50.0 vs. 43.6?month, p?=?0.15) were similar.

Over the past decade, the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the five HNA systems have been evaluated. Although the HNA system is less polymorphic than human leukocyte antigens (HLA), significant differences in the genotypic and allele frequencies still exist in different populations, even those living in close proximity. Objectives: To delineate HNA genotypic and allele frequencies to provide vital information on estimating the risk of HNA-associated diseases for our local population. Methods: Using a validated, in-house-developed assay, genotyping for HNA-1, HNA-3, HLA-4 and HNA-5 was performed on 300 samples from Chinese blood donors from Hong Kong. In addition, the frequency of the HNA-2 c.843A > T allele was also determined. Results: The allele frequencies of HNA-1a, -1b and -1c alleles were 67·8, 31·5 and 0%, respectively, whereas the frequencies of HNA-3a and HNA-3b were 71·0 and 29·0%, respectively. The frequencies of HNA-4a and -4b alleles were 99·5 and 0·5%, respectively, and for HNA-5a and -5b, alleles were 85·2 and 14·8%, respectively. Homozygotes for the HNA-2 c.843 TT variant were absent in our population, whereas only <4% of the population were c.843AT heterozygote carriers. Conclusions: This is the first study to define HNA genotype and allele frequencies using a validated modified in-house PCR-SSP method in the Hong Kong Chinese blood donor population. Our approach provides a cost-effective assay for conducting routine HNA typing and facilitates the incorporation of these assays into routine clinical service. Our results are comparable with those reported in the Guangzhou Chinese population, but the allele frequencies in our Hong Kong Chinese population are significantly different from the reported European frequencies, confirming that a geographical difference exists for HNA allele frequencies. ? 2017 British Blood Transfusion Society",allele frequencies; gene frequencies; geographical difference; human neutrophil antigens,antigen; HLA antigen; alloantigen; Article; Chinese; gene frequency; genotype; heterozygote; homozygote; Hong Kong; human; human cell; neutrophil; prevalence; transfusion related acute lung injury; allele; Asian continental ancestry group; blood donor; genetics; polymerase chain reaction; Alleles; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Donors; Gene Frequency; Hong Kong; Humans; Isoantigens; Neutrophils; Polymerase Chain Reaction,2-s2.0-85039156880

Functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP) has been incorporated into sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish to enhance the remineralization process. NaF varnish with the adjunctive application of silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) solution is effective in arresting dentine caries. So far, there is no published randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of the adoption of AgNO 3 solution and NaF varnish containing fTCP in arresting dentine caries in preschool children. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a 25% AgNO 3 solution plus a 5% NaF varnish containing fTCP and a 25% AgNO 3 solution plus a 5% NaF varnish in arresting coronal dentine caries among preschool children when applied semi-annually over a 30-month period. Methods/design: This is a randomized, double-blind controlled trial. The null hypothesis tested is that no difference exists between the effectiveness of a 25% AgNO 3 solution plus a 5% NaF varnish with fTCP and a 25% AgNO 3 solution plus a 5% NaF varnish in arresting dentine caries in preschool children when applied semi-annually. According to the sample size calculation, approximately 2000 3- to 4-year-old kindergarten children will be screened, and at least 408 children with coronal dentine caries will be recruited. The children will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups via stratified randomization: group A - biannual application of a 25% AgNO 3 solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish, and group B - biannual application of a 25% AgNO 3 solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish with fTCP. Clinical examinations will be conducted every 6 months to assess whether the carious lesions have become arrested (primary outcome). Confounding factors, such as demographic background and oral hygiene behaviors, will be collected through a parental questionnaire. Discussion: The effectiveness of the topical application of a 25% AgNO 3 solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish with fTCP in arresting coronal dentine caries among preschool children remains unknown. Because the proposed caries-arresting methods are simple, noninvasive and low cost, these can be widely recommended for caries control in young children. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Children; Dental caries; Fluoride varnish; Functionalized tricalcium phosphate; Silver nitrate,"calcium phosphate; clinpro white varnish; fluoride varnish; nupro white varnish; silver nitrate; calcium phosphate; paint; silver nitrate; sodium fluoride; Article; child; clinical examination; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; dental caries; dental caries lesion; dental disease assessment; double blind procedure; follow up; human; lesions and defects; major clinical study; mouth hygiene; outcome assessment; periodontal disease; preschool child; randomized controlled trial; sample size; tooth discoloration; tooth status; dental caries; randomized controlled trial (topic); solution and solubility; Calcium Phosphates; Child, Preschool; Dental Caries; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Paint; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sample Size; Silver Nitrate; Sodium Fluoride; Solutions",2-s2.0-85049505206

This study examined costs, length of stay and the predictors of high costs during an ACS hospitalization. Methods and results: Data for patients hospitalized for an ACS (n = 12,922) were collected on demographics, medical history, event characteristics, socioeconomic and insurance status at discharge. Patients were followed up at 6 weeks' post-hospitalization for an ACS event to assess associated treatment costs from a health sector perspective. Primary outcome was the incurring of costs in the highest quintile by country and index event diagnosis, and identification of associated predictors. Cost data were available for 10,819 patients. Mean length of stay was 10.1 days. The highest-cost countries were China, Singapore, and South Korea. Significant predictors of high-cost care were age, male sex, income, country, prior disease history, hospitalization in 3 months before index event, no dependency before index event, having an invasive procedure, hospital type and length of stay. Conclusions: Substantial variability exists in healthcare costs for hospitalized ACS patients across Asia. Of concern is the observation that the highest costs were reported in China, given the rapidly increasing numbers of procedures in recent years. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Acute coronary syndrome; Asia; Costs; Health insurance; Hospitalization,acute coronary syndrome; adult; age; Article; Asia; China; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; country economic status; demography; female; follow up; health care cost; health insurance; hospital; hospitalization cost; human; invasive procedure; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; observational study; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; sex; Singapore; South Korea; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; unstable angina pectoris; acute coronary syndrome; aged; clinical trial; comparative study; economics; health care disparity; health care quality; hospital cost; hospitalization; multicenter study; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Aged; Asia; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Process Assessment (Health Care); Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85049501445

Method: Multiple qualitative methods, including focus groups, individual in-depth interviews, and photovoice, were applied within the framework of constructivist grounded theory and collaborative research. Results: Diverging from conceptualizations of user participation with emphasis on civil rights and the individual as a central agent, participants in the study highlighted the interpersonal dynamics between service users and different players affecting the participation intensity and outcomes. They valued a reciprocal relationship with their caregivers in making treatment decisions, cooperated with staff to observe power hierarchies and social harmony, identified the importance of peer support in enabling service engagement and delivery, and emphasized professional facilitation in advancing involvement at the policy level. Conclusions: User participation in Chinese culture embeds dynamic interdependence. The proposed model adds this new dimension to the existing frameworks and calls for attention to the complex local ecology and cultural consistency in realizing user participation. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chinese culture; mental health service; recovery; User participation model,adult; attention; caregiver; civil rights; ecology; facilitation; female; grounded theory; human; human experiment; information processing; interview; male; mental health service; peer group; qualitative analysis; staff; adolescent; Asian continental ancestry group; China; mental disease; middle aged; patient participation; professional-patient relationship; psychology; social support; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Female; Grounded Theory; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Patient Participation; Peer Group; Professional-Patient Relations; Social Support; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85038858901

It is hypothesised that Cantonese speakers with left-hemisphere (LH) stroke would perform worse than those with right hemisphere (RH) stroke and normal controls. Specific linguistic factors of Cantonese might affect results in the tasks. Method: Fifteen participants with LH stroke, 10 with RH stroke and 25 healthy controls were tested with auditory–verbal immediate serial recall (ISR) tasks and auditory linguistic tasks. All stroke participants were assessed with the Cantonese version of Western Aphasia Battery (CAB). Result: The LH group performed significantly worse than the RH and healthy control groups in the auditory verbal ISR and auditory linguistic tasks. There were significant lexicality, frequency and imageability effects in most tasks. Auditory discrimination and word comprehension tasks, but not the auditory word recognition task had correlations with ISR tasks. Conclusion: Verbal STM and language performance of Cantonese-speakers with history of LH stroke were inferior to RH stroke and healthy controls.

It was found that LGG and EcN supernatants differentially modulated MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA and protein, and total mucin-like glycoprotein secretion. Regarding modulation of cytokine profiles, LGG supernatants moderately influenced the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-10, while those of EcN exerted a broad proinflammatory effect to intestinal epithelial cells by inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, transforming growth factor α, tumor necrosis factor α, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interferon γ. These results suggested that LGG and EcN might produce different bioactive products that display differential modulation of mucin and cytokines, which may contribute to intestinal health and/or defense against bacteria/pathogens. Practical Application: The results suggested that LGG and EcN might produce different bioactive products that display differential modulation of mucin and cytokines, which may contribute to intestinal health and/or defense against bacteria/pathogens. ? 2018 Institute of Food Technologists?",cytokine; Escherichia coli Nissle 1917; intestinal immune response; Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG; mucins,"cytokine; gamma interferon; mucin; probiotic agent; TGFA protein, human; transforming growth factor alpha; tumor necrosis factor; chemistry; drug effect; epithelium cell; Escherichia coli; HT-29 cell line; human; intestine; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; metabolism; Cytokines; Epithelial Cells; Escherichia coli; HT29 Cells; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Intestines; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Mucins; Probiotics; Transforming Growth Factor alpha; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85049835992

We examined the association of in utero GDM exposure with adiposity from infancy to adolescence, and whether any association was modified by breastfeeding during early infancy. Methods: In the prospective Chinese birth cohort “Children of 1997” (n = 7342, 88% follow-up rate), generalised estimate equations with multiple imputation were used to assess associations of in utero GDM exposure with age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z-score during infancy (3 and 9 months), childhood (2– < 8 years) and adolescence (8–16 years), adjusted for sex, parity, maternal age, birth place, preeclampisa, smoking, and family socio-economic position. We also tested whether the associations differed by mode of infant feeding (always formula-fed, mixed, always breastfed) during the first three months of life. Results: In utero GDM exposure (7.5%) was associated with a lower BMI z-score during infancy (?0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.22, ?0.05) but higher BMI z-scores during childhood (0.14, 95% CI 0.03, 0.25) and adolescence (0.25 95% CI 0.11, 0.38). Breastfeeding for the first three months did not modify the association of in utero GDM status with subsequent BMI (all p values for interaction >0.4). Conclusions: In utero GDM exposure was associated with greater adiposity during childhood and adolescence. Breastfeeding in early infancy from mothers with GDM was not associated with greater adiposity in children and thus should still be encouraged. ? 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"adolescence; adult; age; Article; artificial milk; birth weight; birthplace; body mass; breast feeding; childhood; cohort analysis; disease association; female; follow up; human; infancy; infant feeding; maternal age; maternal smoking; medical history; obesity; parity; perinatal period; preeclampsia; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prenatal exposure; priority journal; prospective study; sex difference; smoking; social status; adolescent; breast feeding; child; childhood obesity; China; infant; infant nutrition; male; mother; newborn; obesity; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prenatal exposure; preschool child; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adiposity; Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Breast Feeding; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mothers; Pediatric Obesity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85047122986

Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the survival and death of these cells. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is triggered by various cellular stresses that disturb protein folding in the ER. Cells cope with ER stress by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), a homeostatic signaling network that orchestrates the recovery of ER function. In the present study, we hypothesized that ER stress may upregulate the expression of transient receptor potential channel TRPV6, which in turn serves to protect human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) from ER stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Indeed, we found that ER stress induced by thapsigargin and tunicamycin led to increased expression of TRPV6 via ATF6α signaling branch. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPV6 aggravated ER stress-induced apoptotic cell death, whereas overexpression of TRPV6 attenuated ER stress-induced apoptosis in hESC-CMs. Furthermore, the signaling pathway downstream of TRPV6 was MAPK-JNK. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that, under ER stress, TRPV6 is upregulated to protect hESC-CMs from apoptotic cell death via ATF6α-TRPV6-JNK pathway. ? 2018",ATF6; ER stress; Human embryonic stem cells; JNK signaling pathway; TRPV6 channel,"activating transcription factor 6; activating transcription factor 6alpha; small interfering RNA; stress activated protein kinase; thapsigargin; tunicamycin; unclassified drug; vanilloid receptor 6; activating transcription factor 6; ATF6 protein, human; calcium; calcium channel; TRPV6 protein, human; vanilloid receptor; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell protection; controlled study; embryo; endoplasmic reticulum stress; human; human cell; human embryonic stem cell; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; upregulation; analysis of variance; apoptosis; cell line; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene knockdown; gene vector; genetics; MAPK signaling; metabolism; physiology; protein folding; unfolded protein response; Activating Transcription Factor 6; Analysis of Variance; Apoptosis; Calcium; Calcium Channels; Cell Line; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Genetic Vectors; Human Embryonic Stem Cells; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Myocytes, Cardiac; Protein Folding; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; TRPV Cation Channels; Unfolded Protein Response",2-s2.0-85047102161

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 1700 Asian people with Type 2 diabetes were followed for a mean of 6.3 years in a regional hospital in Singapore. Incident end-stage renal disease was identified by linkage with a national renal registry. The association of baseline fibroblast growth factor 21 levels with risk of progression to end-stage renal disease was studied using survival analyses. Results: Participants were aged 60 ± 10 years, with an average diabetes duration of 12 years. Their estimated GFR was 73 ± 28 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 62% had albuminuria at baseline. A total of 179 incident end-stage renal disease cases were identified. Plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 interacted with sex in its association with end-stage renal disease (Pinteraction = 0.003). A 1-sd increment in fibroblast growth factor 21 (natural log-transformed) was associated with a 1.32-fold (95% CI 1.05–1.66, P = 0.02) increased hazard for end-stage renal disease in women, after adjustment for traditional risk factors including estimated GFR and albuminuria. Taking death as a competing risk did not materially change the outcome [sub-distribution hazard ratio 1.35 (95% CI 1.11–1.66, P = 0.003)]. Fibroblast growth factor 21 did not predict end-stage renal disease risk in men after adjustment for baseline estimated GFR and albuminuria [hazard ratio 1.07 (95% CI 0.89–1.28, P = 0.49)]. Conclusions: Plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 level independently predicted risk of progression to end-stage renal disease in women with Type 2 diabetes.

The POTE family is composed of many proteins which are very closely related and expressed in prostate, ovary, testis, and placenta. Some POTE paralogs are related with some cancers. Here we showed that down-regulation of POTEG was detected in about 60% primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumor tissues. Clinical association studies determined that POTEG down-regulation was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, lymph nodes metastasis and TNM staging. Kaplan-Meier analysis determined that POTEG down-regulation was associated with poorer clinical outcomes of ESCC patients (P = 0.026). Functional studies showed that POTEG overexpression could suppress tumor cell growth and metastasis capacity in vitro and in vivo. Molecular analyses revealed that POTEG downregulated CDKs, leading to subsequent inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, and consequently arrested Cell Cycle at G1/S Checkpoint. POTEG overexpression induced apoptosis by activating caspases and PARP, and regulating canonical mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. On the other side, POTEG inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition and suppressed tumor cell metastasis. In conclusion, our study reveals a functionally important control mechanism of POTEG in esophageal cancer pathogenesis, suggesting potential use in the ESCC intervention and therapeutic strategies. ? 2018 The Authors.

The prevalence of hyperphagia varies among studies, but there has been no systematic review or meta-analysis. Methods: An extensive search on the literature on hyperphagia in AD published between 1 January 1980 and 30 October 2017 was conducted. Data on the prevalence were retrieved. Meta-analysis with a random effect model was performed to determine the pooled estimate of prevalence. Meta-regression analysis was performed based on study characteristics, population demographics, or condition information. Results: Results from 20 studies were extracted. Twenty-six reported cases of hyperphagia were identified. The mean age of onset was 70.7 ± 8.9 years, with a male predominance (68.4%). Hyperphagia occurred in all stages of AD. Only eight studies reported the prevalence of hyperphagia. Meta-analysis showed a pooled prevalence of hyperphagia of 18.6%. Publication bias may have been present. Meta-regression showed that ethnicity accounted for the variance among studies (coefficient: ?1.247 (95% confidence interval: ?1.978 to ?0.516), R2 analogue: 0.77, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Hyperphagia occurs in all stages of AD. In this meta-analysis of eight published studies, the prevalence of hyperphagia was 18.6%. In view of the possible publication bias, a large-scale study on hyperphagia is recommended in the future. ? 2018 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society",aged; Alzheimer’s disease; hyperphagia; Kl?ver–Bucy syndrome; prevalence,age distribution; Alzheimer disease; Article; clinical feature; dementia; demography; disease duration; ethnic difference; human; hyperphagia; meta analysis; Mini Mental State Examination; onset age; prevalence; priority journal; sex difference; systematic review; aged; Alzheimer disease; comorbidity; female; hyperphagia; male; middle aged; prevalence; psychology; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Hyperphagia; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence,2-s2.0-85041616623

The 74 preliminary items derived from the existing literature were reduced to 55 items based on expert panel review which included those with expertise in PH, psychometrics and medical education, as well as medical students. Psychometric properties of the preliminary questionnaire were assessed as follows: frequency of endorsement for item variance; principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation for item reduction and factor estimation; Cronbach's Alpha, item-total correlation and test-retest validity for internal consistency and reliability. Results: PCA yielded five factors: PH Learning Experience (6 items); PH Risk Assessment and Communication (5 items); Future Use of Evidence in Practice (6 items); Recognition of PH as a Scientific Discipline (4 items); and PH Skills Development (3 items), explaining 72.05% variance. Internal consistency and reliability tests were satisfactory (Cronbach's Alpha ranged from 0.87 to 0.90; item-total correlation > 0.59).

Conventional studies of the epidemiology of COPD involved large patient number and immense resources and were difficult to be repeated. The present study aimed at assessing the utilization of a computerized data management system in the collection and analysis of the epidemiological and clinical data of a large COPD cohort in Hong Kong (HK). Patients and methods: It was a computerized, multicenter, retrospective review of the characteristics of patients discharged from medical departments of the 16 participating hospitals with the primary discharge diagnosis of COPD in 1 year (2012). Comparison was made between the different subgroups in the use of medications, ventilatory support, and other health care resources. The mortality of the subjects in different subgroups was traced up to December 31, 2014. The top 10 causes of death were analyzed. Results: In total, 9,776 subjects (82.6% men, mean age =78 years) were identified. Of the 1,918 subjects with lung function coding, 85 (4.4%), 488 (25.5%), 808 (42.1%), and 537 (28.0%) subjects had the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 1, 2, 3, and 4 classes, respectively. Patients with higher GOLD classes had higher number of hospital admissions, longer hospital stay, increased usage of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), combinations of long-acting bronchodilators, and higher mortality. Of the 9,776 subjects, 2,278 (23.3%) received NIV, but invasive mechanical ventilation was uncommon (134 of 9,776 subjects [1.4%]); 4,427 (45.3%) subjects had died by the end of 2014. The top causes of death were COPD, pneumonia, lung cancer, and other malignancies. Conclusion: Patients admitted to hospitals for COPD in HK had significant comorbidities, mortality, and imposed heavy burden on health care resources.

After internship, 7 years of general surgical training is required to obtain registration and fellowship qualifications of the College of Surgeon of Hong Kong and Edinburg. After having become a specialist in general surgery, the surgeon could choose to specialize in colorectal surgery with an additional 3 to 5 years of specialist training in an accredited centre and 6 months of overseas training with subsidies. On the contrary, China has more than 600 medical schools, and students can enroll in different programs to become a medical practitioner.

Vast amounts of resources are being invested to strengthen the quality and to advance the technology used in patient care, not only by supporting basic and clinical research but also by providing extra resources to “import” experts and help develop services with clinical excellence. To accomplish this, the aim of the “three fames project” with a 5-year funding of 3 million United States dollar is to invite overseas experts to help build medical teams in specific areas.

The difficulty of accessing the intrathoracic organs through the bony rib-cage has been a challenge for thoracic surgeons. In the past, large incisions stretching across the chest, such as posterolateral thoracotomies with rib spreading was the standard approach to access the lungs. These methods cause large amounts of trauma to the patient, with high rates of mortality and morbidity. However, with the advances in technology and the improvements in surgical technique, thoracic surgery has progressed to minimise trauma to the patient while still maintaining oncological and surgical principles. State-of-the-art technology, combined with wide variety of old and new surgical techniques give the thoracic surgeon a formidable armamentarium. Although there has been a focus on reducing the number and size of surgical wounds, considerations other than surgical approach can reduce the trauma suffered by the patient. Preservation of pulmonary function via organ preservation and anaesthetic techniques to further minimise the systemic inflammation such as non-intubated anaesthesia have also been shown to improve patient outcomes.

Objective: We investigated the prevalence, severity and management of pain in advanced CKD patients attending Renal Palliative Care out-patient clinics under our Division. Methods: Consecutive patients referred to the Renal Palliative Care Clinics at two hospitals under our Division from July 2012 to June 2016 were included. All the patients were managed according to a multi-disciplinary protocol led by palliative care specialists, including serial assessments with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System. Measurements: Response to pain management was defined as a difference by 2 points or more, and factors predictive of response were assessed by logistic regression. Results: Data from 253 patients were analyzed. Of them 107 patients (42%) experienced pain symptoms: 45 patients (42.1%) rated their pain as mild (score 0-3), 51 (47.7%) as moderate (NRS score 4-6), and 11 (10.2%) as severe (score 7-10) by using numerical rating scale. The response rate to pain management was 53.2%. Neuropathic pain was a predictor for lack of response. Discussion: Pain is common in advanced CKD patients receiving palliative care.

Hong Kong is a unique developed setting to study how household income and adolescent adiposity vary by migrant status given many Hong Kong-born Chinese children were born to parents who migrated from neighboring provinces of Mainland China. Subjects/methods: We examined differences between the associations of absolute household income vs. relative household income on adolescent body mass index (BMI) z-score or overweight (including obesity) status using a linear or logistic model in a Chinese birth cohort (n = 5613, 68% follow-up). We focused on whether the associations differed by mother's or father's migrant status (birthplace). Results: No association was found between absolute household income and BMI z-score among adolescents with either native or migrant mothers. However, the association of relative household income with BMI z-score varied by mother's migrant status (P-values for interaction <0.0005). In adolescents of native born mothers, greater relative household income deprivation was associated with higher BMI z-score (0.03 z-score per USD 128 difference in Yitzhaki index, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.05). However, in adolescents of migrant mothers, greater relative household income deprivation was associated with lower BMI z-score (-0.05, 95% CI-0.09 to-0.01). Similar association of relative household income with overweight (including obesity) status was found in adolescents of native born mothers but not in adolescents of migrant mothers. Conclusions: Relative income (mediated by social comparisons with others in society) appears to be relevant to adolescent adiposity, but the association depends on the interplay between individual characteristics (migrant background) and societal context. ? 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,adolescent; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; educational status; female; follow up; health care; Hong Kong; household income; human; indigenous people; major clinical study; male; maternal attitude; migrant; obesity; priority journal; young adult; body mass; child parent relation; childhood obesity; China; cohort analysis; health survey; migration; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Adiposity; Adolescent; Adult; Body Mass Index; China; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Pediatric Obesity; Socioeconomic Factors; Transients and Migrants,2-s2.0-85048462777

However, this neglects the processes in the developmental origins of tissues and organs, between 8 and 28 weeks of early life, which are driven by the cellular harnessing of physical and mechanical force fields. The learning from early development process in the embryo and fetus promises faster, and facile replacements with accurate anatomical complexity. This can be achieved via the replication of five essential embryonic and fetal cell and tissue dynamic operations: invagination, E-M and M-E transitions, condensation and fusions. Moreover, with the recent evolution of structured biomaterials possessing physical and mechanical actuating elements, it is feasible to manufacture material systems that can impose variable physical constraints on cell functions and generate tissue realistic patterns. In this review, we explain the lessons that can be learned from the nature of physical and mechanical force fields exerted in cell group dynamic operations during embryogenesis and how these form simple anatomic tissue structures such as, cell sheets and cell condensates. Then, we highlight some recent materials bioengineering simulations of events during embryology and fetal development and produce tissue products with prospects for human therapy. Moreover, the manufacture of development inspired tissue products has been enhanced via microfluidic engineering, 3D printing, encapsulation techniques, self-organization, self-templating materials chemistry, fashioned to build developmentally significant biomaterial based systems. ? 2017",Bio-inspired engineering; Biomaterials; Embryology; Mesenchymal condensation; Mesenchymal–epithelium transition; Regenerative therapy; Self-assembly; Self-organization; Tissue complexity; Tissue morphogenesis,,2-s2.0-85044459332

The supernatants were collected to infect LO2 and MIHA cells, respectively. The expression of wt-HBx and tHBxΔ35 was detected by fluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis. The effect of HBx and tHBxΔ35 on the proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis was analyzed by cell counting, MTS, and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS The recombinant lentiviral vectors were successfully constructed. The proliferation of liver cells infected with tHBxΔ35 was significantly increased, compared with HBx or CTRL infected cells, while the proliferation of liver cells infected with HBx was decreased compared with tHBxΔ35 or CTRL infected cells (P &lt; 0.05). tHBxΔ35 improved the number of cells in S phase, while HBx induced G0/G1-S cell cycle arrest.

Many clinical trials and real-world studies have described the safety data for individual PIs. We aimed to review the safety of both the first and second generation PIs in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Areas covered: The unique pharmacokinetic properties of PIs partly explain their toxicities. Second generation PIs, when used without interferon and ribavirin, are well-tolerated. Use of PIs in renal impaired patients or those on dialysis appears to be safe. Decompensated cirrhosis is a contraindication for PIs use due to increased drug exposure and risk of liver decompensation. Drug-drug interactions are common and should be always monitored; some drugs should not be co-administered with PIs. In patients with co-infected hepatitis B virus, reactivation after DAA (whether PI-containing or not) is a concern. Expert opinion: Second generation PIs are key players in the current DAA era. Post-marketing surveillance is essential to monitor unknown adverse events and drug–drug interactions. Non-PI based DAA should be used in decompensated liver disease. The use of these drugs should also be explored in the paediatric population. ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chronic kidney disease; cirrhosis; direct acting antiviral; drug interaction; hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C virus; protease inhibitor; safety,"nonstructural protein 3; proteinase inhibitor; antivirus agent; proteinase inhibitor; anemia; antiviral therapy; area under the curve; chronic hepatitis B; chronic hepatitis C; decompensated liver cirrhosis; drug absorption; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug tolerability; dysgeusia; fatigue; geriatric patient; headache; hemodialysis patient; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; kidney failure; liver cirrhosis; maximum plasma concentration; mixed infection; papule; parkinsonism; pericarditis; photosensitivity; plasma concentration-time curve; portal vein thrombosis; protein targeting; rash; Review; thrombocytopenia; virus reactivation; chronic hepatitis C; drug effect; drug interaction; Hepacivirus; postmarketing surveillance; Antiviral Agents; Drug Interactions; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Protease Inhibitors",2-s2.0-85048015124

About 30-50% of the patients with colorectal cancer would develop liver metastasis in the course of their illness. About one-third of the metastatic liver lesions (CRM) are considered to be resectable, and long-term cure is not infrequently observed. Advances in the surgical management of CRM have certainly improved the chance of resection in recent years. While the selection criteria for open resection is becoming well established in most centers globally, the introduction of laparoscopy to liver resection has shown to be safe and feasible in many recent reported series. The controversy around the optimal approach for synchronous CRM remains unresolved, but the inception of laparoscopic liver surgery has favored the approach with simultaneous resections, especially when left lateral sectionectomy or other minor liver resections are required. On the other hand, various approaches have been proposed to improve the resectability rate for bilobar CRM. A two-stage hepatectomy was associated with a 5-year overall survival rate of up to 30-40%. Alternatively, the recently popularized ALPPS procedure conferred a 2-year overall survival rate of over 50%. For unresectable bilobar CRM, liver transplantation has been proposed to be an effective treatment under stringent selection criteria that, in turn, offered a 5-year overall survival rate up to 60%. A randomized control trial to compare its efficacy with resection is currently underway, and the outcome of this study will be of significance to ascertain its role in the surgical management of CRM. ?

Not only should the treatment achieve good local disease control and favorable survival; but the body functions should also be preserved. Since the introduction of abdominoperineal resection by Sir Ernest Miles for rectal cancer resection more than a century ago, the operation had been the gold standard treatment for rectal cancer until the recent 2-3 decades. However, both the oncologic and functional outcomes of conventional abdominoperineal resection have been far from satisfactory. The introduction of total mesorectal excision by Sir Richard Heald revolutionized the surgical treatment for rectal cancer. He postulated that most of the local recurrence was due to the incomplete excision of the mesorectum. He introduced sharp mesorectal excision along the embryonic plane in rectal resection. Sphincter preservation was achieved by close shave anterior resection. In addition, identification and preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves could be facilitated with sharp dissection in the relatively bloodless operating field. A very low local recurrence rate and a favorable survival were demonstrated in Heald's early reports. The technique could be learned and attained by training through workshops and live demonstrations. Currently total mesorectal excision is regarded as the gold standard surgical technique for rectal cancer. The principles of the operation also form the basis of minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopic, robotic, and transanal approaches. ? Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

Integrating a diabetes risk score into a mobile app would provide a useful platform to enable people to self-assess their risk of diabetes with ease. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the profile of Diabetes Risk Score mobile app users, (2) determine the optimal cutoff value of the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score to identify undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes in the Chinese population, (3) estimate users’ chance of developing diabetes within 2 years of using the app, and (4) investigate high-risk app users’ lifestyle behavior changes after ascertaining their risk level from the app. Methods: We conducted this 2-phase study among adults via mobile app and online survey from August 2014 to December 2016. Phase 1 adopted a cross-sectional design, with a descriptive analysis of the app users’ profile. We used a Cohen kappa score to show the agreement between the risk level (as shown in the app) and glycated hemoglobin test results. We used sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve to determine the optimal cutoff value of the diabetes risk score in this population. Phase 2 was a prospective cohort study. We used a logistic regression model to estimate the chance of developing diabetes after using the app. Paired t tests compared high-risk app users’ lifestyle changes. Results: A total of 13,289 people used the app in phase 1a. After data cleaning, we considered 4549 of these as valid data. Most users were male, and 1811 (39.81%) had tertiary education or above. Among them, 188 (10.4%) users agreed to attend the health assessment in phase 1b. We recommend the optimal value of the diabetes risk score for identifying persons with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes to be 9, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.67 (95% CI 0.60-0.74), sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.80), and specificity of 0.57 (95% CI 0.47-0.66). At the 2-year follow-up, people in the high-risk group had a higher chance of developing diabetes (odds ratio 4.59, P=.048) than the low-risk group. The high-risk app users improved their daily intake of vegetables (baseline: mean 0.76, SD 0.43; follow-up: mean 0.93, SD 0.26; t81=–3.77, P&lt;.001) and daily exercise (baseline: mean 0.40, SD 0.49; follow-up: mean 0.54, SD 0.50; t81=–2.08, P=.04). Conclusions: The Diabetes Risk Score app has been shown to be a feasible and reliable tool to identify persons with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes and to predict diabetes incidence in 2 years. The app can also encourage high-risk people to modify dietary habits and reduce sedentary lifestyle. ?

Appropriate patient care is necessary to prevent adverse effects on dental oral health, dental disfigurement, and psychological well-being. Aim: This clinical report presents a 27-year-old Chinese male with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) and his restorative management. Case report: This clinical report presents a 27-year-old Chinese male with AI and his restorative management. Extraoral examination showed a skeletal class III profile and increased lower facial proportion. Intraorally, all the permanent dentition was hypoplastic with noticeable tooth surface loss and a yellowbrown appearance. This was complicated with a mild malocclusion and food packing on his posterior teeth. The patient wanted to improve his appearance and masticatory efficiency. Orthodontic treatment was performed to treat the mild malocclusion and create physiological interproximal spacing to minimize tooth preparation and facilitate oral hygiene. Conclusion: This report demonstrates how a multidisciplinary approach for the management of AI can achieve a predictable, functional, and esthetic outcome. Orthodontic treatment facilitated a conservative prosthodontic treatment outcome by selectively increasing interproximal space, minimizing tooth preparation, correcting posterior bilateral cross-bite, as well as an anterior reverse overjet and derotation of the canines. Clinical significance: This case report demonstrates the effective restoration of AI using a multidisciplinary approach to overcome crowding using a relatively conservative approach. ?

Method: This was a 10-year retrospective analysis in a tertiary referral center. Results: There were 184 patients recruited (primary liver transplantation [pLT]:salvage liver transplantation [sLT], 143:41). The median follow-up time was 79 months. Operation time was shorter in the pLT group than the sLT group (661 ± 164 minutes vs 754 ± 206 minutes; P =.01) and the blood loss was 3749 mL and 3545 mL for pLT and sLT, respectively (P =.735). The reoperation rate was 5.6% and 4.9%, respectively (P = 1.0). The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates from the time of transplantation for pLT and sLT were 84.1% versus 70.2% (P =.01) and 82.2% versus 65.8% (P =.01), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate from the time of primary treatment for sLT was 80.3% (P =.1).

Young age (P =.004) and microvascular permeation (P =.008) in the recurrent tumor were associated with HCC recurrence. Young age stands out to be the only independent factor associated with HCC recurrence. Conclusion: sLT is the treatment of choice for patients with recurrent HCC in regions of graft shortage. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"abdominal abscess; abdominal bleeding; adult; Article; bile leakage; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; chest infection; cholestasis; clinical outcome; controlled study; disease association; disease free survival; female; follow up; hepatic artery thrombosis; human; independent variable; intermethod comparison; kidney failure; liver cell carcinoma; liver transplantation; liver vein obstruction; major clinical study; male; middle aged; operation duration; operative blood loss; overall survival; pleura effusion; postoperative complication; priority journal; reoperation; retrospective study; salvage therapy; tertiary care center; tumor invasion; wound infection; liver cell carcinoma; liver transplantation; liver tumor; mortality; procedures; survival rate; tumor recurrence; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85046693736

Early recognition of high-risk patients enables timely critical care, but controversies existed in common scoring systems. No local data are available on their applicability and valid prognosticating factors; therefore, the aim of the present study was to improve triage and mortality. Patients and Methods: Fifty patients with FG from 2006 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographics, physiological and laboratory values, management options, and parameters in established scoring systems were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors via univariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the three commonest indexes were plotted to evaluate their diagnostic performance. Results: Mortality was 20 per cent, compatible with international literature. Nonsurvivors had greater median age (63 vs 53 years, P = 0.05), smoking habit (70 vs 30 per cent, P = 0.03), diabetes (80 vs 38 per cent, P = 0.03), immunosuppression (100 vs 68 per cent, P = 0.046), orchidectomy (30 vs 3 per cent, P = 0.022) and serum creatinine (1.2 vs 0.91 mg/dL, P = 0.042) and lower haematocrit (31 vs 36 per cent, P = 0.006). No survival benefit was observed in the construction of defunctioning stoma and suprapubic catheterization. For scoring systems, no difference in translated score levels was seen. The area under the curve of the FG severity index was 0.798, whereas that for the simplified and Uludag versions were 0.588 and 0.833, respectively; all were statistically not significant. Conclusion: Smokers and elderly, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients, those with a higher creatinine or lower haematocrit level and those requiring orchidectomy had a poorer prognosis and could benefit from intensive care. Current scoring systems either perform poorly or have troublesome frontline application.

Methods: A cohort of 1101 participants (84.4% of the recruited individuals) with impaired fasting glucose were recruited from three primary care clinics during regular follow-ups to monitor their chronic conditions. Baseline triglyceridaemic–waist phenotypes were divided into four groups: (1) normal waistline and triglyceride level (n = 252); (2) isolated central obesity (n = 518); (3) isolated high triglyceride level (n = 80); and (4) central obesity with high triglyceride level (i.e. hypertriglyceridaemic–waist phenotype) (n = 251). The presence of diabetes at follow-up was determined by fasting plasma glucose (? 7.0 mmol/l) and/or 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (? 11.1 mmol/l) and/or HbA1c (47.5 mmol/mol; ? 6.5%) according to American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions were established to assess the impact of different triglyceridaemic–waist phenotypes on time to diabetes onset. Results: After a mean follow-up period of 6.5 months (sd 4.7 months), the number of diabetes cases was significantly higher in the group with hypertriglyceridaemic–waist phenotype (52.2%) compared with the other three phenotype groups (group 1: 28.2%; group 2: 34.6%; group 3: 30.0%).

One of these departments, the clinical oncology department (COD), introduced systematic palliative care training for its oncologists since 2002. The COD was recognized as a European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Designated Centre of Integrated Oncology and Palliative Care since 2009. This retrospective cohort study aims to review the impact of integrative training and service on palliative care coverage and outcome. Methods: Clinical information, palliative service provision, and end-of-life outcomes of patients who passed away from lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, or breast cancer in the Hong Kong West public hospital network during July 2015 to December 2015 were collected. Results: A total of 307 patients were analyzed. Around half (49.2%) were attended primarily by COD, and 68.9% received palliative service. There are significantly fewer patients referred to palliative care from other departments (p < 0.001), with only 19.9% of this patient group receiving palliative referral. COD patients had longer palliative coverage before death (median 65?days versus 24?days, p < 0.001), higher chance of receiving end-of-life care at hospice units (36.4 versus 21.2%, p = 0.003), lower ICU admission (0.66 versus 5.1%, p = 0.02), and higher percentage of receiving strong opioid in the last 30?days of life (51.0 versus 28.9%, p < 0.001) compared to other departments. In multivariable analysis, COD being the primary care team (odds ratio 12.2, p < 0.001) was associated with higher palliative care coverage. Conclusion: The study results suggested that systematic palliative care training of oncologists and integrative palliative service model was associated with higher palliative service coverage and improved palliative care outcomes. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Hong Kong; Oncology; Palliative care; Patient outcome assessment,"antineoplastic agent; opiate; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; female; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical education; oncologist; priority journal; retrospective study; stomach cancer; terminal care; education; oncologist; outcome assessment; palliative therapy; procedures; public hospital; standards; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Male; Oncologists; Palliative Care; Patient Outcome Assessment; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85033678963

Utilizing ultra-short time-to-echo (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging, the UTE Disc Sign (UDS) (i.e., hypo/hyper-intense disc band) was developed and found to be more significantly related to pain and disability than the conventional T2-weighted (T2W) MRI. It has been hypothesized that the UDS may represent mineralized deposits in the disc. The following study addressed the relationship between disc calcification on plain radiographs to that of the UDS on MRI. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 106 Southern Chinese subjects (50% male; mean age 52.3?years). Standing lateral plain radiographs as well as T2W and UTE MRI of L1–S1 (n?=?530 discs) were performed of all subjects. Lateral radiographs were used to localize disc calcification of the lumbar spine, T2W MRI was utilized to assess disc degeneration based on a defined grading scheme, and the UTE MRI was implemented to detect the UDS (hyper- or hypo-intense band across a disc). Disc degeneration and UDS scores were summed to represent cumulative scores. Subject demographics and disability profiles (Oswestry Disability Index: ODI) were obtained. Results: Disc calcification on plain radiographs was observed in 33.9% of subjects (55.5% males; mean age 54.3?years), whereas UDS was noted in 40.5% of subjects (51.1% males; mean age 55.0?years). Of these subjects, 66.6% calcification and 74.4% UDS occurred at the three lowest lumbar levels, while multilevel calcification and UDS involved 19.4 and 39.5%, respectively. 72.2% of subjects with plain radiographic disc calcification had corresponding UDS on UTE MRI (p?<?0.001). Multilevel disc calcification on plain radiographs was associated with multilevel UDS (71.4%, p?<?0.001). Both the number of calcified disc levels on plain radiographs and the number of UDS levels were also significantly and positively correlated with each other (r?=?0.58, p?<?0.001). Subjects with disc calcification and positive UDS as well as individuals with increased disc degeneration scores on T2?W MRI were significantly older (p?<?0.05). The cumulative UDS score on UTE MRI significantly correlated with worse ODI scores (r?=?0.31; p?=?0.001), whereas cumulative disc calcification scores on plain radiographs did not (r?=?0.15; p?=?0.19). Conclusions: This is the first study to compare the UDS on UTE MRI with disc calcification on plain radiographs. Disc calcification was correlated with the UDS on UTE, suggesting that the UDS may represent disc calcification. However, UTE MRI appears to be a more sensitive imaging modality in identifying subtle and unique disc changes that may not be revealed on plain radiographs or conventional MRI. This disconnect may rationalize the significant correlation of UTE with disability in comparison with the conventional imaging, further stressing its potential clinical importance. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Calcification; Degeneration; Disc; Imaging; MRI; Pain; Spine; UDS; Ultra-short; UTE; X-ray,adult; Article; calcification; cross-sectional study; demography; female; human; intervertebral disk degeneration; intervertebral disk disease; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Oswestry Disability Index; priority journal; spine radiography; calcinosis; diagnostic imaging; intervertebral disk degeneration; lumbar vertebra; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; radiography; Calcinosis; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Radiography,2-s2.0-85030835000

Random cluster sampling design and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) MS criteria were adopted. Totally 737 adults participated in questionnaire survey and received waist circumference (WC) measurement. Among them 335 showed central obesity (WC?>?80 and 85?cm for women and men respectively). Subsequently 229 accepted blood test. Totally 71 participants met MS criteria, suggesting an overall prevalence of 14.1%. Both central obesity and MS increase sharply with age. Chi-square/ANOVA analyses revealed significant positive associations between central obesity with: being male, marital status being married/cohabit, lower education level, occupation as managers or housewives, and alcohol consumption. For MS, the significant positive correlates were: lower education level, occupation as service workers or housewives, lower income level, and alcohol consumption. After controlling for age, binary logistic regression analyses suggested the significant risk factors for central obesity were being male (OR?=?1.4), married/cohabit (OR?=?1.8), longer working hours (OR?=?1.5), eating less vegetables (OR?=?1.5), and alcohol consumption (OR?=?1.8). For MS, only alcohol consumption appeared to be a?significant risk factor (OR?=?2.3). Multivariate binary logistic regressions also supported that age group and alcohol consumption were significant predictors of MS. To conclude, adopting randomized cluster sampling and IDF criteria, the study revealed a prevalence rate of MS at 14.1%.

Preliminary data suggest that this phenotype has a blunted response to cognitive-behavioral therapy and actigraphy-derived sleep variables can be used as a substitute of polysomnography to predict treatment response. This secondary analysis aimed to determine whether insomnia with polysomnography-derived short sleep duration, defined as < 6?h, had a blunted response to active or placebo acupuncture and the use of actigraphy-derived sleep variables as predictors of treatment response. Data from three randomized, placebo-controlled trials of acupuncture for insomnia were analyzed. A reduction of Insomnia Severity Index score ? 8 points from baseline to 1-week posttreatment was used to define treatment response. Totally 185 subjects who had laboratory-based 1-night polysomnography for at least 7?h were included; 62 (33.5%) had polysomnography-derived sleep duration < 6?h, while 50 (27.0%) were classified as responders. Non-responders were significantly more likely to have below tertiary education (p = 0.04) and polysomnography-derived short sleep duration (p = 0.02), while baseline sleep-diary and actigraphy-derived total sleep time and sleep efficiency were not significant predictors. Multiple logistic regression showed that polysomnography-derived short sleep duration was the only significant predictor of treatment response (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.01, 4.91, p = 0.048).

The aim of this paper is to report patients who developed retrograde type A aortic dissection following initially successful hybrid endovascular treatment. METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively collected computerized departmental database. All patients with supra-Aortic hybrid endovascular surgery and post-procedure retrograde type A dissection were identified. Patient demographics, comorbid conditions, perioperative parameters, procedural details and post-operative complications were collected. RESULTS: From May 2005 to July 2014, 163 patients underwent thoracic aortic endovascular procedures at our institution. From the 46 patients who had supra-Aortic hybrid endovascular repair, six patients (6/46, 13% of all supra-Aortic hybrid cases, 3 males) developed retrograde type A aortic dissection. All were elective cases, with 3 chronic dissecting aneurysms and 3 atherosclerotic aneurysms. All had one-stage hybrid procedures: 2 patients had carotid-carotid bypass grafts, one had carotid-carotid-left subclavian bypass graft, and 3 had bypass grafts from ascending aorta to innominate artery and left carotid artery. Five patients had Cook Zenith thoracic stent-grafts (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA), and one had Medtronic Valiant stent-grafts (Medtronic Vascular Inc, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). The retrograde type A dissection occurred with sudden symptoms at day 5, 6, 10, 20, 105 and 128, respectively. There were 3 immediate fatalities and 2 patients treated conservatively deemed unfit for reintervention (one died of pneumonia at 9 months, and one remained alive at 7 months post-complication). One patient underwent successful emergency open surgery and survived. CONCLUSIONS: Supra-Aortic hybrid procedures in treating aortic arch pathology may be at risk of developing retrograde type A dissection.

Forty-eight human maxillary premolars with two roots were selected and endodontically treated. The teeth were randomly distributed into six equally sized groups (n?=?8) with different combinations of post lengths (7.5, 11, and 15?mm) and abutment heights (3 and 5?mm). All the teeth restored with glass fiber post (Rely X Fiber Post, 3M ESPE, USA) and a full zirconia crown. All the specimens were thermocycled and then loaded to failure at an oblique angle of 135°. Statistical analysis was performed for the effects of post length and abutment height on failure loads using ANOVA and Tukey’s honestly significant difference test. In addition, corresponding FE models of a premolar restored with a glass fiber post were developed to examine mechanical responses. The factor of post length (P?<?0.01) had a significant effect on failure load. The abutment height (P?>?0.05) did not have a significant effect on failure load. The highest mean fracture resistance was recorded for the 15?mm post length and 5?mm abutment height test group, which was significantly more resistant to fracture than the 7.5?mm post and 5?mm abutment height group (P?<?0.05). The FE analysis showed the peak compression and tension stress values of 7.5?mm post length were higher than that of 11 and 15?mm post length. The stress value of remaining tooth decreased as the post length was increased.

Design A total of 202 Chinese individuals aged 15 years and above were recruited from a population-based household survey. Their non-restorative sleep was assessed by a single item, the degree of feeling refreshed on waking up, on a 0-10 scale, while noise tolerance was measured by the most comfortable level expressed in A-weighted decibels. Results The 202 individuals (106 women) had a mean degree of feeling refreshed on waking up of 6.5 on the 0-10 scale and a mean maximum comfortable sound level of 69.2 dB. A multivariable analysis showed that a 1 dB increase in noise tolerance was associated with a 0.1-unit increase in the degree of feeling refreshed after adjusting for age, education, marital status, occupation, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, household noise level, stress, anxiety and depression. Moreover, housewives, non-smokers and individuals who were less anxious or stressed felt significantly more refreshed on waking up. Conclusion People with higher levels of noise tolerance experienced more refreshing sleep. Additional clinical consideration of enhancing noise tolerance in patients with sleep complaints is needed. ? 2018 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

The validity of this platform was assessed on six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines using different fluorescent dyes. Interestingly, it was found that the electroporation efficiency of these cells, i.e. the percentage of cells with membrane pores created, decreases significantly (from ?60% to 30%) as their resistivity against Erlotinib increases, demonstrating the potential of such approach as a screening tool for assessing drug resistance in tumours in the future. Furthermore, we showed that the inverse relationship between the electroporation efficiency and Erlotinib resistance is likely due to the fact that NSCLC cell lines with higher drug resistivity appear to have lower cortical tensions and hence make it harder for membrane pores to be created, consistent with existing electroporation theories. ? 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",cell mechanics; drug-resistance; Electroporation; nano-indentation,erlotinib; fluorescent dye; A-549 cell line; Article; cancer resistance; cell membrane; controlled study; electroporation; HCC827 cell line; lung non-small cell carcinoma cell line; MTT assay; NCI-H1975 cell line; NCI-H23 cell line; NCI-H3255 cell line; NCI-H358 cell line; screening; validity; WST assay,2-s2.0-85043495301

Approved by a local institutional review board, this study examined 20 parotid glands from 10 healthy volunteers (male:female = 6: 4; age ± standard deviation =35.1 ± 14.1?years) with written informed consent obtained. All participants underwent 1.5-T, double-echo EPI with gustatory stimulation. Semi-quantitative parameters, including maximal drop ratio (MDR), time to peak (TTP), drop slope (DS), recovery slope (RS) and recovery ratio (RR), were calculated. The effect of temporal resolution on parotid functional parameters was evaluated. An EMM comprising an output function (S0(t)=A0e-kot+B) and an input function (Sin(t)=Ain(1-e-kint was also applied to fit all dynamic curves. Kruskal–Wallis test, Wilcoxon test, linear regression analysis and goodness of fit were used for statistical analysis. p &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The signal intensity dropped significantly after gustatory stimulation on the proton density (PD) image (p &lt; 0.01). MDR was 8.26% in the PD image.

We conducted a two-wave longitudinal study over one summer peak season (May-July 2014) of HFMD to examine parents' HFMD-related risk perceptions and protective responses. In total, 618 parents with at least one child aged ?12 years, recruited using randomly-dialled household telephone calls completed the baseline survey interview, 452 of whom subsequently completed the follow-up survey. Around two-thirds of participants perceived the chance of their child being infected by HFMD was 'zero/very small/small' but the likelihood of being hospitalized once infected was 'somewhat likely/likely/very likely'. At follow-up, 82% reported washing child's hands frequently (Hygiene), 16% would keep their child away from school if HFMD cases were identified in school (Distancing) and 23% were 'very likely/certainly' to take the child for HFMD vaccination if available (Vaccination). Anticipated regret was consistently the strongest predictor for Hygiene (OR 3.34), and intention of Distancing (OR 2.58) and Vaccination (OR 3.16). Interventions focusing on anticipated regret may be effective to promote protective behaviour against HFMD among parents for their children.

This study reported our 5-year experience in the management of patients with nipple discharge, and our experience of mammography, ultrasonography, ductography, and nipple discharge cytology in an attempt to determine their role in the management of nipple discharge. Methods: Women who attended our Breast Clinic in a university-affiliated hospital in Hong Kong were identified by retrospective review of clinical data from January 2007 to December 2011. They were divided into benign and malignant subgroups. Background clinical variables and investigative results were compared between the two subgroups. We also reported the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the investigations that included mammography, ultrasonography, ductography, and cytology. Results: We identified 71 and 31 patients in the benign and malignant subgroups, respectively. The median age at presentation for the benign subgroup was younger than that of the malignant subgroup (48 vs 59 years; P=0.003). A higher proportion of patients in the malignant subgroup than the benign subgroup presented with bloodstained nipple discharge (87.1% vs 47.9%; P=0.002). Mammography had a specificity of 98.4% and positive predictive value of 66.7%; ultrasonography had a specificity of 87.0% and negative predictive value of 75.0%. Cytology and ductography were sensitive but lacked specificity. Ductography had a negative predictive value of 100% but a low positive predictive value (14.0%). Clinical variables including age at presentation, duration of discharge, colour of discharge, presence of an associated breast mass, and abnormal sonographic findings were important in suggesting the underlying pathology of nipple discharge. Multiple logistic regression showed that blood-stained discharge and an associated breast mass were statistically significantly more common in the malignant subgroup.

One year after the heart transplantation, he had exercise-induced transient muscle weakness with elevated creatine kinases (CKs). Muscle biopsy showed normal structures and normal dystrophin immunohistochemical labeling, but utrophin, which is an autosomal homologue of dystrophin, was overexpressed at sarcolemma. Sanger sequencing confirmed a heterozygous c.31 + 1G > A, 5′ splice site point mutation at the first intron of dystrophin gene. A review of previous reports of patients with different point mutations in the same region, the first exon-intron boundary that involved the muscle promotor to exon 1, confirmed a high correlation of cardiospecific phenotype sparing the muscles with this specific site of mutations. The confirmation of upregulation of brain and Purkinje isoforms of dystrophin protein in the skeletal muscles but not in the heart in past studies help to explain the skeletal sparing presentation. X-linked DCM (XLDCM) is an important cause of isolated cardiomyopathy. Routine immunohistochemical staining study including dystrophin in cardiac muscle biopsy, and dystrophin and utrophin labelling on skeletal muscle biopsy for patients with subsequent muscle symptoms or raised creatine kinases, help in the early diagnosis of the XLDCM. Future experimental study to determine the aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of this specific splice site mutation involving exon 1 and intron 1 will help to understand better the underlying complex mechanism of the splicing regulation.",dilated cardiomyopathy; dystrophin gene; splice site mutation; utrophin upregulation; X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy,creatine kinase; cyclosporine; dystrophin; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisolone; tacrolimus; utrophin; adolescent; Article; case report; clinical article; congestive cardiomyopathy; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; dystrophin gene; exercise; forced vital capacity; gene mutation; genetic counseling; heart muscle biopsy; heart transplantation; hemizygosity; hospital admission; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; intron; limb weakness; male; muscle biopsy; myalgia; postoperative period; upregulation; X chromosome linked disorder; X linked dilated cardiomyopathy,2-s2.0-85028343050

Not many studies have identified the demographic correlates of medication knowledge in psychiatric patients, and fewer have performed so for non-Western societies, which may present different results owing to distinct cultural factors. Our objective was to identify the demographic correlates of medication knowledge in early psychosis patients from Hong Kong. Methods: A short questionnaire comprising questions on six components of medication knowledge was administered to 105 consecutive early psychosis patients from an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. A suite of patient demographics was assembled from clinicians' records. Results: Poor medication knowledge was characterized by patients of older age (>30 years), low education level (?Form 3), overall negative family relationships (as compared with overall positive ones) and shorter treatment duration (?4 years). Shorter treatment duration most consistently predicted poor medication knowledge, displaying significant (P < 0.05) associations with four out of six knowledge components. Patients (54.3%) did not know the English names of their medication. Conclusions: Specific groups of early psychosis patients are at risk of having poor medication knowledge; these individuals should be identified to receive regular health education. Contrary to findings from non-psychosis groups, short treatment duration was unequivocally associated with poorer medication knowledge in patients with early psychosis. Local replacements for English medication names should be considered in non-English speaking societies, especially in areas of mental health treatment. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",medication knowledge; patient demographics; psychosis,"risperidone; neuroleptic agent; adult; age distribution; Article; controlled study; disease association; drug safety; educational status; family relation; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; medication compliance; medication error; patient compliance; patient education; priority journal; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; treatment duration; unspecified side effect; attitude to health; demography; psychology; psychosis; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Demography; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Psychotic Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84969909319

It is important to diagnose NMOSDs early as they are treatable. The majority of NMOSDs patients are seropositive for aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) autoantibodies, which target CNS aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expressed abundantly in astrocytic foot processes. We report the novel observation of orbital masses containing ectopic lymphoid follicles with germinal centres (GC) in two patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD. Both patients had severe extensive myelitis with symptomatic or asymptomatic ON, with the ectopic lymphoid structures detected on initial presentation. Histolopathological studies confirmed that the orbital masses contained reactive lymphoid follicles with GC containing B cells and plasma cells. Our observations support that AQP4-IgG positive NMOSDs patients have underlying AQP4 autoimmunity and suggest that ON (symptomatic or asymptomatic) may trigger formation of orbital ectopic GC contributing to development of high-affinity AQP4-specific memory B cells and plasma cells, which produce highly pathogenic AQP4-IgG. ? 2018 Chan, Lee, Lau and Loong.",Aquaporin 4; Autoimmunity; Ectopic lymphoid structures; Germinal center; Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder,antinuclear antibody; aquaporin 4 antibody; azathioprine; CD20 antigen; cytokeratin; double stranded DNA antibody; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisolone; rituximab; adult; aged; Article; autoimmunity; blindness; case report; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; conjunctival biopsy; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; eye surgery; female; germinal center; histopathology; homonymous hemianopia; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; limb weakness; liver disease; memory cell; myelooptic neuropathy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optic neuritis; orbitotomy; papilledema; paraplegia; plasma cell; plasmacytosis; plasmapheresis; pleocytosis; pneumonia; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; recurrent disease; respiratory failure; tertiary lymphoid structure; urine retention; visual evoked potential,2-s2.0-85040824439

OBI can be classified by serology. It can also be classified according to the medical history of the subjects. Majority of subjects with OBI have had chronic hepatitis B infection with subsequent loss of HBsAg during the natural history of disease or as a result of antiviral treatment. There are still challenges in diagnosing this condition in many service-based laboratories. The prevalence of OBI was estimated to be ranging from < 1 to 18% in general population. The HBV usually replicates at an extremely low level due to various postulated mechanisms. The clinical significance of OBI is particularly prominent in three main areas: (1) transmission of HBV through blood and organ donations, (2) development of chronic liver diseases and liver-related mortality and (3) HBV reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy. With the use of more potent immunosuppressive therapies including B-cell depleting agents, the disease manifestations become more apparent which require more research to establish clinical management guidelines. ?

We investigated the associations of living with smoker(s) with quitting in Chinese adult smokers. Methods: We examined both cross-sectional and prospective data in the Hong Kong Population Health Survey recruited participants in 2003/04, and followed up to 2006. Unconditional logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of (i) planning to quit, (ii) ex-smoking (cross-sectional), and quitting (prospective) for living with smoker(s). 1679 ever smokers aged 18+ years at baseline, and 323 of them who were successfully followed-up were included in the cross-sectional, and prospective analysis. Results: At baseline, living with smoker(s) was significantly associated with lower odds of planning to quit in current smokers (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.25-0.68), and lower odds of ex-smoking (AOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34-0.58), particularly if the smoker(s) smoked inside home (AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.26-0.47). Prospectively, living with smoker(s) non-significantly predicted lower odds of new quitting (AOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13-1.78). Conclusions: Our study has provided the first evidence in a Chinese general population that living with smoker(s) is an important barrier against smoking cessation. To boost quit rate in nonusers of smoking cessation services, smoking at home should be banned, especially for populations living in crowed urban environments that are typical of economically developed cities in China. ? 2018 by the authors.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) mononucleosis is a manifestation of primary CMV infection. This study aims to establish the link between long-term population CMV seroepidemiological trends and incidence of CMV mononucleosis requiring hospitalization. Furthermore, by analyzing serial laboratory data of patients hospitalized with CMV mononucleosis, we aim to provide insights into the natural history of this syndrome. Methods. We conducted a 14-year observational study in a tertiary hospital in Hong Kong. Cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G data of 2349 adults were analyzed for trends in CMV susceptibility during the study period. The clinical features, risk factors, antiviral treatment data, and laboratory findings of 25 adult patients presenting with CMV mononucleosis during this period were retrieved. Results. Susceptibility to CMV infection among the adult population aged 18-45 in Hong Kong increased from 14.5% in 2004 to 32.2% in 2012-2017 (P < .001), and this led to doubling of observed CMV mononucleosis incidence among inpatients in our center during the study period. All patients with CMV mononucleosis were hospitalized for investigation of fever of unknown origin. Household contact with young children was the most common risk factor followed by recent overseas travel. Derangement of liver function tests was universally observed and was more severe than in previously published western CMV mononucleosis patient cohorts. Most patients showed clinical improvement within the third week of illness. Conclusions. We conclude that increasing CMV susceptibility among young adults in Hong Kong has resulted in a rising observed incidence of CMV mononucleosis, which is typically a self-limited illness characterized by anicteric hepatitis. ?

Our control participants were all patients with skin infections in two 3-month periods, and sex-pair-matched patients with the same infections, who had not undergone dermatoscopy. Records of 523 study subjects were analyzed. Our first new finding was that dermatoscopy brought forward the diagnosis of herpes zoster by 1.62 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 0.34 days; z-score -2.18). Second, dermatoscopy facilitated the diagnosis of genital (P<.01) and small extragenital risk ratio [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.59) viral warts. Third, patients with genital herpes and/or genital warts and/or genital molluscum contagiosum diagnosed by clinical examination and dermatoscopy were significantly more willing to pay US$300 to investigate for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.18), and bring partners for investigation (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55), compared to patients diagnosed by clinical examination alone. We performed dermatoscope-guided laser ablation on viral warts, and dermatoscopy-guided excisional biopsy to confirm molluscum contagiosum.

A critical aspect to early detection and effective containment of communicable diseases lies at the heart of how we leverage different types of social media to promote public awareness and safety protocol for the general population as well as the health workforce for dealing with emerging communicable diseases in a timely manner. China consists of more than 100 cities with a population of over one million people each. Effective monitoring and public awareness of global epidemics and early detection to its possible transmission to local population is critical for China for monitoring the spread of communicable disease, which can potentially have deadly effect for the Chinese population and the world. The recent West African Ebola disaster deserves attention due to the number of annual arrivals from Africa and also significantly large Chinese employees engaged in African cooperative projects. Weibo, the most popular social media in China with more than 2 billion users and over 300 million daily posts can essentially serve as a platform monitoring, promoting of public health awareness as well as early detection of possible cases of Ebola. This, in turn, can provide an effective and timely alternative to improve the overall preparedness for and response to disaster medicine.

This study assessed the current BRCAmut testing patterns and explored physicians’ perspectives on the utilities and optimal sequencing of the testing, in order to facilitate and standardize testing practices. Methods: Medical specialists in BC and OC in Hong Kong were invited to complete a questionnaire on BRCAmut testing practices. A panel of specialists with extensive BRCAmut testing experience was also convened to develop consensus statements on testing, using the Delphi method and an anonymous electronic voting system. Results: The survey respondents (n?=?71) recognized family history (FH) of BC and/or OC and an early age of onset as key factors for referring BRCAmut testing. The proportion of respondents who would test all OCs regardless of FH or age, as per the recent international guideline, was low (28.2%). The largest hurdles to testing were the cost, as well as the availability of next-generation sequencing-accredited testing and genetic counseling facilities. The panelists suggested that the sequence of somatic testing followed by germline testing may help address both the imminent need of treatment planning and longer term hereditary implications. The potential emotional and financial burdens of BRCAmut testing should be weighed against the potential therapeutic benefits, and the type and timing of testing personalized. Conclusions: Accessibility of BRCAmut testing to all at-risk individuals will be achievable through improvements in testing affordability, as well as widened availability of accredited testing and genetic counseling facilities. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",DNA mutational analysis; genetic counseling; healthcare survey; ovarian cancer; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors; practice guideline,"BRCA1 protein; BRCA1 protein, human; BRCA2 protein; BRCA2 protein, human; adult; consensus; female; genetic screening; genetics; Hong Kong; human; molecularly targeted therapy; mutation; ovary tumor; patient selection; practice guideline; specialization; young adult; Adult; BRCA1 Protein; BRCA2 Protein; Consensus; Female; Genetic Testing; Hong Kong; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Ovarian Neoplasms; Patient Selection; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Specialization; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85062555972

Patients with oligometastatic disease were shown to demonstrate favorable outcome after local ablative therapy such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SBRT in patients with oligometastatic lung disease. Methods: Patients who received SBRT to metastatic lung disease up to four lesions on presentation between April 2013 and August 2014 were studied. 50 Gy was given in five fractions over 2 weeks. Primary endpoint was local control. Acute grade 2 and above toxicities according to CTCAE version 4.0 criteria were evaluated. Secondary endpoints included overall and disease-free survival. Results: Fourteen lung metastases in 12 patients were analyzed, and median follow up was 18.8 months (7.4 – 28.0). Most patients had solitary metastases at the time of treatment (n=10, 83%). One-and two-year local control were 91.7% and 51.6% respectively. Five out of 14 lesions achieved partial response, five attained static disease, and four lesions achieved complete remission as evident from CT or PET. 1-year and 2-year overall survival were 83.3% and 74.1% respectively. Disease-free survival was 75% at 1 year and 38.1% at 2 years. There was no Grade 2 or above toxicity noted. Most (83%) patients had no deterioration of ECOG performance status on serial follow up assessments. Conclusions: This study demonstrated excellent local control for patient with oligometastatic lung disease after SBRT with good survival outcomes.

Among a myriad of tools, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) is a previously-validated tool for prognostication. Objective: To review the effectiveness and limitations of different survival prediction tools, report our single center experience of using ESAS as survival predictor, and develop a simple prognostic tool suitable for clinical practice in a community palliative care center. Methods: All deceased patients aged 18 years of age or older, having a diagnosis of advanced, metastatic or incurable malignancies, and an ESAS completed in their first encounter at the Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong between September 2011 and October 2011 were included. Patient demographic and clinical data was collected retrospectively based on a rigorous chart review. Overall survival and a multivariate analysis evaluating prognostic factors was conducted. Results: ESAS records of 85 patients were included in our analysis. Median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 60 (range 30-100). Median ESAS score was 10 (range: 0-51), and median survival was 6.4 weeks (95% Cl: 5.3-9.6 weeks). Multivariate analysis suggested ESAS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.94) and KPS (HR 1.95) independently predicted overall survival. Three groups were stratified based on these prognostic factors: median survival of group 1 (ESAS < 25 and KPS ? 60), group 2 (either ESAS ? 25 or KPS < 60) and group 3 (ESAS ? 25 and KPS < 60) were 105 days, 20 days and 10 days, respectively. (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Our finding suggest that ESAS offers promising potential as a prognostication tool predicting survival. Its ease of use and dual role as both a symptom assessment and a survival estimation tool allows the ESAS to be seamlessly integrated into daily clinical practice. ?

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients who had previously undergone complete resection of the tumor for LSCC were studied retrospectively. The ILK expression level in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry. The changes of ILK expression from each group were assessed and correlated to the clinical parameters of the patients. Secondly, ILK antisense oligonucleotide (ILK-ASONS) was used to silence the ILK gene of LSCC cell from Hep-2 cell line. The expression of ILK, epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker Vimentin were evaluated by Western blotting. The proliferation of cells after transfection was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The migration and invasion activity of Hep-2 cells was detected by Matrigel invasion and cell migration assays. RESULTS: The expression of the ILK protein was significantly associated with tumor differentiation (p=0.046), lymph node metastasis (p=0.020) and pTNM stage (p=0.019). ILK ASONS-transfected cells showed a significant decrease in cell proliferation, cell migration and invasive activity compared to mock-transfected cells. ILK ASONS-transfected cells increased the expression of E-cadherin, whereas the expression of ILK and Vimentin decreased, compared with mock-transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of ILK was significantly correlated with differentiation and metastasis of the laryngeal carcinomas. The inhibition of the ILK gene could downregulate the proliferation, migration and invasion of Hep-2 cells. These findings suggest that the ILK gene could be a potential target for the treatment of laryngeal cancer. ? Verduci Editore s.r.l.

The non-specific clinical features of B12 deficiency and unreliable serum parameters make diagnosis difficult. We aimed to evaluate the value of oral “beefy red” patches as a clinical marker of B12 deficiency. Methods: A diagnostic study was conducted in patients complaining of oral soreness, burning sensation, or severe recurrent oral ulcers. Patients underwent clinical examination and laboratory investigations, including complete blood count and estimation of serum B12, folate, iron, and ferritin levels. Resolution of clinical signs and symptoms after 1 month of B12 supplement was regarded as the diagnostic gold standard. Results: Of 136 patients, 70 had B12 deficiency. Among these patients, the oral “beefy red” patch was observed in 61, abnormal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was noted in 30, and serum cobalamin levels <200 and <350 pg/mL were seen in 59 and 67 cases, respectively. The “beefy red” patch demonstrated the highest diagnostic validity (Youden index 0.84) and reliability (consistency 91.9% [95% CI: 87.3%–96.5%]), followed by the serum cobalamin levels and MCV. The combination of “beefy red” patch with cobalamin <350 pg/mL exhibited better diagnostic value than the combination of “beefy red” patch with cobalamin <200 pg/mL, with accuracy of 0.81 vs 0.74 and reliability of 90.4% (95% CI: 85.5%–95.4%) vs 86.8% (95% CI: 81.1%–92.5%).

This study reports results involving a large-scale territory-wide investigation on the impacts of ambient temperature and age–gender differences on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcome in Hong Kong. Methods: This study included 25,467 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases treated by the Hong Kong Fire Services Department between December 2011 and November 2016 inclusive. Simple correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases and temperature, age and gender. Calendar charts were used to visualise temporal patterns of pre-hospital emergency medical services related to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases. Results: A strong negative curvilinear relationship was found between out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and daily temperature (r2 &gt; 0.9) with prominent effects on elderly people aged ?85 years. For each unit decrease in mean temperature in °C, there was a maximum of 5.6% increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases among all age groups and 7.3% increase in the ?85 years elderly age group. Men were slightly more at risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared with women. The demand for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest–related emergency medical services was highest between 06:00 and 11:00 in the wintertime. Conclusion: This study provides the first local evidence linking weather and demographic effects with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Hong Kong. It offers empirical evidence to policymakers in support of strengthening existing emergency medical services to deal with the expected increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the wintertime and in regions with a large number of elderly population. ?

An effective treatment is lacking and is urgently needed. We evaluated two structurally similar natural compounds, morin and resveratrol, for treating tauopathy in JNPL3 P301L mutant human tau overexpressing mice. Rotarod tests were performed to determine effects on motor function. After treatment from age 11 to 14 months, brains of 26 mice were collected to quantify aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau by Thioflavin T and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and to quantify total tau (HT7 antibody) and hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8 antibody) in homogenates and a fraction enriched for paired helical filaments. Resveratrol reduced the level of total hyperphosphorylated tau in IHC sections (p=0.036), and morin exhibited a tendency to do so (p=0.29), while the two drugs tended to increase the proportion of solubilizable tau that was hyperphosphorylated, as detected in blots. Neither resveratrol nor morin affected motor function. One explanation of these results is that the drugs might interrupt a late stage in tau aggregation, after small aggregates have formed but before further aggregation has occurred. Further animal studies would be informative to explore the possible efficacy of morin or resveratrol for treating tauopathies. ? 2018 Kwun Chung Yu et al., published by De Gruyter.",Alzheimer's disease; flavonoid; frontotemporal dementia; neurodegeneration; neurofibrillary tangle; paired helical filament; tauopathy,morin; resveratrol; tau protein; thioflavine; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain homogenate; comparative study; controlled study; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; motor coordination; motor performance; mouse; nonhuman; paired helical filament; priority journal; protein aggregation; rotarod test; tauopathy,2-s2.0-85056896896

Methods: This was a single-centre retrospective study of patients with histologically proven GCTB. Clinical data of all patients treated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant denosumab according to a standardised protocol were reviewed. Duration of follow-up from the time of diagnosis ranged from 4 to 30 months. Clinical response in terms of pain reduction or functional improvement and major adverse drug effects were documented. Preand post-treatment tumour responses were evaluated using available radiographs, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images taken at irregular intervals. Concomitant histopathological evaluations of tissue samples were also conducted to assess the percentage of giant cells and de novo bone matrix. Results: A total of 12 patients received denosumab treatment for GCTB from 20 July 2012 to 5 June 2015. Among them, 10 (83.3%) patients had no tumour recurrence before September 2016; and 11 (91.6%) patients reported reduced pain or functional improvement with no major treatment complications. Excellent treatment response was achieved for 10 (90.9%) of 11 patients who underwent radiographic assessment and four (100%) of four patients who underwent CT assessment. Serial MRI assessments demonstrated tumour recurrence in two (18.2%) of 11 patients. Histopathological tumour response was observed in all patients. Conclusion: Denosumab is an efficacious treatment for GCTB in terms of clinical, radiological, and histopathological response, with no major complications documented in the present study. Radiography and CT are useful tools for clinical evaluations of the efficacy of denosumab treatment for GCTB. ? 2018 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.",Denosumab; Giant cell tumor of bone,calcium; denosumab; phosphate; vitamin D; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; Article; bone matrix; bone radiography; calcium blood level; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer patient; clinical article; clinical study; computer assisted tomography; drug efficacy; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; kidney function test; loading drug dose; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteoclastoma; phosphate blood level; quality of life; retrospective study; treatment response; tumor recurrence; unspecified side effect; vitamin blood level,2-s2.0-85054860797

These reporting systems commonly employ checkboxes, radio buttons, text boxes, and pick lists for data entry. In bone scintigraphy, each of the 200 bones that compose the human skeleton is of potential interest. Therefore, it is impractical to select from a long list containing all possible anatomical sites for reporting. This study aimed to develop an application for reporting metastatic bone disease by clicking on a diagram of a human skeleton, and to devise a simple method to input the report to the Radiology Information System (RIS). Methods: The template contains a human skeleton diagram for input of the anatomical sites of lesions. Radio buttons allow the user to select among metastasis, degeneration and trauma/fracture as the pathology of a lesion. Optional activation of the compare mode allows the user to specify the metastatic lesions as new, progressed, stable, improved or resolved. A text report can be automatically generated for input into the RIS. Results: The template was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and compiled as a stand-alone Windows application, running simultaneously with the RIS. Reports in conventional narrative report format can be generated using mouse clicks only. Conclusion: Use of a diagram circumvents the limitations of templated reporting for complex anatomy. ? 2018 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.",Automatic data processing; Computer graphics; Nuclear medicine; Radiology information systems; Skeleton; User-computer interface,,2-s2.0-85054792895

To address this gap, a rationally designed tandem Payne/Dakin reaction is reported that is specific to molecular recognition of H2O2. New H2O2 probes based on this unique chemical strategy can be easily synthesized by a general coupling reaction, and the practical applicability of those probes has been confirmed by the visualization of endogenously produced H2O2 in living cells. In particular, starvation-induced H2O2 production in mouse macrophages has been detected by the novel probe in both confocal imaging and flow cytometry.

Among them, lung cancer including Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and smallcell lung cancer are the most common types. Surgery alone for early-stage, or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for more advanced disease have been the major components of treatment strategies for the past few decades. The recent discovery of oncogenic drivers for NSCLC has led to the devise of new targeted therapies which dramatically improve the quality of life and survival of patients whose tumors harbor such mutations. New generations of targeted therapy which specifically target the drug-resistant mutations gradually evolve, benefiting patients who are refractory or intolerant to first-line targeted therapy. The survival of NSCLC patients without identifiable mutations has also improved, as contributed by use of the relatively non-toxic chemotherapeutic and anti-angiogenic agents, as well as the advances of radiation techniques with better tumor coverage and reduced toxicities. The treatment outcomes of other rarer chest tumors including mesothelioma, thymic epithelial tumors and neuroendocrine tumors have also improved significantly, secondary to earlier detection, more accurate and uniform diagnostic criteria and classification, emergence of new treatment options and multidisciplinary management. In addition, the epidemiology, patterns of genetic and environmental predisposition and treatment strategies of these tumors may differ substantially between Western and Asian countries. Conclusion: The approaches of this review are to highlight the recent management advances and contrast the differences of treatment practice between Western and Asian countries. ? 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.",Chest tumors; Multidisciplinary management; Mutations; Overview; Targeted therapy,afatinib; alectinib; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; B Raf kinase; bevacizumab; brigatinib; carboplatin; ceritinib; cisplatin; crizotinib; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; etoposide; gefitinib; irinotecan; microtubule associated protein; nivolumab; osimertinib; paclitaxel; pembrolizumab; pemetrexed; rociletinib; scatter factor receptor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vinorelbine tartrate; adjuvant radiotherapy; bronchus carcinoid; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer epidemiology; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer resistance; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cell transformation; consolidation chemotherapy; disease free survival; Eastern Hemisphere; environmental factor; epithelium tumor; exon; gene rearrangement; genetic predisposition; human; induction chemotherapy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; mesothelioma; meta analysis (topic); molecularly targeted therapy; neuroendocrine tumor; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; overall survival; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phase 4 clinical trial (topic); pleura mesothelioma; point mutation; progression free survival; quality of life; radioisotope therapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; skull irradiation; small cell lung cancer; systemic therapy; thymic epithelial tumor; thymoma; tomotherapy; treatment outcome; Western Hemisphere; wild type,2-s2.0-85050347909

Phosphodiesterase inhibition leading to smooth muscle relaxation is its main mode of action as a broncho-dilating agent, requiring blood theophylline concentrations close to the toxic range and a consequent problem with side effects. It also has anti-inflammatory effects that occur at relatively low concentrations. Objective: To explore supporting evidence for how other properties of theophylline could be of considerable clinical utility, particularly in reducing weakness and overt sarcopenia, based on its antiinflammatory, steroid-sparing and immune-modulating properties. Methods: PUBMED and MEDLINE were scanned using the search terms: theophylline, antiinflammatory, cytokine, inflammation, ageing, sarcopenia, frailty, chronic obstructive airways disease, pulmonary rehabilitation. High quality articles were selected, read in-depth and discussed by the authors, then used as the basis for a proposition on the potential anti-inflammatory and antisarcopenic use of theophylline. Findings: The anti-inflammatory properties of theophylline are mainly mediated by histone deacetylase induction in immune competent cells with a resulting shift toward the expression of a less inflamed phenotype, including a reduction of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the associated increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. These effects occur at blood theophylline concentrations well below the range for direct broncho-dilatation. Conclusion: There are potential therapeutic benefits of theophylline that are systemic and not confined to airways inflammation in COPD. There is scope for a beneficial effect in other chronic inflammatory states and post-acute inflammation with slow resolution. There is compelling evidence that theophylline could be used for anti-inflammatory adjunctive treatment to improve independent function, muscle strength and other outcomes in individuals recovering from acute inflammatory episodes, including but not limited to exacerbations of COPD, and as a pharmaceutical intervention in support of pulmonary rehabilitation. ? 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Illness behaviour; Immune modulation; Pulmonary rehabilitation; Sarcopenia; Systemic inflammation; Theophylline,cytokine; histone deacetylase; theophylline; aging; antiinflammatory activity; bronchodilatation; bronchodilating activity; chronic inflammation; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical practice; cytokine production; drug efficacy; evidence based practice; frailty; gene expression; human; immunomodulation; inflammation; lymphocyte; medical literature; Medline; muscle weakness; nonhuman; phenotype; pulmonary rehabilitation; quality control; Review; sarcopenia; theophylline blood level,2-s2.0-85050342619

Oral health–related quality of life has usually been investigated by means of disease-specific descriptive instruments, such as the Oral Health Impact Profile and the General Oral Health Assessment Index. These instruments, however, do not enable a comparison of oral health–related quality of life with other medical diseases. Economic methods, such as the time trade-off technique, enable a comparison of the impact of oral health with other medical diseases and thus provide a means to build a bridge in quality-of-life assessments between medicine and dentistry. Methods: We included in our study a total of 58 patients who received a complete denture in our clinic in the last 10 y (between January 2001 and May 2012) and who were ?65 y old. Patient preferences for the edentulous and poorest imaginable oral health state were assessed via the time trade-off method. Results: Edentulous patients rated their current oral health state as 0.73 (SD, 0.25) and the poorest oral health state as 0.43 (SD, 0.33) on a scale between 0 (death) and 1 (best possible health state). These results are comparable to patient preferences for other serious diseases, such as breast cancer (0.75), asymptomatic HIV infection (0.69), depression (0.44), and osteoarthritis of the hip (0.44). Conclusion: In conclusion, our results suggest that oral health may substantially affect quality of life no less than other medical diseases. Knowledge Transfer Statement: Health is generally considered the highest good of humankind. In the present article, we show that oral health substantially affects quality of life. In particular, we show that loss of teeth (i.e., being edentulous) reduces quality of life no less than other systemic diseases. Treatment modalities for the edentulous patient may therefore substantially improve the patient’s well-being and should be a research priority. ?

Materials and Methods: Consecutive newly-diagnosed head and neck cancer patients with nodal metastasis between December 2010 and July 2013 were recruited, and 25 patients (8 females; 24~63 mean 43±11 years old) were enrolled. DCE-MRI was performed in the primary tumor region including the regional lymph nodes on a 3.0-T MRI system. Three quantitative parameters: Ktrans (volume transfer constant), ve (volume fraction of extravascular extracellular space) and kep (the rate constant of contrast transfer) were calculated for the largest node. A repeated-measure ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction and post hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction were used to evaluate the differences in Ktrans, ve and kep among primary tumors, metastatic nodes and normal tissue. Results: The values of both Ktrans and ve of normal tissue differed significantly from those of nodes (both P &lt; 0.001) and primary tumors (both P &lt; 0.001) respectively, while no significant differences of Ktrans and ve were observed between nodes and primary tumors (P = 0.075 and 0.365 respectively). The kep values of primary tumors were significantly different from those of nodes (P = 0.001) and normal tissue (P = 0.002), while no significant differences between nodes and normal tissue (P &gt; 0.999).

SEDRIC will strengthen the availability of information needed to monitor and track risks, including an evaluation of access to, and utility of data generated by pharma and research activities, and will support the translation of surveillance data into interventions, changes in policy and more effective practices. Ways of working will include the provision of independent scientific analysis, advocacy and expert advice to groups, such as the Wellcome Drug Resistant Infection Priority Programme. A priority for SEDRIC's first Working Group is to review mechanisms to strengthen the generation, collection, collation and dissemination of high quality data, together with the need for creativity in the use of existing data and proxy measures, and linking to existing in-country networking infrastructure.

Materials and Methods: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of 77 patients managed for MOGCT between January 1986 and December 2012. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 26 years. The histologic subtypes included 47 (61.0%) immature teratoma, 16 (20.8%) yolk sac tumor, 9 (11.7%) dysgerminoma, and five (6.5%) mixed germ cell tumor. Of 65 patients with clinically early-stage tumors, 17 (26.1%) had lymphadenectomy performed, of which all had no lymph node metastasis on histology. The overall survival was 100% for both lymphadenectomy and no lymphadenectomy groups. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 51 (66.2%) patients, 38 (74.5%) of whom received VAC chemotherapy. Complete response and overall cure rate of VAC regimen was 100% and 89.5%, respectively when used as first-line postoperative adjuvant treatment. Median follow-up period was 138 months and overall survival was 97.4%. Conclusions: Lymphadenectomy did not provide survival benefits in patients with clinically earlystage MOGCT. The VAC chemotherapy regimen can be considered as an option for primary postoperative treatment, especially in patients with early-stage disease. ? 2018 S.O.G. CANADA Inc.

This chapter reviews preclinical studies using animal models that evaluate the efficacy of various antioxidants including pure compounds and herbal medicines. Furthermore, therapeutic outcomes of antioxidants in patients with alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic liver disease are also summarized. Although a great deal of encouraging data on various antioxidants has been obtained in animal studies, the potential of application of antioxidants solely or as adjuvant therapy in human liver diseases is still controversial and challenging. On the one hand, this might be partly due to the fact that only the early phases of liver diseases are studied in most animal models, suggesting that antioxidants might have a greater role in less advanced hepatic diseases. On the other hand, translational research should also be further improved to realize the application of antioxidants in liver diseases. Factors such as the duration of treatment, dose to be used, bioavailability in human, and mode of administration should be carefully explored in future studies. Additionally, study design, clinical endpoints, and choice of patient population should also be critically considered in clinical trials. In summary, intensive efforts should be made to establish a role for antioxidant treatment of liver disease. ?

We compared the clinical, functioning and cognitive characteristics between the financially deprived women with first-episode psychosis and their non-deprived women counterparts. Method: A cross-sectional analysis of consecutively recruited first-episode psychosis women patients was conducted. A total of 93 financially deprived women patients and 105 non-deprived women patients aged 25 to 55 years were compared in terms of demographic, premorbid and help-seeking characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, baseline functioning and baseline cognitive functioning. Results: Financially deprived women were older (P = .005), had received less education (P = .001), more likely to live alone (P < .001) and with a higher proportion of immigrants (P = .001). Whereas there was no significant difference found in duration of untreated psychosis, deprived women had more severe depressive symptoms (P = .021) and more severe negative symptoms, in terms of avolition-apathy (P = .003) and anhedonia-asociality (P = .008).

Effective postoperative pain control after abdominal surgery is particularly important for patient recovery, mobility, and satisfaction. Acupuncture has been commonly used for pain management. However, its efficacy in postoperative pain control is inconclusive and health economic evaluation is limited. Methods: A randomized, sham-controlled, patient- and- assessor-blind trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in managing postoperative pain following abdominal surgery of gynecological diseases. Patients who are eligible for laparotomy with a midline incision for gynecological neoplasia, including ovarian mass, uterine mass, and cervical lesions, will be recruited. Seventy-two participants will be randomly allocated to an acupuncture or non-invasive sham control in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment will be done within 2 h before operation, upon arrival to the ward and once daily for 5 days. The Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on the first 5 days during hospitalization will be the primary outcome and will be analyzed using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) method. The secondary outcome measures include frequency of rescue analgesic use during hospital stay, cumulative morphine consumption; quality of recovery as measured by time to recovery variables and the Quality of Recovery-9 (QoR-9); quality of life as measured by the Short Form-6 dimension (SF-6D) and EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5 L). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of acupuncture vs sham acupuncture will be calculated. Discussion: This study protocol provides an example of integrative medicine practice in a hospital setting for the management of postoperative pain using acupuncture treatment. The acupuncture treatment protocol, if proven to be effective, can be implemented in routine settings to play a role in postoperative pain management for patients who have undergone abdominal surgery for gynecological diseases. ?

On the contrary, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis is sometimes used to guide treatment decisions. This cross-sectional study compared groups of insomnia patients with different TCM diagnoses in terms of Western medicine symptomatology. Methods Baseline data of two randomized controlled trials on insomnia were studied. TCM diagnosis was made by consensus between two TCM practitioners, with the help of a 92-item symptom checklist designed for TCM diagnosis in subjects with insomnia. Other data include sleep diary and actigraphy, insomnia symptoms, general sleep disturbances, comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders, physical and psychiatric symptoms, and sleep-related dysfunctional cognitions and behaviors. Results The four commonest TCM diagnoses among 365 subjects with insomnia disorder (mean age 51.7 years; 77.3% females) were dual deficiency of the heart-spleen, non-interaction between the heart and kidney, depressed liver qi transforming into fire, and yin deficiency with effulgent fire, with prevalence 31.8%, 25.8%, 18.4%, and 10.1%, respectively. We found minimal interrelationships between the TCM and Western medicine systems. Only the mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was significantly lower in non-interaction between the heart and kidney compared to dual deficiency of the heart-spleen and yin deficiency with effulgent fire (ANOVA: F [3310] = 4.64, p = 0.003). Conclusion Limited by an excessive focus on sleep-related variables, our results show minimal relationships between the TCM and Western diagnostic systems of insomnia. An integrative TCM-Western approach in clinical practice may be a key to personalized treatment of insomnia. ? 2017",Classification; Cross-sectional study; Diagnosis; Insomnia; Pattern; Traditional chinese medicine,actimetry; acupuncture; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; Chinese medicine; cognitive defect; comorbidity; consensus; controlled study; cross-sectional study; documentation; dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep scale; Epworth sleepiness scale; expanded consensus sleep diary for morning; female; functional status assessment; generalized anxiety disorder; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; heart; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; intermethod comparison; kidney; liver; major clinical study; major depression; male; middle aged; multidimensional fatigue invenstory 20; panic; physician; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; primary insomnia; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); sleep diary; sleep disorder; sleep disorder assessment; sleep hygiene practice scale; symptomatology; western medicine; yang deficiency; yin deficiency,2-s2.0-85039778099

Here, we report a detailed protocol for the generation of iPSCs from human fibroblasts containing mutations in COL3A1 using a Sendai virus mediated integration-free reprogramming approach. We describe how to characterize the putative iPSCs in vivo and in vitro to ensure potency and differentiation potential. As an example of how these mutations may affect cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, we provide protocols for the differentiation of these cells into smooth muscle cells to illustrate how different cell types may display cell autonomous differences in collagen receptors that may affect their phenotype. These cells, when applied to mechanical model systems (see Chapter 18 by Bose et al.) facilitate an assessment of stiffness and stress-strain relationships useful for understanding how extracellular matrix dysfunction and its interactions with surface proteins contribute to disease processes. ?

Although several published resources have proved useful to the analysis of these interactions, our newly developed web-based platform Targets-search has the capability of integrating multiple types of omics data to unravel their association with diverse molecule interactions and disease. Here, we describe how to use Targets-search, for the integrated and systemic exploitation of surface proteins to identify potential drug targets, which can further be used to analyze gene regulation, protein networks, and possible biomarkers for diseases and cancers. To illustrate this process, we have taken data from Ewing’s sarcoma to identify surface proteins differentially expressed in Ewing’s sarcoma cells.

However, normative and clinical data for this approach are unreported. We aimed to describe the application of an extended DCI measurement in asymptomatic controls and patients. Methods: High-resolution manometry (HRM) of 65 asymptomatic controls and 72 patients with normal motility were evaluated retrospectively. Dysphagia and chest pain symptoms were assessed using the brief esophageal dysphagia questionnaire (BEDQ); ?10 was considered abnormal. HRM studies of 10 supine swallows were evaluated via the standard DCI and an extended DCI measurement domain (DCI+) to include the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) during and after the peristaltic wave. The DCI-increment was calculated as the DCI+ minus DCI. Key Results: Among controls, the median (5-95th percentile) DCI+ was 1915 (1359-6921)?mm Hg/cm/s and DCI-increment was 534 (126-1488)?mm Hg/cm/s. Two patients (3%) had ?2 swallows with DCI+ >8000?mm Hg/cm/s and seven (10%) patients had at least one swallow with DCI+ >8000?mm Hg/cm/s, ie, had potential motility reclassification by application of DCI+. Seven of these nine patients (78%) were evaluated for dysphagia or chest pain, but only 3/9 (33%) had an abnormal BEDQ. Conclusions and Inferences: Extension of the DCI measurement domain may aid quantifying hypercontractility that involves the LES. However, adjusting management strategies based on reclassification of patients with otherwise normal motility should be cautiously considered. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",dysphagia; esophageal motility; high-resolution manometry; lower esophageal sphincter,"adult; Article; brief esophageal dysphagia questionnaire; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease classification; dysphagia; esophagus manometry; esophagus motility; female; human; lower esophagus sphincter; major clinical study; male; middle aged; normal value; peristalsis; priority journal; questionnaire; retrospective study; swallowing; symptom assessment; thorax pain; diagnostic imaging; lower esophagus sphincter; manometry; muscle contraction; pathophysiology; procedures; young adult; Adult; Deglutition Disorders; Esophageal Sphincter, Lower; Female; Humans; Male; Manometry; Muscle Contraction; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85038425441

In a migrant population within a homogenous culture, we tested the hypothesis that an intergenerational mismatch in childhood living condition is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure in childhood and adolescence. Methods We used data from 6,965 native born Chinese in Hong Kong (participated in “Children of 1997” birth cohort) and migrant Chinese born elsewhere in China in 1997 (N = 9,845). We classified children into those with intergenerational mismatch (child migrants or first-generation migrants) or those without (second+-generation migrants). Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations of migration status (child migrants, first-generation migrants or second+-generation migrants) with age- and sex-specific BMI z-score at 8–15 years and age-, sex-, and height-specific blood pressure z-score at 11–13 years, adjusted for sex, month of birth, and age. Results Compared with second+-generation migrants, first-generation migrants had higher diastolic blood pressure z-score (.04, 95% confidence interval (CI).02,.06) and BMI z-score (.12, 95% CI.06,.18), whereas child migrants had higher diastolic blood pressure z-score (.03, 95% CI.01,.05) regardless of age at migration and higher BMI z-score if they had migrated in infancy (.17, 95% CI.11,.23). Conclusion Different relations for blood pressure and BMI suggest that intergenerational mismatch and proximal exposures may have different impacts on adiposity and blood pressure. ? 2017 The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",Adiposity; Blood pressure; Body mass index; Chinese; Intergenerational mismatch; Life-course epidemiology; Migrants,adolescence; adolescent; age; Article; blood pressure; body height; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; child; childhood; Chinese; confidence interval; correlation analysis; diastolic blood pressure; female; generalized estimating equation; high risk population; Hong Kong; human; infancy; intergenerational mismatch; major clinical study; male; migrant; migration; obesity; outcome assessment; priority journal; statistical model; body mass; cardiovascular disease; child development; China; cohort analysis; epidemiology; ethnology; human relation; migration; obesity; physiology; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Adiposity; Adolescent; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child Development; China; Cohort Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Intergenerational Relations; Male; Socioeconomic Factors; Transients and Migrants,2-s2.0-85031796893

Results Emergency re-exploration of the thoracotomy was performed and a 6 cm laceration of the right postero-medial diaphragm was identified as the bleeding source and was found to be in close proximity with the locking nut of the anterior implants. The laceration was repaired and a soft synthetic patch was used to cover the implants. Postoperatively, the hemothorax resolved and the patient recovered from the neurological deficit.

Participants who gained more than 20 kg during early and middle adulthood were associated with the highest risk of diabetes in men (OR=2.83, 95% CI: 1.99-4.02) and women (OR=3.13, 95%CI: 2.47-3.96). Compared to those who reached the highest weight at age 20, those who reaching the highest weight at 40 to 49 years were associated with the highest risk of diabetes, with OR being 5.32 (95%67: 1.92-14.8) in men and 3.41 (95%67: 2.49-4.67) in women, respectively. Weight loss in adulthood was associated with self-reported but not newly diagnosed diabctic eases in both middle and older aged men and women. Conclusion Weight gain during early and middle adulthood may increase the risk of diabetes in middle and older aged population. The detrimental effect of obesity on diabetes might bccomc significantly visible in the next decadcs. ? 2017 Chinese Medical Association.

There are no data on the incidence of LAR in Asian subjects, or its risk factors and associated clinical outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-centre case-+control study to investigate the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of LAR in Chinese kidney transplant recipients. Subjects with or without LAR were matched for age, gender, era of transplantation, allograft type, and maintenance immunosuppression regimen. Results: Thirty-two episodes of LAR occurred within an observation period of 12?years giving an incidence rate of 0.46 episodes per 1000 patient-years. Acute rejection within the first year after transplantation was associated with an increased risk of LAR (OR 3.59, P?=?0.041). In patients receiving maintenance immunosuppression regimen with steroid, cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolate or an m-TOR inhibitor, patients with LAR showed lower trough CsA levels prior to and at the time of rejection compared to Controls (86.0?±?26.1 vs. 105.6?±?13.3?μg/L, P?=?0.049; and 75.7?±?35.7 vs. 106.0?±?20.5?μg/L, P?=?0.032, respectively). Trough CsA level below 80?μg/L was associated with the development of LAR (OR 10.82, P?=?0.032). Patients with LAR showed an inferior allograft survival (P?<?0.001) while patient survival rates were similar (P?=?0.122). Conclusions: Late acute rejection is uncommon in Chinese kidney transplant recipients but is associated with reduced allograft survival. Risk factors include acute rejection in the first post-transplant year and trough CsA level below 80?μg/L in patients on CsA-based maintenance immunosuppression. Minimization of immunosuppression in apparently stable kidney transplant recipients must be exercised with caution. ? 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology",allograft; immunosuppressive agents; kidney transplantation; prognosis; risk factors,azathioprine; cyclosporin A; cyclosporin C; everolimus; mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor; methylprednisolone; mycophenolic acid; prednisolone; rapamycin; tacrolimus; acute graft rejection; adult; anemia; Article; case control study; Chinese; clinical article; controlled study; drug megadose; female; gastrointestinal symptom; graft survival; human; immunosuppressive treatment; incidence; infection; kidney graft rejection; kidney transplantation; late acute rejection; leukopenia; male; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; survival rate; acute disease; graft rejection; kidney transplantation; middle aged; mortality; statistical model; Acute Disease; Adult; Female; Graft Rejection; Graft Survival; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85033797168

This study developed a simple tool for a 5-year CVD risk prediction for primary care Chinese patients with T2DM. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 137,935 primary care Chinese T2DM patients aged 18-79 years without history of CVD between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010. New events of CVD of the cohort over a median follow up of 5 years were extracted from the medical records. A classification rule of 5-year CVD risk was obtained from the derivation cohort and validated in the validation cohort. Significant risk factors included in decision tree were age, gender, smoking status, diagnosis duration, obesity, unsatisfactory control on haemoglobin A1c and cholesterol, albuminuria and stage of chronic kidney disease, which categorized patients into five 5-year CVD risk groups(<5%; 5-9%; 10-14%; 15-19% and ?20%). Taking the group with the lowest CVD risk, the hazard ratios varied from 1.92(1.77,2.08) to 8.46(7.75,9.24).

A multilevel regression was fitted and the time-of-day effect was modeled by restricted cubic spline. The net affect score was a serpentine curve; stable from 4?a.m. to 6?a.m., increased from 7?a.m. to 12 noon, and became stable onwards. Participants had the highest net affect scores during religious activities (0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44, 0.53), and they enjoyed leisure activities, exercising, and household responsibilities more than work. Compared with events that lacked interacting partners, activities with very friendly interacting partners were associated with higher net affect scores (0.21, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.22), but events with slightly friendly interacting partners, slightly irritating or very irritating partners had lower net affect scores. To conclude, researchers using DRM for assessing well-being status across time should include the type of activities and the friendliness of the interacting partners.

Finally, 13 studies with 5915 subjects were considered qualified for meta-analysis. The association of single nucleotide polymorphism with HIV-1 susceptibility was evaluated using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Factoring in healthy controls, results indicate no association between CCR5 -59029A/G polymorphism and HIV-1 infection. Further analysis stratified by ethnicity indicates a significant association among Caucasians under an allelic model (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.02-1.49, Phet = 0.532) and a dominant model (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.15-1.98, Phet = 0.708).

In the present study, we review the incidence of inguinal omental fibromatosis at our centre. From 1 January1996 to 30 June 2016, all hernia operations performed in all the affiliated hospitals of the University of Hong Kong were reviewed retrospectively; data were retrieved from patient records. A total of 7039 hernia operations were carried out during the period, in which 564 were incarcerated or strangulated hernia operations, and two were omental fibromatosis, accounting for an incidence of 0.028 per cent of groin explorations. In the present study, we report the second case at our centre. A 26-year-old man was admitted with a history of reducible right groin mass from birth. The mass had become irreducible for 2 months. The patient had no symptoms of bowel obstruction. On palpation, a firm mass was found in the right groin extending to the right scrotum, and could not be reduced completely. Bilateral testes in the scrotum were palpable. Computed tomography scan of pelvic cavity showed that there was a herniated omentum in the right scrotum. The omental mass was completely resected and free-tension repair was performed. The histopathological examination revealed that the tumour consisted of spindle-shaped cells that were consistent with fibromatosis. Inguinal omental fibromatosis is rare and could present as incarcerated hernia clinically. Fibromatosis could be part of a syndromal disease presentation, such as Gardner syndrome.

This new hypothesis for SBC formation in non-load-bearing region for knee, which cannot be explained by the existing theories, will provide us a new angle to understand the pathomechanism and pathophysiology of subchondral bone disturbance in osteoarthritis in addition to the classical biomechanical overloading theories.

This study aimed to gain more understanding of the neural dynamics during motor learning by investigating the time course of electroencephalogram (EEG) activities in the continuous tracking task that involves more motor components. One participant performed 16 trials of the continuous tracking task on Day1 and Day2 respectively. The 16-channel EEG signals were recorded and analyzed in both the resting and active states. Results showed that the tracking performance improved from Day1 to Day2. Regarding the EEG, it was found that the relative amplitude in the individual alpha band (IAB) decreased locally over primary motor cortex from the resting state to the active state on both days, and this reduction was more focused on the left primary motor cortex on Day2 compared to Day1. Moreover, in the active state the alpha coherence between central and frontal areas also significantly increased from Day1 to Day2. Time course of alpha activities may explain the tracking performance enhancement from Day1 to Day2. Future work will include more participants to extend the validity of current results. ? 2017 The Author(s).

Genomic imprinting is an important epigenetic phenomenon and currently, there has been increasing interest of incorporating imprinting to improve the test power of association analysis. However, GDT-ME does not take imprinting effects into account, and it has not been investigated whether it can be used for association analysis when the effects indeed exist. Results: In this article, based on a novel decomposition of the genotype score according to the paternal or maternal source of the allele, we propose the generalized disequilibrium test with imprinting (GDTI) for complete pedigrees without any missing genotypes. Then, we extend GDTI and GDT-ME to accommodate incomplete pedigrees with some pedigrees having missing genotypes, by using a Monte Carlo (MC) sampling and estimation scheme to infer missing genotypes given available genotypes in each pedigree, denoted by MCGDTI and MCGDT-ME, respectively. The proposed GDTI and MCGDTI methods evaluate the differences of the paternal as well as maternal allele scores for all discordant relative pairs in a pedigree, including beyond first-degree relative pairs. Advantages of the proposed GDTI and MCGDTI test statistics over existing methods are demonstrated by simulation studies under various simulation settings and by application to the rheumatoid arthritis dataset. Simulation results show that the proposed tests control the size well under the null hypothesis of no association, and outperform the existing methods under various imprinting effect models. The existing GDT-ME and the proposed MCGDT-ME can be used to test for association even when imprinting effects exist. For the application to the rheumatoid arthritis data, compared to the existing methods, MCGDTI identifies more loci statistically significantly associated with the disease. Conclusions: Under complete and incomplete imprinting effect models, our proposed GDTI and MCGDTI methods, by considering the information on imprinting effects and all discordant relative pairs within each pedigree, outperform all the existing test statistics and MCGDTI can recapture much of the missing information. Therefore, MCGDTI is recommended in practice. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Generalized disequilibrium test; Genomic imprinting; Monte Carlo sampling; Qualitative trait,"allele; Article; gene linkage disequilibrium; generalized disequilibrium test; genetic screening; genetic trait; genome imprinting; genotype; intermethod comparison; mathematical parameters; Monte Carlo method; pedigree analysis; quality control; biological model; computer simulation; female; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic variation; genetics; human; male; pedigree; predictive value; quantitative trait locus; rheumatoid arthritis; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Computer Simulation; Female; Genetic Variation; Genomic Imprinting; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Models, Genetic; Monte Carlo Method; Pedigree; Predictive Value of Tests; Quantitative Trait Loci",2-s2.0-85031500719

In particular, highlighted are their associated personal, social, relational and cultural vulnerabilities. A purposeful sample of 13 pairs of HIV-born adolescents between the ages of 11–19?years and their primary caregivers were recruited in December 2014. The Conceptual Model Sexual Health Disclosure (CMSHD) was modified with Chinese culturally specific adaptation to guide the exploration of the complex aspects of the adolescents and caregiver’s relationships. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and then translated into English. Complex sociocultural interactions emerging in these dyadic interviews included guilt, shame, unintended disclosure, the need for secrecy, perceived stigma, ‘loss of face’, protection of parents, inability to support their families and deep concerns over lineage and future marriage prospects amongst the parents, which had significant psychosocial and even physical impacts for these adolescents born with HIV and their families. Frontline health-care workers and HIV peer support programs are recommended to counteract China’s current top-down biomedical disease-related approach to health services. It is crucial to provide instrumental avenues of confidential psychosocial support including disclosure approaches for caregivers of HIV positive adolescents within a uniquely Chinese cultural context. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; culture; disclosure; HIV; parent–child relationship; stigma,,2-s2.0-85026521448

Methods A linear regression analysis was performed for a period of 10 years on the impact of ambient temperature on the incidence of ALI. Mean ambient temperature on a daily basis was retrieved electronically from our observatory, and the daily incidence of ALI was retrieved from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting (CDAR) system. CDAR system could retrieve clinical data from all 42 public hospitals in our region, which provided almost 90% inpatient care of the population. Daily incidence was defined as total number of emergency admissions from all 42 pubic hospitals due to ALI from 00:00 till 23:59 hr of that day. Results For the 10-year period, spanning from January 2005 to December 2014, there were a total of 634 recorded ALI with revascularization, 608 (95.9%) of which underwent emergency femoral embolectomy, 15 (2.4%) underwent thrombolysis, and 11 (1.7%) underwent thrombolysis and embolectomy. ALIs with primary amputation or conservative management were excluded from the study. The average daily incidence of ALI was 0.170. A linear regression model was built using mean ambient temperature as independent variable and incidence of ALI as dependent variables. The line of best fit was drawn through the data points. The daily incidence of ALI could be predicted by ambient temperature (in °C) with the equation: incidence = 0.274–0.004 × temperature (linear regression; r = ?0.053, r2 = 0.003, F = 10.42, and P = 0.001). In other words, daily incidence was 0.274 at 0°C; and for every 10°C increase, the incidence would drop by 0.040. At 30°C, daily incidence of ALI was 0.154. Conclusions This study showed an association of cold temperature and ALI in our population. Measures to protect the susceptible population from cold temperatures should be considered. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"acute leg ischemia; adult; amputation; blood clot lysis; cold; Conference Paper; dependent variable; disease association; embolectomy; environmental temperature; female; hospital patient; human; incidence; independent variable; leg ischemia; longitudinal study; male; patient care; priority journal; public hospital; retrospective study; revascularization; acute disease; aged; cold; Hong Kong; hospital admission; hospital emergency service; incidence; ischemia; least square analysis; lower limb; middle aged; peripheral occlusive artery disease; risk factor; statistical model; time factor; vascularization; very elderly; young adult; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cold Temperature; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hong Kong; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Incidence; Ischemia; Least-Squares Analysis; Linear Models; Longitudinal Studies; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Admission; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85020905410

The objectives were to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, implementation and sustainability of the programme. Background: Health promotion for the prevention of chronic diseases has always been the top priority in the health sector. To ensure that the relevant health messages are well received in local communities, a health promotion programme must be accessible, acceptable and culturally relevant. Design: We conducted and evaluated a women health ambassador programme based on the lay health advisor model for health promotion in Hong Kong during November 2014 to February 2015. Health needs and the subsequent focus of the programme were determined by underprivileged Chinese women. Methods: University health educators from different disciplines trained the women (N?=?80) to be health ambassadors through mini-lectures and training workshops. The trained women raised awareness about the importance of health within their families and social networks. The programme was evaluated through attendance rates, questionnaires and quizzes, changes in knowledge and behaviour, as well as qualitative discussion. Results: While the majority of participants found the programme valuable and useful, retention rates were unideal. A statistically significant improvement was found in eating habits, but no significant change was identified for other knowledge and behaviour assessments. Conclusions: The programme empowered underprivileged women to reflect on the importance of health, take responsibility for their own health and actively promote health to their families and personal communities. Relevance to clinical practice: Our study supports that health promotion programmes based on the lay health advisor model are effective and encourage large-scale programmes of this nature. Our results also support that future health promotion efforts should deliver brief, clear and simple content as opposed to intricate information. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Chinese; community; health ambassadors; process evaluation; women,"adult; attitude to health; chronic disease; evaluation study; feasibility study; female; health promotion; Hong Kong; human; middle aged; procedures; program evaluation; public health; qualitative research; questionnaire; standards; women's health; Adult; Chronic Disease; Feasibility Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Hong Kong; Humans; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; Public Health; Qualitative Research; Surveys and Questionnaires; Women's Health",2-s2.0-85015301695

Effective implementation of respiratory protection measures has been identified as an effective prevention measure to reduce mortality and morbidity caused by such outbreaks. Yet, relatively little is known about this aspect in these homes. This study evaluated the implementation of respiratory protection measures among infection control officers (ICOs) and health care workers (HCWs) in these homes in Hong Kong. Patients and methods: A territory-wide, cross-sectional survey was conducted in 87 OAHs. A total of 87 ICOs and 1,763 HCWs (including nurses, health workers, care workers, allied HCWs and assistants) completed the questionnaires that evaluated the implementation at the organizational level and individual level, respectively. Generalized estimating equations with unstructured working correlation matrix were used to analyze the simultaneous influence of organizational and individual factors on the implementation. Results: At the organizational level, all homes had a policy on respiratory protection and implementation of such measures was generally adequate. Basic resources such as paper towels/hand dryers and equipment disinfectants, however, were rated as most inadequate by HCWs. Training opportunities were also identified as grossly inadequate. Only less than half of the ICOs and HCWs participated in training on infection control either at the initiation of employment or on a regular basis. Twenty-five percent of HCWs even indicated that they had never participated in any infection control training. At the individual level, hand hygiene, among other protection measures, was found to be less well implemented by HCWs. In terms of the association of various organizational and individual characteristics, private homes and health workers rated significantly higher scores in the implementation of various domains in respiratory protection.

We investigated differences between manufacturers for the same length and gauge of Luer and non-Luer needles, and examined the effect of the internal stylet in terms of needle strength. A specialised rig was designed to perform the testing in both the horizontal and axial plane, reflecting common industrial tests and clinical use. Needles from four commonly used manufacturers were used (Vygon, Becton Dickinson, B Braun, and Pajunk). Needles of 25 G and 27 G were tested in 90-mm and 120-mm lengths. We found significant differences in terms of the size of final deformation and ‘toughness’/resistance to deformation between needles of different brands. There were also significant differences between horizontal tests conducted as an industry standard and our own axial test. This may have bearing on clinical use in terms of the incidence of bending and breakage. The presence of the internal stylet resulted in significantly greater toughness in many needles, but had little effect on the degree of deformation. Comparison of Luer and non-Luer needles of the same brand and size showed few significant differences in strength.

Patients have a dismal prognosis without curative resection. The role of hepatic trisectionectomy in these patients is not established. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the perioperative outcome and prognosis of patients undergoing trisectionectomy with hepatic resection of a lesser extent. Methods From 2000 to 2014, 48 patients underwent hepatic trisectionectomy for HCC with background cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis (Group A). Another (Group B) 520 patients underwent liver resection of a lesser extent. Patient demographics, clinicopathological data, perioperative outcome and long-term survival were compared between the 2 groups. Results Intraoperative bloodloss, operating time and total hospital stay were significantly higher in trisectionectomy patients. Tumors were larger and more advanced in group A. The morbidity rate was 43.8% in group A compared to 27.5% in group B, p = 0.027. In-hospital mortality was 6.3% for group A. Group A had a significantly shorter time to recurrence (4.5months vs 6.2months, p = 0.036), as well as a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) than group B (6.3 months vs 15.7 months, p = 0.02). Overall survival was comparable. Tumor number, size, albumin, INR, microvascular invasions and positive resection margins were predictors of disease-free survival. Conclusion Hepatic trisectionectomy may be associated with a higher morbidity and lower DFS. However, these patients would not be suitable candidates for ablative therapy or liver transplantation. With careful patient selection and meticulous surgical technique, trisectionectomy is feasible and gives these patients the only hope of cure. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cirrhosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Trisectionectomy,"albumin; alpha fetoprotein; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; indocyanine green; abdominal bleeding; adult; aged; albumin blood level; alpha fetoprotein blood level; Article; ascites; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bile duct fistula; bile leakage; bilirubin blood level; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; cause of death; chest infection; Child Pugh score; chronic hepatitis; diaphragm hernia; disease free survival; female; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart infarction; hepatic trisectionectomy; hepatitis B; hospital mortality; human; international normalized ratio; intestine obstruction; intraoperative period; kidney failure; length of stay; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver failure; liver resection; long term survival; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; morbidity; multiple organ failure; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; overall survival; peptic ulcer bleeding; perioperative period; pleura effusion; pneumonia; pneumothorax; preoperative period; priority journal; retrospective study; sepsis; subphrenic abscess; surgical margin; thrombocyte count; tumor differentiation; urinary tract infection; wound dehiscence; wound infection; chronic disease; comparative study; complication; computer assisted surgery; conservative treatment; hepatitis; interventional ultrasonography; Kaplan Meier method; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; liver tumor; middle aged; pathology; postoperative care; postoperative complication; procedures; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; tumor volume; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ascites; Blood Loss, Surgical; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chronic Disease; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hepatectomy; Hepatitis; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Length of Stay; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Margins of Excision; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Organ Sparing Treatments; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Burden; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85021724067

This retrospective study was to examine the safety and survival outcomes of hepatopancreatoduodenectomy in our center. Methods Prospectively collected data of 12 patients who underwent hepatopancreatoduodenectomy for advanced hepatobiliary malignancies in our hospital from January 1998 to December 2014 were analyzed. The primary endpoints are treatment-related morbidity and mortality and the secondary endpoints are overall survival and disease-free survival. Results Curative resection was achieved in 11 (91.7%) patients. Complications developed in 10 (83.3%) patients. Three hospital deaths resulted from multiorgan failure secondary to postoperative pancreatic fistula or hepaticojejunostomy leakage. Six of the nine remaining patients had disease recurrence. The nine patients had a median survival of 39.8 (5.3–151.8) months. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 66.7%, 55.6% and 27.8%, respectively.

Methods: As research objects, the lung tissues of NSCLC and lung benign lesions after surgical resection were collected from July 2009 to September 2015 at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University. Firstly, the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDS) was used for observation of crystalline deposit and local pathological changes. Secondly, expression level of NF-κB had been analysed and a correlation analysis with particle size of SiO2 crystal in the same lung sample was made. Results: The occurrence rates of quartz in Xuanwei NSCLC lung tissues were above non-Xuanwei NSCLC and benign lung tissues (P &lt; 0.01); the average particle size of SiO2 crystal was (226 ± 120) nm × (237 ± 163) nm in Xuanwei NSCLC group and it was smaller than the other two groups; In Xuanwei NSCLC group, the expression level of NF-κB was significantly higher than non-Xuanwei and benign lung tissues (P &lt; 0.01), but there was no significant difference between cancer tissues and normal lung tissues in the group (P &gt; 0.05). The expression level of NF-κB was generally increasing when quartz' s size became smaller. Conclusion: Quartz' s deposit may play a certain role in carcinogenic mechanism of lung cancer in Xuanwei, the smaller the particle size, the greater the cytotoxicity.",Carcinoma; NF-kappa b; Non-small-cell lung; Quartz,immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; silicon dioxide; Article; cancer patient; cancer tissue; controlled study; correlation analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; human; human tissue; lung carcinogenesis; lung lesion; lung parenchyma; lung resection; molecular pathology; non small cell lung cancer; protein expression; protein function; tissue level; transmission electron microscopy,2-s2.0-85029653741

This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of patients aged 50 years or above towards herpes zoster and its vaccination. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in the format of a structured questionnaire interview carried out in Sai Ying Pun Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic in Hong Kong. Knowledge of herpes zoster and its vaccination was assessed, and patient attitudes to and concerns about the disease were evaluated. Factors that affected a decision about vaccination against herpes zoster were investigated. Results: A total of 408 Hong Kong citizens aged 50 years or above were interviewed. Multiple regression analysis revealed that number of correct responses regarding knowledge about herpes zoster was positively correlated with educational attainment (B=0.313, P=0.026) and history of herpes zoster (B=0.408, P=0.038), and negatively correlated with age (B= –0.042, P<0.001) and male gender (B= –0.396, P=0.029). Answers to several questions revealed a sizable number of misconceptions about the disease. Among all respondents, 35% stated that they were worried about getting the disease, and 17% would consider vaccination against herpes zoster. Conclusions: Misconceptions about herpes zoster were notable in this study. More health education is needed to improve the understanding and heighten awareness of herpes zoster among the general public. Although the majority of participants indicated that herpes zoster would have a significant impact on their health, a relatively smaller proportion was actually worried about getting the disease. Further studies on this topic should be encouraged to gauge the awareness and knowledge of herpes zoster among broader age-groups. ? 2017, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

In this work, a metagenomics-guided strategy consisting of metagenomic analysis and function validation was proposed for rapidly identifying novel ARGs from hot spots of ARG dissemination, such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and animal feces. We used an antibiotic resistance gene database to annotate 76 putative β-lactam resistance genes from the metagenomes of sludge and chicken feces. Among these 76 candidate genes, 25 target genes that shared 40~70% amino acid identity to known β-lactamases were cloned by PCR from the metagenomes. Their resistances to four β-lactam antibiotics were further demonstrated. Furthermore, the validated ARGs were used as the reference sequences to identify novel ARGs in eight environmental samples, suggesting the necessity of re-examining the profiles of ARGs in environmental samples using the validated novel ARG sequences. This metagenomics-guided pipeline does not rely on the activity of ARGs during the initial screening process and may specifically select novel ARG sequences for function validation, which make it suitable for the high-throughput screening of novel ARGs from environmental metagenomes. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Antibiotic resistance gene; Metagenomics; β-Lactam,"Animals; Antibiotics; Cloning; Health risks; Wastewater treatment; Antibiotic resistance bacteria; Antibiotic resistance genes; Environmental sample; High throughput screening; Metagenomic analysis; Metagenomics; Screening process; Wastewater treatment plants; Genes; amoxicillin; ampicillin; beta lactam; carbenicillin; piperacillin; antiinfective agent; beta lactam; beta lactamase; amino acid; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; drug; emergence; gene; gene expression; genome; genomics; wastewater treatment plant; amino acid sequence; anaerobic digestion; antibiotic resistance; Article; bioprospecting; chicken; controlled study; feces; genetic resistance; heterologous expression; high throughput screening; metagenome; metagenomics; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; sludge; validation process; animal; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; beta-lactam resistance; genetic database; genetics; human; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; procedures; sewage; waste water; Animalia; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Lactam Resistance; beta-Lactamases; beta-Lactams; Bioprospecting; Chickens; Databases, Genetic; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Feces; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Sewage; Waste Water",2-s2.0-85020180774

This study explored the decision making process involved in Hong Kong Chinese's choice between TCM and western medicine. Methods Eight focus group interviews (six to eight participants per group) and four individual interviews were conducted. Results The participants kept an “old fashioned” concept of TCM. Many saw TCM as a non-scientific practice and had stronger trust on the credibility of western medicine. Some participants, however, preferred the more personalized treatment approach of TCM. While western medicine was usually the initial choice, the participants were pragmatic to adopt TCM when they felt western medicine was not working, or to supplement the treatment. They were often referred by members of their social networks. Conclusion The public' perception of TCM lagged behind its actual development. Many TCM users are pragmatic users who learn through trial and error. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Healthcare choices; Qualitative interview; Traditional Chinese medicine; Western medicine,"Chinese medicine; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; female; health belief; Hong Kong; human; interview; male; perception; social network; trust; western medicine; adult; aged; attitude to health; Chinese medicine; decision making; environment; health care delivery; Hong Kong; information processing; middle aged; patient attitude; patient preference; patient referral; procedures; questionnaire; treatment outcome; utilization; young adult; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Health; Choice Behavior; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Environment; Female; Focus Groups; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Preference; Referral and Consultation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Trust; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85020024955

The current study set out to show that visual stimulus awareness plays a crucial role in determining whether vicarious pain primarily activates behavioral defense systems that enhance pain sensitivity and stimulate withdrawal or appetitive systems that attenuate pain sensitivity and stimulate approach. We employed a mixed factorial design with the between-subject factors exposure time (subliminal vs optimal) and vicarious pain (pain vs no pain images), and the within-subject factor session (baseline vs trial) to investigate how visual awareness of vicarious pain images affects subsequent self-pain in the cold-pressor test. Self-pain tolerance, intensity and unpleasantness were evaluated in a sample of 77 healthy participants. Results revealed significant interactions of exposure time and vicarious pain in all three dependent measures. In the presence of visual awareness (optimal condition), vicarious pain compared to no-pain elicited overall enhanced self-pain sensitivity, indexed by reduced pain tolerance and enhanced ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. Conversely, in the absence of visual awareness (subliminal condition), vicarious pain evoked decreased self-pain intensity and unpleasantness while pain tolerance remained unaffected. These findings suggest that the activation of defense mechanisms by vicarious pain depends on relatively elaborate cognitive processes, while – strikingly – the appetitive system is activated in highly automatic manner independent from stimulus awareness. Such mechanisms may have evolved to facilitate empathic, protective approach responses toward suffering individuals, ensuring survival of the protective social group. ? 2017 Terrighena et al.",Approach; Defense; Observation of pain; Pain tolerance,awareness; cold pressor test; defense mechanism; exposure; factorial design; female; human; major clinical study; male; normal human; pain intensity; pain threshold; visual stimulation,2-s2.0-85026806605

However, the promotion of CRC screening for older adults may be difficult because reading CRC prevention information may evoke embarrassment, fear, and anxiety towards the screening procedure and cancer diagnosis. This study aims to (1) examine the effects of three promotional materials for CRC screening on the attitudes toward CRC screening tests (screening interest, screening effectiveness, and trust in the screening results) and cancer fear, and (2) to explore the interaction effect of cancer fear with screening effectiveness and trust in the screening results on screening interest of the three screening tests (fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy) among Chinese older adults. A total of 114 community-dwelling older adults were asked to look at the corresponding promotional materials (pamphlet, cartoon, and video) of one of the three study groups. The pamphlet and video represent convention strategies and the cartoon represents an innovative strategy. No significant difference was observed in the screening interest and cancer fear across groups. FOBT was the most preferred screening modality. The video group has a large proportion agreed screening effectiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy than pamphlet and cartoon groups and trusted in the screening results for FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy than the pamphlet group. Logistic regression results showed that the effect of trust in the screening results on screening interest for colonoscopy was greater among participants with higher cancer fear than those with lower cancer fear level. In conclusion, the three promotional groups had produced similar results in their attitudes toward CRC screening and cancer fear. The use of cartoons may be a comparable approach with conventional methods in the promotion of CRC screening. Additional components that can arouse fear and boost response efficacy simultaneously might also be useful for the effective promotion of colonoscopy among Chinese older adults. ? 2017 by the authors.

The 21-item Weinstein's noise sensitivity scale (WNSS) has been the most popular scale for assessing noise sensitivity, but it is not yet available in traditional Chinese. Aims: This study aimed to conduct linguistic and psychometric performance of WNSS in Hong Kong (HK) Chinese. Settings and Design: A population-based telephone survey with 1-week follow-up. Materials and Methods: The HK Chinese WNSS was obtained after forward-backward translation from the original English version and cognitive debriefing in five Chinese adults. Its measurement properties were assessed in 569 Chinese adults aged 18 years or above. Statistical Analysis Used: The sample was randomly split into two halves. The first half was used to explore a scale structure of the WNSS by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with the number of factors determined by the optimal comparison data technique and tested for being artifactual. The second half was used for confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent validity and test-retest validity were also assessed. Results: EFA identified two unipolar factors and removed three items poorly associated with the factors. The factors were likely artifactual and a unidimensional structure was assessed in CFA, which showed a satisfactory fit (root mean square error of approximation = 0.055; comparative fit index = 0.904; standardized root mean square residual = 0.061). The HK Chinese WNSS had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.83) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.87). Furthermore, it confirmed the expected association with extraversion (r =-0.14, P < 0.001) and neuroticism (r = 0.28, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The 18-item HK Chinese WNSS was reliable and valid for assessing noise sensitivity in the Chinese population. ? 2017 Noise and Health.",Factor analysis; noise sensitivity; psychometrics,"adolescent; adult; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; factor analysis; female; Hong Kong; human; loudness perception; male; middle aged; noise; procedures; psychology; psychometry; publication; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Loudness Perception; Male; Middle Aged; Noise; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translations; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85027849097

Methods: Breast cancer cases (n? =? 202) and healthy controls (n? =? 202) were matched according to demographics. Chinese women residing in Hong Kong for the past 7? years were recruited by media advertisements (e.g., via newspapers, radio, and posters). The control participants were recruited by convenience sampling from health workshops held in clinics and communities of 15 districts of Hong Kong. After completing test-retest reliability, all participants were asked to complete diet pattern questionnaires about their food preferences and dietary patterns. The Student's unpaired t test, Chi square test, and logistic regression were conducted using SPSS software. Results: Three major CM dietary patterns were identified: hot, neutral, and cold. The participants with breast cancer exhibited a stronger preference for hot food than the control group (Chi square test, P? <? 0.001). A higher frequency of breast cancer was associated with a higher frequency of dining out for breakfast (4-5 times per week, Chi square test, P? =? 0.015; 6-7 times per week, Chi square test, P? <? 0.001) and lunch (4-5 times per week, Chi square test, P? <? 0.001; 6-7 times per week, Chi square test, P? =? 0.006). The participants with no history of breast cancer consumed CM supplements and Guangdong soups (1-2 times per week, Chi square test, P? =? 0.05;? >3 times per week, Chi square test, P? <? 0.001) more frequently than those with breast cancer.

Considering iron is the main chemical element in the particles emitted from Xuanwei coal combustion, and especially, reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be generated by redox-active transition metals (TM) such as iron (Fe) in particles, therefore, raw coal samples from 4 coal mines in Xuanwei were sampled, and size-resolved particles emitted from the raw coal samples were collected by using of Andersen Five-stage High Volume Sampler. Species of iron in the raw coal sample, size-resolved particles and bottom ashes were analyzed by BCR sequential extraction method (community bureau of reference, BCR). The generation potential of ·OH free radicals from coal emission particles in the surrogate lung fluid (SLF) solution was measured by using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Our results demonstrated that a large fraction of oxidizable Fe could be found in raw coal samples. However, the acid extractable, reducible and oxidizable fractions of Fe in the fly ash particles accounted for a large proportion (46%-78%) in the size-resolved particles after coal combustion. There was difference in levels of ·OH free radicals generated from coal emission particles in the SLF for 24 hours among particles with different sizes. The concentration of ·OH increased in both fine particles (&lt;1 μm, 1.1-2 μm, 2-3.3 μm) and coarse particles (3.3-7 μm, &gt;7 μm) as the particles size decreased. Linear correlation could be found between the oxidizable fractions of iron and the generation of ·OH in particles emitted from coal combustion (R2=0.32). ? 2017, Science Press.

Approximately half (49%) had caries experience. The mean dmft score was 2.1. Gender and age were not associated with either the studied occlusal features or the mean dmft score (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Approximately half of the Hong Kong preschool children studied had a normal occlusion, and two-thirds of them had a flush terminal plane. About three-quarters of them had a maxillary primate space, and half of them had a mandibular primate space. Their occlusal traits were not associated with caries experience and prevalence. ? 2017 by the authors.

The evidence is conflicting as to whether Type D is associated with increased healthcare services, and no study has reported on the healthcare utilization of people living with HIV (PLWH) who have a Type D personality. This study investigated the impact of Type D personality on healthcare utilization in a sample of Chinese PLWH and examined physical and emotional symptoms as possible mechanisms of healthcare utilization. This was a cross-sectional study of 199 PLWH in rural China. Participants completed a survey on physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, healthcare utilization, and Type D personality. Those PLWH with a Type D personality reported more physical and emotional symptoms and healthcare utilization than patients without this personality. Among PLWH who had a Type D personality, physical symptoms had a direct effect on healthcare utilization, and emotional symptoms did not significantly mediate this association. However, among PLWH without a Type D personality, emotional symptoms significantly mediated the effects of physical symptoms on healthcare utilization. PLWH with a Type D personality reported more healthcare utilization, which was attributed to their high physical symptoms rather than their emotional symptoms. These findings suggest that PLWH with a Type D personality might be bothered by intensified emotional symptoms, which might be too severe to be associated with physical symptoms and healthcare utilization. New prospective studies should focus on the pattern of healthcare utilization among patients with a Type D personality and their intensified physical and emotional symptoms. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",emotional symptoms; healthcare utilization; HIV; physical symptoms; Type D personality,antiretrovirus agent; adult; anxiety; Article; balance disorder; China; Chinese; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; diarrhea; dizziness; emotional stress; female; fever; headache; health care utilization; health survey; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pain; priority journal; rural area; symptom; type D behavior; Affective Symptoms; blood donor; depression; ethnology; health service; health status; HIV Infections; prospective study; psychology; quality of life; statistics; statistics and numerical data; transmission; utilization; Adult; Affective Symptoms; Blood Donors; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Services; Health Status; Health Surveys; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Statistics as Topic; Type D Personality,2-s2.0-84992179905

This is a retrospective, comparative, cohort study which included 43 eyes of 43 consecutive patients who underwent LASEK with MMC in a private hospital in Hong Kong by a single surgeon. Twenty-five eyes had high myopia (mean spherical equivalent [SE] = -8.53±1.82D) and 18 eyes had low-to-moderate myopia (mean SE = -3.99±1.37D) before surgery. In terms of refractive predictability, mean SE was significantly better in eyes with preoperative low-to-moderate myopia than high myopia at 6 months (0.04±0.23 vs 0.31±0.52D, P=.035). In terms of refractive stability, between 1 and 3 months, both groups had mean absolute change of SE of around 0.25D. Between 3 and 6 months, preoperative low-to-moderate myopia group had significantly less absolute change of SE compared to high myopia group (0.07 vs 0.23D, P=.003). More eyes with preoperative high myopia changed SE by more than 0.25D than those with low-to-moderate myopia between 3 and 6 months (32.0% vs 5.6%, P=.057). In conclusion, LASEK with MMC is more unpredictable and unstable in correction of high myopia than low-to-moderate myopia. The refractive outcome of most low-to-moderate myopia correction stabilizes at 3 months. Stability is not achieved until after 6 months in high myopia correction. Copyright ? 2017 the Author(s).

Asian patients may also experience higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), such as nausea and vomiting, compared with their Western counterparts. These factors should be taken into consideration when selecting therapy for basal insulin treatment intensification in Asian patients. However, the majority of studies to establish various agents for treatment intensification in T2DM have been conducted in predominantly Western populations, and the levels of evidence available in Chinese or Asian patients are limited.

The management of locally recurrent tumors has been challenging, because of the anatomy and the effects of recent radical radiotherapy. Over the past few decades, various surgical approaches to the region have been investigated, aiming at providing a wide access to the nasopharynx without causing unnecessary trauma to the normal surrounding structures. Improving the understanding of skull base anatomy and the biological characteristics of the tumor, as well as advances in instruments and techniques, allows surgical salvage of early recurrent tumors using the minimally invasive procedures, such as the endoscopic endonasal approach and the transoral robotic surgical approach. For locally advanced tumors, however, the maxillary swing operation provides wide access to the bilateral nasopharynx and the ipsilateral parapharyngeal space, allowing resection of large tumors with adequate margins. Irrespective of the approach employed, every effort should be made to ensure microscopic clearance of disease, as the resection margins status is one of the most important independent prognostic factors influencing the local tumor control and overall survival, as shown by multivariate analysis. On the other hand, it is important to recognize the potential side effects and complications of surgery and work towards minimizing the potential post-operative complications that may in turn adversely affect the subsequent quality of life. ? 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica.",Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Natural orifice endoscopic surgery; Quality of life; Robotic surgical procedures; Salvage therapy,,2-s2.0-85019486150

Methods Clinical and radiographic (cone-beam computed tomographic) examinations of 54 teeth treated with buccal access flaps for apical surgery were performed at baseline and after 1 year. Clinical assessment included measurements of probing pocket depth, the level of gingival margin (GM), and the width of keratinized tissue. Subsequently, the clinical attachment level (CAL) and the width of the attached gingiva were calculated. On bucco-oral cone-beam computed tomographic sections, the height and thickness of the crestal bone and the thickness of the alveolar bone were measured at different levels. Results In general, the calculated mean changes of periodontal tissue and crestal/alveolar bone were only minimal. Significant mean changes included only GM and CAL on midoral aspects and the distance from the cementoenamel junction or restoration margin on midbuccal sites. CAL was further correlated with the thickness of the alveolar bone at 3 mm below the cementoenamel junction or restoration margin. None of the clinically and radiographically calculated mean changes were correlated with sex, biotype, or incision techniques. With regard to age, older patients showed significantly more gingival recession on the buccal aspect compared with younger individuals. Furthermore, mean changes of the midbuccal width of the attached gingiva were positively correlated with the healing outcome, whereas mean changes of the midoral GM and CAL were negatively correlated with the healing outcome.

And some of these complications are well-demonstrated as abnormalities on computed tomographic peritoneogram (CTP). The objective of our study is to document the serial changes of these complications. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 125 patients treated with CAPD for end staged renal failure (ESRF) who had CTP conducted in our hospital between December 2006 and August 2015. A total of 164 (n?=?164) CTPs were performed. Patients with only one CTP performed were excluded from our study. A retrospective review of 68 serial CTPs studies on 28 patients during the 9-year period was undertaken. We looked into the serial changes on CTP. Results: Among the 28 patients who had serial imaging, 46.43% of patients were found to have retroperitoneal leakage; 92.31% of them showed resolution in subsequent serial CTP. 21.43% of patients had anterior abdominal wall leakage; none of them resolved in subsequent CTP. 14.29% of patients were found to have inguinal hernias; 75% of them showed interval progression in subsequent serial CTPs. Conclusion: Retroperitoneal leakage is a common complication in patients on CAPD and tends to resolve whereas other complications including anterior abdominal wall leakage and hernias are unlikely to resolve and may progress further. ? 2016 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists",complications; computed tomographic peritoneogram; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; end staged renal failure; ultrafiltration failure,"abdominal radiography; adult; anterior abdominal wall leakage; Article; computed tomographic peritoneogram; computer assisted tomography; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; disease course; end stage renal disease; female; human; iatrogenic disease; image analysis; inguinal hernia; major clinical study; male; priority journal; retroperitoneal leakage; retrospective study; treatment failure; ultrafiltration; chronic kidney failure; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; procedures; x-ray computed tomography; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Failure; Ultrafiltration",2-s2.0-85006999226

Understanding interagency coordination in preparing for and responding to extreme events such as disease outbreaks is central to reducing risks and coordination costs. Methods We evaluated the pattern of information flow for actors involved in disaster medicine through social network analysis. Social network analysis of agencies can serve as a basis for the effective design and reconstruction of disaster medicine response coordination structures. This research used new theoretical approaches in suggesting a framework and a method to study the outcome of complex inter-organizational networks in coordinating disease outbreak response. We present research surveys of 70 health professionals from different skill sets and organizational positions during the swine influenza A (H1N1) PDM09 2009 pandemic. The survey and interviews were designed to collect both qualitative and quantitative data in order to build a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the dynamics of the inter-organizational networks that evolved during the pandemic. Results The degree centrality of the informal network showed a positive correlation with performance, in which the ego's performance is related to the number of links he or she establishes informally - outside the standard operating structure during the pandemic. Informal networks facilitate the transmission of both strong (ie, infections, confirmed cases, deaths in hospital or clinic settings) and weak (ie, casual acquaintances) ties. Conclusions The results showed that informal networks promoted community-based ad hoc and formal networks, thus making overall disaster medicine and public health preparedness more effective.

It adopted a single group design, and 52 participants joined the group. A questionnaire with three outcome measures, measuring general mental health, quality of life and dysfunctional attitudes and beliefs, was administered to participants at pre-test, post-test and six month follow-up. Repeated measures ANOVAs were employed and revealed positive changes in most of the outcome measures across the three time points. Cohen’s d showed a moderate to large effect size for most outcome measures. From a step care perspective, a culturally attuned brief CBT psychoeducational group may serve as an early intervention and a triage to attract suitable people with chronic illness to engage in the treatment process. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anxiety; Brief cognitive behavioural therapy; chronic illness; group; illness management,,2-s2.0-84981719946

Methods: A total of 912 subjects were selected from the health examination adults in University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital from June to November 2013, and they were assigned into a NAFLD group, an else hepatic disease group, and a control group. The physical examination results of these subjects were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The prevalence of NAFLD was 29.7%. The related factors such as age, body mass index, and the levels of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c and alanine aminotransferase in the NAFLD group were higher than those in the else hepatic disease group and the control group (P&lt;0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase levels in the NAFLD group were higher than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05). High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the NAFLD group were lower than those in the else hepatic disease group and the control group (P&lt;0.05). According to the quartile of HbAlc level, these subjects were divided into 4 groups, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, and the prevalence of NAFLD in the Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 were 17.5%, 21.5%, 31%, and 59.4%, respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD increased along with the increase in the level of HbAlc (χ2=100.092, P&lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factor for NAFLD was increased in the subjects of Q4 as compared with the subjects of Q1 after adjusting for the related factors including age, gender, body mass index, etc. Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between the prevalence of NAFLD and HbAlc level, and the risk of NAFLD increases with the elevating level of HbAlc. High HbAlc level is an independent risk factor for NAFLD.

The gene has no homology to any known gene and its expression pattern, protein function or structure are still unknown. Previously, studying gene expression in human ovarian cumulus cells, we found increased expression of MRO in lean-type Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) subjects, as compared to controls. In this study, we examined the MRO splice variants and protein expression pattern in various human tissues and cells. We found a differential expression pattern of the MRO 5'-UTR region in luteinized granulosacumulus cells and in testicular tissues as compared to non-gonadal tissues. Our study also shows a punctate nuclear expression pattern and disperse cytoplasmic expression pattern of the MRO protein in human granulosa-cumulus cells and in testicular germ cells, which was later validated by western blotting. The tentative and unique features of the protein hampered our efforts to gain more insight about this elusive protein. A better understanding of the tissue-specific MRO isoforms expression patterns and the unique structure of the protein may provide important insights into the function of this gene and possibly to the pathophysiology of PCOS. ? 2017 Kenigsberg et al.

Study Design and Setting Drawing from a sampling frame based on the FAMILY Cohort, using a 2 × 2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 1,200 participants to (1) request for Hong Kong Identity Card number (HKID) or no request and (2) receiving a souvenir incentive (valued at USD4) or no incentive. The primary outcome was consent to health record linkage. We also investigated associations between demographics, health status, and postal reminders with consent. Results Overall, we received signed consent forms from 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.6–36.0%) of respondents. We did not find an overall effect of requesting HKID (?4.3%, 95% CI ?9.8% to 1.2%) or offering souvenir incentives (2.4%, 95% CI ?3.1% to 7.9%) on consent to linkage. In subgroup analyses, requesting HKID significantly reduced consent among adults aged 18–44 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.30–0.94, compared to no request). Souvenir incentives increased consent among women (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13–2.11, compared to no souvenirs).

This study aimed to compare the performance of five different creatinine-based eGFR equations in predicting all-cause mortality among Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods A total of 6739 Chinese subjects with T2DM were included. Their eGFR was calculated using the MDRD, CKD-EPI, their respective modified equations for Chinese, and the diabetes specific CKD-EPI Chinese T2DM equations. Multiple Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of eGFR with all-cause mortality. C-statistics, net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were applied to assess the discrimination and reclassification of each eGFR equation in predicting mortality outcome. Results Over a follow-up of 5.7?years, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 12.9% (N?=?867). The CKD-EPI equation discriminated all-cause mortality better than the MDRD equation (C-statistics: 0.714 vs. 0.689, p?<?0.0001), and Chinese modification of their respective equations did not improve discrimination. Among the five eGFR equations evaluated, the CKD-EPI Chinese T2DM equation provided the best discrimination in predicting all-cause mortality among Chinese subjects with T2DM, and was the only equation providing a significantly positive NRI and IDI relative to the CKD-EPI equation. Conclusions Among Chinese subjects with T2DM, our findings suggested that the CKD-EPI Chinese T2DM equation best predicted all-cause mortality, and relative to the CKD-EPI equation, conferred improved discrimination and reclassification. ? 2017",Chinese; eGFR equations; Mortality; Type 2 diabetes,"creatinine; creatinine; adult; Article; Chinese; Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine blood level; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; integrated discrimination index; major clinical study; male; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease; mortality rate; mortality risk; net reclassification index; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prediction; statistical analysis; urogenital system parameters; aged; China; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; epidemiology; follow up; glomerulus filtration rate; incidence; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; prognosis; regression analysis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Creatinine; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Regression Analysis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",2-s2.0-85012088508

Even as human life expectancy is being prolonged, age-related diseases continue to be major obstacles for healthy aging and longevity. Evidence from different biological models ranging from yeasts, worms, flies, rodents, and primates to humans suggests a number of conserved aging mechanisms offer pathways to maintain the ""youthful"" states. Calorie restriction remains the most robust nongenetic approach for extending health and life span. It slows primary aging and effectively protects secondary aging in both animals and humans. Calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs) targeting the molecular aging pathways have emerged as a promising strategy for combating age-related morbidities. This chapter introduces a number of CRMs derived from functional foods and discusses their mechanisms of action in mimicking calorie restriction. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to assess whether such combined resection for T4 HCC is justifiable. Methods Adult patients with T4 HCC were divided into three groups. Group 1: tumors and invaded adjacent structures were resected together if histopathologically confirmed tumor invasion; group 2: same as group 1 but histopathologically confirmed tumor adhesion; group 3: tumor resection only. Group comparisons were made. Results Totally 144 patients were included in the study. There were 71, 14 and 59 patients in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The groups were comparable in demographics, complication and survival. Ten hospital deaths occurred (5, 0 and 5 in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P=0.533). The 5-year overall survival (hospital mortality excluded) was 17.8% in group 1, 14.3% in group 2, and 28.9% in group 3 (P=0.191). The 5-year disease-free survival was 10.4% in group 1 and 14.5% in group 3 (no data for group 2 yet) (P=0.565). On multivariate analysis, macrovascular invasion and poor differentiation were risk factors for survival whereas combined resection did not impact patients' survival. Conclusions Combined resection achieved survival outcomes similar to tumor resection only. Patients with tumor invasion and those with tumor adhesion had comparable survival after combined resection. At centers with the required expertise, combined resection should be attempted to treat T4 HCCs with clinically suspected invasion of adjacent structures. ? 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International",desmosplastic reaction; en-bloc resection; hepatocellular carcinoma; invasion; recurrence,"adult; aged; Article; cancer staging; cancer surgery; controlled study; female; hospital mortality; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; overall survival; risk factor; treatment outcome; tumor invasion; adverse effects; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; cell differentiation; chi square distribution; disease free survival; Kaplan Meier method; Liver Neoplasms; liver resection; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; pathology; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; statistical model; time factor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Differentiation; Chi-Square Distribution; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hepatectomy; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85012050624

The condition, which affects sebaceous glands internally or externally, is common. When the meibomian gland in the tarsal plate is affected, internal hordeolum occurs, while when the glands of Zeis or Moll associated with eyelash follicles are affected, external hordeolum, or stye occurs. The onset of hordeolum is usually self limited, and may resolve in about a week with spontaneous drainage of the abscess. When the condition is severe, it can spread to adjacent glands and tissues. Recurrences are very common. As long as an internal hordeolum remains unresolved, it can develop into a chalazion or generalized eyelid cellulitis. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy aimed to treat disease by using fine needles to stimulate specific points on the body. However, it is unclear if acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for acute hordeolum. Objectives: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum compared with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other active treatment. We also compared the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture plus another treatment with that treatment alone. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS), three major Chinese databases, as well as clinical trial registers all through 7 June 201We reviewed the reference lists from potentially eligible studies to identify additional randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Selection criteria: We included RCTs of people diagnosed with acute internal or external hordeola. We included RCTs comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment, other active treatments, or comparing acupuncture plus another treatment versus another treatment alone. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures used by Cochrane. Main results: We included 6 RCTs with a total of 531 participants from China. The mean age of the participants ranged from 18 to 28 years. Four RCTs included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum with a duration of less than seven days; one RCT included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum without specifying the duration; and one RCT included participants with recurrent acute hordeolum with a mean duration of 24 days. About 55% (291/531) of participants were women. Three RCTs included participants with either external or internal hordeolum; one RCT included participants with only external hordeolum; and two RCTs did not specify the type of hordeolum. Follow-up was no more than seven days after treatment in all included RCTs; no data were available for long-term outcomes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low, and we judged all RCTs to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Three RCTs compared acupuncture with conventional treatments. We did not pool the data from these RCTs because the conventional treatments were not similar among trials. Two trials showed that resolution of acute hordeolum was more likely in the acupuncture group when compared with topical antibiotics (1 RCT; 32 participants; risk ratio (RR) 3.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 9.70; low-certainty of evidence) or oral antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 120 participants; RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.78; low-certainty of evidence). In the third trial, little or no difference in resolution of hordeolum was observed when acupuncture was compared with topical antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 109 participants; RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; low-certainty of evidence). One RCT mentioned adverse outcomes, stating that there was no adverse event associated with acupuncture. Three RCTs compared acupuncture plus conventional treatments (two RCTs used topical antibiotics and warm compresses, one RCT used topical antibiotics only) versus the conventional treatments alone. One of the three RCTs, with very low-certainty evidence, did not report the resolution of acute hordeolum; however, it reported that acute hordeolum relief might be higher when acupuncture was combined with conventional treatments than with conventional treatments alone group (60 participants; RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.23). Pooled analysis of the remaining two RCTs, with low-certainty evidence, estimated resolution of acute hordeolum was slightly higher in the combined treatment group compared with the conventional treatment alone group at 7-day follow-up (210 participants; RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23; I2 = 0%). None of the three RCTs reported adverse outcomes. Among the included RCTs, four participants, two from the acupuncture plus conventional treatments group and two from the conventional treatments alone group, withdrew due to exacerbation of symptoms. Authors' conclusions: Low-certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture with or without conventional treatments may provide short-term benefits for treating acute hordeolum when compared with conventional treatments alone. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low mainly due to small sample sizes, inadequate allocation concealment, lack of masking of the outcome assessors, inadequate or unclear randomization method, and a high or unreported number of dropouts. All RCTs were conducted in China, which may limit their generalizability to non-Chinese populations. Because no RCTs included a valid sham acupuncture control, we cannot rule out a potential expectation/placebo effect associated with acupuncture. As resolution is based on clinical observation, the outcome could be influenced by the observer's knowledge of the assigned treatment. Adverse effects of acupuncture were reported sparsely in the included RCTs, and, when reported, were rare. RCTs with better methodology, longer follow-up, and which are conducted among other populations are warranted to provide more general evidence regarding the benefit of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Distal clipping at the supraclinoid portion of the ICA is technically straightforward, but it can potentially compromise ophthalmic artery (OA) perfusion. Because of the extensive EC-IC anastomoses with the OA, visual symptoms are fortunately uncommon. We report a patient who developed complete blindness after distal trapping of the supraclinoid ICA; it was reversed after emergency clip removal. Case Description Our patient is a 47-year-old man with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma in close proximity to the left petrosal ICA. The first stage of the procedure involved an EC-IC bypass using radial artery graft, followed by a second stage with combined craniofacial excision. Trapping of the native ICA was achieved using a permanent aneurysm clip placed at the supraclinoid ICA distal to the origin of the OA. He complained of a new onset of complete left eye visual loss approximately 6 hours after the distal aneurysm clip was applied. He was immediately sent to the operating theatre for the removal of the supraclinoid aneurysm clip. On the next day, his vision improved and left pupil became reactive again. Discussion OA flow following ICA trapping is complicated and precarious. Delayed onset of visual loss is possible. Prompt action by direct exploration and clip removal is needed and can be effective in reversing blindness. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Blindness; Cerebral revascularization; Ischemic; Optic neuropathy,"antineoplastic agent; adult; aneurysm clip; artery graft; Article; blindness; bypass surgery; cancer surgery; case report; chemoradiotherapy; computed tomographic angiography; craniofacial surgery; craniotomy; extraintracranial anastomosis; eye; human; internal carotid artery; ischemic optic neuropathy; male; middle aged; nasopharynx carcinoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operating room; ophthalmic artery; pupil; radial artery; recurrent disease; vision; adverse effects; carcinoma; cerebral revascularization; diagnostic imaging; digital subtraction angiography; internal carotid artery; magnetic resonance angiography; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; pathology; Postoperative Complications; three dimensional imaging; Vision Disorders; Angiography, Digital Subtraction; Carcinoma; Carotid Artery, Internal; Cerebral Revascularization; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Ophthalmic Artery; Postoperative Complications; Vision Disorders",2-s2.0-85008235588

The proposed model can be regarded as a generalized version of the spectrum method (denoising method and flipping method) by varying parameter λ. In particular, our suggested optimal λ under the Bregman matrix divergence theory can be obtained using unconstrained optimization. Experimental results on 4 real world data sets ranging from glycan classification to cancer prediction show that the proposed model can achieve better or competitive performance when compared to the related indefinite kernel methods.

One example is cadmium, a toxic metal reported at concentrations ranging from 10 to 2100 mg/kg in fly ash. Various sorbents (e.g., bauxite, alumina, and calcium oxide) are usually injected into thermal treatment processes to immobilize toxic metals. However, this method has certain disadvantages including the agglomeration of sorbents, the clogging of sorption sites, and the need for additional ash stabilization. Solidification/stabilization (S/S) technologies are an alternative which aim to use physical and/or chemical mechanisms to prevent metal leaching from waste incineration residues. Common S/S technologies use sorption or cementation to immobilize metals but may not reliably control metal leaching in a variety of acidic environments. The development of a novel, economical, and reliable technology to stabilize toxic metals, such as cadmium, in waste incineration residues is a timely and important need. Gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) and hematite (α-Fe2O3) are common, low-cost industrial materials. It has been reported that γ-Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 reacts with cadmium under thermal conditions to form crystal structures which immobilize and stabilize cadmium. However, for a reaction mechanism to become a feasible treatment technique, the optimal conditions for effectively incorporating cadmium into crystal structures using γ-Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 precursors must be investigated in detail. In this study, γ-Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 were employed to stabilize cadmium, and the operational parameters, such as treatment temperature and treatment time, were systematically evaluated. The chemical durability of reaction products was also evaluated using an acid leaching test to assess their metal stabilization effects. It was found that γ-Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 were capable of incorporating cadmium into stable crystal structures under attainable thermal conditions, and the product phases, particularly ferrite spinel, showed a remarkably high acidic resistance. ? 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Alumina; Aluminum; Aluminum oxide; Cadmium; Costs; Durability; Fly ash; Health risks; Hematite; Leaching; Lime; Municipal solid waste; Sewage sludge; Stabilization; Incineration residues; Industrial materials; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Operational parameters; Solidification/stabilization; Thermal treatment process; Treatment techniques; Treatment temperature; Waste incineration,2-s2.0-85053338494

Unlike motorized transportation modes, pedestrians are often exposed to outdoor environments, and hence walking movements are affected by weather conditions. In rainy weather in particular, the use of umbrellas appears to have considerable conflicting effects on crowd movements. Therefore, the influence of rainy weather on pedestrian flow raises concerns regarding the efficiency and safety of the traffic facilities associated with intensive pedestrian movements. This study investigated pedestrian movements at crosswalks under rainy conditions by conducting controlled experiments. The experiments were designed to cover wide ranges of experimental variables, including rainfall intensity, crosswalk width, pedestrian density, total number of pedestrians, umbrella usage proportion, and the split ratio of bidirectional pedestrian flow. Ninety-seven testing scenarios with different variable combinations were adopted in the controlled experiments, and three runs were performed for each scenario. The experiments were video recorded, and pedestrian walking trajectories were extracted for further analysis with the aid of computer programs. The characteristics of bidirectional pedestrian flow under rainy conditions were identified while accounting for proportions of umbrella usage and rainfall intensity, which permitted estimation of the influence of rainy weather on bidirectional pedestrian flows. Fundamental diagrams of the testing scenarios with and without rain are presented to illustrate how pedestrian movements were affected by conflicts between umbrellas and an increase in rainfall intensity. Possible temporary traffic arrangement measures are proposed to alleviate the influence of rainy weather and maintain traffic efficiency at crosswalks and intersections. ? 2017 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

Poor ventilation inside street canyons often results in the accumulation of pollutants which is harmful to human health. Most vehiclar exhausts are chemically reactive that evolve to their secondary counterparts in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Therefore, the conventional Gaussian plume model, which assumes inert pollutants, should be used with caution. The pollutant transport process from the ground level to the ABL is dominated by advection, diffusion and chemistry processes. In this study, turbulent dispersion of reactive pollutants in the ABL over hypothetical urban area of an array of idealised street canyons is investigated using large-eddy simulation (LES). Nitric oxide (NO) is emitted from the first street canyon into the urban ABL doped with ozone (O3). Firstly, we use the source depletion analogy instead of the conventional Gaussian plume model to estimate the plume shape. Inaccuracy is caused by the dominated NO oxidation in the near-wall region. Regression to the LES output shows that the vertical dimensionless NO profiles exhibit Gamma γ-distribution for a range of background O3 concentrations, unveiling a new parameterization of reactive plume dispersion over urban areas. Apart from the plume characteristic, budget analysis of the pollutant transport is conducted. Different levels of background O3 are used to contrast the importance of individual chemistry terms to the pollutant transport. It is found that three terms (advection, diffusion and chemistry) vary with different streamwise location and coupling with each other. ? 2018 Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Even more alarming is when there is progressive kyphosis and therefore the need to recognize when and how to intervene in acute tuberculous spondylitis. Though the deformity may be unsightly, the greatest worry has always been the attendant Pott’s paraplegia that develops once there is significant kyphosis, whether acute or that after the infection has subsided. Broadly speaking, spinal tuberculosis (TB), its attendant deformity, and its neurological deficit can be conceptually separated into acute and late, because the management principles are quite different for these distinct entities. The latter not only poses numerous surgical challenges but also greater prognostic uncertainty. In the acute form, studies have demonstrated clearly the short- and long-term benefits of a thorough debridement and anterior column reconstruction. The arguments for this approach centered on three aspects: quicker resolution of infection, preservation of neurological status, and prevention of deformity. Instrumentation using titanium implants does not impair clearance of TB infection, and its use lends immediate stability, obviating the need for bracing. Of course, anti-TB chemotherapy is still the cornerstone for completely eradicating the infection. In Pott’s disease of late onset, the best surgical approach may not be as straightforward. For the ""soft” kyphus and less neurologically impaired scenario, a careful decompression and stabilization procedure represents the best chance for good outcome. The choice of surgery, and for that matter whether to proceed with surgery at all, in the ""hard” kyphus of a bed-bound patient, can be a dilemma. In this case, kyphectomy and reconstruction should not be undertaken lightly given the potentially high rate of complications coupled with a lack of prospect for recovery. ?

Remote health monitoring, a bi-product of technology integration, assists in minimizing human mortality through continuous health monitoring using low-cost sensors. However, privacy and security concerns have become a bottleneck in this process. The secure multi-party computation (SMC)-based privacy-preserving data mining algorithm has emerged as a solution to this problem. However, traditional cryptography-based PPDM solutions are too inefficient and infeasible for analysis on large-scale datasets for data owners. Previous work on random decision trees (RDTs) shows that it is possible to generate equivalent and accurate models at substantially lower costs. In this paper, we focus on the outsourced privacy-preserving random decision tree (OPPRDT) algorithm for multiple parties. We outsource most of the protocol computation to the cloud and propose secure sub-protocols to protect users’ data privacy. As a result, we show that our method can achieve similar results as the original RDT algorithm while also preserving the privacy of the data.

Results: ESAS records of 85 patients were included in our analysis. Median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 60 (range 30-100). Median ESAS score was 10 (range: 0-51), and median survival was 6.4 weeks (95% Cl: 5.3-9.6 weeks).

Methods: Three different sets of questionnaire were sent to three groups of clinical oncologists: chiefs of service (n = 6), past successful candidates (n = 20), and trainees of the 2013-2016 cycle (n = 28) to evaluate the palliative medicine training programme organised by the Palliative Medicine Subspecialty Board of the Hong Kong College of Radiologists. Results: The response rates for chiefs of service, past successful candidates, and trainees were 83%, 70%, and 32%, respectively. The chiefs of service and past candidates confirmed the value of the palliative medicine training programme and made suggestions to improve the training. The trainees raised some concerns regarding course work and the examination. Their comments were reviewed in the Subspecialty Board meeting and changes were made to improve the learning experience for future trainees. Conclusion: Clinical oncologists viewed favourably the palliative medicine training in providing high-standard palliative care for cancer patients. ? 2017 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.",Education; Medical; Oncologists; Palliative medicine,adult; cancer patient; clinical article; education; female; Hong Kong; human; learning; male; oncologist; palliative therapy; questionnaire; radiologist; student,2-s2.0-85032948619

Methods: Records of all neonates who underwent cerebral hypothermia for moderate-to-severe HIE between May 2010 and October 2014 were reviewed. Signal abnormalities of the basal ganglia and thalami (BGT), posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), cortex at central fissure, cortex at interhemispheric fissure, and white matter were graded. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (overall, gross motor, fine motor, speech and language, and social) were assessed using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales. Results: In 11 male and 4 female neonates, signal abnormality in the PLIC was associated with adverse overall outcome (p = 0.02) and adverse fine motor outcome (p = 0.011). Signal abnormalities in both the PLIC and BGT were associated with adverse fine motor outcome (p = 0.03) and borderline adverse overall outcome (p = 0.06).

This study investigated the THMs precursors removal by coagulation with four coagulants, namely TiCl4, polymerized titanium chloride (PTC), Al2(SO4)3, polymerized aluminum chloride (PAC), in silver nanoparticle-humic acid (AgNPs-HA) water treatment. Flocs formed during coagulation process were characterized using a laser diffraction particle-sizing device, and the residual dissolved organic matter (DOM) in coagulated water was characterized using three-dimensional Excitation and emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Results showed the reduction of THMs by a large margin through coagulation by the four coagulants, and CHCl3 and CHBrCl2 were observed as main species. Compared with conventional Al2(SO4)3 and PAC, TiC4 and PTC achieved efficient AgNPs removal and were superior in terms of DOM removal with improved floc characteristics in terms of floc growth rate and floc size. Analysis of 3DEEM results suggested the fluorescent substance removal ability of TiCl4?&gt;?PTC?&gt;?Al2(SO4)3?&gt;?PAC, and the predominant fulvic acid-like DOM was removed to the largest extent through coagulation. Besides, anatase structured TiO2 with efficient photocatalytic performance was finally recovered from TiCl4 and PTC coagulated sludge.

Through the Hong Kong Down Syndrome Association, 116 participants were recruited, consisting of parents and caregivers of patients with Down syndrome (DS). These participants were asked to rate 43 items of words in Cantonese as “offensive”/”not offensive”, and were invited to give additional words that they have heard in healthcare setting which they considered to be offensive. We found that the use of “abnormal”, the assumptions on abilities and behaviours of individual with DS and the use of allusions to blame parents are the characteristics of sensitive language.

This report describes an attempt to establish normal values of medial joint space, acetabular index and centre edge angle according to specific age groups and sex in a Chinese population. Patients who had undergone a pelvic radiograph as part of their assessment, but were subsequently found to have normal hips were recruited retrospectively. These patients were grouped according to sex and age; medial joint space, acetabular index and centre edge angle were measured in all radiographs. A mean±SD was calculated for each group, and then each age group was tested for statistical significance between the male and the female groups. A total of, 98 patients were recruited, who underwent 188 pelvic radiographs, resulting in images of 376 'normal' hips. The results for medial joint space, acetabular index and centre edge angle for each age and sex group are described. Only the acetabular index requires different reference ranges for male and female patients because of consistent statistical significance between the two groups. It was found that medial joint space remained fairly constant throughout the age groups, whereas the acetabular index decreased and the centre edge angle increased slightly. The reference ranges for the parameters described here are quite different from those established previously in a population of Northern-European descent, which could be because of a variety of reasons including genetics, body habitus and measurement technique. We believe that it would be prudent to implement these different ranges when assessing patients of Chinese heritage to optimize care of patients who may suffer as a consequence of not receiving treatment for missed hip dysplasia.

It can occur years after the primary treatment and is often associated with devastating local symptoms. Salvage nasopharyngectomy is usually reserved for early relapse disease, while majority of the patients have to rely on re-irradiation as the only chance of cure. Due to the close proximity to adjacent critical structures and previous exposure to high-dose irradiation, the therapeutic window is extremely narrow. The increasing use of chemo-irradiation as the primary treatment may also mean local recurrence occurring in modern era is a clone of tumor cells that is more therapy resistant and difficult to eradicate. Nonetheless, there is a stark paucity of prospective studies to guide our current management for this challenging condition. Better understanding of the radiobiological factors, improvement in radiotherapy techniques, and integration with systemic treatment might enhance the disease control and minimize treatment toxicities. Personalized treatment approach and novel systemic treatment will be the future direction. ?

In September 2006, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV7) was introduced into the UK's routine childhood immunization programme. This study validated the PCV7 immunization status of children aged 2 years recorded in the IMS Disease Analyses (DA) database. Methods: The PCV7 vaccination uptake rate for children born in 2008 in the IMS DA database was calculated. A sample of 173 of the 2497 children not recorded as vaccinated was identified, and a questionnaire was sent to each of their general practitioners to ascertain the child's true PCV7 vaccination status. Results: In the IMS DA data of 15 237 children born in 2008, 12 740 (83.6%) had a vaccination record of PCV7. One-hundred and eleven of the 167 questionnaires sent to the child's general practitioners were returned, giving an adjusted response rate of 111/167 (66.5%). Based on the general practitioners' responses, 71 (64%) of these children were fully vaccinated according to their general practitioner's records making the revised estimated vaccination rate for this cohort 94.1%. Conclusion: This validation study has shown that caution is needed if using historical IMS patient-level data to analyse the effectiveness of PCV7 as there is a potential under-recording of immunization leading to under representation of vaccination rates by approximately 10%.

The correlations between FGFR4 and clinicopathologic features were analyzed with Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression model were also used to evaluate the prognostic value of FGFR4. The results showed that FGFR4 expression was lower in non-small cell lung cancer (23.4%, 30/128), which was significantly associated with T stage (P=0.02), N stage (P=0.02), TNM stage (P=0.03), pleural invasion (P=0.03) and differentiation (P=0.02).

It is used in position over the kidney to achieve optimal vascular control of a tumour while minimising parenchymal ischaemia. This study aimed to report the feasibility, surgical outcome, and oncological control of a kidney clamp in partial nephrectomy. Methods: This study was conducted at a teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Partial nephrectomies performed from January 2009 to March 2015 were reviewed. The tumour characteristics and surgical outcomes of kidney clamp were studied and compared with traditional hilar clamping. Results: A total of 92 patients were identified during the study period. Kidney clamps were used in 20 patients and hilar clamping in 72, with a mean follow-up of 27 and 37 months, respectively. For patients in whom a kidney clamp was applied, all tumours were exophytic to a different extent and the majority (90%) were located at the polar region. The PADUA (preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical) classification nephrometry score was also lower than those in whom hilar clampin was used (7.07 vs 8.34; P=0.002). The clamp was used in open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted surgery. Operating time was shorter (207 ± 72 mins vs 306 ± 80 mins; P<0.001) and estimated blood loss was lower (205 ± 191 mL vs 331 ± 275 mL; P=0.045) with kidney clamp. No acute kidney injury occurred. Postoperative renal function was comparable between the two groups. Conclusions: Partial nephrectomy using parenchymal clamping is safe and feasible in selected cases. The postoperative renal function and oncological control were satisfactory. ? 2016, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

Most patients present with hemoperitoneum, requiring emergency laparotomy. CASE: A 32-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain and an elevated beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level. Ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and laparoscopy failed to locate the source of elevated hCG. Subsequent positron emission tomography (PET)–CT demonstrated a cystic mass in the left pararenal region with no increased uptake. Repeated ultrasound scan revealed a live fetus implanted laterally to the abdominal aorta. After failing to respond to methotrexate at the usual dosage, a regimen used in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was given. The pregnancy underwent miscarriage afterwards, and the hCG level gradually returned to normal. CONCLUSION: The site of an ectopic pregnancy should be sought thoroughly to avoid missing an abdominal pregnancy and hence disastrous hemoperitoneum. While medical therapy with high-dose methotrexate is not a standard treatment, it can be considered after failing the traditional therapy, provided that there is adequate treatment monitoring and expertise in handling the side effects of the medication. ?

In this report, we describe laser diagnosis and therapy in an Asian patient with IRVAN syndrome over two years of follow-up. We observed non-perfusion retina and dilated retinal capillaries in the contralateral eye. Photocoagulation is an effective therapy to control retinal macroaneurysms and nonperfusions and to prevent visual loss, particularly in the early stages of IRVAN syndrome (stages 2 & 3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long-term observation of photocoagulation in IRVAN syndrome.

Two versions of a patient-based DAS (PDAS) 1 and 2 (with and without ESR) have been developed and validated in RA. The objective of this study was to define PDAS1-and PDAS2-based criteria for remission, low, moderate and high disease activity and responses to treatment. Method. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal thresholds for PDAS1 and PDAS2 that correspond to validated assessor-based DAS (DAS28) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) disease statuses were determined. Data from RA patients initiated on disease-modifying drugs were used to determine optimal thresholds for PDAS1 and PDAS2 that corresponded to EULAR good and moderate responses. Agreement with DAS28, CDAI and EULAR response criteria was assessed by Cohen's κ statistic. Results. Threshold for PDAS1 and PDAS2 demonstrated fair to moderate agreement with DAS28 [κ = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.50) and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.38)] and CDAI [κ = 0.27 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.33) and 0.42 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.49)] disease statuses, respectively, which was similar to agreement between DAS28 and CDAI [κ = 0.54 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.61)] within this group.

Substantial evidence has shown that family caregivers suffer from significant health problems arising from the demands of caregiving. Although there are programs supporting caregivers, there is little evidence regarding their effectiveness. Acupressure is an ancient Chinese healing method designed to restore the flow of Qi (vital energy) by applying external pressure to acupoints. A randomized, wait-list controlled trial was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-administered acupressure intervention on caregiver stress (primary objective) and stress-related symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, depression, and health-related quality of life (secondary objectives) in Chinese caregivers of older family members. Methods: Two hundred Chinese participants, aged ? 21 years, who are the primary caregivers of an older family member and screen positive for caregiver stress and symptoms of fatigue/insomnia/depression will be recruited from a community setting in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomized to receive either an immediate treatment condition (self-administered acupressure intervention) or a wait-list control condition. The self-administered acupressure intervention will include (i) an individual learning and practice session twice a week for 2 weeks, (ii) a home follow-up visit once a week for 2 weeks, and (iii) 15-min self-practice twice a day for 6 weeks. The wait-list control group will receive the same acupressure training after the intervention group has completed the intervention. We hypothesize that Chinese family caregivers in the intervention group will have lower levels of caregiver stress, fatigue, insomnia, depression, and higher health-related quality of life after completion of the intervention than participants in the wait-list control group. Discussion: This study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of self-administered acupressure in reducing stress and improving symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, depression, and health-related quality of life in Chinese family caregivers. The findings will inform the design of interventions to relieve negative health effects of caregiving. Furthermore, the results can raise community awareness and serve as a basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of resources regarding empowerment of family caregivers for self-care.

Exposure to SHS can be shown using biomarkers but is often estimated using self-reports. Epidemiological studies have shown associations with cancers, chronic and acute respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease and there is now sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship for many of these conditions. In the US, the number of lives lost per year because of SHS exposure is estimated at around 50. 000. Thirdhand smoke, the residue left behind on surfaces, is also toxic. The solution to these hazards is to ensure universal smoke-free living and working environments for all. Many countries have enacted smoke-free policies and legislation to protect non-smokers and children. These policies have already been shown to reduce the numbers of illnesses and deaths from heart disease. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The corresponding cut-point of optimal body fat percentage for Guangzhou older population. Methods: Based on the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS), 3 490 relatively healthy Guangzhou residents aged ?50 years were selected and were randomly divided into 2 groups. The equations between BFP and BMI, WC, WHR were set up with Curve fitting analysis in one group. The multiple regression analysis was undertaken to establish predictive equations between BFP and BMI, WC, WHR with stepwise model for adding gender, age, physical activity, drinking and smoking. Then, the optimal cut-points of BFP corresponding to BMI, WC and WHR to reflect the degree of obesity were calculated. The equations were then validated with another group. Results: BFP increased with the increase of WHR, WC and BMI. BMI was a better predictor of body fat percentage than WC and WHR. The final regression equation was BFP = (-23.47-8.87 × sex) + 2.94 × (BMI) - 0.024 × (BMI)2, the coefficient of determination was 0.805. Based on the equation, the BFP corresponding to overweight/obesity (24 kg/m2?BMI&lt;28 kg/m2) were 24.3%?BFP&lt;31.1% in men and 33.2%?BFP&lt;40.0% in women, respectively.

Methods: Examination was based on IRI for 15 groups of older adults, with four to eight participants in each group. Homework assignment was included as a core component of the intervention in each session, except the first session. Particular emphasis was put on both homework design and assignment strategies. Results: Two effective strategies were developed. The first was the development of a tactic card as a tool for homework content and assignment. The second strategy was interventionist training. Clinical examples are used to illustrate how these strategies can enhance homework adherence in a Chinese context. Conclusions: The two clinical strategies were found to be effective in enhancing homework adherence among Chinese older participants in a group therapy setting. These strategies are recommended for use in group clinical settings for Chinese participants.

For example, vaccine trials may define a response as at least a four-fold increase in antibody titers from baseline to end-of-study. Accordingly, sample size is determined based on comparisons of proportions. Since the pair of measurements is quantitative, modeling the bivariate cumulative distribution function to estimate the proportion gives more precise results than using dichotomization of data. This is known as the distributional approach to the analysis of proportions. However, this can be complicated by interval-censoring. For example, due to the nature of some laboratory measurement methods, antibody titers are interval-censored.

Identified as one of the vasopressin (Vp)-independent mechanisms in fluid balance, SCT regulates aquaporin 2 (AQP2) in the kidney distal collecting duct cells through activating intracellular cAMP production. This ability to bypass Vpmediated water reabsorption in kidney implicates SCT's potential to treat nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Research on NDI in the past has largely been focused on the searching for mutations in vasopressin receptor 2(AVPR2), while the functional relationship between SCTR, AVPR2 and NDI remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the interaction between SCTR and AVPR2 to modulate cellular signaling in vitro. Interestingly, we show in this report that upon heteromer formation with SCTR, R137H, a NDI-causing AVPR2 mutant that is defective in trafficking to cell surface, can functionally be rescued. Our data may provide an explanation for this clinically mild case of NDI, and insights into the pathological development of NDI in the future. ? 2016 Ng et al.

I provide evidence of a concerted effort led by biologist-entrepreneurs to promote the biotech industry in postcolonial Hong Kong. Through assessing scientific literature, media representations, business strategies, and programmatic visions of key scientist-entrepreneurs in Hong Kong’s biotech enterprise, I highlight how factors such as local history and geopolitical considerations shape the emerging “Hong Kong’s bioscience dream.” Using the recent discovery of a new recombinant anticancer drug, pegylated human recombinant arginase (BCT-100), as a case in point, I explore how biotech research and applications are marketed and interpreted in relation to Hong Kong’s unique historical, political, and cultural context, thus making it distinct from other Asian Tigers.

Under the framework of a two-stage design, it has been shown that joint analysis is more powerful than replication-based analysis. Several robust tests have been proposed for joint analysis to handle the problem of unknown genetic mode of inheritance. However, existing joint analysis of combining test statistics from both stages might suffer from a loss of efficiency if the combined test statistics are not sufficient or the weight of the statistic for each stage is not appropriate. In this article, we propose a new strategy for joint analysis by combining the raw data rather than the test statistics across stages and construct a robust MAX3-based test for two-staged GWASs, which can make full use of the information of the data from both stages. Our numerical results show that the proposed procedure is more powerful and computationally much faster than the existing joint analysis procedures. An application to a type 2 diabetes dataset is used to illustrate the proposed approach. ? 2016, Copyright ?

DN is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Conventional therapy blocking the renin-angiotensin system has only achieved limited effect in preserving renal function. Recent observational data show that the use of Chinese medicine (CM), a major form of traditional medicine used extensively in Asia, could reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease. However, existing clinical practice guidelines are weakly evidence-based and the effect of CM remains unclear. This trial explores the effect of an existing integrative Chinese-Western medicine protocol for the management of DN. Objective To optimise parameters and assess the feasibility for a subsequent phase III randomised controlled trial through preliminary evaluation on the effect of an adjuvant semi-individualised CM treatment protocol on patients with type 2 diabetes with stages 2-3 chronic kidney disease and macroalbuminuria. Methods and analysis This is an assessor-blind, add-on, randomised, controlled, parallel, multicentre, open-label pilot pragmatic clinical trial. 148 patients diagnosed with DN will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to a 48-week additional semi-individualised CM treatment programme or standard medical care. Primary end points are the changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio between baseline and treatment end point. Secondary end points include fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide, fasting insulin, C peptide, fibroblast growth factor 23, urinary monocyte chemotactic protein-1, cystatin C, nephrin, transforming growth factor-β1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Adverse events are monitored through self-completed questionnaire and clinical visits. Outcomes will be analysed by regression models. Enrolment started in July 2015.

STUDY DESIGN: Patients with a diagnosis of PSTT from 1995 to 2012 were identified from a computer database. Clinical and pathological data were obtained from medical records and the electronic database. RESULTS: Ten patients with PSTT were identified. Only 4 patients (40%) had disease confined to the uterus at presentation (Stage I). The most common site of metastasis was the lung. Four patients had pretreatment serum hCG levels <1,000 IU/L, and all of them had disease confined to the uterus. Of the 4 patients with Stage I disease 3 had hysterectomy only and 1 had both hysterectomy and chemotherapy. All 4 patients achieved complete remission, although 1 of them had a recurrence successfully treated with chemotherapy. For patients with Stage III/IV disease most of them had both hysterectomy and chemotherapy. Only 1 patient (20%) was alive without evidence of disease. CONCLUSION: Patients with Stage I disease have excellent prognosis after hysterectomy, and adjuvant treatment is not recommended. A low pretreatment serum hCG level (<1,000 IU/L) was a good predictor of early stage disease. The prognosis for patients with metastatic disease was poor despite surgery and com bination chemotherapy. ?

Most syndromes with dysmorphic features demonstrate recognizable patterns of disproportionate growth, thus physical measurements are an important aspect of patient evaluation. Delineating the abnormal growth pattern depends greatly on the accuracy of the normal range. However, the currently available reference data are restricted in terms of ethnicity and geographical location, hence may not be applicable to all children worldwide. In Hong Kong, reference data are limited only to the neonatal period. The aim of our pilot study is to obtain a set of region-specific physical measurement data for Chinese children in Hong Kong. Two to six year olds were recruited from preschools and kindergartens in different regions of Hong Kong. Twenty-six parameters found in previous publications were measured with minor modifications. Three medical personnel trained by a clinical geneticist obtained these parameters. Satisfactory inter-rater reliability was achieved in a training cohort prior to the study. Raw measurement data collected were normalized and fitted into growth curves modeled by LMS method. We recruited 448 children (55.6% male) between 2 and 6 years old from five preschools and kindergartens. Growth curves with essential percentile lines were drawn. Significant differences were identified in 11 parameters when compared with Caucasian children, including canthal distances and facial width/height. Our current pilot study presents the first local- and ethnicity-specific data on physical measurements of 2–6 year olds.

It is now possible to obtain the human genome information easily based on the high-throughput sequencing technology, so personalized medicine can become a reality. Based on mutation data of 168 patients with stage IIIB and IV NSCLC. We use computational method to predict the homo-dimers and hetero-dimers formation and compute the binding free energy of complexes (between drugs and proteins). For the gefitinib and erlotinib as two common drugs used in patient's therapy, we compute the possible 3D structure of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant- inhibitor complex. Rosetta and Amber are used for molecular dynamics analysis and simulation. The PRISM protocol is used to predict the binding energy based on similar protein-protein interaction surfaces. Multiple factors, including the mutant proteins surface geometry change, the number of hydrogen bonds change and the electronic change of the surface, are taken into account when in evaluating the binding free energy. Our results suggest that the mutation position is very important for dimer formation and it affects the drug’s binding strength with EGFR. Mutations such as L858R and T790M which do not happen on the protein interaction surface can hardly affect the formation of dimers. Patients with the delE746_A750 mutation can obtain a good therapy by using gefitinib instead of erlotinib. By comparing the binding free energy to form a homo- or heterodimers, we find that the L858R mutant will incline to form a hetero-dimer rather than a homo-dimer. ? 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",Dimer formation; Drug resistance; EGFR; Hetero-dimer; Homo-dimer; Mutation,epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gefitinib; mutant protein; Article; binding affinity; calculation; cancer staging; density; dimerization; drug binding; energy; exon; gene deletion; human; hydrogen bond; major clinical study; molecular dynamics; non small cell lung cancer; priority journal; progression free survival; protein domain; protein protein interaction; simulation; surface property; temperature; three dimensional imaging,2-s2.0-84978286063

Effective management of outbreaks, like the current West African 2014 Ebola epidemic, is dependent on public health preparedness. In this study, a systematic analysis of the spread during the months of March to October 2014 was performed using data from the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) and the Factiva database. This study aims to draw network connections of individuals/groups from a localised to a globalised transmission of Ebola using reported suspected/probable/confirmed cases at different locations around the world. Public health preparedness can be strengthened by understanding the social network connections between responders (such as local health authorities) and spreaders (infected individuals and groups). Using data from ProMED and other media could be useful in improving the individual and organisational networks (i.e. forming stronger community partnerships) in developing settings to respond to an outbreak before an International Health Emergency has to be declared. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Connecting the dots; disaster; Ebola; preparedness; public health; spread dynamics,Disasters; Diseases; Health; Community partnerships; Connecting the dots; Ebola; Effective management; International healths; preparedness; Public health preparedness; Spread dynamics; Public health,2-s2.0-84976484234

A total of 70 female patients, who underwent elective excision of clinically benign breast lump between February 2009 and November 2011, were randomised to have wound closure using either octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive or standard wound suture following breast surgery. Wound complications and cosmetic outcome were measured. Results: Octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive achieved wound closure in significantly less time than standard suturing (mean, 80.6 seconds vs 344.6 seconds; P<0.001). There was no statistical difference in wound condition or cosmetic outcome although number of clinic visits, ease of self-showering, and comfort of dressing significantly favoured octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive.

However, all tested vaccines for the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses appear to be poorly immunogenic in mammals. In this study, a series of vaccines was produced using reverse genetic techniques that possess HA and NA genes from the H5N1 virus in the genetic background of the high-yield strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Meanwhile, a group of H7N9 VLP vaccines that contain HA from H7N9 and NA and M1 from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was also produced. The HA amino acids of both the H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines differed at residues 226 and 228, both of which are critical for receptor specificity for an avian or mammalian host. Mice received two doses (3 μg of HA each) of each vaccine and were challenged with lethal doses of wild type H5N1 or H7N9 viruses. The results showed that a recombinant H5N1 vaccine in which the HA amino acid G228 (avian specificity) was converted to S228 (mammalian specificity) resulted in higher HI titers, a lower viral titer in the lungs, and 100% protection in mice. However, a H7N9 VLP vaccine that contains L226 (mammalian specificity) and G228 (avian specificity) in HA showed better immunogenicity and protection efficacy in mice than VLP containing HA with either L226 + S228 or Q226 + S228. This observation indicated that specific HA residues could enhance a vaccine's protection efficacy and HA glycoproteins with both avian-type and human-type receptor specificities may produce better pandemic influenza vaccines for humans. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Animal model; Influenza; Receptor specificity; Reverse genetics; Vaccine,"amino acid; avian influenza vaccine; hemagglutinin; amino acid; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; recombinant vaccine; virus receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody titer; Article; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; immunogenicity; infection prevention; Influenza A virus (H5N1); Influenza A virus (H7N9); mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; receptor binding; virus strain; animal; Bagg albino mouse; hemagglutination inhibition test; immunology; Influenza A virus (H5N1); Influenza A virus (H7N9); lung; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; pathology; reverse genetics; virology; Amino Acids; Animals; Female; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Receptors, Virus; Reverse Genetics; Vaccines, Synthetic",2-s2.0-84963641705

In this study, we tested whether immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of cytoplasmic NPM1 (cNPM1) in formalin-fixed bone marrow trephine biopsies correlated with NPM1 mutations and the prognostic impact of NPM1 and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) gene mutations was also assessed. Methods A total of 71 Chinese adult de novo AML cases were evaluated for cNPM1 by IHC where the bone marrow trephines were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and decalcified by 5% EDTA. NPM1 and FLT3-ITD gene mutations were also investigated using PCR, fragment analysis and direct DNA sequencing. Results IHC analysis of cNPM1 had a very good sensitivity (86.7%) and excellent specificity (96.4%) for NPM1 mutation. The positive predictive value was 86.7% and the negative predictive value was 96.4%. NPM1 mutations and FLT3-ITD were closely associated (p=0.003). Patients with mutated NPM1 and without FLT3-ITD mutation have a longer overall survival (p=0.042) than patients with both NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations. Conclusions Our results showed that IHC detection of cNPM1 in formalin-fixed trephine biopsies correlated well but not entirely with NPM1 mutation.

Botulinum toxin (BTX) can be injected to temporarily paralyze the affected muscles, which provides a window of opportunity for rehabilitation. We present our 2.5-year experience with BTX injection and a patient-specific rehabilitation program provided by a multidisciplinary team, which consists of neurosurgeons, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and prosthetic orthotists. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data in a local hospital including 22 patients suffering from spasticity. Outcome measures include goal attainment, caregiver burden and biomechanical assessment by Modified Ashworth Scale and Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS). Results: OnabotulinumtoxinA injection together with rehabilitation facilitates the attainment of patient-centred physical goals in daily activities. It reduces caregiver burden. Spasticity is reduced particularly for finger and wrist flexors as well as hip adductors. Responses of ankle plantarflexors are less satisfactory which may be due to inadequate dosages. Initial improvement in the R2 component of the MTS for ankle plantarflexors and hip adductors may be attributable to the application of ankle-foot orthosis and abduction pillow. Conclusions: Multidisciplinary management for spasticity is feasible within our healthcare setting and our promising findings indicate its wider adoption in this locality. ? 2016 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong.",Botulinum toxin; Multidisciplinary; Neurosurgery; Rehabilitation; Spasticity,botulinum toxin; botulinum toxin A; adolescent; adult; Article; caregiver; clinical article; controlled study; daily life activity; female; finger; human; male; Modified Ashworth Scale; Modified Tardieu Scale; motor performance; muscle tone; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; nurse; occupational therapist; orthosis; outcome assessment; paralysis; physiotherapist; priority journal; prospective study; rating scale; rehabilitation; retrospective study; socioeconomics; spasticity; wrist,2-s2.0-84964523828

Recent findings Entecavir and tenofovir are the two newer oral nucleosides that are associated with a low virological rebound rate at less than 2% at 5 years. As a result, they have been applied as standalone treatment against HBV recurrence after liver transplantation without immunoglobulin. Recent evidence has shown that a hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance rate of 86% and 91% after 1 and 2 years was achievable with entecavir monotherapy. Moreover, none of the patients had histological graft damage because of HBV recurrence and an overall survival over 80% at 7 years has been reported.

This hypothesis has been tested primarily using neuropsychological studies, which tend to generate inconsistent findings. Modern advances in the identification of aging biomarkers and neuroimaging technologies have sparked renewed interest in the premature aging phenomenon. Cellular senescence was identified to be a key biochemical process that underlies the aging process, and telomerase activity, which reflects cellular senescence, was also substantially reduced in a group of heroin abusers. Moreover, telomerase activity can be modulated by heroin abuse to influence brain systems that are closely related to aging, including the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe. Therefore, heroin-associated accelerated aging at the cellular level was related to accelerated aging at the brain system level. These findings contributed to understanding the potential mechanisms underlying the anecdotal evidence that substance abusers appear older than their actual age. The results also set the stage for future studies to push beyond the existing boundaries of the understanding of addiction pathology. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods. Psychotic patients with I/DOR (n = 20) and without I/DOR (n = 17) matched for age and education were tested for attentional shift to SON embedded in a background voice clip presented binaurally when engaging in an attention-demanding task (computerised Stroop task). Reaction time and accuracy in Stroop tasks with and without embedded SON were measured. I/DOR severity, other positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive performance were assessed. Results. There was significant interaction between conditions (Stroop tasks with and without SON) and groups (patients with and without I/DOR) on reaction time (F(1,32) = 4.22, p = .05). Simple main effects showed a significant mean difference in reaction time between conditions in patients with I/DOR (107.7 milliseconds, p = .001) but not in those without (5.8 milliseconds, p = .86). Within-subject difference in reaction time correlated with I/DOR severity scores (r = .33-.52, range; p < .05) and remained significant after controlling for other clinical and cognitive variables. Conclusions. The significant interaction and simple main effect suggest that I/DOR are associated with a heightened attentional shift to SON. The SON paradigm can potentially be developed into a neurocognitive parameter of I/DOR. However, the lack of nonself stimuli in the SON paradigm limits the interpretation on whether I/DOR are associated with general or specific distractibility related to self-referential information and further studies are warranted. ? 2016 Taylor and Francis.",attention; delusions; neuropsychiatry; psychopathology; Psychotic disorders,chlorpromazine; adult; aged; Article; attention; brief psychotic disorder; clinical article; clinical assessment; cognition; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; delusional disorder; disease severity; distractibility; educational status; female; hallucination; human; ideas and delusion of reference; ideas and delusion of reference; male; mental patient; negative syndrome; positive syndrome; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; psychosis; reaction time; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; scoring system; stimulus; Stroop test; voice; adolescent; attention; case control study; delusion; psychology; psychosis; schizophrenia; thinking; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delusions; Female; Humans; Male; Psychotic Disorders; Reaction Time; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Thinking; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84958047001

Due to its low incidence, prognostic factors and treatment strategies are not well defined. Objective: This study aims to report our long-term results in terms of survival and prognostic factors affecting survival through retrospective analysis of 38 consecutive patients with scalp angiosarcoma who underwent treatment at two different plastic centers in Hong Kong. Result: The overall survival rate for 1, 3, and 5 years of maximally treated patients was 56%, 24%, and 12%, respectively. Univariate analysis with Cox regression model showed that age >70 years (risk ratio, RR 5.0; p = 0.02), satellite lesion on presentation (RR 8.4, p = 0.02), and tumor of size >5 cm (RR 2.79, p = 0.05) were factors affecting the overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed that only the involved deep resection margin was a significant risk factor (RR 8.6, p = 0.02) However, univariate analysis showed that the involved deep resection margin (RR 10.2, p = 0.01) and satellite lesion on presentation (RR 0.73, p = 0.01) were factors affecting disease-free survival. Besides, satellite lesion on presentation predicted local recurrence on univariate analysis (RR 2, p = 0.01). Conclusions: The prognosis in terms of overall survival and local disease control was poor with a 5-year survival rate of 12% in maximally treated patients. ? 2015 The Authors.",Angiosarcoma; Cutaneous angiosarcoma; Hemangiosarcoma; Scalp angiosarcoma,antineoplastic agent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; brain metastasis; cancer control; cancer immunotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chemoradiotherapy; Chinese; clinical article; craniectomy; disease free survival; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; human tissue; lymph node metastasis; lymphadenopathy; male; outcome assessment; overall survival; plastic surgery; retrospective study; risk factor; scalp angiosarcoma; soft tissue sarcoma; survival rate; survival time; wide excision,2-s2.0-84958536100

Methods: This was a prospective observational study on patients presented with PRB to Family Medicine Specialty Clinic, who undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) or colonoscopy (CLN) from December 2012 to September 2013. Patients aged 40?years old or above, haemodynamically stable, with normal haemoglobin level were included. Patients with a history of previous colonic surgery, refused to have FS or CLN, with ophthalmologic diseases such as colour blindness were excluded. Parameters including subjective description of PRB colour, number of chosen red colour by patients, source and distance of bleeding from anal verge were recorded for analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify the optimal cutoff level of colour for diagnosing colonic lesion. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by area under the ROC curve (AUC). Accountability of this model was assessed by logistic regression. Results: The dark PRB colour was associated with diagnosis of tumour (p < 0.001) and advanced neoplastic polyp (p < 0.001). The light PRB colour was associated with the diagnosis of piles (p < 0.001). The performance of our model to predict tumour or advanced neoplastic polyps by colour (AUC, 0.798) had a better discriminative power than that to predict colonic lesion alone (AUC, 0.610) by ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: Objective measurement of PRB colour accurately estimated the risk of LGIB caused by malignant lesion in patients presenting with PRB. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Colonoscopy; Colour cards; Lower gastrointestinal bleeding; Per-rectal bleeding; Sigmoidoscopy,hemoglobin; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; colon injury; colonoscopy; color; defecation habit; digestive system cancer; digestive tract parameters; disease association; female; follow up; hemodynamic parameters; human; intestine polyp; major clinical study; male; observational study; per rectal bleeding color; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; rectum hemorrhage; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; sigmoidoscopy; smoking; visual aid; Colorectal Neoplasms; complication; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; middle aged; rectum; risk factor; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Rectum; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-84957431773

Significantly fewer 'open-class' NNQs (e.g a number of people) are produced by L2 learners, preferring 'closed-class' single lexical quantifiers (following L1-like use). While such production is predictable via L1 transfer, Korean L2 English learners produced significantly more L2-like NNQs at each proficiency level, which was not entirely predictable under a transfer account.

Methods: This study consisted of three parts. First, a retrospective study analyzed DCE-MRI data previously acquired on different patients using NFS (n = 18) or FS (n = 18) scans. Second, a phantom study simulated the signal enhancements in the presence of gadolinium contrast agent at six concentrations and three fat contents. Finally, a prospective study recruited nine healthy volunteers to investigate the influence of fat suppression on perfusion quantification on the same subjects. Parotid perfusion parameters were derived from NFS and FS DCE-MRI data using both pharmacokinetic model analysis and semiquantitative parametric analysis. T tests and linear regression analysis were used for statistical analysis with correction for multiple comparisons. Results: NFS scans showed lower amplitude-related parameters, including parameter A, peak enhancement (PE), and slope than FS scans in the patients (all with P &lt; 0.0167). The relative signal enhancement in the phantoms was proportional to the dose of contrast agent and was lower in NFS scans than in FS scans. The volunteer study showed lower parameter A (6.75±2.38 a.u.), PE (42.12%±14.87%), and slope (1.43%±0.54% s-1) in NFS scans as compared to 17.63±8.56 a.u., 104.22%±25.15%, and 9.68%±1.67% s-1, respectively, in FS scans (all with P &lt; 0.005). These amplitude-related parameters were negatively associated with the fat content in NFS scans only (all with P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: On NFS DCE-MRI, quantification of parotid perfusion is adversely affected by the presence of fat signals for all amplitude-related parameters.

Together with klaskin tumour and cholangiocarcinoma of extrahepatic bile duct, it is one of the less prevalent subtypes. Pathologically, it can be classified as mass forming, peri-ductal infiltrative and intra-ductal growth. Since most ICC develops de novo and originates from the periphery of the biliary system, most patients present at a relative late stage of the disease. There is no specific tumour marker for diagnosis, and crosssectional imaging remains the most informative diagnostic tool. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scan is asensitive in picking up hypermetabolic foci and able to alter treatment plan in case of the presence of bilobar or extra-hepatic tumour. AJCC 7th edition remains the most frequently used staging system with validated discriminatory and prognostic ability. Surgical remains the only hope of cure provided that R0 resection could be achieved. Margin width tends to influence survival of patients with solitary tumour and node negative disease. The high recurrence rate and poor long-Term outcome make liver transplantation an unpopular option for ICC treatment. Non-surgical treatments are mainly reserved for inoperable ICC, treatment outcomes are generally poor with overall survival (OS) depends on individual treatment response.

The kidneys are frequently involved in antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated small-vessel vasculitis (AASVV). The pathological hallmark of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (AAGN) is a pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis. The histopathology of AAGN may change during the course of the disease as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy. Herein, we report the pathological evolution of a case of AAGN. Methods. We report a female presented with renal-limited AASVV, hypocomplementaemia and nephrotic syndrome. The first renal biopsy revealed ""crescentic"" changes at presentation, but after treatment with immunosuppressive treatment, a second renal biopsy four years later showed ""mixed"" changes of AAGN and immune complex deposition mimicking a mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. A literature review was undertaken in order to understand these transformations and factors which determine the pathological transitions. Results. AAGN is commonly described as a pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis, but immune complex depositions have been frequently identified under electronic microscopy and is associated with greater levels of proteinuria. Acute lesions such as fibrinoid necrosis or glomerular crescent may completely disappear or reduce significantly after immunosuppressive therapy, but chronic changes may increase over time. Conclusion. Based on our review and the illustration of this case, the initial histopathology of an AAGN and its active fibrinoid necrosis and cellular glomerular crescent may disappear or resolve after immunosuppressive therapy with resulting non-distinctive feature. Understanding the transition may facilitate the clinical diagnosis and provide further insight into this disease. ?

The aim of this study was to assess the utility of an en-face projection processing for optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for SB evaluation. Methods Measurements of the SB orifice obtained using en-face OCT images were validated using a phantom model. Linear regression modeling was applied to estimated area measurements made on the en-face images. The SB orifice was then analyzed in 88 patients with bifurcation lesions treated with either Xience V (everolimus-eluting stent) or Resolute Integrity [zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES)]. The SB orifice area (A) and the area obstructed by struts (B) were calculated, and the %open area was evaluated as (A-B)/A?100. Results Linear regression modeling demonstrated that the observed departures of the intercept and slope were not significantly different from 0 (-0.12± 0.22, P=0.59) and 1 (1.01± 0.06, R2=0.88, P=0.87), respectively. In cases without SB dilatation, the %open area was significantly larger in the everolimus-eluting stent group (n=25) than in the ZES group [n=32; 89.2% (83.7-91.3) vs. 84.3% (78.9-87.8), P=0.04]. A significant difference in %open area between cases with and those without SB dilatation was demonstrated in the ZES group [91.4% (86.1-94.0) vs. 84.3% (78.9-87.8), P=0.04]. Conclusion The accuracy of SB orifice measurement on an en-face OCT image was validated using a phantom model. This novel approach enables quantitative evaluation of the differences in SB orifice area free from struts among different stent types and different treatment strategies in vivo.

Here we report that HPV-negative cervical epithelial cells failed to be immortalized by telomerase activation or the combination of p53 knockdown and telomerase activation. Under those conditions, p16INK4a expression was always elevated during the late stage of limited cell lifespan, suggesting that cervical epithelial cells possess an intrinsic property of uniquely stringent activation of p16INK4a, which may offer an explanation for the rarity of HPV-negative cervical cancer. Combining p16INK4a knockdown with telomerase activation resulted in efficient immortalization of HPV-negative cervical epithelial cells under ordinary culture conditions. Compared with the HPV16-E6E7-immortalized cell lines derived from the same primary cell sources, the novel HPV-negative immortalized cell lines had lower degrees of chromosomal instability, maintained more sensitive p53/p21 response to DNA damage, exhibited more stringent G2 checkpoint function, and were more resistant to replication-stress-induced genomic instability.

Both developed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and one died of respiratory failure. We hypothesise that the rapid drop in lymphocyte count may have been in part due to the 'low dose bath' of radiation to the whole pulmonary vasculature with consequent killing of the circulating lymphocytes, in addition to low-dose radiation to a high volume of the thymus, thoracic duct, and bone marrow. We therefore suggest close monitoring of lymphocyte count during tomotherapy-CSI and consideration of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in severe lymphopenic patients.

Awareness of this pathological entity that may be a complication of TRUS or due to chronic prostatitis may avoid misinterpretation, especially in the absence of administration of CT contrast to delineate the prostatic ducts. ? 2016 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.","Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Positron-emission tomography; Prostatic neoplasms; Seminal vesicles; Tomography, X-ray computed",fluorodeoxyglucose; prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; awareness; case report; chronic prostatitis; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; drug uptake; human; human tissue; imaging; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; prostate; prostate cancer; prostate hypertrophy; prostatism; seminal vesicle; transrectal ultrasonography; urine,2-s2.0-84964329981

In this paper, we present our experience in organising a postgraduate study day for the Paediatric Immunology and Infectious Diseases (PIID) subspecialty. Principles of adult learning were applied to enable interactive, group-based collaborative learning through trainee-led case discussions and interactive seminar. The Faculty provided feedback to the trainees by objective scoring of their performance. Evaluation from the trainees on the PIID Study Day was positive and self-perception on knowledge in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, investigations and management on infectious diseases in immunocompromised hosts and primary immunodeficiency syndromes increased after the event. The success of this form of postgraduate training activity depends on learners' motivations, the educators' experience and perspectives, and the learning environment. ? 2016, Hong Kong Journal of Paediatrics.

Until oral vaccines are completely withdrawn, the risks of vaccine-associated paralysis continue to exist, requiring a high index of suspicion and timely investigations to evaluate the etiology of acute flaccid paralysis. Here we present a four year old boy with acute paralysis one month after oral polio booster dose.

Conventionally, sedation for ERCP is managed by endoscopists with intravenously administered benzodiazepines and opioids. With increasing complexity of ERCP procedures, there is a trend to involve anesthesiologists to provide sedation and anesthesia. Anesthesiologists are able to provide general anesthesia in failed sedation. Moreover, patients at high risk of aspiration should be identified, and general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation would be a recommended approach in these patients. Anesthesiologists are also experienced in using potent and short-acting intravenous sedation and in management of cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events that arise from sedation. Use of short-acting sedatives would enhance recovery from ERCP.

These two types of cancers alone account for nearly a million deaths annually. Most patients when first diagnosed are already in advanced stage of the disease, where frontline treatments such as surgical resection are ineffective. Alternative treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies are the remaining options for this group of inoperable patients, though each of these treatment options has its own limitations and disadvantages. Discussion: To improve current cancer management, new treatment directions are needed. In the recent decade, Wnt/β-catenin pathway is emerging as a hallmark of various types of malignancies including esophageal and gastric cancers. Its activation is manifested by alteration and deregulation of the core components of this pathway. Conclusion: Identification of key deregulated components along this pathway has opened up a new avenue of research to combat esophageal and gastric cancers by targeting these components to counteract tumorigenesis. ? 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.",Esophageal cancer; Gastric cancer; Therapeutic target; Wnt,axin; beta catenin; cadherin; casein kinase I; dickkopf 1 protein; dishevelled protein; frizzled protein; glycogen synthase kinase 3; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6; lymphoid enhancer factor 1; T cell factor protein; Wnt protein; Article; digestive system cancer; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; esophagus cancer; human; immunohistochemistry; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; protein expression; RNA interference; signal transduction; stomach cancer,2-s2.0-85042571993

Research into the interactional practices in consultations, which involves Chinese patients, is largely absent. Objective: To provide insight into the talk-in-interaction in surgical-oncology consultations in the context of a Chinese medical setting. Methods: Thirty-one consultations involving 31 patients with breast cancer and eight surgeons were videotaped. The recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using conversation analysis. Results: The manner in which surgeons delivered the diagnostic results was fairly similar across all the consultations. Most surgeons gave the diagnosis in a very straightforward and abrupt manner at the outset of the consultation with no mitigation. While patients in our study conformed to the traditional information giving and receiving roles, how information was presented by surgeons shaped the subsequent sequential organization of surgeon-patient interaction and turn-taking patterns. More importantly, there was a tendency by the surgeons to move from issues of psychosocial nature to clinical matters regardless of the topics taken up in the specific encounter. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the potential of conversation analysis as a context-sensitive method that enabled researchers to gain a more thorough understanding of dynamics of interaction in cancer consultations, thereby informing training interventions for surgeons. Our findings underscore the importance of discursive practices in shaping and encouraging (or discouraging) patient participation in oncology consultation. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Breast cancer; Clinical communication; Conversation analysis; Oncology consultation,adult; aged; Breast Neoplasms; China; doctor patient relation; female; human; interpersonal communication; middle aged; oncology; procedures; psychology; videorecording; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; China; Communication; Female; Humans; Medical Oncology; Middle Aged; Physician-Patient Relations; Video Recording,2-s2.0-84954523651

Methods: A random sample of 668 12-year-old students was recruited from a birth cohort. Permanent incisors and first molars were clinically examined for DDE using the modified FDI (DDE) index. Multivariable negative binomial regression was used to examine the association of growth trajectory (five categories) from birth to 12 months with the occurrence of DDE (any defects, demarcated opacities, diffuse opacities, and hypoplasia) in the permanent dentition. Results: The response rate was 76.9% (n = 514). Four hundred and eighty-five children had complete records of growth- and health-related data. In the unadjusted model, infants who had birth weights closer to the WHO average and rapid growth were more likely to have 'demarcated opacities' (p < 0.05), and the first 3 months of life was the 'critical period' to develop 'demarcated opacities' in permanent dentition. However, after adjusting for the confounders (gender, gestational age, mode of delivery, type of feeding, parental education, and health status), significant association with the occurrence of 'demarcated opacities' (p < 0.05) remained only for the children of trajectory V (heavier birth weights and rapid growth); no 'critical period' was found to be significantly associated with DDE. Conclusions: Infants with heavy birth weight and rapid growth during the first year of life were more vulnerable to the occurrence of DDE in terms of demarcated opacities in their permanent dentition. ? 2015 S.

This can occur as a primary isolated renal disease, as a manifestation of systemic diseases such as vasculitis or lupus, or secondary to drugs, infections or tumours. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and a potentially preventable cause of end-stage renal disease, so early diagnosis is vital to allow timely referral to specialist units where renal biopsy can be performed. Proteinuria and/or haematuria are typical findings. Pathogenesis involves cells and mediators of the immune system, including the complement pathway. Intrinsic glomerular cells, especially podocytes, are important in glomerular injury and the response to it. Schemes for appropriate investigations when GN is suspected, guidelines for referral, and strategies for investigation of proteinuria and haematuria, and for management of common forms of GN are presented. When nephrotic syndrome is present, it can lead to major morbidity and potential mortality and should be managed, irrespective of the cause, with diuretics, antiproteinuric agents, cholesterol-lowering agents and, sometimes, anticoagulants. Treatment with corticosteroids, with or without other immunosuppressive agents, is effective in many forms of GN, but adverse effects are problematic. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of GN promises more specific forms of treatment in the future. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",complement; glomerulonephritis; haematuria; kidney; nephrotic syndrome; podocyte; proteinuria; treatment,antihypertensive agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; Article; clinical feature; clinical trial (topic); complement system; focal glomerulosclerosis; glomerulonephritis; glomerulopathy; glomerulus; human; hypertension; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; immunopathogenesis; kidney biopsy; membranous glomerulonephritis; minimal change nephropathy; nephrotic syndrome; nonhuman; priority journal; prognosis; systemic disease,2-s2.0-84940460028

It was first detected by chest X-ray after endotracheal intubation. Repeat X-ray revealed the catheter moved to the stomach and migrated to the lower gastrointestinal tract in a few hours. The patient was treated conservatively and the catheter was passed out on day 14. Newborn resuscitation may result in iatrogenic foreign body in neonates. Serious complications such as respiratory compromise, perforations or abscess may occur. Early referral to a specialized tertiary center with pediatric surgical service is recommended. We hope our experience demonstrated the importance of preventing iatrogenic foreign body in clinical setting.

Video compression reduces the size of multi-frame data and induces blocking effect. This study aims to examine if the blocking effect alters the performances of HCC tumor detection and hepatic lesion classification in CT images. H.264 is considered in this study because it can compress 14-bit grayscale multi-frame data that is compatible with the image requirement of CT. A range of quantization parameters (QP) was determined in a phantom study. With this QP range, the trained support vector machines (SVM) based on image features were applied to test 20 HCC cases and 21 normal cases. The SVM performed significantly better than the random classification for detecting HCC in images compressed with the QP levels of interest. Images compressed with QP1 yielded the best performance. The same range of QP levels was applied to 15 lesion-bearing images. The image quality indices of these images were calculated to form the feature vectors. The clustering of these feature vectors identified at least six clusters. The association of the lesion classes with the identified clusters was found significant for all QP levels of interest. QP5 and QP9 yielded higher association than QP-3 and QP1.

Due to the anatomical location of the nasopharynx, many approaches have been proposed by various authors in the last 30 years to resect locally recurrent tumors in the nasopharynx. There are advantages and disadvantages of various approaches. Of all the approaches, the anterolateral approach with the maxillary swing operation has the largest published experience of over 300 cases from multiple centres. The approach provides wide exposure with minimal postoperative morbidities. Technological advances in the last decade enabled surgeons to resect small recurrent tumors in the nasopharynx with an endoscopic approach or robotic approach, further reducing the morbidities. With the relatively short follow up time of these minimally invasive approaches, the long term oncological outcome could not be compare to open approaches at this stage. Nodal recurrences in NPC is now are after the introduction of concurrent chemoradiation. Nodal recurrence can still be salvaged with a standard radical neck dissection. More extensive disease with invasion to soft tissue of the neck can be salvaged with extended neck dissection together with after-loading brachytherapy as second radiation and reconstruction of the surgical defect with laps. With advanced imaging technologies, small isolated metastasis to the liver and lung can be detected early. Early experience in resection of these isolated metastasis to the liver and lung showed survival beneits in this group of advanced stage NPC patients. Larger scale studies would be needed to deine the role of surgical resection in managing NPC patients with isolated metastasis.",Minimally invasive.; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Operative; Surgical procedures; Surgical procedures,,2-s2.0-85009084556

In endemic area, keratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma is the major histological type and the cancer is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. NPC is a rare disease in Western countries. The incidence of undifferentiated NPC is very much higher in Southern China in comparison with other parts of the world. Oncogenic gene mutations are rarely found in NPC suggesting other risk factors are associated with the disease. Genetic predisposition is a major risk factor at the high incidence areas. Other risk factors including environmental exposure and viral infection could also contribute to the disease. The mainstay treatment for early NPC is radiation therapy as the tumor is very sensitive to radiation. Functional imaging represents a noninvasive method to provide metabolic and clinical information for the guideline of NPC management. Tumor stage and tumor histology have major influence on the treatment outcomes and are significant prognostic factors for local or regional control of NPC. EBV, HPV and a number of oncogenic proteins could serve as critical molecular biomarkers for the monitoring of patients. Comprehensive evaluation on the latest findings on risk factors and prognostic factor may help to identify high-risk community earlier and predict treatment outcome. ? 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It has been suggested that this discrepancy may lead to antibiotic misuse. Currently, there is limited relevant information for the Chinese. This study aims to investigate the duration that Hong Kong Chinese expect their upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to last and its possible association with antibiotic use. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone questionnaire survey with 2,471 adult respondents was conducted in Hong Kong between November and December of 2010. The expected URTI duration of the respondents and their antibiotic use behaviors were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for the effects of demographic factors including age, gender, education and income. Results: Excluding 80 uncertain responses, 544 (23.1%) respondents expected their URTI to last for 1-3 days in general, 613 (25.5%) for 4-6 days, 1168 (48.6%) for 1-2 weeks, and 66 (2.7%) for&gt;2 weeks. The mean of expected duration was 7.4 (SD:4.2) days. Respondents expecting 1-3 days duration were least likely to ask for and be treated with antibiotics. The proportion of respondents being treated with antibiotics for the last URTI increased from 10% for the 1-3 days group to 23% for the&gt;2 weeks group (χ2=19.086, P&lt;0.001). The effect of expected duration remained significant (P=0.0188) after adjusting for the effects of demographic factors. Conclusions: The Hong Kong Chinese expect their URTI to last for about 7 days on average. Different from the notion that underestimation of the actual duration would lead to antibiotic misuse, this study shows that patients expecting a longer duration have a doubled chance to be treated with antibiotics. ?

Ketamine is classified as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist like phencyclidine (PCP) and MK801, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychosis in humans (Javitt et al. 2012). Neurochemical models based on the actions of PCP and ketamine have become progressively well established, with increased focus on glutamatergic dysfunction as a basis for both symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These same effects have contributed to it becoming used as a recreational drug. The reported negative consequences of chronic ketamine use include cognitive impairment, deterioration in psychological well-being, psychotic symptoms, bladder dysfunction, and, in some cases, death. Moreover, chronic and prolonged use of ketamine has led to damage of the nervous system, including neuronal loss, synaptic changes, white matter integrity, and formation of mutated tau protein in neurons, as described in ketamine abuse models of humans, primates, and rodents. Given that the use of ketamine as a “club drug” has increased dramatically in recent years, the side effects are of increasing global concern.

In additional, autologous stem cells can avoid immune rejection after transplantation, and thus it has become one of the most promising alternative strategies for tissue/organ transplantation. However, due to the adverse environments at injured sites, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, current stem cell transplantation efficacy is relatively low. OBJECTIVE: To review the effects of oxidative stress on stem cells and on their transplantation efficiency as well as relevant mechanisms. METHODS: PubMed database was searched by the first author for relevant articles about stem cells published from 1990 to 2015. The keywords were “stem cell transplantation, stem cell, oxidative stress, molecular mechanism”. After eliminating literatures which had poor authority or similar content, 97 articles were involved in result analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Different types of stem cells have different basal endogenous antioxidant stress levels. Oxidative stress through multiple molecular pathways causes cell aging, apoptosis and cancer, which also can result in apoptosis of cancer cells. Stem cells can adjust endogenous antioxidant levels through multiple paths. To improve the endogenous antioxidant stress level using a variety of methods can increase stem cell transplantation efficiency and prevent stem cell cancerization due to oxidative stress, which makes the clinical application of stem cell transplantation therapy safer and more popular. ? 2015, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Both computational methods and mathematical models are necessary to integrate and analyze the information of glycomics data so as to efficiently detect glycan structures. In this paper, we propose a new model to predict the structure of N-glycans, which are the most common type of glycans. Our proposed prediction method is based on a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. The coefficients of our proposed model are solved by using experimental data. We obtain our data from High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) experiments. Three sources of our data are adopted and they are divided into two parts: elution value on an Amide column and elution value on an OctaDecylSilane (ODS) column. After pre-processing the data, we then construct our proposed MLR model. The obtained correlation coefficients are 0.9680 for the Amide data and 0.9263 for the ODS data. We have also tested the correctness of the model statistically. The model test and correlation coefficients demonstrate both the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed model. ? 2015 IET.",Coefficient of Multiple Determination; Glycan; High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC); Multiple Linear Regression (MLR); Structure,Amides; Chromatography; Data handling; High performance liquid chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Oligosaccharides; Operations research; Polysaccharides; Regression analysis; Structure (composition); Coefficient of Multiple Determination; Complex structure; Correlation coefficient; Glycan; Glycan structures; Multiple linear regression models; Multiple linear regressions; Prediction methods; Linear regression,2-s2.0-84971280414

This study sought insights into Chinese new immigrant mothers' perceptions about adult-onset NCDs prevention during childhood. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were carried out with new immigrant mothers from mainland China who had at least one child aged 14 years or younger living in Hong Kong. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and analysed using a Grounded Theory approach. The present study identified three major themes: perceived causes of adult NCDs, beliefs about NCDs prevention and everyday health information practices. Unhealthy lifestyle, contaminated food and environment pollution were perceived as the primary causes of adult NCDs. Less than half of the participants recognized that parents had responsibility for helping children establish healthy behaviours from an early age to prevent diseases in later life. Most participants expressed helplessness about chronic diseases prevention due to lack of knowledge of prevention, being perceived as beyond individual control. Many participants experienced barriers to seeking health information, the most common sources of health information being interpersonal conversation and television. Participants' everyday information practice was passive and generally lacked awareness regarding early prevention of adult-onset NCDs. Updated understanding of this issue has notable implications for future health promotion interventions. ? 2014 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press.

Moreover, the world’s most populous countries, China and India, are an integral part of this large continent. Unfortunately, health care delivery across the Asian continent is very uneven. Childhood mortality and morbidity are important indicators of the quality of health care delivery. Most childhood deaths occur in less developed countries and poorer sectors of the community in more developed countries, reflecting enormous disparities among different geographical areas and population groups. Despite improvement in child health in many of the emerging economies in Asia, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that childhood mortality rate is still more than twice the rate in Latin America and the Caribbean, though much lower than sub-Saharan Africa. In fact in South Asia, 1 in 16 children die before the age of 5 years. Thus the Millennium Development Goal is to reduce by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate of children between the years 1990 and 2015 [2]. To achieve this, health policy reform is needed to ensure that competent staff is available in rural health facilities and that services and transportation are made affordable for these rural communities. Therefore the major challenges in pediatric nephrology practice in many of the emerging economies in Asia still include the management of children with acute kidney injury due to diarrheal diseases with severe dehydration, sepsis, and toxins. On the other hand, the prevention and treatment of children with chronic kidney disease is also emerging as the new challenge for this millennium especially in the more urban communities. ?

Almost all are caused by infection of human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Traditionally, VaIN was classified into grades I, II, and III, depending on the degree of involvement of the epithelium by the dysplastic cells. The 2013 Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) Standardization Project working group and the World Health Organization (WHO) 2014 classification recommend that lesions that are considered as condyloma and VaIN I should now be classified as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs). LSIL is a morphological manifestation of transient, usually low-risk HPV infection. VaIN II/III lesions signify persistent infection by high-risk HPV and are considered precancerous; they should now be classified as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). The change in nomenclature reduces the problem of interobserver variability in assessing VaIN II and also classifies lesions into two biological and managerial groups. Histological assessment of problematic HSIL may be supported by using several immunohistochemical stains such as p16, ki-67, and ProEx C. Patients with persistent high-risk HPV infection are at an increased risk of recurrence and development into squamous cell carcinoma. Although many studies on HPV-associated lesions were done on the cervix, given the biological similarity between those in the vagina and other lower genital sites, it is conceivable that they can be regarded as closely related lesions even if not a single disease entity. Premalignant glandular lesions of the vagina are rare and a brief account will be given. ?

The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) could be activated by a number of growth factors reversibly such as EGF, TGF-alpha, heregulins and HB-EGF. Inhibition of the activation of the EGFR receptor will block the activation of significant oncogenic signaling cascades including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Aberrations of the EGFR family are frequently observed in head and neck cancer. Specific genotypes will affect the treatment outcome and hence impact the prognosis of cancer patients. The use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or specific antibodies is proven to be useful. However, the effects will gradually decline with the development of resistant phenotype. Recent data suggest that cancer cells will compensate the loss of EGFR-mediated signaling effects by increasing the signaling output of other EGFR members such as HER2. Human HER2 (ERBB2 or NEU) is one of the 4 members of the EGFR family. Gene amplification and protein overexpression of HER2 are found in head and neck cancer. Histological data revealed that protein overexpression of HER2 is site- specific with particular high frequency observed in a subset of cancers in head and neck regions. This chapter will provide a summary on HER2 with particular focus on the therapeutic aspects. Further, the significance of HER2 and the growing recognition of the particular functional roles in head and neck cancers will be addressed. ? 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Knowledge about its etiological or prognostic factors is limited. With similar pattern of dissemination, histopathology, prognostic indicators, and survival to ovarian cancer, the treatment of primary tubal cancer generally follows that of ovarian cancer. This chapter reviews the prevalence and potential etiological factors, clinical features, diagnosis, staging and treatment of primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube. Epidemiology Primary fallopian tube carcinoma accounts for approximately 0.14–1.8% of all female genital malignancies, with an estimated average incidence of around 3.6 per million women per year. The reported prevalence of tubal cancers varies among countries. A study from the cancer registries in the USA reported an incidence rate of 4.1 per million women from 1998 to 2003, indicating a relatively stable prevalence of primary tubal cancer. In contrast, a Finnish study showed an increase in the age-adjusted incidence of tubal cancer from 1.2 per million in 1953–1957 to 5.4 per million in 1993–1997, representing a 4.5-fold rise and corresponding to a seven-fold increase in the absolute number of new cases. From 2003 to 2007, the incidence increased further to 6.5 per million. ? Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,2-s2.0-84952909841

To study the clinical effects of selenium on cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, the long-term exposure level of selenium should be adequately assessed. In this chapter, we describe and appraise the questionnaire-based assessment techniques of selenium status, focusing on the use of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in the clinical studies of cardiovascular and chronic diseases. We shall also dissect its pros and cons at the methodology and execution levels in comparison with direct measurement of clinical biomarkers of selenium. As is shown, both questionnaire-based assessment and clinical biomarkers of selenium have their own merits and limitations. Combined assessment approaches can allow interrogation of both short-term and long-term exposure estimates and also allow crossvalidation. The novel findings of genetic polymorphisms related to mechanistic pathways of selenium provide exciting future research opportunities for any diet-gene interactions, when studied in conjunction with the questionnaire-based assessments. ?

The management of CRS remains a challenge despite extensive research into the pathophysiology, discovery of new biomarkers, and ongoing drug trials. This article reviews some of the most important trials for patients with acute decompensated heart failure and CRS using diuretics, vasodilator, levosimendan (a calcium sensitizer), vasoactive and neurohormonal therapies, and finally ultrafiltration for refractory cases. In addition, the trials of a new agent that combines angiotensin-receptor blockade with neprilysin inhibition (enhancing endogenous natriuretic peptide action), and of a new recombinant human relaxin-2 called serelaxin are discussed. For chronic CRS, the blockade of the RAAS and levosimendan given in repetitive dosing is discussed.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is prevalent in the endemic regions including Southern China and Southeast Asia. The primary tumor of NPC is small and usually causes no symptoms. Patients often present with bilateral glands enlargement and local/regional lymph node metastasis leading to poor prognosis and local control rate. Therefore, there is a desperate need to develop early diagnosis method to improve the treatment outcome. Detection of EBV-derived biomarkers in tissues and EBV DNA in the peripheral blood of NPC patients opens up the possibility to monitor the disease using molecular markers with high sensitivity. Among the biomarkers in tissue, in situ hybridization for EBER remains to be the most efficient and reliable way because EBER is the most abundantly expressed viral transcript. In addition to diagnosis value, EBER, EBNA1, and LMP1 levels in tissue after radiation therapy could serve as biomarkers to evaluate response to radiotherapy. In light of the detection of EBV DNA in plasma, serum, nasal brush, and saliva, EBV DNA is particularly useful for periodic monitoring of NPC patients. A systematic review has revealed that circulating EBV DNA could be applied as noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for NPC. Moreover, the close association of circulating EBV DNA with the clinical outcomes of treatment provided new tool to predict the treatment outcome. Nevertheless, circulating EBV DNA was not detectable in all the undifferentiated NPC patients, and EBV latent infection was not associated with WHO-1 NPC, which limits the utility of EBV DNA. Further studies are warranted to identify complementary biomarkers originating from the human cancer cells to overcome the limitation of EBV-based biomarkers in NPC screening and monitoring treatment outcome. ?

The related mechanisms include decreasing the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) leakage and strengthening tight junctions (TJ) between endothelial cells. L. barbarum could modulate the response of blood-vessel-associated glial cells to impact on the integrity of blood-barriers. L. barbarum could inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells under the high concentration of glucose. L. barbarum also showed effects on regulating the expression of blood vessel activating factors to modulate the vasoconstriction, dilatation, and neovascularization, such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β).

Acute and chronic liver diseases greatly threaten the healthy condition of the liver organ. Alternative medicinal therapy, using extracts from natural herbs, provides a promising way to treat and prevent various liver diseases in past decades. Wolfberry has been proposed as a liver-nourishing recipe in the traditional Chinese medicine for more than 1000 years. Modern preclinical studies and clinical trials also suggest their beneficial effects on the liver. The hepatic protective properties of wolfberry may be mainly attributed to its polysaccharides portion, which have demonstrated to ameliorate hepatic injuries caused by both acute and chronic liver diseases, through mechanisms at different cascading levels of cell signaling pathways. In this chapter, we mainly focus on the etiology of fatty liver diseases and the protective mechanisms of wolfberry on the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases. ?

Hong Kong is a shining example In 2011, 13 % of the population was aged 65 years and older, and this proportion is expected to rise to 30 % in 2041. As people are living longer, the burden of disease is expected to rise, which will be preceded by chronic non-communicable diseases (chronic diseases). Chronic diseases commonly encountered with ageing include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. These diseases in turn predispose individuals to as well as magnify the impact of geriatric syndromes of sarcopenia and frailty. While findings indicate that there are some signs of decline or stabilization in the secular trends of mortality rates of most of these diseases in Hong Kong, these trends will be greatly offset by an ageing population. It is projected that by 2036, the number of people with diabetes, stroke, dementia, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) will be at least more than double the number in 2006, with a corresponding impact in terms of disability and an enormous economic burden. ?

Urological procedures range from minor day case to major surgery in which extensive resources are needed both intra- and postoperatively. For simple day case procedures like cystoscopy or ureteroscopy, general anaesthesia is most commonly used because it allows for early ambulation. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) needs special attention. TURP syndrome due to excessive absorption of the irrigation fluid can be catastrophic if not managed early. Avoiding contributing factors and choosing regional anaesthesia which allows for early detection are key. Careful perioperative planning and risk stratification is important in major urological cancer surgery. Most of these procedures will require general anaesthesia (due to longer operative time and more extensive surgical trauma). Postoperative pain management in the form of epidural or patient-controlled multi-modal analgesia are essential. Postoperative high-dependency care is beneficial. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As new agents become available, a critical look at trial design across the spectrum of UC is needed. Early UC trials should aim to stratify patients by risk level, defined by molecular features to reduce the heterogeneity and improve interpretation of trial results. For muscle invasive UC, the practice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be encouraged, especially as complete pathological response could be used as a surrogate end-point measure on trials and has the potential for garnering expedited drug approval. The neoadjuvant setting also provides a unique opportunity for evaluating biomarkers and targeted therapy given the availability of tumor tissue. For advanced disease, more emphasis should be placed on studies for patients who are cisplatin-ineligible or have poorer performance status, which represents many UC patients. Bladder-sparing therapy, incorporating agents targeting the HER2 or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, or immunotherapy are potential new directions in UC. The importance of quality-of-life as an end-point in clinical trials in UC should also not be overlooked. Ultimately, multidisciplinary large-scale collaborations will be the key to move this field forwards. ? 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Advanced urothelial carcinoma; Biological therapies; Bladder cancer; Trial design,biological marker; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; bladder cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer patient; cancer specific survival; cancer tissue; disease marker; drug approval; high risk patient; human; muscle invasive bladder cancer; non muscle invasive bladder cancer; overall survival; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systemic therapy; transitional cell carcinoma; treatment response,2-s2.0-84937827047

The present study aimed to evaluate Mandarin consonant discrimination ability in children with HI, and explore the effects of unaided and aided hearing threshold, the age of first HA fitting and the duration of HA use on consonant discrimination ability. Methods: Subjects were Mandarin-speaking children aged 5;4-12;6 years with profound HI (n= 41), children aged 6;1-12;4 years with severe HI (n= 26), and children aged 5;0-11;9 years with moderate HI (n= 9). The Mandarin Consonant Discrimination Test was administered in six test conditions: -10, -5, 0, 5 and 10. dB signal to noise ratios (S/Ns) and quiet. HAs were in the usual user's settings, adjusted to match the manufacturer prescribed settings and individual preferences, and the volume was set to comfortable listening level. Results: The results revealed that /ph/-/th/, /ts/-/ts/ and /z/-/l/ were the most difficult and /p/-/ph/, /t/-/th/, /tc/-/tch/ and /k/-/kh/ were the easiest consonant minimal pairs to discriminate in quiet both for children with profound HI and those with moderate to severe HI. In noise, no significant difference in performance was found among all consonant minimal pairs. A backward elimination stepwise multiple linear regressions revealed that unaided hearing level accounted for 25.4% of the variance in consonant discrimination performance in noise at 10dB S/N and 30.4% in quiet. However, aided hearing threshold, the age of first HA fitting and the duration of HA use did not significantly predict consonant discrimination ability both in quiet and in noise. Conclusions: Consonant discrimination performance of children with profound HI was poorer than those with moderate to severe HI. The ability to discriminate consonant pairs seems to depend on age of acquisition of the consonants. Although the age of first HA fitting and the duration of HA use were not correlated with consonant discrimination outcomes, this finding does not preclude the importance of early HA fitting. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Hearing aids; Hearing in noise; Hearing loss; Mandarin consonant discrimination,"Article; auditory discrimination; child; consonant; controlled study; female; hearing aid; hearing impairment; hearing test; human; language; major clinical study; male; Mandarin (language); Mandarin Consonant Discrimination Test; Mandarin Early Speech Perception Test; priority journal; signal noise ratio; child; China; hearing aid; Hearing Loss; preschool child; psychology; severity of illness index; speech audiometry; speech perception; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Female; Hearing Aids; Hearing Loss; Humans; Language; Male; Severity of Illness Index; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Speech Discrimination Tests; Speech Perception",2-s2.0-84937164329

LTx recipients with uraemia and diabetes have poor prognosis even when treated with dialysis and insulin. Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) has been proven to be an effective treatment for patients with diabetic uraemia, but rarely performed in patients after LTx. Two cases of SPK after LTx were performed in our centre and we present our experience here. Patients and methods: Two patients received LTx because of HBV related liver cirrhosis; both of them had pre-transplant diabetes mellitus (DM), which worsened after the administration of immunosuppressive drugs. These two patients suffered from CKD and developed uraemia due to diabetic nephropathy and immunosuppressive drugs induced renal toxicity years after LTx. They relied on dialysis and insulin injection. SPK were performed years after LTx and the clinical data was retrospectively analyzed. Results: SPK was successfully performed in these two patients. Pancreatic fluid drainage was achieved via a side-to-side duodenojejunostomy into the proximal jejunum. No serious surgical complications, including pancreatitis or pancreatic fistula were observed postoperatively. In both cases, kidney and pancreatic grafts were functioning well as evidenced by euglycemia without the need for insulin injections and normal serum-creatinine level 7. days after the operation. One of the patients presented with renal graft impairment 1. week after the operation. FK506 was tapered and rapamycin was used when the renal graft biopsy indicated drug toxicity. The patient's kidney graft function recovered gradually after the adjustment. Both patients have good function of liver, kidney and pancreas grafts during a 60-month and 30-month period of follow up. Conclusions: SPK could serve as an effective option for patients with diabetes and uremia after LTx. Perioperative management, especially the immunosuppressive strategy is crucial to improve the outcome of this procedure. ? 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,"creatinine; glucose; insulin; lamivudine; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; rapamycin; steroid; tacrolimus; thymocyte antibody; adult; allograft; Article; bone marrow suppression; case report; chronic kidney disease; cold ischemia; creatinine blood level; diabetic nephropathy; diarrhea; drug blood level; drug megadose; drug pulse therapy; drug substitution; drug treatment failure; drug withdrawal; end stage renal disease; erythrocyte count; glucose blood level; graft recipient; hepatitis B; high temperature procedures; hospital admission; human; immunosuppressive treatment; insulin treatment; kidney biopsy; kidney pancreas transplantation; leukocyte count; liver cirrhosis; liver graft; living donor; low drug dose; male; medical history; middle aged; nephrotoxicity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oliguria; postoperative period; renal replacement therapy; retrospective study; steroid therapy; thrombocyte count; uremia; urine volume; warm ischemia time (procedure); complication; diabetes mellitus; Diabetic Nephropathies; kidney transplantation; liver cirrhosis; liver transplantation; pancreas transplantation; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; uremia; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Nephropathies; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreas Transplantation; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; Uremia",2-s2.0-84930871911

It has also become a global research agenda to identify improved pathways to coordinating outbreak detection. Furthermore, a significant need exists for timely coordination of the detection of potential foodborne disease outbreaks to reduce the number of infected individuals and the overall impact on public health security. This study aimed to offer an effective approach for coordinating foodborne disease outbreaks. First, we identify current coordination processes, complexities, and challenges. We then explore social media surveillance strategies, usage, and the power of these strategies to influence decision-making. Finally, based on informal (social media) and formal (organizational) surveillance approaches, we propose a hybrid information network model for improving the coordination of outbreak detection.

In Hong Kong, a widely used Cantonese term for insanity 'Chi Sin' provides a unique example because of its neutral original sense, as it literally means misconnection in a network circuit. We attempt to trace the origin and subsequent evolution of the term 'Chi Sin' from its early use to the present day to understand how local Hong Kong people have attached increasingly negative connotations to this scientific term since the mid-20th century. Methods: We sampled as many newspapers and magazines published in Hong Kong from 1939 to June 2014 as possible, and sampled 7 popular local movies from the 1950s and 1960s. We also searched all the newspapers published in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Mainland China from January 1998 to June 2014, and searched several other local historical resources. Results: In one early use of 'Chi Sin' in 1939, the term was only used in a technical sense to describe 'short circuiting'. We found that the development of the telephone system, the Strowger system, in Hong Kong is closely related to the evolution of the semantics of the term 'Chi Sin'. Conclusions: The original meaning of short circuitry of the term 'Chi Sin' is no longer used, and it has become a dead metaphor through repeated use with negative emotional connotations. This illustrates some of the factors facilitating the emergence of a metaphor with subsequent semantic drift. ? 2015 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.",Psychotic disorders; Schizophrenia; Semantics; Social stigma,"Article; behavior; China; history of medicine; Hong Kong; human; Macao; medical terminology; mental disease; publication; semantics; Taiwan; telephone; history; literature; mental patient; public opinion; social stigma; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Hong Kong; Humans; Mentally Ill Persons; Metaphor; Public Opinion; Semantics; Social Stigma",2-s2.0-84928492438

The use of oral nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) has brought the management of HBV infection in RTRs to a new paradigm. Lamivudine (LAM) can effectively suppress HBV DNA levels, normalize liver biochemistry, and significantly improve short-and long-term patient survival in HBsAg-positive RTRs. However, it has the burden of high drug resistance. The prevention and management of drug-resistant HBV infection in RTRs has emerged as an important clinical issue. In treatment-na?ve hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive RTRs, ETV has demonstrated high efficacy, low resistance rates, and favorable tolerability. Entecavir can also significantly improve transaminasemia in LAM-resistant patients, although the virological response is relatively modest in comparison to the virological response in treatment-na?ve patients. Adefovir (ADV) and tenofovir (TDF) are viable options for LAM-resistant HBV infection in RTR; however, their use in patients with moderate to severe allograft dysfunction entails a balance between the potential risk and benefit, the appropriate dose adjustment, and allograft function monitoring for nephrotoxicity. The long-term patient survival of HBsAg-positive RTRs has significantly improved with the progress in these effective antiviral treatments, and is approaching the survival rate of their HBsAg-negative counterparts. Many efficacious options of first-line and rescue therapies are available, but the choice of NA in HBsAg-positive RTR should take into consideration antiviral potency, drug resistance pattern, renal allograft function, and the cost and availability of drugs in different localities.

With computed tomography (CT)/cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), three-dimensional (3D) imaging can be produced. These imagings not only facilitate disease diagnosis but also enable computer-aided surgical planning/navigation. In dentistry, the common method for transfer of the virtual surgical planning to the patient (reality) is the use of surgical stent either with a preloaded planning (static) like a channel or a real time surgical navigation (dynamic) after registration with fiducial markers (RF). This paper describes using the corner of a cube as a radiopaque fiducial marker on an acrylic (plastic) stent, this RF allows robust calibration and registration of Cartesian (x, y, z)- coordinates for linking up the patient (reality) and the imaging (virtuality) and hence the surgical planning can be transferred in either static or dynamic way. The accuracy of computer-aided implant surgery was measured with reference to coordinates. In our preliminary model surgery, a dental implant was planned virtually and placed with preloaded surgical guide. The deviation of the placed implant apex from the planning was x=+0.56mm [more right], y=- 0.05mm [deeper], z=-0.26mm [more lingual]) which was within clinically 2mm safety range. For comparison with the virtual planning, the physically placed implant was CT/CBCT scanned and errors may be introduced. The difference of the actual implant apex to the virtual apex was x=0.00mm, y=+0.21mm [shallower], z=-1.35mm [more lingual] and this should be brought in mind when interpret the results.",Cartesian coordinates; Cone beam computed tomography; Implant surgical guide; Mapping; Rigid registration,Calibration; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer vision; Dental prostheses; Diagnosis; Image processing; Implants (surgical); Mapping; Radiography; Stents; Surgery; Tomography; Transplantation (surgical); Cartesian coordinate; Computed tomograms; Cone-beam computed tomography; Disease diagnosis; Rigid registration; Robust calibration; Surgical navigation; Three dimensional (3-D) imaging; Computerized tomography,2-s2.0-84926685284

A small-for-size liver graft is very likely to sustain a significant degree of injury as a result of ischemia, preservation, reperfusion, and rejection. Usually, small-for-size grafts are a concern in living-donor liver transplantation rather than in deceased-donor liver transplantation. Here, we describe the successful transplantation of a liver from a 2-year-old deceased donor to a 61-year-old male recipient who suffered from liver failure related to hepatitis B. No report of successful deceased-donor liver transplantation with discrepancies between donor and recipient age and size to such an extent has been found in the literature. Despite unusually large discrepancies, with effort in minimizing the ischemic time, revised surgical techniques, and strong regenerative power of the ""young"" graft, the old patient's liver function gradually returned to normal. This again proves that the definition of a ""suitable graft"" evolves with time and experience.. ? 2014, Asian Surgical Association. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

Recent data showed that ATM also localizes at the centrosome, but the function remains elusive. TAX1BP2 was initially identified as a novel centrosomal protein that interacts directly with the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-encoded oncoprotein, Tax, and inhibits centrosome overduplication. Subsequently, TAX1BP2 was found to be a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma, and accumulation of TAX1BP2 was observed upon chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Here, we provide evidence that TAX1BP2 is a direct phosphorylation substrate of ATM. The protein level of TAX1BP2 is significantly upregulated in response to DNA damaging agents. Serine-922 of TAX1BP2 is the phosphorylation site of ATM, and such phosphorylation modulates the protein stability, ubiquitination and tumor suppressor activity of TAX1BP2. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that TAX1BP2 is a novel effector of ATM in DNA damage response and delineated a new mechanism by which ATM stabilizes the tumor suppressor TAX1BP2.",,"2-morpholin-4-yl-6-thianthren-1-yl-pyran-4-one; antineoplastic agent; ATM protein; ATM protein, human; cisplatin; etoposide; membrane protein; morpholine derivative; pyrone derivative; serine; tumor suppressor protein; VAC14 protein, human; antagonists and inhibitors; drug effects; enzyme specificity; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; HepG2 cell line; human; metabolism; mutation; phosphorylation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; tumor cell line; ubiquitination; Western blotting; Antineoplastic Agents; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; Blotting, Western; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Etoposide; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Morpholines; Mutation; Phosphorylation; Pyrones; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Serine; Substrate Specificity; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Ubiquitination",2-s2.0-85028193695

The major limitation of lamivudine is the high occurrence rate of resistance mutations leading to virological rebound and hepatitic flares. Entecavir and tenofovir are newer and more potent oral nucleoside and nucleotide analogs respectively, with a high barrier to resistance.

Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that curcumin could suppress proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis in a wide variety of human malignancies through modulating multiple signaling proteins including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases with the capacity to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components. MMPs function in degradation of ECM, generation of active peptides and activation of specific growth factors, leading to the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, which favors the survival of cancer cells. Curcumin suppresses the transcription, secretion and activation of various MMPs. Curcumin also up-regulates the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which curcumin regulates MMPs have been delineated. Curcumin modulates multiple signaling pathways including wnt/β-catenin signaling, notch-1 signaling pathway, TGF-β signaling pathway, janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), protein kinase C (PKC), CC motif ligand 2 (CCL2), and transcription factor activator protein-1(AP-1). These signaling pathways directly or indirectly regulate the expression of various MMPs, implicating that curcumin exertsinhibitory effect on MMPs by suppressing these signaling pathways. Overall, curcumin could be developed as an effective MMPs inhibitor in human cancers. ? 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Curcumin; Matrix metalloproteinases; MMPs inhibitor; Signaling pathways; Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases,,2-s2.0-84952882518

According to the World Heal Organization (WHO) classification, nasopharyngeal carcinoma could be classified into 3 types according to the differentiation status. Among which, type 3 undifferentiated NPC is consistently associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Clinical examination relies very much on conventional imaging with the use of endoscopy and histological assessment of the endoscopic biopsy. To localize and evaluate the extent of tumor in the head and neck regions, computerized tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull base will be employed. These approaches however cannot be applied for routine follow-up examination and screening high-risk population for early cancer detection. In view of the close association EBV with type 3 NPC, the use of EBV-derived genes or gene products are proposed in the surveillance of undifferentiated NPC on tissues obtained with non-invasive means including nasal swabs and peripheral blood. Here, the potential application of EBV DNA and viral proteins in different clinical aspects are discussed.

Design: Case series. Setting: A tertiary referral hospital in Hong Kong. Patients: Data of patients undergoing nephrectomy were collected retrospectively from a clinical database and analysed. A R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score was allocated to each renal tumour by a blinded qualified radiologist, utilising computerised imaging systems. Patient demographics, choice of surgery (radical vs partial), and approaches (open vs minimally invasive) were analysed with respect to their R.E.N.A.L. score. Results: In all, 74 patients were included during the study period, of which 38 underwent partial nephrectomy and 36 underwent radical nephrectomy. No differences between the groups were found with respect to patient demographics. There were significant differences between the partial and radical nephrectomy groups in terms of their mean nephrometry score (6.9 vs 9.3, P<0.001). The mean nephrometry sum was also significantly different in the open approach versus the minimally invasive approach in patients having partial nephrectomy (7.8 vs 6.0, P=0.001). There was no difference in the postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality in the partial nephrectomy and radical nephrectomy groups. Conclusions: The R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score of a renal mass correlated significantly with our choice of surgery (partial vs radical) and our approach to surgery (open vs minimally invasive surgery), particularly in the partial nephrectomy group. It does not, however, correlate with postoperative complications. The nephrometry score provides a useful tool for objectively describing renal mass characteristics and enhancing better communication for the operative planning directed at renal masses.",,"adult; article; artificial embolism; atelectasis; bleeding; computer assisted tomography; female; gout; heart atrium fibrillation; heart muscle ischemia; human; information retrieval; intestine obstruction; kidney tumor; major clinical study; male; middle aged; minimally invasive surgery; mortality; operation duration; partial nephrectomy; radical nephrectomy; RENAL nephrometry scoring system; retrospective study; scoring system; urinary tract infection; urine incontinence; Kidney neoplasms; Nephrectomy; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Nephrectomy; Organ Size; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-84893370391

Among these 15 previously unrecognized coronaviruses were two globally distributed human coronaviruses, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) [8-10]; 10 other mammalian coronaviruses, SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV), Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (Rh-BatCoV HKU2), Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4), Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5), Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (Mi-BatCoV HKU8), Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9), Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 (Sc-BatCoV 512), Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1A/B (Mi-BatCoV 1A/B), equine coronavirus (ECoV) and beluga whale coronavirus SW1 [3,6,11-15]; and three avian coronaviruses, bulbul coronavirus HKU11 (BuCoV HKU11), thrush coronavirus HKU12 (ThCoV HKU12) and munia coronavirus HKU13 (MunCoV HKU13) [2]. Most of these genomes were sequenced using the RNA extracted directly from the clinical specimens, such as nasopharyngeal aspirate or stool, as the template, while the viruses themselves were still non-cultivable [2,3,6,1115]. This provided more accurate analysis of the in situ viral genomes avoiding mutational bias during in vitro viral replication. These sequence efforts have resulted in a marked increase in the number of coronavirus genomes and have given us an unprecedented opportunity to understand this family of virus at the genomic and in silico levels. These understandings have also led to generation of further hypotheses and experiments in the laboratory. In this article, we reviewed our current understanding on the genomics and bioinformatics analysis of coronaviruses. Details of the bioinformatics tools will not be discussed. ? 2014 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-85054232620

Patient characteristics, clinical presentation, referral pattern, contact tracing, diagnostic investigations, treatment and complications were summarised. Among 208 children aged 15 years or below diagnosed with TB, there was a bimodal age distribution (one peak at age 5 years and another at age 14 years) and female preponderance (male to female ratio of 1:1.36 overall and 1:1.92 in age group 12 years or above). TB was found to be more likely in South Asian children (p=0.0001; OR: 4.005, CI: 1.974-8.128), immigrants (p <0.0001; OR: 2.685, CI: 1.956- 3.685) and Down syndrome patients (p<0.0001; OR: 94.47, CI: 38.68-230.71). There were significant acute presentations through emergency service in the younger age group and referrals from the private sector in the older age group. Contact history was positive in 27.9% and positive contacts were mainly parents. Contact tracing was useful for case finding and contact detection rate was 3365/ 100000. Most (87.5%) had been vaccinated the first dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and 22.1% had received BCG booster. Majority was new cases (96.6%). Pulmonary TB was the most common form (65.9%), followed by extrapulmonary TB (26.4%), both pulmonary and extrapulmonary (3.4%), miliary TB (2.4%) and central nervous system TB (2.4%). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was rare (0.48%). Diagnosis of TB was laboratory confirmed in 63.5%, with an overall positive TB culture rate of 51%. Tuberculin skin test was of diagnostic value in the general work up of childhood TB. Histology test and computerised tomography scan achieved high diagnostic sensitivities in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB groups. Drug resistance rates remained low (5.7% to any anti-TB drug) and there was no multi-drug resistant TB. Most of the children received anti-TB drug therapy (95.2%) and there was no mortality. More complicated disease pathologies occurred in 23.1% of cases and risk factors included having BCG booster (p=0.012; adjusted OR: 5.8; 95% CI: 1.46 to 23.26) and female gender (p=0.012; adjusted OR: 4.31; 95% CI: 1.37 to 13.51). Adverse drug reaction incidences remained low. Future studies were suggested to follow the disease characteristics and trend of childhood TB to plan for better management strategy and control of the disease.",Childhood tuberculosis; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Prospective surveillance study; Treatment,BCG vaccine; ethambutol; isoniazid; pyrazinamide; rifampicin; steroid; streptomycin; tuberculostatic agent; adolescent; age distribution; allergy; Article; BCG vaccination; blurred vision; case finding; central nervous system tuberculosis; child; computer assisted tomography; contact examination; diagnostic value; dizziness; Down syndrome; drug dose reduction; drug fever; drug intermittent therapy; drug resistant tuberculosis; emergency health service; extrapulmonary tuberculosis; female; gastrointestinal symptom; hematopneumothorax; hepatitis; histology; Hong Kong; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immigrant; limited mobility; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; miliary tuberculosis; patient referral; pleura biopsy; preschool child; private hospital; prospective study; pruritus; public hospital; rash; school child; sex ratio; South Asian; thrush; tuberculin test; tuberculosis,2-s2.0-85043216117

The Charter articulates principles and minimum standards for facilitating the achievement of rights and obligations enshrined in various international legal ""soft law"" instruments. Due to the multiplicity of international legal instruments, the Sphere Charter provides a tool for a coherent understanding and application of relevant obligations, and therefore increases accountability and efficiency. The Sphere Charter bold human rights based approach to humanitarian assistance, including its articulation of a right to receive humanitarian assistance, may contribute to the evolution of the international legal regime into a more ""victim centered"" system. The central argument postulated in this article is that although the Sphere Charter is not a binding legal instrument, it has significant normative value that may contribute to progressive developments in the legal regime governing humanitarian assistance, and is particularly helpful in improving accountability and quality in the provision of nutrition and health relief. The Sphere Charter framework for local participation is particularly viewed as significant in engendering accountability in relief activities. ? 2015 ? 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",accountability; health; humanitarian assistance; legal; nutrition; rights; Self-regulation; Sphere Charter,,2-s2.0-84941794089

METHODS: Serum GITRL levels were measured in 30 patients with CTD-PAH and 30 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Patients were assessed for clinical and laboratory variables. Correlations of serum GITRL levels with laboratory values and clinical manifestations were assessed. Serum GITRL levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum GITRL levels were markedly increased in CTD-PAH patients compared with healthy controls (mean 47.47±6.28 ng/mL and 5.40±0.83 ng/mL, resp.; P < 0.0001). Serum GITRL levels were positively correlated with the titers of anticardiolipin antibody (ACA-IgM, ACA-IgG) and rheumatoid factor (RF).

Methods: This retrospective study reviewed cases that underwent uterine artery embolisation for symptomatic leiomyomas using A-PVAM from 2009 to 2012 in a single local institute. Pre- and post-embolisation magnetic resonance images of pelvis were evaluated by independent radiologists who were not involved in the procedures, and reduction in the volumes of uterus and dominant leiomyoma was calculated. Procedural details, angiographic features, and clinical consultation notes were reviewed. Procedure-related complications and clinical outcomes were studied. Results: A total of five patients were included in the study. All patients showed reduction in the volumes of the uterus and dominant leiomyomas. The mean volume reduction in the dominant leiomyoma was 45.8% (range, 18.2%-78.8%), and mean uterine volume reduction was 31.4% (range, 12.8%-53.5%). Post-embolisation scans of all patients showed necrosis of the leiomyomas. No procedure-related complications such as endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, transcervical expulsion of leiomyomas, uterine ischaemia, or loss of ovarian function were noted.

Introduction of new treatment modalities including targeted therapy may hopefully bring better survival of patients. A precise pathological diagnosis of HCC is crucial in view of the prognostic and treatment implications. The characteristic histology of HCC can be identified in most cases, yet histological mimickers and poorly differentiated tumors impose diagnostic challenges from time to time. The appropriate use of immunohistochemical markers and cautious interpretation of results are essential in difficult scenarios. Markers such as CD10, polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, HepPar-1, and the recently reported arginase 1 are helpful in confirming the hepatocytic differentiation of a malignant liver tumor. Glypican 3, either singly or in combination with glutamine synthetase and heat shock protein 70, is useful in distinguishing HCC from precursor lesions.

However, the research leading to this conclusion has been based primarily on sources written by Japanese practitioners of Western- style medicine (ran), while the perspectives of Chinese-style (kan) practitioners, who were more numerous than ranp? practitioners but less likely to have shown immediate enthusiasm for vaccination, have been largely neglected. Kanp? doctors typically learned about vaccination from Chinese rather than European sources and often held an ambivalent attitude toward the vaccine’s foreign origins. This article develops an analysis of kanp? writings on vaccination and suggests that skepticism about the vaccine remained widespread for at least a decade after its initial arrival in Japan, providing new insights into both the initial opposition and the subsequent acceptance of the technique. ? 2014, Johns Hopkins University Press.

In general, weekly cetuximab was given with biweekly chemotherapy FOLFOX-4 or FOLFIRI, synchronizing them would be appealed to both patients and health care professionals. Materials and Methods: This Phase II, prospective study investigated the efficacy and safety of using biweekly cetuximab 500 mg/m2 with chemotherapy FOLFOX-4 or FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for Chinese patients with K-ras wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. The study endpoints included overall objective response (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. Results: Total 15 Chinese patients (male: 10 [67%]; median age: 60 [range 41-80]) were enrolled. Patients received median 12 cycles (range 2-12) of chemotherapy + cetuximab (FOLFOX-4 + cetuximab: 9 [60%]; FOLFIRI + cetuximab: 6 [40%]). Six patients (40%) with non-progressive disease after 12 cycles of chemotherapy + cetuximab carried on maintenance cetuximab. Median duration of follow-up (FU) was 23.7 months. The OR was 40% (complete response: 0%; partial response: 40%) for a disease control rate of 87%. Median PFS and OS were 7.8 months and 17.9 months respectively. For maintenance cetuximab phase, median PFS since the start of maintenance cetuximab was 6.8 months and median OS was 17.0 months. The only grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (26.7%) in chemotherapy phase and acneiform rashes (16.7%) in maintenance phase. Conclusions: Biweekly cetuximab with combination chemotherapy was effective and safe as weekly dose. Further studies are warranted for the role of maintenance cetuximab. ? 2014 South Asian Journal of Cancer.

Bremsstrahlung single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) is commonly performed to assess the biodistribution of 90Y-labelled microspheres post-radioembolisation. Because 90Y emits positrons in a small percentage of its decays, 90Y positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has recently been used for this purpose, yielding higher-resolution visualisation of the distribution of the microspheres.

Purpose: This study examined the relationship of self-reported OH with the trajectories of physical and mental HRQoL in Hong Kong at 3, 9, and 15 months after the measurement period using a latent growth curve model. Methods: This study included 5,710 participants recruited in the FAMILY project cohort study during March-October 2009. Self-report OH was measured using a five-point single-item scale, and HRQoL was measured using the physical component scale (PCS) and mental component scale (MCS) of Short Form 12. Latent growth curve model was used to compute the relationship of self-reported OH with the trajectories on HRQoL over time, adjusted for age and sex. Results: The latent growth curve model gave good fit to both the PCS (normed fit index (NFI)=0.98, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.99, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)=0.03) and MCS (NFI=0.97, CFI=0.98, and SRMR=0.03). Better self-reported OH was associated with higher PCS and MCS at the baseline. The longitudinal association with PCS remained constant over time (coefficient=-0.02, p=0.07) but that with MCS diminished over time with baseline oral health status (coefficient=-0.04, p=0.002). Conclusion: Better self-reported OH status was associated with higher level of physical and mental HRQoL, and with negative change in mental HRQoL. ? 2013 International Society of Behavioral Medicine.",Dentistry; Epidemiology; Longitudinal; Structural equation model; Survey,adult; analysis of variance; article; cohort analysis; female; health; Hong Kong; human; male; mental health; middle aged; quality of life; self evaluation; self report; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Cohort Studies; Diagnostic Self Evaluation; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Oral Health; Quality of Life; Self Report,2-s2.0-84899101484

The aim of this study is to report the outcome of eEVAR in Hong Kong. Methods: This was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from Hong Kong Hospital Authority Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), Clinical Management System (CMS), and departmental prospective computerized databases. Patient demographics, clinical and biochemical parameters, perioperative complications, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed. The independent sample t-test was used for continuous variables and the Fisher's exact test was used for nonparametric variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for overall survival and survival of subgroups. Binary logistic regression was performed for factors predicting perioperative mortality. SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses. Results: A total of 40 patients (36 men with a mean age of 74.9 ± 1.53 years [range: 52-89 years]) underwent emergency eEVAR between January 2006 and September 2011 in 6 Hospital Authority Hospitals in Hong Kong. All patients were treated using commercially available aortoiliac endografts (including 26 bifurcated and 14 aorto-uniiliac grafts). There was 1 conversion from eEVAR to open repair. Blood loss, operating time, duration of stay in intensive care, and duration of stay in the hospital were 948 ± 495.5 mL, 194 ± 12.7 min, 4.7 ± 1.26 days, and 14.5 ± 2.19 days, respectively. The 7-day, 30-day, and 12-month mortality rates were 15%, 17.5%, and 35%, respectively. Six patients required reintervention on follow-up, and 8 patients died during hospitalization. Cox regression analysis of survival found that hypotension (P = 0.001) and being >76 years of age (P = 0.002) were associated with reduced overall survival. Binary logistic regression found that hypotension is associated with increased 30-day mortality (P = 0.026). Conclusions: This audit shows that the results of eEVAR in Hong Kong are comparable to international standards. In the endovascular era, this may be an attractive alternative to emergency open aneurysm repair. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is an important cause of morbidity, mortality and renal failure. Treatment of LN has evolved over the past few decades with the advent of new therapeutic options, and the clinical outcome of patients has improved substantially. Areas covered: This review covers data from the clinical studies to date, focusing on the short- and long-term efficacy and safety, on different immunosuppressives, including corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide (CYC), azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), biologic agents (e.g., anti-CD20, anti-BAFF, CTLA4-Ig) and other novel immunomodulatory drugs. Expert opinion: Initial treatment for active proliferative and/or membranous LN should be corticosteroids combined with either CYC or MMF. MMF has the advantages of improved tolerability and ease of administration, and also higher efficacy in patients of African or Hispanic descent. Preliminary data suggest that CYC treatment may lead to a more sustained response, especially in patients with most severe disease. Low-dose corticosteroids with either MMF or AZA, or CNI, can be used as long-term maintenance immunosuppression, and the choice depends on prior induction treatment, history of relapse, and considerations of pregnancy and finance. ?

The knowledge helps the leaders in Emergency Medicine better plan the development of the specialty. In the medical literature, few studies primarily investigated this subject. Most were on the career choice of medical students. This study aimed at addressing this knowledge gap. Methods: It was a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of the year 3 to 5 medical students studying at the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong. The questionnaire measuring their attitude consisted of 16 items in 3 domains: overall merits of Emergency Medicine, the role and function of emergency physicians and the career prospect in Emergency Medicine. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Their attitude was represented by an attitude score with 80 being most positive and 16 most negative. Results: A total of 298 students participated in the survey. The response rate was 64.5%. The overall median attitude score was 59. Year 5 students had a statistically significant higher score. Emergency Medicine ranked third in their first specialty choice after qualification. There was no statistical relationship between a student's attitude score and the specialty choice.
