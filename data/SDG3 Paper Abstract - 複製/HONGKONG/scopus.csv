"A possible role of biogenic silica in esophageal cancer in North China?",2019,"Certain areas in North China have the highest incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the world, which has not seen convincing explanation by any risk factor yet. Biogenic silica in millet bran was linked to ESCC in the early 1980s but the hypothesis was largely dismissed because of the lack of geographic correlation between millet consumption and ESCC. Later epidemiological studies disclosed the linkage of wheat consumption in North China to ESCC instead. Now, we hypothesize silica phytoliths (silicified bodies that have definite shapes) from wheat chaff are a major etiologic factor of ESCC in this region. This hypothesis is supported by the potentially high abundance of silica phytoliths on the bracts of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in North China due to favorable Si-accumulation genotype, arid climate, and siallitic soil with bioavailable Si. These silica phytoliths can contaminate wheat flour and cause repeated local injuries in the esophagus and stimulate proliferation by providing anchorage. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","aridity; biogenic material; cancer; crop residue; epidemiology; geochemistry; phytolith; silica; China; Triticum aestivum; silicon dioxide; chemically induced; chemistry; China; dietary exposure; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; genetics; genotype; human; incidence; risk factor; soil; wheat; China; Dietary Exposure; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Genotype; Humans; Incidence; Risk Factors; Silicon Dioxide; Soil; Triticum"
"Early childhood caries among 3- to 5-year-old children in Hong Kong",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of dental caries among 3- to 5-year-old children in Hong Kong and to investigate the factors associated with their dental caries status. Methods: Seven kindergartens in Hong Kong were selected using stratified random sampling. The 3- to 5-year-old kindergarten children were invited to join the study. The participants’ parents were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their children's demographic and socio-economic backgrounds, their dental habits and their own dental knowledge. Dental caries experience was measured using the decayed, missing and filled primary teeth (dmft) index. The visible plaque index was adopted for recording oral hygiene. The relationships between caries experience and children's demographic backgrounds, dental habits, oral hygiene and parental dental knowledge were studied using a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression analysis. Results: Among the 1,204 participating preschool children, the overall prevalence of dental caries (dmft > 0) was 46%. The mean dmft score was 2.1 ± 3.4. The prevalences of dental caries among the 3-, 4- and 5-year-old children were 38%, 43% and 55%, respectively. ZINB regression analysis revealed that the study children who were boys, came from families with lower incomes, had dental visit experiences, had higher plaque scores and had parents with lower levels of dental knowledge, had higher dmft scores (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Dental caries is prevalent among preschool children in Hong Kong. The caries experiences of the study children are associated with gender, family income, parental dental knowledge, dental visit experience and oral hygiene. ? 2018 FDI World Dental Federation","child; cross-sectional study; deciduous tooth; dental caries; DMF index; Hong Kong; human; male; mouth hygiene; preschool child; prevalence; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Caries; DMF Index; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Oral Hygiene; Prevalence; Tooth, Deciduous"
"Influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality in China, 2010–15: a population-based study",2019,"Background: The estimation of influenza-associated excess mortality in countries can help to improve estimates of the global mortality burden attributable to influenza virus infections. We did a study to estimate the influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality in mainland China for the 2010–11 through 2014–15 seasons. Methods: We obtained provincial weekly influenza surveillance data and population mortality data for 161 disease surveillance points in 31 provinces in mainland China from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the years 2005–15. Disease surveillance points with an annual average mortality rate of less than 0·4% between 2005 and 2015 or an annual mortality rate of less than 0·3% in any given years were excluded. We extracted data for respiratory deaths based on codes J00-J99 under the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Data on respiratory mortality and population were stratified by age group (age <60 years and ?60 years) and aggregated by province. The overall annual population data of each province and national annual respiratory mortality data were compiled from the China Statistical Yearbook. Influenza surveillance data on weekly proportion of samples testing positive for influenza virus by type or subtype for 31 provinces were extracted from the National Sentinel Hospital-based Influenza Surveillance Network. We estimated influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality rates between the 2010–11 and 2014–15 seasons for 22 provinces with valid data in the country using linear regression models. Extrapolation of excess respiratory mortality rates was done using random-effect meta-regression models for nine provinces without valid data for a direct estimation of the rates. Findings: We fitted the linear regression model with the data from 22 of 31 provinces in mainland China, representing 83·0% of the total population. We estimated that an annual mean of 88 100 (95% CI 84 200–92 000) influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths occurred in China in the 5 years studied, corresponding to 8·2% (95% CI 7·9–8·6) of respiratory deaths. The mean excess respiratory mortality rates per 100 000 person-seasons for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses were 1·6 (95% CI 1·5–1·7), 2·6 (2·4–2·8), and 2·3 (2·1–2·5), respectively. Estimated excess respiratory mortality rates per 100 000 person-seasons were 1·5 (95% CI 1·1–1·9) for individuals younger than 60 years and 38·5 (36·8–40·2) for individuals aged 60 years or older. Approximately 71 000 (95% CI 67 800–74 100) influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths occurred in individuals aged 60 years or older, corresponding to 80% of such deaths. Interpretation: Influenza was associated with substantial excess respiratory mortality in China between 2010–11 and 2014–15 seasons, especially in older adults aged at least 60 years. Continuous and high-quality surveillance data across China are needed to improve the estimation of the disease burden attributable to influenza and the best public health interventions are needed to curb this burden.

"Cellular energy stress induces AMPK-mediated regulation of glioblastoma cell proliferation by PIKE-A phosphorylation",2019,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer-activating Akt (PIKE-A), which associates with and potentiates Akt activity, is a pro-oncogenic factor that play vital role in cancer cell survival and growth. However, PIKE-A physiological functions under energy/nutrient deficiency are poorly understood. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that is a principal regulator of energy homeostasis and has a critical role in metabolic disorders and cancers. In this present study, we show that cellular energy stress induces PIKE-A phosphorylation mediated by AMPK activation, thereby preventing its carcinogenic action. Moreover, AMPK directly phosphorylates PIKE-A Ser-351 and Ser-377, which become accessible for the interaction with 14-3-3β, and in turn stimulates nuclear translocation of PIKE-A. Nuclear PIKE-A associates with CDK4 and then disrupts CDK4-cyclinD1 complex and inhibits the Rb pathway, resulting in cancer cell cycle arrest. Our data uncover a molecular mechanism and functional significance of PIKE-A phosphorylation response to cellular energy status mediated by AMPK. ? 2019, The Author(s).","cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase 4; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; serine; Article; cell cycle arrest; cell energy; cell proliferation; cell stress; cellular distribution; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; feedback system; glioblastoma; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; pike a proto oncogene; priority journal; protein function; proto oncogene; signal transduction"
"Chinese Medicine in Cancer Treatment – How is it Practised in the East and the West?",2019,"Chinese medicine therapies in cancer treatment are very common in the East. Although it is usually classified as a form of complementary and alternative therapy in the West, Chinese medicine is an independent medical profession in Hong Kong and mainland China. It has a different perspective in understanding health and diseases compared with Western medicine. In oncology practice, whereas Western medicine focuses on direct tumour eradication by surgery, radiation therapy and systemic therapies, Chinese medicine focuses on restoring body balance and enhancing the body's defences (immunity), in addition to some cytotoxic herbal therapies. Most often patients, especially those in the East, receive both treatments. Chinese medicine is also commonly used to reduce side-effects from chemotherapy or radiation therapy, to aid recovery after an operation, to palliate symptoms and to address survivorship issues. However, this raises concerns of drug–herb interactions and toxicity in combination therapies. Commonly used Chinese medicine treatment modalities include acupuncture, moxibustion, diet therapy, prescribed Chinese medicine herbal decoction, single Chinese medicine herbs or supplements and tai chi. Although there is an increasing trend of Chinese medicine use in cancer patients in both the East and the West, the scientific evidence of safety and efficacy is often questioned by oncologists. This article reviews the current evidence in different Chinese medicine therapies in cancer management in both the East and the West. ? 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists","antineoplastic agent; Chinese drug; herbaceous agent; placebo; acupuncture; Article; cancer chemotherapy; Chinese medicine; human; malignant neoplasm; oriental medicine; priority journal; unspecified side effect; western medicine"

"Deferred treatment with a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1, 2, 4 and 6 infection",2019,"Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In this single-arm, open-label, phase 3, deferred treatment study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir among patients randomized to the placebo group in the ASTRAL-1 study. Patients received sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400/100?mg) once daily for 12?weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response 12?weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12). The primary safety endpoint was any adverse events (AEs) leading to the permanent discontinuation of study drug. Overall, 108/111 (97%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 92%-99%) achieved SVR12, and only one patient had virological failure. SVR12 was achieved by 61/63 (97%, 95%CI, 89%-100%) genotype 1 patients, 20/20 (100%; 95%CI, 83%-100%) with genotype 2, 19/19 (100%; 95%CI, 82%-100%) with genotype 4 and 8/9 (89%; 95% CI, 52%-100%) with genotype 6. All (19/19; 95%CI, 82-100) patients with cirrhosis and all (31/31, 95%CI, 89-100) with prior treatment experience achieved SVR12. The safety profile during treatment was similar to that observed in patients receiving placebo treatment. The most common AEs were headache, fatigue and nausea. One patient (1%) discontinued treatment due to an AE of gallbladder carcinoma, which was not considered related to treatment. Of five reported serious AEs, none were considered related to study drug. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12?weeks was effective and well tolerated among untreated and previously treated patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4 or 6 infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02346721). ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","creatine kinase; nonstructural protein 5A; nonstructural protein 5B; sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir; Article; coughing; creatine kinase blood level; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; fatigue; female; headache; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; Hepatitis C virus genotype 4; Hepatitis C virus genotype 6; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hyperglycemia; lack of drug effect; major clinical study; male; nausea; outcome assessment; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; relapse; side effect; sustained virologic response; treatment duration; treatment outcome"
"High risk Epstein-Barr virus variants characterized by distinct polymorphisms in the EBER locus are strongly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma",2019,"Whether certain variants of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) are linked to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which shows a marked geographic restriction, remains an unresolved issue. We performed a case–control study comparing genomic sequences of EBV isolated from saliva samples of 142 population carriers with those from primary tumour biopsies derived from 62 patients with NPC of Hong Kong. Cluster analysis discovered five EBV subgroups 1A-C and 2A-B amongst the population carriers in contrast to the predominance of 1A and -B in the majority of NPC. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a panel of NPC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels in the EBER locus. The most significant polymorphism, which can be found in 96.8% NPC cases and 40.1% population carriers of Hong Kong, is a four-base-deletion polymorphism downstream of EBER2 (EBER-del) from coordinates 7188–7191 (p = 1.91 × 10 ?7 ). In addition, the predicted secondary structure of EBER2 is altered with likely functional consequence in nearly all NPC cases. Using the SNPs and indels associated with NPC, genetic risk score is assigned for each EBV variant. EBV variants with high genetic risk score are found to be much more prevalent in Hong Kong Chinese than individuals of other geographic regions and in NPC than other EBV-associated cancers. We conclude that high risk EBV variants with polymorphisms in the EBER locus, designated as HKNPC-EBERvar, are strongly associated with NPC. Further investigation of the biological function and potential clinical application of these newly identified polymorphisms in NPC and other EBV-associated cancers is warranted. ? 2018 UICC","virus RNA; virus DNA; virus RNA; Article; carcinogenesis; case control study; Chinese; cluster analysis; controlled study; disease association; Epstein Barr virus; female; gene deletion; gene locus; gene sequence; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; geography; haplotype; Hong Kong; human; indel mutation; major clinical study; male; nasopharynx carcinoma; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; protein secondary structure; risk assessment; saliva analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; tumor biopsy; virus carrier; virus isolation; virus load; classification; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; genetics; heterozygote; isolation and purification; nasopharynx carcinoma; nasopharynx tumor; principal component analysis; saliva; virology; virus genome; Carrier State; Case-Control Studies; DNA, Viral; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Genetic Loci; Genome, Viral; Genome-Wide Association Study; Haplotypes; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Hong Kong; Humans; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; RNA, Viral; Saliva"
"Enhancing tetrandrine cytotoxicity in human lung carcinoma A549 cells by suppressing mitochondrial ATP production",2019,"ATP depletion induced by inhibiting glycolysis or mitochondrial ATP production has been demonstrated to cause cancer cell death. Whether ATP depletion can enhance the efficacy and potency of anti-cancer effects of herbal compounds is so far unknown. We examined the enhancing effect of ATP depletion on anti-cancer actions of tetrandrine (TET) in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. A 24-h incubation of A549 cells with tetrandrine caused a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect (LC 50 = 66.1?μM). Co-incubation with 20?mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, glycolysis inhibitor) caused only a very slight enhancement of tetrandrine cytotoxicity. By contrast, inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production with oligomycin (10?μM, ATP synthase inhibitor) and FCCP (30?μM, uncoupling agent) (thus, oligo-FCCP) on its own caused only slight cell cytotoxicity but strongly potentiated tetrandrine cytotoxicity (tetrandrine LC 50 = 15.6?μM). The stronger enhancing effect of oligo-FCCP than 2-DG on TET toxicity did not result from more severe overall ATP depletion, since both treatments caused a similar ATP level suppression. Neither oligo-FCCP nor 2-DG synergized with tetrandrine in decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. TET on its own triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and oligo-FCCP, but not 2-DG, potentiated TET in causing ROS production. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibiting ATP production from mitochondria, but not from glycolysis, appears to be a very effective means in augmenting TET-triggered ROS production and hence toxicity in A549 cells. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adenosine triphosphate; carbonyl cyanide 4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; deoxyglucose; oligomycin; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reactive oxygen metabolite; tetrandrine; A-549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; Article; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; cytotoxicity; glycolysis; human; human cell; lung carcinoma; mitochondrial membrane potential"
"A network pharmacology-based study on the anti-hepatoma effect of Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae",2019,"Background: Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (RSM), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis in various human cancers. However, the anticancer effects of RSM on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of RSM in the treatment of HCC using a network pharmacology approach. In vivo and in vitro experiments were also performed to validate the therapeutic effects of RSM on HCC. Results: In total, 62 active compounds from RSM and 72 HCC-related targets were identified through network pharmacological analysis. RSM was found to play a critical role in HCC via multiple targets and pathways, especially the EGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In addition, RSM was found to suppress HCC cell proliferation, and impair cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that RSM induced cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis, and western blot analysis showed that RSM up-regulated the expression of BAX and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in MHCC97-H and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, RSM administration down-regulated the expression of EGFR, PI3K, and p-AKT proteins, whereas the total AKT level was not altered. Finally, the results of our in vivo experiments confirmed the therapeutic effects of RSM on HCC in nude mice. Conclusions: We provide an integrative network pharmacology approach, in combination with in vitro and in vivo experiments, to illustrate the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of RSM action on HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antineoplastic agent; Chinese drug; cryptotanshinone; epidermal growth factor receptor; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; liver protective agent; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein Bax; protein kinase B; Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae extract; tanshinone IIA; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell cycle G2 phase; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; chemical composition; Chinese medicine; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug megadose; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene ontology; Hep-G2 cell line; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; liver protection; low drug dose; male; MHCC97-H cell line; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; Pi3K/Akt signaling; plant root; protein binding; protein expression level; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; tumor invasion; upregulation; Western blotting"
"On-Chip Hardware Accelerator for Automated Diagnosis Through Human-Machine Interactions in Healthcare Delivery",2019,"The automated diagnosis helps us better understand the complex landscape of diseases, leading to more effective, early and reliable medical diagnosis and therapy. The human-machine interactions in healthcare delivery relying on automated cyber-physical systems (ACPSs) play an important role in the automated diagnosis. Currently, the multicore accelerator used for ACPS has utilized the network-on-chip (NoC) for personalized healthcare. However, the discrete cores based on NoC are affected by limited computation speed, since the data have to pass through an electrical interconnect. In this paper, we propose a novel optical NoC (ONoC) solution of designing discrete cores to quickly understand biomarkers for early detecting abnormal pathophysiology, such as the deviation from the protein's native state. We analyze the performance of our ONoC-based ACPS accelerator for personalized healthcare by virtue of the tested proteins widely adopted in the lattice protein model. Our mathematical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the chip area becomes smaller than a traditional design, which makes the personalized healthcare product more convenient; 2) the computation speed is promoted, resulting in the rapid understanding of biomarkers; and 3) we improve the data transmission reliability through accurately capturing the photonic effect so that desirable human-machine interactions can be guaranteed. Note to Practitioners-We design an on-chip hardware accelerator for automated diagnosis and personalized healthcare by predicting biological protein folding. The simulation results based on the lattice protein model can well guide the practitioners to design a more convenient and reliable product quickly detecting the biomarker, such as the deviation from the protein's native state. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.","Automation; Biomarkers; Cyber Physical System; Diagnosis; Disease control; Electric power transmission; Embedded systems; Health care; Man machine systems; Network-on-chip; Proteins; Reliability analysis; Servers; Automated cyber-physical system (ACPS); Automated diagnosis; Electrical interconnects; Hardware accelerators; Human machine interaction; Lattice protein model; Optical network on chip (ONoC); Personalized healthcare; Integrated circuit design"
"Brain network connectivity mediates education-related cognitive performance in healthy elderly adults",2019,"Background: Among the protective factors for cognitive decline related to aging and Alzheimer’s disease, education level is one of the most prominent. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of education on cognition remain to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to systematically assess the role of Functional Connectivity (FC) of resting-state brain networks playing in the cognition-protection effect of education. Methods: Data from a battery of neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging in resting-state were acquired in 77 cognitively normal elderly participants from local communities in Beijing, China. Six resting-state networks related to primary function or complex cognition were extracted through independent component analysis. We then explored the relationships between education level, cognition, and FC of these networks. Results: We found that education level was positively associated with a wide range of complex cognitive domains including general mental status, episodic memory, language, attention, executive function and visuospatial processing, and it showed significantly negative correlations with FC of multiple areas in the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Left Frontal-parietal Network (LFP) which are related to complex cognition. And regional connectivity of DMN was significantly negatively correlated with episodic memory performance. Further mediation analysis suggested that higher education level was associated with higher episodic memory performance through lower regional connectivity of DMN. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that inhibitory modulation in the resting-state brain networks related to complex cognition is one of the main routes through which education exerts its protective effects on cognition in normal aging. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","apolipoprotein E; adult; Article; attention; brain region; China; cognition; default mode network; depth perception; episodic memory; executive function; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; genotype; human; language; left frontal parietal network; male; mental health; neuropsychological test; normal human; patient education; priority journal; resting state network; senescence"
"Hearing voices and its psychosocial correlates in four Chinese samples",2019,"The experience of hearing voices is common in both clinical and nonclinical populations and has been found to be associated with various psychosocial factors (e.g., trauma, dissociation). However, little is known about voice-hearers (VHs) in the Chinese context. This study investigated the experience of hearing voices and its relationships with psychosocial variables in four independent Chinese samples, including two college student samples (n =?328), a sample of patients with depression (n =?71) and a sample of females with disabilities (n =?94). Self-report survey data were analyzed. Around 26% to 28% of participants in the three non-psychiatric samples reported hearing voices. Evidence for the differences in age, trauma exposure, overall psychopathology, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms between VHs and non-VHs is insufficient or inconsistent across samples. There is some evidence for voice-hearing being associated with poor mental well-being, dissociation and ‘borderline personality’ symptoms. This study provides the first data regarding voice-hearing experiences and their psychosocial correlates in the Chinese context. Implications for research and practice are discussed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Gelsolin-like actin-capping protein has prognostic value and promotes tumorigenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the Hippo signaling pathway in human bladder cancer",2019,"Background: Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, the major histologic subtype of bladder cancer, is increasing in incidence and mortality, which requires the identification of effective biomarkers. Actin-regulating proteins have recently been proposed as important antitumor druggable targets. As a gelsolin-family actin-modulating protein, CAPG (gelsolin-like actin-capping protein) generated great interest due to its crucial effects in various biological and physiological processes; however, the role and mechanism of CAPG in TCCs remain unknown. Materials and methods: Bioinformatic analysis and immunohistochemistry of clinical specimens were performed to detect the expression level of CAPG. Both in vitro and in vivo assays were used to determine the oncogenic effect of CAPG in TCCs. Male 4–5-week-old BALB/c nude mice were used for in vivo tumorigenesis assays, while SCID mice were used for in vivo metastatic assays. Affymetrix microarray was used to identify the underlying molecular mechanism. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to validate the expression and localization of proteins. Results: CAPG was frequently upregulated in TCCs and associated with clinical aggressiveness and worse prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that CAPG could contribute to the tumorigenesis, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TCCs both in vitro and in vivo. A novel mechanism that CAPG promoted TCC development via inactivating the Hippo pathway, leading to a nucleus translocation of Yes-associated protein was suggested. Conclusions: The current study identified CAPG as a novel and critical oncogene in TCCs, supporting the pursuit of CAPG as a potential target for TCC intervention. ?

"Lean mass, grip strength and risk of type 2 diabetes: a bi-directional Mendelian randomisation study",2019,"Aims/hypothesis: Muscle mass and strength may protect against type 2 diabetes as a sink for glucose disposal. In randomised controlled trials, resistance training improves glucose metabolism in people with the metabolic syndrome. Whether increasing muscle mass and strength protects against diabetes in the general population is unknown. We assessed the effect of markers of muscle mass and strength on diabetes and glycaemic traits using bi-directional Mendelian randomisation. Methods: Inverse variance weighting estimates were obtained by applying genetic variants that predict male lean mass, female lean mass and grip strength, obtained from the UK Biobank GWAS, to the largest available case–control study of diabetes (DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis [DIAGRAM]; n = 74,124 cases and 824,006 controls) and to a study of glycaemic traits (Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium [MAGIC]). Conversely, we also applied genetic variants that predict diabetes, HbA 1c , fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-B to UK Biobank summary statistics for genetic association with lean mass and grip strength. As sensitivity analyses we used weighted median, Mendelian randomisation (MR)-Egger and Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) and removed pleiotropic SNPs. Results: Grip strength was not significantly associated with diabetes using inverse variance weighting (OR 0.72 per SD increase in grip strength, 95% CI 0.51, 1.01, p = 0.06) and including pleiotropic SNPs but was significantly associated with diabetes using MR-PRESSO (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62, 0.95, p = 0.02) after removing pleiotropic SNPs. Female lean mass was significantly associated with diabetes (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84, 0.99, p = 0.02) while male lean mass was not significant but directionally similar (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88, 1.01, p = 0.09). Conversely, diabetes was inversely and significantly associated with male lean mass (β ?0.02 SD change in lean mass, 95% CI ?0.04, ?0.00, p = 0.04) and grip strength (β ?0.01, 95% CI ?0.02, ?0.00, p = 0.01). Conclusions/interpretation: Increased muscle mass and strength may be related to lower diabetes risk. Diabetes may also be associated with grip strength and lean mass. Muscle strength could warrant further investigation as a possible target of intervention for diabetes prevention. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; adult; Article; biobank; diabetic patient; fasting; female; genetic association; genetic variability; glucose metabolism; grip strength; homeostasis model assessment; human; lean body weight; major clinical study; male; Mendelian randomization analysis; metabolic syndrome X; muscle mass; muscle strength; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance; pleiotropy; population; priority journal; resistance training; risk; single nucleotide polymorphism; aged; blood; body weight; gene frequency; genetics; genome-wide association study; glucose blood level; hand strength; Mendelian randomization analysis; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; odds ratio; pathology; pathophysiology; phenotype; risk factor; skeletal muscle; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Gene Frequency; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hand Strength; Humans; Insulin; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Odds Ratio; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Resistance Training; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; United Kingdom"
"A novel radiographic classification of severe spinal curvatures exceeding 100°: the Omega (Ω), gamma (γ) and alpha (α) deformities",2019,"Purpose: For spine curvatures with Cobb angles > 100°, curve classification and characterization become more difficult with conventional radiographs. 3-D computerized axial tomography scans add relevant information to categorize and describe a new classification to aid preoperative assessment in communication and patient evaluation. The purpose of this study is to describe a radiographic classification system of curves exceeding 100°. Methods: A consecutive series of patients with curves exceeding 100° underwent a full spine radiographic review using conventional radiographs and 3-D CT. A descriptive analysis was performed to categorize curves into 4 main types (1, 2, 3 and 4) and 6 subtypes (1C, 1S, 1CS, 2P, 2D and 2PD) based on the location of the Cobb angle of the major scoliotic and kyphotic deformity as well as the location of the upper/lower end vertebra relative to the apical vertebra. Results: A total of 98 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 51 males and 47 females with an average age of 17.8 ± 4.5?years. The diagnosis included idiopathic (48); congenital (24); neuromuscular (4); and neurofibromatosis (2). The mean major coronal and sagittal Cobb (kyphosis) were 131.2° ± 23.4° and 154 ± 45.6, respectively. The classification scheme yielded 4 main types (1, 2, 3 and 4) and 6 subtypes under types 1 and 2 (1C, 1S, 1CS, 2P, 2D and 2PD). Conclusions: Our study describes a novel method of classifying severe spinal curvatures exceeding 100° using erect AP/lateral radiographs and 3-D CT reconstructive images. We hope that the descriptive analysis and classification will expand our understanding of these complex deformities.

"Effect of oral hygiene programmes on oral opportunistic pathogens during stroke rehabilitation",2019,"Objectives: This study was to assess the effectiveness of a conventional oral hygiene care programme (COHCP) and an advanced oral hygiene care programme (AOHCP) on prevalence and viable counts of oral opportunistic pathogens among patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation. Methods: A total of 94 patients were randomized to two groups. Subjects were block randomized to either (a) COHCP: manual toothbrushing with oral hygiene instruction (OHI); or (b) AOHCP: powered toothbrushing, mouthrinsing with chlorhexidine and OHI. Prevalence and viable counts of oral opportunistic pathogens including yeasts, aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, were assessed at baseline, the end of 3 and 6?months. Results: No significant difference was observed in the prevalence of oral opportunistic pathogens within each group over the clinical trial period. A significant decrease in the viable counts of S.?aureus was found over the clinical trial period within AOHCP group (p?<?0.05), while the viable counts of yeasts and anaerobic gram-negative bacillus (AGNB) remained stable within each group. Regression analysis failed to detect an association between intervention and the prevalence/viable counts of oral opportunistic pathogens. Conclusions: Neither oral healthcare programme significantly affects AGNB, yeast or S.?aureus over the study period in terms of prevalence and viable counts. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Linifanib exerts dual anti-obesity effect by regulating adipocyte browning and formation",2019,"Obesity is caused by energy imbalance and accompanied by adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Therefore, both enhancement of adipocyte energy expenditure and inhibition of adipogenesis are viable ways to combat obesity. Using the Ucp1-2A-luciferase reporter animal model previously reported by us as a screening platform, a chemical compound Linifanib was identified as a potent inducer of UCP1 expression in primary inguinal adipocytes in vitro and in vivo. Signal pathway analyses showed that Linifanib promoted adipocyte browning by attenuating STAT3 phosphorylation. The effects of Linifanib on adipocyte browning were blocked by the compound, SD19, which activates the STAT3 signaling cascade. Linifanib also inhibited adipocyte differentiation, by blocking mitotic clonal expansion, which could be rescued by STAT3 activator. Taken together, our results indicate that Linifanib might serve as a potential drug for the treatment of obesity. ? 2019","linifanib; STAT3 protein; uncoupling protein 1; antiobesity agent; carbanilamide derivative; indazole derivative; N-(4-(3-amino-1H-indazol-4-yl)phenyl)-N1-(2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)urea; STAT3 protein; Stat3 protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; brown adipocyte; cell differentiation; cell expansion; cell metabolism; controlled study; drug effect; drug identification; drug structure; enzyme activation; in vitro study; in vivo study; mitosis; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; brown adipocyte; cell culture; dose response; drug effect; metabolism; physiology; randomization; Smegmamorpha; transgenic mouse; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes, Brown; Adipogenesis; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Cells, Cultured; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Indazoles; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Phenylurea Compounds; Random Allocation; Smegmamorpha; STAT3 Transcription Factor"
"Role of DLC2 and RhoA/ROCK pathway in formalin induced inflammatory pain in mice",2019,"Deficiency of deleted in liver cancer 2 (DLC2), a novel domain to inhibit RhoA activity, plays an important role in inflammatory pain. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the role of DLC2 and its downstream cascade of RhoA/ROCK in formalin-induced inflammatory pain using DLC2-knockout (DLC2?/?) mice and compared them with DLC2 wild-type (DLC2+/+) mice. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated using von Frey filament aesthesiometer and Hargreaves test, respectively. The spinal cord dorsal horn (L3-L5) was selected for molecular and cellular identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence. DLC2?/? mice showed increased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Expression of ROCK1, ROCK2 and IL-1β was significantly higher in DLC2?/? mice. Intrathecal administration of RhoA inhibitor (C3 exoenzyme) or ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) significantly attenuated formalin-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia in DLC2?/? mice. ROCK2 and IL-1β expression were reduced by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632. Spinal p38 activation was also inhibited by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632. Double-labelling immunofluorescence demonstrated co-localization of DLC2 with spinal dorsal microglia. The number of activated microglia in the spinal dorsal horn was significantly higher in DLC2?/? mice, but was reduced by Y27632. These findings indicate that DLC2 deficiency increased formalin-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia through regulating RhoA/ROCK2, and IL-1β may be a downstream effector. Our results also suggest that RhoA/ROCK enhanced p38 activation plays an important role in formalin-induced inflammatory pain. The finding that DLC2 attenuated inflammatory pain through inhibiting RhoA/ROCK2 suggests that the DLC2/RhoA/ROCK2/p38/IL-β pathway may be a potential therapeutic target to reduce inflammatory pain. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","4 (1 aminoethyl) n (4 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; deleted in liver cancer 2; exoenzyme C3; interleukin 1beta; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; synaptophysin; tumor protein; unclassified drug; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; formalin-induced pain; Hargreaves test; hyperalgesia; immunofluorescence; inflammatory pain; knockout mouse; male; mechanical allodynia; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; spinal cord dorsal horn; thermal hyperalgesia; von Frey test; Western blotting; wild type mouse"
"Photo-responsive chitosan/Ag/MoS2 for rapid bacteria-killing",2020,"Bacterial infection is a serious problem threatening human health. The chitosan (CS)-modified MoS2 coating loaded with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was designed on the surface of titanium (Ti) to kill bacteria rapidly and efficiently under 660 nm visible light. Ag/MoS2 exhibited high photocatalytic activity due to the rapid transfer of photo-inspired electrons from MoS2 to Ag NPs, resulting in higher yields of radical oxygen species (ROS) to kill bacteria. The covering of CS made the composite coating positively charged to further enhance the antibacterial property of the coating. In addition, CS/Ag/MoS2-Ti also showed a certain photothermal effect. in vitro results showed that the antibacterial efficiency of the coating on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was 98.66% and 99.77% respectively, when the coating was irradiated by 660 nm visible light for 20 min. Cell culture tests showed that CS/Ag/MoS2-Ti had no adverse effects on cell growth. Hence, this surface system will be a very promising strategy for eliminating bacterial infection on biomedical device and implants safely and effectively within a short time. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Chitosan; Composite coatings; Escherichia coli; Implants (surgical); Layered semiconductors; Light; Molybdenum compounds; Silver nanoparticles; Surface treatment; Antibacterial; Antibacterial properties; High photocatalytic activities; MoS2; Photo-catalytic; Radical oxygen species; Silver nanoparticles (AgNps); Staphylococcus aureus; Photocatalytic activity; chitosan; molybdenum; molybdenum disulfide; oxygen derivative; silver nanoparticle; titanium; unclassified drug; antibiotics; antimicrobial activity; bacterium; catalysis; coating; composite; disinfection; molybdenum; photodegradation; silver; sulfate; visible spectrum; antibacterial activity; Article; cytotoxicity test; electron transport; Escherichia coli; in vitro study; light; material coating; photocatalysis; photosensitivity; Staphylococcus aureus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus aureus"
"Cariogenic microbiome and microbiota of the early primary dentition: A contemporary overview",2019,"Recent advances in the field of molecular microbiology provide an unprecedented opportunity to decipher the vast diversity of the oral microbiome in health and disease. Here, we provide a contemporary overview of the oral microbiome and the microbiota of early childhood caries (ECC) with particular reference to newer analytical techniques. A MEDLINE search revealed a total of 20 metagenomic studies describing cariogenic microbiomes of ECC, 10 of which also detailed the healthy microbiomes. In addition, seven studies on site-specific microbiomes, focusing on acidogenic and aciduric microbiota of deep-dentinal lesions, were also reviewed. These studies evaluated plaque and saliva of children aged 1.5–11?years, in cohorts of 12–485 individuals. These studies reveal a very rich and diverse microbial communities, with hundreds of different phylotypes and microbial species, including novel species and phyla such as Scardovia wiggsiae, Slackia exigua, Granulicatella elegans, Firmicutes in the plaque biofilms of children with ECC. On the contrary, bacteria such as Streptococcus cristatus, S.?gordonii, S.?sanguinis, Corynebacterium matruchotii, and Neisseria flavescens were common in plaque biofilm of noncarious, healthy, tooth surfaces in subjects with caries. The review illustrates the immense complexity and the diversity of the human oral microbiota of the cariogenic plaque microbiome in ECC, and the daunting prospect of its demystification. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"The beneficial effects of physical exercise in the brain and related pathophysiological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases",2019,"Growing evidence has shown the beneficial influence of exercise on humans. Apart from classic cardioprotection, numerous studies have demonstrated that different exercise regimes provide a substantial improvement in various brain functions. Although the underlying mechanism is yet to be determined, emerging evidence for neuroprotection has been established in both humans and experimental animals, with most of the valuable findings in the field of mental health, neurodegenerative diseases, and acquired brain injuries. This review will discuss the recent findings of how exercise could ameliorate brain function in neuropathological states, demonstrated by either clinical or laboratory animal studies. Simultaneously, state-of-the-art molecular mechanisms underlying the exercise-induced neuroprotective effects and comparison between different types of exercise will be discussed in detail. A majority of reports show that physical exercise is associated with enhanced cognition throughout different populations and remains as a fascinating area in scientific research because of its universal protective effects in different brain domain functions. This article is to review what we know about how physical exercise modulates the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration. ? 2019, United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.","kynurenine; neurotrophic factor; serotonin; acquired brain injury; antiinflammatory activity; brain; cognition; degenerative disease; exercise; exosome; human; mental disease; mitochondrion; muscle; pathophysiology; priority journal; Review"
"Predictors of healthier and more sustainable school travel mode profiles among Hong Kong adolescents",2019,"Background: Adolescent travel mode choices to/from school vary in their physical activity (PA) component and environmental sustainability. Research has typically focussed on correlates of active travel, the most healthy and sustainable mode, in comparison to other modes combined. Under the premise that a small shift from less to more healthy/sustainable modes may be a more feasible than a shift to 'pure' active travel (e.g., walking), we examined potential correlates of the odds of undertaking more vs. less healthy/sustainable modes. Methods: Hong Kong adolescents attending secondary school and a parent/caregiver (n = 1299 dyads) participated in this cross-sectional study. Latent profile analyses identified groups of adolescents with different transport mode profiles to/from school. Profiles were ranked based on relative PA/sustainability outcomes. Multilevel logistic regression identified environmental, social and psychological factors associated with more vs. less PA/sustainable transport mode profiles to/from school. Results: Most frequent transport modes were walking and public transport. Latent profile analysis resulted in a 7-profile model (walk (n = 430); walk & public transport (n = 93); public transport (n = 486); bicycle, car & taxi (n = 60); school bus to & public transport from school (n = 54); school bus (n = 106); car to & car/public transport from school (n = 70)). All profile comparisons were associated with at least one environmental variable. School proximity, access to services and parent transport-related PA were generally associated with higher odds of healthier-more sustainable transport modes. Adolescent-perceived distance and effort barriers to walking and cycling were generally associated with lower odds of more healthy/sustainable modes. Discussion: Most adolescents engaged in relatively healthy/sustainable travel modes to/from school. Public transport to walking and school bus to public transport mode shifts are likely to have the biggest impact towards more healthy/sustainable modes. Encouraging parent-related transport PA may positively influence adolescent mode choice. Relatively dense, destination-rich neighbourhoods may encourage more healthy/sustainable transport modes to/from school by providing easy access to schools and services. Conclusion: Government policy encouraging enrolment in the closest local school and private school encouragement of public transport rather than school buses may have the greatest impact on shifts to more healthy/sustainable transport modes to/from school in Hong Kong adolescents. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; adult; Article; car; caregiver; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cycling; environmental factor; female; healthy lifestyle; high school student; Hong Kong; human; male; predictive value; psychological aspect; public policy; social aspect; traffic and transport; travel; walking; walking distance; child parent relation; epidemiology; motor vehicle; psychology; school; student; traffic and transport; travel; Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hong Kong; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Parents; Schools; Students; Transportation; Travel; Walking"
"Emerging next-generation robotic colonoscopy systems towards painless colonoscopy",2019,"Advances in the field of robotics have allowed modern technology to be integrated into medicine and that can minimize patients suffering from the side effects that are inherent to procedures for improving their quality of life. Conventional devices that are used for colonoscopies are rigid and require a high level of expertise from endoscopists to perform the procedure. Advances in robot-assisted colonoscopic systems now produce softer, more slender, automated designs that no longer require the operator to use forceful pushing to advance the colonoscope inside the colon, reducing risks to the patient of perforation and pain. It is challenging to reprocess these scopes for reuse as the materials used can be damaged during decontamination, leading to the possible risks of cross-infection by pathogenic microorganisms when reused by patients. An ideal solution is to eliminate these contamination risks to patients by adopting sterile, single-use scopes straight from the manufacturer's package to the patient. With this idea in mind, emerging developments that push the boundaries in this area will benefit patients and encourage the public to participate in and adhere better to colonoscopy screening to reduce the development of colorectal cancer. Thus, in light of these concerns and challenges, to encourage patients undergoing colorectal screening to comply with colonoscopy procedures that they are less invasive, changes in the design and materials are necessary. One of the more promising technological advances in this area is the advent of robotic colonoscopy. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Effectiveness of virtual and augmented reality-enhanced exercise on physical activity, psychological outcomes, and physical performance: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2019,"Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)-enhanced exercise training is a novel approach to promoting health. Previous systematic reviews have focused on the effectiveness of VR interventions in clinical settings. The present study was the first systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of exercise-based VR and AR training as preventive measures in improving physical activity, psychological outcomes, and physical performance of a healthy population when compared with traditional programs and no-exercise controls. This study included 22 research articles published between 1997 and 2017, involving 1,184 participants aged 18 to 79. The results showed a large effect on physical activity (Hedges' g = 0.83, SE = 0.18), a small to moderate effect on physical performance (Hedges’ g = 0.31, SE = 0.09), and no significant effect on psychological outcomes. VR training programs were particularly shown to be effective for enhancing frequency of physical activity and strength of physical performance. Only two studies examined the effectiveness of AR training programs on physical performance, and the findings concerning those effects were not separately reported. A list of plausible moderators was tested but that variable was not significantly associated with the effects of VR on the three outcomes.

"Efficacy of musical training on psychological outcomes and quality of life in Chinese pediatric brain tumor survivors",2019,"Background: Evidence has shown that survivors of pediatric brain tumors have more negative psychological sequela, particularly depression, than do survivors of other childhood cancers. This study examined the efficacy of a musical training program in reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing self-esteem and quality of life in Hong Kong Chinese pediatric brain tumor survivors. Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial, two-group pretest and repeated posttest, between-subjects design was conducted to 60 pediatric brain tumor survivors (8-5?years old). Participants in the experimental group received a weekly 45-min lesson on musical training for 52?weeks. Participants in the control group received a placebo intervention. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms at 12?months. Secondary outcomes were self-esteem and quality of life at 12?months. Data were collected at baseline and 6 and 12?months after the intervention began. Results: Participants in the experimental group reported statistically significant fewer depressive symptoms (P?<?0.001), higher levels of self-esteem (P?<?0.001), and better quality of life (P?<?0.001) than the control group at 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that musical training is effective in reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing self-esteem and quality of life in Hong Kong Chinese pediatric brain tumor survivors. These results indicate that musical training is not only a leisure activity but also carries therapeutic effects in promoting psychological well-being and quality of life in pediatric brain tumor survivors. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adolescent; Article; brain tumor; child; Chinese; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; depression; experimental study; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; music therapy; outcome assessment; pretest posttest design; prospective study; psychological aspect; psychological well-being; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; self esteem; Asian continental ancestry group; brain tumor; cancer survivor; child behavior; depression; music; psychology; quality of life; self concept; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Brain Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Child; Child Behavior; Depression; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Music; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Self Concept"
"Objectively-measured neighbourhood attributes as correlates and moderators of quality of life in older adults with different living arrangements: The alecs cross-sectional study",2019,"With an ageing world population, preservation of older adults’ health and quality of life (QoL) is paramount. Due to lower levels of physical functionality, older adults are particularly susceptible to local environment influences, especially those living alone and lacking family support. Using generalised additive mixed models, we examined associations and confounder-adjusted associations between objectively-measured neighbourhood attributes and QoL domains in 909 Hong Kong Chinese elderly community dwellers. Most examined neighbourhood attributes were not associated with QoL in the whole sample. Neighbourhood residential and entertainment density was curvilinearly and/or linearly related to specific QoL domains. Number of parks was negatively associated with social QoL and having well-treed parks with higher levels of social QoL. Older adults living alone in neighbourhoods with poor access to destinations and few activities in parks showed lower environmental and/or social QoL than their counterparts. Neighbourhood built environment characteristics do not seem to impact Hong Kong older adults’ physical and psychological QoL. Medium-to-high density, well-ordered neighbourhoods with optimal mixes of well-treed public open spaces and services meeting their daily needs may significantly contribute to social and environmental QoL in this population and appear particularly important to those living alone. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Colorectal liver metastases: An update on multidisciplinary approach",2019,"Liver metastasis is the commonest form of distant metastasis in colorectal cancer. Selection criteria for surgery and liver-directed therapies have recently been extended. However, resectability remains poorly defined. Tumour biology is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic factor; hence molecular profiling has a growing role in risk stratification and management planning. Surgical resection is the only treatment modality for curative intent. The most appropriate surgical approach is yet to be established. The primary cancer and the hepatic metastasis can be removed simultaneously or in a two-step approach; these two strategies have comparable long-term outcomes. For patients with a limited future liver remnant, portal vein embolization, combined ablation and resection, and associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy have been advocated, and each has their pros and cons. The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy is still debated. Targeted biological agents and loco-regional therapies (thermal ablation, intra-arterial chemo- or radio-embolization, and stereotactic radiotherapy) further improve the already favourable results. The recent debate about offering liver transplantation to highly selected patients needs validation from large clinical trials. Evidencebased protocols are missing, and therefore optimal management of hepatic metastasis should be personalized and determined by a multi-disciplinary team. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"Subjective wellbeing, suicide and socioeconomic factors: An ecological analysis in Hong Kong",2019,"Aims. There has recently been an increased interest in mental health indicators for the monitoring of population wellbeing, which is among the targets of Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations. Levels of subjective wellbeing and suicide rates have been proposed as indicators of population mental health, but prior research is limited.Methods. Data on individual happiness and life satisfaction were sourced from a population-based survey in Hong Kong (2011). Suicide data were extracted from Coroner's Court files (2005-2013). Area characteristic variables included local poverty rate and four factors derived from a factor analysis of 21 variables extracted from the 2011 census. The associations between mean happiness and life satisfaction scores and suicide rates were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient at two area levels: 18 districts and 30 quantiles of large street blocks (LSBs; n = 1620). LSB is a small area unit with a higher level of within-unit homogeneity compared with districts. Partial correlations were used to control for area characteristics.Results. Happiness and life satisfaction demonstrated weak inverse associations with suicide rate at the district level (r =-0.32 and-0.36, respectively) but very strong associations at the LSB quantile level (r =-0.83 and-0.84, respectively). There were generally very weak or weak negative correlations across sex/age groups at the district level but generally moderate to strong correlations at the LSB quantile level. The associations were markedly attenuated or became null after controlling for area characteristics.Conclusions. Subjective wellbeing is strongly associated with suicide at a small area level; socioeconomic factors can largely explain this association. Socioeconomic factors could play an important role in determining the wellbeing of the population, and this could inform policies aimed at enhancing population wellbeing. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.","adolescent; Article; ecology; female; geography; happiness; Hong Kong; human; life satisfaction; major clinical study; male; population research; poverty; prevalence; psychological well-being; socioeconomics; suicide; adult; age distribution; aged; demography; happiness; health survey; mental disease; mental health; middle aged; poverty; psychology; quality of life; satisfaction; sex ratio; socioeconomics; suicide; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Female; Happiness; Health Surveys; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Population Surveillance; Poverty; Quality of Life; Residence Characteristics; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide; Young Adult"
"A novel 3D evaluation method for assessing bone to bone relationships in clubfoot",2019,"OBJECTIVE: Clubfoot is a complex congenital three-dimensional foot deformity, which affects 150,000-200,000 newborn babies annually around the world. A good understanding of the alignment of the two osseous columns and the lower leg of the ankle and foot complex is essential for evaluating the severity of clubfoot. The purposes of this study were to (1) develop an automated three-dimensional (3D) surface model of severe clubfoot based on two-dimensional (2D) slices of computed tomography (CT) images, (2) evaluate the alignment of foot bones relative to the ankle in severe clubfoot, and (3) examine the structural changes in the shape of the clubfoot. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-dimensional CT image was taken from a four-year-old child with a severe clubfoot. Subsequently, an automated and detailed 3D surface model of the severe clubfoot was developed from the 2D images by using MATLAB software programming. Then, the x, y, and z coordinate angles were automatically calculated for each bone in the foot relative to the ankle (lower end of the tibia) to determine the orientations and relationships among the bones. RESULTS: The relative position or orientation of each bone of the foot to the ankle of the severe clubfoot was objectively measured which was used to determine the orientation of each bone in the foot. Among the x, y, and z axes of the interested tarsal bones, the z axis represents the smallest moment of inertia, and the results showed that the bones in the x axis shifted medially with higher relative angle. CONCLUSIONS: This 3D objective measurement method for assessing clubfoot can be used to determine and classify the severity of clubfoot, as well as evaluate and monitor the progress of the clubfoot intervention based on the relative position of the tarsal bones. The method can also be used to quantify the relationship between the tarsal bones of the foot and lower end of the tibia. In addition, angular measurements can be used to assess other pathological conditions of the foot such as pes cavus and pes planus. ? 2019 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

"Delay of cone degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa using a 12-month treatment with Lycium barbarum supplement",2019,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lycium barbarum L. (also known as “Goji berry”), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been a common herb in the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia for centuries. The main active component is the Lycium barbarum polysaccharides and its antioxidative effect has been widely shown to provide neuroprotection to the eye, and it would, therefore, be interesting to determine if Lycium barbarum help delay vision deterioration in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Aim of the study: Cone rescue is a potential method for delaying deterioration of visual function in Retinitis pigmentosa (RP). This study aimed to investigate the treatment effect of Lycium barbarum L. (LB) supplement on retinal functions and structure in RP patients after a 12-month intervention trial. Methods: The investigation was a double-masked and placebo-controlled clinical study. Each of forty-two RP subjects who completed the 12-month intervention (23 and 19 in the treatment and placebo groups respectively) received a daily supply of LB or placebo granules for oral administration. The primary outcome was change of best corrected visual acuity (VA) (90% and 10% contrast) from the baseline to the end of treatment. The secondary outcomes were sensitivity changes of the central visual field, amplitude of full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) (including scotopic maximal response and photopic cone response), and average macular thickness. Results: The compliance rates for both groups exceeded 80%. There were no deteriorations of either 90% or 10% contrast VA in the LB group compared with the placebo group (p = 0.001). A thinning of macular layer was observed in the placebo group, which was not observed in the LB group (p = 0.008). However, no significant differences were found in the sensitivity of visual field or in any parameters of ffERG between the two groups. No significant adverse effects were reported in the treatment group. Conclusions: LB supplement provides a neuroprotective effect for the retina and could help delay or minimize cone degeneration in RP. Classifications: Clinical Studies (1.05).

"Tbx15 is required for adipocyte browning induced by adrenergic signaling pathway",2019,"Objective: The T-box gene Tbx15 is abundantly expressed in adipose tissues, especially subcutaneous and brown fat. Although its expression is correlated with obesity, its precise biological role in adipose tissue is poorly understood in vivo. Here we investigated the function of Tbx15 in brown adipose thermogenesis and white adipose browning in vivo. Methods: In the present study, we generated adipose-specific Tbx15 knockout (AKO) mice by crossing Tbx15 floxed mice with adiponectin-Cre mice to delineate Tbx15 function in adipose tissues. We systematically investigated the influence of Tbx15 on brown adipose thermogenesis and white adipose browning in mice, as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanism. Results: Upon cold exposure, adipocyte browning in inguinal adipose tissue was significantly impaired in Tbx15 AKO mice. Furthermore, ablation of Tbx15 blocked adipocyte browning induced by β3 adrenergic agonist CL 316243, which did not appear to alter the expression of Tbx15. Analysis of DNA binding sites using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that TBX15 bound directly to a key region in the Prdm16 promoter, indicating it regulates transcription of Prdm16, the master gene for adipocyte thermogenesis and browning. Compared to control mice, Tbx15 AKO mice displayed increased body weight gain and decreased whole body energy expenditure in response to high fat diets. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that Tbx15 regulates adipocyte browning and might be a potential target for the treatment of obesity. ? 2019 The Authors","5 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl] 1,3 benzodioxole 2,2 dicarboxylic acid; adiponectin; adrenergic transmission; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight gain; brown adipocyte; chromatin immunoprecipitation; cohort analysis; cold exposure; controlled study; DNA binding; DNA determination; drug targeting; energy expenditure; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene knockout; genetic transcription; in vivo study; lipid diet; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; Prdm16 gene; priority journal; promoter region; signal transduction; Tbx15 gene; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue"
"Determinants of cognitive performance and decline in 20 diverse ethno-regional groups: A COSMIC collaboration cohort study",2019,"Background: With no effective treatments for cognitive decline or dementia, improving the evidence base for modifiable risk factors is a research priority. This study investigated associations between risk factors and late-life cognitive decline on a global scale, including comparisons between ethno-regional groups. Methods and findings: We harmonized longitudinal data from 20 population-based cohorts from 15 countries over 5 continents, including 48,522 individuals (58.4% women) aged 54–105 (mean = 72.7) years and without dementia at baseline. Studies had 2–15 years of follow-up. The risk factors investigated were age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, anxiety, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE*4) status, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure and pulse pressure, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, self-rated health, high cholesterol, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, physical activity, smoking, and history of stroke. Associations with risk factors were determined for a global cognitive composite outcome (memory, language, processing speed, and executive functioning tests) and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Individual participant data meta-analyses of multivariable linear mixed model results pooled across cohorts revealed that for at least 1 cognitive outcome, age (B = ?0.1, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = ?0.31, SE = 0.11), depression (B = ?0.11, SE = 0.06), diabetes (B = ?0.23, SE = 0.10), current smoking (B = ?0.20, SE = 0.08), and history of stroke (B = ?0.22, SE = 0.09) were independently associated with poorer cognitive performance (p < 0.05 for all), and higher levels of education (B = 0.12, SE = 0.02) and vigorous physical activity (B = 0.17, SE = 0.06) were associated with better performance (p < 0.01 for both). Age (B = ?0.07, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = ?0.41, SE = 0.18), and diabetes (B = ?0.18, SE = 0.10) were independently associated with faster cognitive decline (p < 0.05 for all). Different effects between Asian people and white people included stronger associations for Asian people between ever smoking and poorer cognition (group by risk factor interaction: B = ?0.24, SE = 0.12), and between diabetes and cognitive decline (B = ?0.66, SE = 0.27; p < 0.05 for both). Limitations of our study include a loss or distortion of risk factor data with harmonization, and not investigating factors at midlife. Conclusions: These results suggest that education, smoking, physical activity, diabetes, and stroke are all modifiable factors associated with cognitive decline. If these factors are determined to be causal, controlling them could minimize worldwide levels of cognitive decline. However, any global prevention strategy may need to consider ethno-regional differences. ? 2019 Lipnicki et al.","apolipoprotein E; cholesterol; adult; aged; anxiety; Article; atrial fibrillation; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; cohort analysis; dementia; depression; education; ethnicity; female; genetic heterogeneity; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; mental performance; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; physical activity; prevalence; pulse pressure; questionnaire; risk factor; very elderly; adverse event; age; clinical trial; cognitive defect; comorbidity; comparative study; diabetes mellitus; ethnic group; ethnology; exercise; health education; meta analysis; multicenter study; psychology; risk assessment; smoking; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus; Ethnic Groups; Exercise; Female; Health Education; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smoking; Stroke"
"Cardiovascular outcomes in trials of new antidiabetic drug classes: A network meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Recent trials suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced cardiovascular events. Comparative effectiveness of these new antidiabetic drug classes remains unclear. We therefore performed a network meta-analysis to compare the effect on cardiovascular outcomes among GLP-1 RAs, SGLT-2 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and congress proceedings from recent cardiology conferences were searched up to April 20, 2019. Cardiovascular outcome trials and renal outcome trials reporting cardiovascular outcomes on GLP-1 RAs, SGLT-2 and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes were nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), and renal composite outcome. ORs and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects models. Results: Fourteen trials enrolling 121,047 patients were included. SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced cardiovascular deaths and all-cause deaths compared to placebo (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.93 and OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77-0.92) and DPP-4 inhibitors (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.99 and OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.94), respectively. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced MACE (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.95 and OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.93), hospitalisation for HF (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.61-0.77 and OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.93), and renal composite outcome (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.67 and OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.94) compared to placebo, but SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced hospitalisation for HF (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90) and renal composite outcome (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.80) more than GLP-1 RAs. Only GLP-1 RAs reduced nonfatal stroke (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-0.99). DPP-4 inhibitors did not lower the risk of these outcomes when compared to placebo and were associated with higher risks of MACE, hospitalisation for HF, and renal composite outcome when compared to the other two drug classes. Conclusions: SGLT-2 inhibitors show clear superiority in reducing cardiovascular and all-cause deaths, hospitalisation for HF, and renal events among new antidiabetic drug classes. GLP-1 RAs also have cardiovascular and renal protective effects. DPP-4 inhibitors have no beneficial cardiovascular effects and are therefore inferior to the other two drug classes. SGLT-2 inhibitors should now be the preferred treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular effect; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; drug effect; heart failure; heart infarction; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; kidney disease; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; risk reduction"
"Neurocysticercosis and HIV infection: What can we learn from the published literature? [Neurocisticercosis e infecci?n por VIH: ?qu? se puede aprender de la literatura reportada?]",2019,"Infections caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and by the larvae of Taenia solium (i.e., cysticercosis) are still widespread in many developing countries. Both pathologies modify host immune status and it is possible that HIV infection may modulate the frequency and pathogeny of cysticercosis of the central nervous system (i.e., neurocysticercosis [NCC]). Objective: To describe published cases of NCC among HIV-positive patients and to evaluate whether the characteristics of NCC, including frequency, symptoms, radiological appearance, and response to treatment differed between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Methods: Forty cases of NCC/HIV co-infected patients were identified in the literature. Clinical and radiological characteristics, as well as response to treatment, were compared with non-matching historical series of NCC patients without HIV infection. Results: Most of these patients had seizures and multiple vesicular parasites located in parenchyma. Clinical and radiological characteristics were similar between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with NCC, as well as between immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised HIV-positive patients. Conclusion: Our review did not reveal clear interactions between HIV and NCC. This may be partially due to the small number of cases and reliance on published research. A systematic, multi-institutional effort aiming to report all the cases of this dual pathology is needed to confirm this finding and to clarify the possible relationship between both pathogens. ? 2019, Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria.

"The impact of indocyanine-green fluorescence angiogram on colorectal resection",2019,"Background: Perfusion plays an important role in anastomotic healing. Indocyanine-green fluorescence angiogram allows objective bowel perfusion assessment. This study aimed to investigate the impact of perfusion assessment on intraoperative decision during left-sided colorectal resections. Method: This was a prospective, single-centre, observational study recruiting patients with left-sided colorectal resections. Perfusion of bowel segment was assessed with ICG fluorescence angiogram prior to resection and anastomosis intra-operatively. The planned transection site and the actual transection site after perfusion assessment were compared. The decision for diversion stoma was also evaluated. Results: 110 patients with cancer of the sigmoid colon (29.1%) and rectum (70.9%) were recruited. Total mesorectal excision was performed in 51.8% of patients. The transection site was revised in 34.5% of cases: 30.9% more proximally and 3.6% more distally. The median distance between the intended and actual transection sites was 2 cm (range 1–17 cm). A proximal revision in the transection site was more likely seen in rectal cancers (p = 0.036, OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.09–11.78) and relatively under-perfused left colon (p = 0.036, OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01–1.02). Three (2.7%) patients were spared from a diversion stoma. The overall anastomotic leakage rate was 5.5%. Conclusion: ICG fluorescence angiogram altered operative decisions in a significant proportion of cases. The impact on transection site was more pronounced in patients with rectal cancers and those with relatively under-perfused colon. ? 2018 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland",""
"Chinese Martial Art Training Failed to Improve Balance or Inhibit Falls in Older Adults",2019,"This randomized controlled trial explored the effects of a Ving Tsun (VT) Chinese martial art training program on reactive standing balance performance, postural muscle reflex contraction latency, leg muscle performance, balance confidence and falls in community-dwelling older adults. We randomly assigned 33 healthy older adults to either a VT group (mean age = 67.5 years) or a control group (mean age = 72.1 years). The VT group received two 1-hour VT training sessions per week for three months (24 sessions). Primary outcome measures collected before and after the intervention period were electromyographic muscle activation onset latencies of the hamstring and gastrocnemius and the center of pressure path, length and movement velocity in standing (reactive balance performance). Secondary outcome measures included isometric peak force and time to isometric peak force of the knee extensors and flexors, the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale score, and fall history. Results revealed that the mean gastrocnemius muscle activation onset latency was significantly longer (22.53 ms) in the VT group after the intervention. The peak force of the knee flexors significantly increased (by 1.58 kg) in the control group over time but not in the VT group. The time to reach peak force in the knee flexors was significantly longer (by 0.51 s) in the control group (but not the VT group) at posttest compared with the pretest value. No other significant group, time, or group-by-time interaction effects were noted. We discussed possible reasons for the failure of three months of martial art training to benefit fall risks among these older adults. ?

"Intermittent abortive reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus during the progression of nasopharyngeal cancer as indicated by elevated antibody levels",2019,"The development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a common cancer in Southeastern Asia, is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection; however, the aetiological role of EBV in NPC pathogenesis remains enigmatic. The life cycle of EBV in NPC patients is defined as latency II, while the antibodies specific to lytic phase proteins, as well as lytic genes, were highly expressed in NPC patients. The correlation between antibody levels and the progression of NPC has been reported in some studies; however, most of these studies focused on IgA antibodies, and the results in different articles were not consistent. In this study, we concurrently determined the levels of IgA and IgG antibodies specific to six purified recombinant EBV antigens associated with different replication statuses of EBV: EBNA1 associated with latency II; the non-structural antigens Zta, TK, EA-D and EA-R associated with immediate-early and early lytic phases; and the EBV matrix protein VCA p18, which is involved in late lytic phase. Levels of antibodies specific to immediate-early and early antigens were correlated with the tumour progression, especially tumour size. The levels of antibodies specific to some lytic phase antigens were also correlated with lymph node inclusion and metastasis. However, the antibody specific to the latency II antigen EBNA1 was not correlated with either tumour size or metastasis. Consistent with previous transcriptome studies, the results suggested both the expression of lytic phase genes at the protein level and the intermittent reactivation of EBV in NPC patients. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Epstein Barr virus antigen; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; matrix protein; transcriptome; adult; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; carcinogenesis; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; Epstein Barr virus; female; human; latent period; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nasopharynx cancer; prevalence; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; tumor volume; virus reactivation; virus replication"
"Assessment of causal direction between gut microbiota- dependent metabolites and cardiometabolic health: A bidirectional mendelian randomization analysis",2019,"We examined the causal direction between gut microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) or its predecessors and cardiometabolic diseases, such as risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We used genetic variants as instruments to test the causal associations. Genetically predicted higher TMAO and carnitine were not associated with higher odds of T2DM, AF, CAD, MI, stroke, and CKD after Bonferroni correction (P ? 0.0005). However, we observed that genetically increased choline showed a suggestive association with higher risk of T2DM (odds ratio 1.84 [95% CI 1.00-3.42] per 10 units, P = 0.05). In contrast, genetically predicted higher betaine (0.68 [0.48-0.95] per 10 units, P = 0.023) was suggestively associated with a lower risk of T2DM. We observed a suggestive association of genetically increased choline with a lower level of body fat percentage (β ± SE 20.28 ± 0.11, P = 0.013) but a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (0.10 ± 0.05, P = 0.034). We further found that T2DM (0.130 ± 0.036, P < 0.0001) and CKD (0.483 ± 0.168, P = 0.004) were causally associated with higher TMAO levels. Our Mendelian randomization findings support that T2DM and kidney disease increase TMAO levels and that observational evidence for cardiovascular diseases may be due to confounding or reverse causality. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","betaine; carnitine; choline; cystatin C; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; leptin; low density lipoprotein; proinsulin; triacylglycerol; trimethylamine oxide; acute coronary syndrome; Article; atrial fibrillation; body fat; cardiometabolic risk; causality; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; heart infarction; human; intestine flora; major clinical study; Mendelian randomization analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pleiotropy; priority journal; stable angina pectoris"
"Real-world evidence of improved healthcare utilization in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder after early treatment of paliperidone palmitate once-monthly treatment in Hong Kong",2019,"Background: Very few data are available to demonstrate the economic benefit of early paliperidone palmitate once-monthly long-acting injectable (PP1M) treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Methods and materials: This study has retrospectively compared the healthcare utilization and associated costs of pre- and post-PPIM treatment in 413 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder recruited from three major public hospitals providing psychiatric services in Hong Kong. Patients were categorized into early treatment (?3 years since diagnosis) and chronic (>3 years) groups, and also whether they were receiving polypharmacy (POP). Results: It was found that patients who were started on early therapy with no POP had the most favourable outcomes. Overall results of the entire cohort, including both early and late treatments, indicate that there was a slight increase in annual in-patient days (IP) per patient and outpatient visit (OP) by 3.18 and 1.87, respectively, and a decrease in emergency room visit (ER) of 0.9 (p < 0.05). For non-polypharmacy (NP) patients receiving early PP1M therapy, there was a significant decrease in IP and ER of 21.56 (p < 0.05) and 1.15 (p < 0.05), respectively, but an increase in OP of 1.88 (p < 0.05). For patients with POP, there was an all-across increase in IP and all-across decrease in OP and ER. In monetary terms, a NP patient receiving early therapy may have an overall saving of HKD40,878 (USD5,241, 1USD = 7.8HKD) per year compared to HKD6,224 (USD798) in patients where therapy was given after 3 years. For patients with POP, there was an all-across increase in overall spending despite reductions in OP and ER. Conclusions: From the 413 patients studied, potential annual savings is higher by early administration of PPIM in patients with NP. Analysis using multivariate linear regression based on generalized estimating equations and sensitivity analysis using a linear mixed model supported the findings. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","paliperidone; neuroleptic agent; paliperidone; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost control; early intervention; emergency ward; female; health care cost; health care utilization; Hong Kong; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental health service; outcome assessment; outpatient care; polypharmacy; public hospital; retrospective study; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; cost; delayed release formulation; drug administration; economics; health care cost; health care planning; middle aged; patient attitude; psychosis; schizophrenia; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; Costs and Cost Analysis; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Resources; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paliperidone Palmitate; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Polypharmacy; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Schizophrenia; Young Adult"
"Associations of Socio-demographic, Family, and Neighborhood Factors with Physical Activity-Related Parenting Practices Among Hong Kong Preschoolers’ Parents",2019,"Objectives Regular engagement in physical activity (PA) has numerous health benefits in young children. Young children’s parents can influence their children’s PA behavior through different PA-related parenting practices. This cross-sectional study examined the independent contributions of socio-demographic, family/home and parent-perceived neighborhood environmental characteristics explaining PA-related parenting practices encouraging or discouraging PA among Hong Kong preschool-aged children (3–5 years-old). Methods Hong Kong Chinese preschoolers’ parents were recruited from pre-selected kindergartens and Maternal and Child Health Centers located in areas stratified by residential density and socio-economic status. They self-completed socio-demographic, family/home and perceived neighborhood characteristics and PA-related parenting practices questionnaires. Generalized linear models were used to examine associations of socio-demographic, family/home and neighborhood variables with PA-related parenting practices. Results Socio-demographic and family/home characteristics were significantly correlated with parenting practices encouraging and discouraging PA. Parent-perceived neighborhood characteristics were significantly correlated with parenting practices discouraging PA only. Conclusions for Practice This study identified correlates of PA-related parenting practices among parents of Hong Kong Chinese preschoolers. The findings suggest future PA-promoting interventions among Chinese preschoolers via the promotion of parenting practices encouraging children’s PA should consider multiple factors, including family relationships and childcare sharing, promotion of PA and its benefits among parents, and neighborhood social cohesion, traffic safety and safety from crime. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","article; child; child parent relation; crime; cross-sectional study; female; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; kindergarten; neighborhood; pediatric hospital; physical activity; questionnaire; social status; traffic safety; adult; child parent relation; demography; exercise; family relation; family size; Hong Kong; male; preschool child; procedures; psychology; social class; Adult; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Exercise; Family Characteristics; Family Relations; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Parenting; Residence Characteristics; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Spatial analysis to assess the relationship between human and bovine brucellosis in South Korea, 2005–2010",2019,"The first case of human brucellosis in South Korea was reported in 2002, and cases of human infection continue to occur. Although an association between human and bovine brucellosis has been identified, the spatial relationship has not been studied in South Korea. Here, we analysed the spatial patterns of human and bovine brucellosis retrieved from the human and veterinary surveillance data, as well as the spatial correlation between human and bovine brucellosis and associated factors that contribute to its occurrence. The risk of human brucellosis was analysed using a Bayesian spatial model with potential risk factors. Our results show that, for both human and bovine brucellosis, hotspots were clustered in the southeast regions of Korea, whereas coldspots were clustered in the northwest regions of Korea. Our study suggests that the risk of human brucellosis increases in rural regions with the highest risk of bovine brucellosis. Collaborative strategies between human and veterinary health sectors (e.g, public health intervention and region-specific eradication programs for bovine brucellosis) would reduce the burden of brucellosis in South Korea. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Analgesic Effect of Sinew Acupuncture for Patients with Soft-Tissue Injuries: A Pilot Trial",2019,"Objective: To investigate the immediate analgesic effect of sinew acupuncture for patients with soft-tissue injuries (STIs). Methods: Two hundreds eligible adult patients suffering from STIs were recruited and received sinew acupuncture with flexible treatment schedules. The number of treatment sessions was pragmatically decided by each patient on the basis of their pain relief. The outcome measurement was the change of pain rating in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the first 5 sessions. The adverse effect was also observed. Results: Of the 200 patients recruited, 7 were excluded due to incomplete data. In total, 888 sinew acupuncture treatments were administered to patients at 14 injury sites (including head, neck, shoulder, arm, chest, elbow, wrist, hand, waist and hip, knee, thigh, calf, ankle, and foot) where pain was felt. Compared with the baseline, the VAS rating after the first and last treatments were both significantly reduced at all the injury sites (P<0.01). The VAS rating was also significantly reduced after each session of treatment in the first five sessions (P<0.01). No serious adverse effect was observed. Conclusion: Sinew acupuncture had not only an immediate analgesic effect for STIs, but also an accumulated analgesic effect during the first 5 treatment sessions. ? 2019, The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","acupuncture; adult; aged; analgesic activity; ankle injury; arm injury; Article; calf injury; clinical observation; elbow injury; female; foot injury; hand injury; head injury; hip injury; human; knee injury; major clinical study; male; neck injury; outcome assessment; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; shoulder injury; sinew acupuncture; soft tissue injury; thigh injury; thorax injury; visual analog scale; waist injury; wrist injury; adverse event; clinical trial; middle aged; soft tissue injury; analgesic agent; Acupuncture Therapy; Analgesics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Soft Tissue Injuries; Visual Analog Scale"
"The reliability and validity of the Chinese Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale in the general population of Hong Kong",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the 7-item Chinese Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) in Hong Kong Chinese. Methods: Under “A Jockey Club Initiative for a Harmonious Society” project, a random telephone survey was conducted in 2017 on 1331 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged ? 18. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the factorial validity. The Spearman correlations of the SWEMWBS with other scales including the 12-item short form health survey (SF-12), family well-being, self-rated health, the global happiness item (GHI), subjective happiness scale (SHS), and patient health questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), were used to evaluate the convergent and divergent validity. Known-group validity was also assessed. We calculated congeneric reliability based on standardized factor loadings and error variances. Two-week test–retest reliability was assessed in 100 randomly selected respondents using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Among the weighted sample, 55.9% were female and 72.9% were 25 to 64?years old. The CFA indicated good validity of the SWEMWBS. The SWEMWBS had moderate correlations with SHS, SF-12 mental component, PHQ-4 and GHI, but a weak correlation with SF-12 physical component. Older respondents, those with higher education level, married, working, with higher household income reported higher level of well-being. The congeneric reliability of the SWEMWBS was 0.85. Moderate to good test–retest reliability was observed (ICC 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.80). Conclusion: The Chinese SWEMWBS showed good validity and reliability for measuring well-being in the general population of Hong Kong. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","adult; article; Chinese; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; correlation coefficient; education; female; happiness; Hong Kong; household income; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; married person; patient health questionnaire; population; psychological well-being; randomized controlled trial; Short Form 12; telephone interview; test retest reliability; validity; Hong Kong; mental health; middle aged; procedures; psychology; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; Adult; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires"

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This is a randomized triple blind study of 320 infertile women for their first or repeated cycles undergoing IVF between September 2015 and October 2016. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women were randomized into the brief incubation group (n = 160) or the standard incubation group (n = 160) according to a computer-generated randomization list. Oocytes were incubated with spermatozoa (0.3-1.2 million motile sperm/ml) for 3-4 h in the brief incubation group while oocytes were incubated with spermatozoa at similar concentration for 20 h in the standard incubation group. The primary outcome was the LBR (a baby born alive after 22 weeks gestation) in the fresh cycle. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE There was no significant difference in the LBR between the brief and standard incubation groups based on both intention-to-treat [33.0% (53/160) versus 36.8% (59/160), relative risk (RR) 0.898 (95% CI = 0.666-1.212), P = 0.482] and per protocol [41.4%(53/128) versus 41.0% (59/144), RR1.011 (95% CI = 0.760-1.343), P = 0.942] analyses. Clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and implantation rates were comparable for the two groups. Similar results were found with subgroup analysis of advanced maternal age, abnormal semen analysis and repeated IVF cycles. No differences were observed in cumulative LBR between two groups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Various motile sperm concentrations of 0.3-1.2 million per ml were used for insemination and the reactive oxygen species level in the insemination medium was not measured. The highest level at 1.2 million per ml is still relatively low compared to prior studies, therefore we do not know whether brief incubation can improve the LBR using higher concentrations of spermatozoa. The present sample size may not be adequate to detect a smaller difference in the LBR. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The present study demonstrated that a brief incubation of gametes had no significant beneficial effect on the LBR when compared with the standard incubation. The practice of brief incubation of gametes is not necessary and this can save the already tight manpower in many laboratories.

"The contribution of cannabis use to variation in the incidence of psychotic disorder across Europe (EU-GEI): a multicentre case-control study",2019,"Background: Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of later psychotic disorder but whether it affects incidence of the disorder remains unclear. We aimed to identify patterns of cannabis use with the strongest effect on odds of psychotic disorder across Europe and explore whether differences in such patterns contribute to variations in the incidence rates of psychotic disorder. Methods: We included patients aged 18–64 years who presented to psychiatric services in 11 sites across Europe and Brazil with first-episode psychosis and recruited controls representative of the local populations. We applied adjusted logistic regression models to the data to estimate which patterns of cannabis use carried the highest odds for psychotic disorder. Using Europe-wide and national data on the expected concentration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the different types of cannabis available across the sites, we divided the types of cannabis used by participants into two categories: low potency (THC &lt;10%) and high potency (THC ?10%). Assuming causality, we calculated the population attributable fractions (PAFs) for the patterns of cannabis use associated with the highest odds of psychosis and the correlation between such patterns and the incidence rates for psychotic disorder across the study sites. Findings: Between May 1, 2010, and April 1, 2015, we obtained data from 901 patients with first-episode psychosis across 11 sites and 1237 population controls from those same sites. Daily cannabis use was associated with increased odds of psychotic disorder compared with never users (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3·2, 95% CI 2·2–4·1), increasing to nearly five-times increased odds for daily use of high-potency types of cannabis (4·8, 2·5–6·3). The PAFs calculated indicated that if high-potency cannabis were no longer available, 12·2% (95% CI 3·0–16·1) of cases of first-episode psychosis could be prevented across the 11 sites, rising to 30·3% (15·2–40·0) in London and 50·3% (27·4–66·0) in Amsterdam. The adjusted incident rates for psychotic disorder were positively correlated with the prevalence in controls across the 11 sites of use of high-potency cannabis (r = 0·7; p=0·0286) and daily use (r = 0·8; p=0·0109). Interpretation: Differences in frequency of daily cannabis use and in use of high-potency cannabis contributed to the striking variation in the incidence of psychotic disorder across the 11 studied sites. Given the increasing availability of high-potency cannabis, this has important implications for public health.

"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in non-camelid domestic mammals",2019,"Dromedary camels are natural host of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, there are limited studies of MERS-CoV infection of other domestic mammals exposed to infected dromedaries. We expanded our surveillance among camels in Egypt, Tunisia, and Senegal to include other domestic mammalian species in contact with infected camels. A total of 820 sera and 823 nasal swabs from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, buffaloes, mules, and horses were collected. Swabs were tested using RT-PCR and virus RNA-positive samples were genetically sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Sera were screened using virus microneutralization tests and positive sera (where available) were confirmed using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). We detected 90% PRNT confirmed MERS-CoV antibody in 35 (55.6%) of 63 sera from sheep collected from Senegal, two sheep (1.8%) of 114 in Tunisia and a goat (0.9%) of 107 in Egypt, with titres ranging from 1:80 to ?1:320. We detected MERS-CoV RNA in swabs from three sheep (1.2%) of 254 and five goats (4.1%) of 121 from Egypt and Senegal, as well as one cow (1.9%) of 53 and three donkeys (7.1%) of 42 from Egypt. Partial sequences of the RT-PCR amplicons confirmed specificity of the results. This study showed that domestic livestock in contact with MERS-CoV infected camels may be at risk of infection. We recommend expanding current MERS-CoV surveillance in animals to include other livestock in close contact with dromedary camels. The segregation of camels from other livestock in farms and live animal markets may need to be considered. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Recurrent grade 4 panuveitis with serous retinal detachment related to nivolumab treatment in a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma",2019,"Blockade of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) has become one of the most promising immunotherapies for many human cancers. However, immune-related adverse events can be produced by anti-PD-1 therapy. Uveitis is a rare but potentially devastating side effect of anti-PD-1 therapy. Delay in diagnosis or improper treatment may eventually lead to irreversible blindness. Therefore, it is important for the oncologist and the ophthalmologist to recognize and manage this adverse event properly in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy in a timely manner. Here we present a grade 4 panuveitis with bilateral serous retinal detachment following treatment with nivolumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Oral prednisone, topical steroid eye drops, periorbital injection of steroid and finally intravitreal injection of steroid implant were administered in our patient. We observed that intravitreal injection of dexamethasone implant, but not the periorbital injection of steroid or the steroid eye drops, was effective to control the posterior uveitis and serous retinal detachment. Oral prednisone was also effective, but it might affect the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and promote tumor growth. We also summarize 15 cases of uveitis reported to date related to nivolumab or pembrolizumab therapy in the present study. The symptoms, signs, potential underlying mechanisms and treatment options regarding this adverse event are discussed. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","dexamethasone; methylprednisolone; nivolumab; prednisolone acetate; prednisone; steroid; sunitinib; immunological antineoplastic agent; nivolumab; adult; anterior eye chamber; Article; case report; clinical article; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug withdrawal; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; eye inflammation; female; follow up; human; inflammatory cell; liver metastasis; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; nephrectomy; optical coherence tomography; priority journal; renal cell carcinoma; retina detachment; retina fluorescein angiography; retinal nerve fiber layer; subretinal fluid; uveitis; visual acuity; vitreous floaters; chemically induced; complication; kidney tumor; renal cell carcinoma; retina detachment; uveitis; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Nivolumab; Panuveitis; Retinal Detachment"
"On profile MM algorithms for gamma frailty survival models",2019,"Gamma frailty survival models have been extensively used for the analysis of such multivariate failure time data as clustered failure times and recurrent events. Estimation and inference procedures in these models often center on the nonparametric maximum likelihood method and its numerical implementation via the EM algorithm. Despite its success in dealing with incomplete data problems, the algorithm may not fare well in high-dimensional situations. To address this problem, we propose a class of profile MM algorithms with good convergence properties. As a key step in constructing minorizing functions, the high-dimensional objective function is decomposed as a sum of separable low-dimensional functions. This allows the algorithm to bypass the difficulty of inverting large matrix and facilitates its pertinent use in high-dimensional problems. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms perform well in various situations and converge reliably with practical sample sizes. The method is illustrated using data from a colorectal cancer study. ? 2019 Institute of Statistical Science. All rights reserved.",""
"Rising rural body-mass index is the main driver of the global obesity epidemic in adults",2019,"Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities1,2. This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity3–6. Here we use 2,009?population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112?million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean?BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017—and more than 80% in?some low- and middle-income regions—was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities?in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing—and in some countries reversal—of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adult; Africa south of the Sahara; aged; body height; body mass; body weight; controlled study; developed country; epidemic; female; health care access; high income country; human; Letter; low income country; male; middle income country; nutrition education; obesity; prevalence; priority journal; rural area; urban area; adolescent; age; developing country; geographic mapping; middle aged; nutritional status; obesity; rural health; rural population; sex factor; urban health; urban population; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diet, Healthy; Female; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Rural Health; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Urban Health; Urban Population; Young Adult"
"The functional roles of exosomes-derived long non-coding RNA in human cancer",2019,"Cancer is one of the most pervasive causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide regardless of the fact that a majority of therapeutic strategies have been constantly invented. The survival rate of cancer patients remains unsatisfactory due to the late diagnosis, frequent metastasis and poor response to chemotherapeutics. Therefore, novel methods with high specificity and susceptibility for prompt diagnosis and precise treatment of cancer are imperative. Circulating RNA is located in bodily fluids, including urine, saliva, breast milk and naturally present in blood. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a subset of non-coding RNAs are discovered to be differentially expressed in a variety of cancers. LncRNAs have been broadly recognized as emerging mediators for cancer behavior. Presence of lncRNA in circulation can be cell-free or encapsulated in extracellular vesicles?(EVs) released by cancer cells. The release of EVs, especially exosomes, with 40–120?nm diameter in size, has been implicated in the regulation of malignancies as carriers for nucleic acid cargo through intercellular transfer. Therefore, systematic understanding of the role of exosomal lncRNAs in carcinogenesis may offer ideal diagnostic and prognostic biomarker or even therapeutic targets for malignancies. Herein, the underlying functional roles of exosomal lncRNAs in regulating tumor progression, immunomodulation as well as drug resistance will be elaborated. Lastly, the importance of exosomal lncRNAs in cancer study will also be discussed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","biological marker; long untranslated RNA; tamoxifen; angiogenesis; cancer resistance; carcinogenesis; exosome; human; immune response; immunomodulation; malignant neoplasm; metastasis; Review; tumor growth"
"Does density of green infrastructure predict preference?",2019,"Green Infrastructure (GI)refers to the natural spaces in a city that improve urban ecology and bring social, economic, and environmental benefits to residents and communities. Although we know a good deal about people's preference for urban forests, we know little about how people reaction to other types of GI and even less about how varying levels of vegetation density influence preference. Without this knowledge, planners and designers risk creating landscapes that people experience as insufficiently restorative. To understand people's preference for different types and vegetation density levels of GI, we conducted three GI preference surveys and utilized a new technology called Brown Dog's Green Index Extractor to calculate vegetation density. We found that, overall, tree density and understory vegetation density are positively associated with preference in a power-curve relationship. The nature of the relationship between bioretention density and preference remains unclear, even though it is significant and positive. The findings presented here expand our knowledge of landscape preference to the emerging field of GI. Designers and planners can use these results to create preferred landscapes that manage stormwater that also promote human well-being. Future studies might explore the relationship between GI density and preference further by investigating other aspects of GI such as planting designs and maintenance and the relationships between GI's vegetation density and various health and well-being indicators. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH","density; estimation method; infrastructure; landscape; methodology; preference behavior; stormwater; understory; vegetation; Canis familiaris"
"Feasibility of case-control and test-negative designs to evaluate dengue vaccine effectiveness in Malaysia",2019,"Background: The world's first dengue vaccine [Dengvaxia; Sanofi Pasteur] was licensed in 2015 and others are in development. Real-world evaluations of dengue vaccines will therefore soon be needed. We assessed feasibility of case control (CC) and test-negative (TN) design studies for dengue vaccine effectiveness by measuring associations between socio-demographic risk factors, and hospitalized dengue outcomes, in Malaysia. Methods: Following ethical approval, we conducted hospital-based dengue surveillance for one year in three referral hospitals. Suspected cases aged 9–25 years underwent dengue virological confirmation by RT-PCR and/or NS1 Ag ELISA at a central laboratory. Two age- and geography-matched hospitalized non-dengue case-controls were recruited for a traditional CC study. Suspected cases testing negative were test-negative controls. Socio-demographic, risk factor and routine laboratory data were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between confirmed dengue and risk factors. Results: We recruited 327 subjects; 155 were suspected of dengue. The planned sample size was not met. 124 (80%) of suspected cases were dengue-confirmed; seven were assessed as severe. Three had missing RT-PCR results; the study recruited 28 test-negative controls. Only 172 matched controls could be recruited; 90 cases were matched with ?1 controls. Characteristics of cases and controls were mostly similar. By CC design, two variables were significant risk factors for hospitalized dengue: recent household dengue contact (OR: 54, 95% CI: 7.3–397) and recent neighbourhood insecticidal fogging (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3–3.6). In the TN design, no risk factors were identified. In comparison with gold-standard diagnostics, routine tests performed poorly. Conclusions: The CC design may be more appropriate than the TN design for hospitalized dengue vaccine effectiveness studies. Selection bias in case control selection could be minimized by protocol changes more easily than increasing TN design control numbers, because early-stage dengue diagnosis in endemic countries is highly specific.

"Liver transplantation using hepatitis B core positive grafts with antiviral monotherapy prophylaxis",2019,"Background & Aims: The impact of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive liver grafts on survival and the risk of de novo hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after liver transplantation (LT) remain controversial. Therefore, we aimed to analyze this risk and the associated outcomes in a large cohort of patients. Methods: This was a retrospective study that included all adults who underwent LT at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, between 2000 and 2015. Data were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. Antiviral monotherapy prophylaxis was given for patients receiving grafts from anti-HBc positive donors. Results: A total of 964 LTs were performed during the study period, with 416 (43.2%) anti-HBc positive and 548 (56.8%) anti-HBc negative donors. The median follow-up time was 7.8 years. Perioperative outcomes (hospital mortality, complications, primary nonfunction and delayed graft function) were similar between the 2 groups. The 1-, 5- and 10-year graft survival rates were comparable in anti-HBc positive (93.3%, 85.3% and 76.8%) and anti-HBc negative groups (92.5%, 82.9% and 78.4%, p = 0.944). The 1-, 5- and 10-year patient survival rates in anti-HBc positive group were 94.2%, 87% and 79% and were similar to the anti-HBc negative group (93.5%, 84% and 79.7%, p = 0.712). One-hundred and eight HBsAg negative recipients received anti-HBc positive grafts, of whom 64 received lamivudine and 44 entecavir monotherapy prophylaxis. The risk of de novo HBV was 3/108 (2.8%) and all occurred in the lamivudine era. There were 659 HBsAg-positive patients and 308 (46.7%) received anti-HBc positive grafts. The risk of HBV recurrence was similar between the 2 groups. Donor anti-HBc status did not impact on long-term patient and graft survival, or the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after LT. Conclusions: De novo HBV was exceedingly rare especially with entecavir prophylaxis. Anti-HBc positive grafts did not impact on perioperative and long-term outcomes after transplant. Lay summary: The risk of de novo hepatitis B infection after liver transplantation was rare when using hepatitis B core positive liver grafts with entecavir monotherapy prophylaxis. Hepatitis B core antibody status did not impact on perioperative and long-term outcomes after liver transplantation. This provides support for the clinical use of hepatitis B core positive liver grafts when required. ? 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver","basiliximab; entecavir; hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; lamivudine; mycophenolate mofetil; tacrolimus; adolescent; adult; age; aged; alcohol liver cirrhosis; antiviral therapy; Article; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; chemoprophylaxis; chronic patient; cohort analysis; cold ischemia; controlled study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; delayed graft function; drug substitution; fatty liver; female; follow up; gender; graft recipient; graft survival; hepatic artery thrombosis; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; human tissue; hypoxia; immunosuppressive treatment; infection risk; injury; liver biopsy; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; liver graft; liver graft rejection; liver transplantation; liver vein thrombosis; living donor; lymphoproliferative disease; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; mortality; perioperative period; portal vein thrombosis; postoperative complication; priority journal; recurrent infection; retransplantation; retrospective study; survival rate; treatment indication"
"Mid-term outcomes of concomitant left atrial appendage closure and catheter ablation for non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a multicenter registry",2019,"To investigate the safety and midterm outcome of concomitant left atrial appendage (LAA) closure and catheter ablation (CA) as a one-stage hybrid procedure for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in a multicenter registry. A total of 50 consecutive patients with symptomatic drug-resistant non-valvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score ??2 and contraindications for antithrombotic therapy were included in the prospectively established LAA closure registry, and underwent concomitant LAA closure (48 for WATCHMAN and 2 for ACP) and CA procedure (40 for radiofrequency and 10 for cryoballoon CA). Two cardiac tamponades, one peripheral vascular complications and one mild air embolism were observed during perioperative period. After mean follow-up of 20.2 ± 11.5?months, 18 (36%) patients presented with atrial arrhythmia relapse and 45 (91.8%) patients presented with complete sealing; furthermore, there were two transient ischemic attacks and one ischemic stroke under an off-oral anticoagulant situation, respectively. Concomitant CA and LAA closure as a one-stage hybrid procedure might be feasible and potentially decrease costs in patients with symptomatic non-valvular AF with high stroke risk and contraindication to antithrombotic treatment, and as safe as LAA closure procedure only during the perioperative period.

"Online health information seeking and ehealth literacy among patients attending a primary care clinic in Hong Kong: A cross-sectional survey",2019,"Background: Previous studies have suggested that patients' online health information seeking affects their medical consultations and patient-doctor relationships. An up-to-date picture of patients' online health information-seeking behaviors can inform and prepare frontline health care professionals to collaborate, facilitate, or empower their patients to access and manage health information found online. Objective: This study explores the prevalence, patterns, and predictors of online health information-seeking behaviors among primary care patients in Hong Kong, and the relations between online health information seeking and electronic health (eHealth) literacy. Methods: Patients attending a university primary care clinic in Hong Kong were asked to complete a questionnaire survey on their demographic backgrounds; health status; frequency and pattern of online health information seeking; contents, sources, and reasons for online health information seeking; and their eHealth literacy. eHealth literacy was measured by the validated eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS). Regression analyses explored various demographic and behavioral predictors to online health information seeking, and predictors to eHealth literacy. Results: In all, 97.32% (1162/1194) respondents used the internet, of which 87.44% (1016/1162) had used the internet to find health information. Most respondents (65.97%, 665/1008) searched once monthly or more. Few (26.88%, 271/1008) asked their doctor about health information found online, but most doctors (56.1%, 152/271) showed little or no interest at all. The most sought topic was symptom (81.59%, 829/1016), the top reason was noticing new symptoms or change in health (70.08%, 712/1016), the most popular source was online encyclopedia (69.98%, 711/1016), and the top reason for choosing a source was convenience (55.41%, 563/1016). Poisson regression analysis identified high eHEALS score, fair or poor self-rated health, having a chronic medical condition, and using the internet several times a day as significant predictors of online health information seeking. Multiple regression analysis identified lower age, better self-rated health, more frequent internet use, more frequent online health information seeking, and more types of health information sought as significant predictors to higher eHealth literacy. Conclusions: Online health information seeking is prevalent among primary care patients in Hong Kong, but only a minority shared the information with doctors. Websites were chosen more for convenience than for accuracy or authoritativeness. Doctors should recognize patients' online health information-seeking behavior, and facilitate and empower them to search for high-quality online health information. ?

"The role of symptoms and insight in mediating cognition and functioning in first episode psychosis",2019,"Introduction: Achieving functional recovery in patients with psychosis is a challenge in clinical practice. Investigating the complex interplay between cognition, symptoms, insight and functional outcome in first episode psychosis will be crucial to understanding the factors leading to better functioning. Methods: In this 12-month prospective follow-up study, we investigated how cognition, clinical symptoms, and insight into illness affected overall functioning in 160 patients with first episode psychosis recruited from the Early Assessment Service for Young People with Psychosis (EASY) in Hong Kong from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016. Cognition was assessed at baseline while symptoms, insight, and functioning were assessed at 12-month follow-up. Structural equation modelling was used to examine the direct and indirect relationships between functioning and other latent constructs. Results: Symptoms (negative symptoms and general psychopathology) and insight were shown to be significant mediators between cognition and functioning. The significant direct relationship between cognition and functioning (β = 0.387; p < 0.001) became insignificant (β = 0.079; p = 0.578) after including symptoms and insight in the model. Symptoms and insight were significantly associated with cognition (symptoms, β = ?0.469; p < 0.001; insight, β = ?0.372; p < 0.001) and predicted functioning (symptoms, β = ?0.558; p < 0.001; insight, β = ?0.264; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Symptoms and insight mediated the effects of cognition on functioning. Interventions for improving functioning in patients with first episode psychosis should target not only cognition but also symptoms and insight. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; brief psychotic disorder; cognition; delusional disorder; female; follow up; functional status; Hong Kong; human; human relation; introspection; major clinical study; male; negative syndrome; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; priority journal; productivity; prospective study; psychosis; Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; self care; structural equation modeling"
"Exploring shared genetic bases and causal relationships of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with 28 cardiovascular and metabolic traits",2019,"Background Cardiovascular diseases represent a major health issue in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), but the exact nature of cardiometabolic (CM) abnormalities involved and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Psychiatric medications are known risk factors, but it is unclear whether there is a connection between the disorders (SCZ/BD) themselves and CM abnormalities.Methods Using polygenic risk scores and linkage disequilibrium score regression, we investigated the shared genetic bases of SCZ and BD with 28 CM traits. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate causal relationships between the two groups of disorders. The analysis was based on large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. We also identified the potential shared genetic variants and inferred the pathways involved.Results We found tentative polygenic associations of SCZ with glucose metabolism abnormalities, adverse adipokine profiles, increased waist-to-hip ratio and visceral adiposity (false discovery rate or FDR<0.05). However, there was an inverse association with body mass index. For BD, we observed several polygenic associations with favorable CM profiles at FDR<0.05. MR analysis showed that SCZ may be causally linked to raised triglyceride and that lower fasting glucose may be linked to BD. We also identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and pathways shared between SCZ/BD with CM traits, some of which are related to inflammation or the immune system.Conclusions Our findings suggest that SCZ patients may be genetically predisposed to several CM abnormalities independent of medication side effects. On the other hand, CM abnormalities in BD may be more likely to be secondary. However, the findings require further validation. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.",""
"Neighborhood environment and cognitive function in older adults: A multilevel analysis in Hong Kong",2019,"In considering the influence of the neighborhood environment on cognitive function, little research has looked beyond the individual factors. Here, we conducted a study on 21,008 older adults aged 65 years and above in Hong Kong to examine the cross-sectional associations of neighborhood economic disadvantage, recreational resources, walkability, library accessibility and physical activities on cognitive function and dementia. Both smaller and larger census tracts were adopted as proxies for neighborhoods. Using multilevel regression, neighborhood economic disadvantage was found to be associated with cognitive decline, net of individual features. This association was not explained by neighborhood built environment. Recreational environment was not a significant factor for older adults' cognitive function while library accessibility was. Neighborhood walkability was only related to dementia but not the cognitive function score. Physical activity can partly explain the relationship between neighborhood environment and cognitive function. No significant interaction effect was identified except on the educational level and neighborhood library accessibility. To conclude, late life residential environments are important contexts for aging. Aging-in-place interventions in Hong Kong should thus address neighborhood poverty, improve accessibility of libraries and walkability to reduce future risks of cognitive decline. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","accessibility; cognition; elderly population; environmental factor; future prospect; health geography; health risk; mental health; neighborhood; physical activity; recreational activity; walking; aged; aging; Article; cultural factor; daily life activity; disease association; educational status; environmental factor; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; mental deterioration; mental performance; neighborhood; physical activity; poverty; priority journal; recreation; scoring system; sex ratio; very elderly; walkability; China; Hong Kong"
"Coping, mood and health-related quality of life: A cross-sectional study in Chinese patients with advanced lung cancer",2019,"Objectives The ways patients cope with advanced cancer can influence their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aims to examine the mediating role of positive and negative mood in the relationship between coping and HRQoL in patients with advanced lung cancer. Methods A consecutive sample of 261 patients (mean age: 59.99±9.53) diagnosed with stage III or IV lung cancer was recruited from the inpatient unit in a hospital that specialises in chest-related disease in Shanghai, China. Participants completed measurements including Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and 5-level EuroQol 5-dimension instrument. Results Although the total effects of confrontation on HRQoL were not significant, competing indirect effects via mood were identified: (1) positive indirect effects through positive mood were found for confrontation on mobility, usual activities, pain/discomfort and overall utility index (indirect effect=0.01, 95% CI 0.003 to 0.03); (2) negative indirect effects through negative mood were found for confrontation on mobility, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression and overall utility index (indirect effect=-0.01, 95% CI-0.03 to-0.001). Resigned acceptance was negatively associated with HRQoL, and indirect effects via mood were identified: (1) negative indirect effects through positive mood were found for resigned acceptance on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and overall utility index (indirect effect=-0.01, 95% CI-0.03 to-0.003); (2) negative indirect effects through negative mood were found for resigned acceptance on domains of HRQoL and overall utility index (indirect effect=-0.04, 95% CI-0.06 to-0.02). Conclusions Confronting advanced lung cancer can fuel ambivalent emotional experiences. Nevertheless, accepting the illness in a resigned way can be maladaptive for health outcomes. The findings suggest interventions that facilitate adaptive coping, reduce negative mood and enhance positive mood, as this could help to improve or maintain HRQoL in patients with advanced lung cancer. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

"Validation of the Oral Health Impact on Daily Life Questionnaire (OHIDL) among Hong Kong older adults",2019,"Background: The Oral Health Impact on Daily Life Questionnaire (OHIDL) was developed through a qualitative study to measure oral health-related quality of life, including intensity and bother measurements, among older adults in Hong Kong. The instrument comprises 20 items divided into eight domains. Objectives: This study describes the psychometric properties of the OHIDL and refines the instrument through validity and reliability testing. Materials and methods: The OHIDL was administered to older adults who attended dental clinics for general dental treatments. Items with low discriminant ability were to be eliminated. Construct validity was assessed through convergent, divergent and factorial validity. Criterion validity was investigated by assessing the correlation between the measurements and the global questions. Reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha. Results: In total, 306 participants (mean age: 69.6?years) completed the interviews. Two items for which over 90% of the participants reported no impact and two items with poor discriminant validity were eliminated. Both intensity and bother measurements demonstrated good construct and criterion validity, with the intensity measurement showing better performance being selected for the OHIDL to reduce the respondents’ burden. The intensity measurement also showed satisfactory internal consistency. Conclusions: The refined OHIDL with 16 items in seven domains is valid and reliable in measuring the oral health impacts on daily life among Hong Kong older adults. ? 2019 Gerodontology Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aged; article; construct validity; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; dental clinic; dental procedure; discriminant validity; female; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; internal consistency; interview; major clinical study; male; quality of life; questionnaire; validation process"
"(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate suppresses cigarette smoke-induced inflammation in human cardiomyocytes via ROS-mediated MAPK and NF-κB pathways",2019,"Background: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause for the initiation and development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses play important roles in the pathophysiological processes of smoking-induced cardiac injury. (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, which is made from Camellia sinensis leaves, has been reported to possess potent anti-oxidant property. Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether the antioxidant EGCG could alleviate cigarette smoke medium (CSM)-induced inflammation in human AC16 cardiomyocytes in vitro. Methods: Human AC16 cardiomyocytes were pre-treated with EGCG, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), or specific inhibitors for 30 min before 4% CSM was added. Supernatant was collected for determination of interleukin (IL)-8 by ELISA and cells were collected for flow cytometry, biochemical assays and Western blot analysis. Results: EGCG treatment significantly attenuated CSM-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by reducing intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generations and preventing antioxidant depletion. EGCG treatment reduced CSM-induced inflammatory chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 productions in the supernatant via the inhibition of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways. EGCG treatment further inhibited CSM-induced cell apoptosis. Conclusion: Taken together, EGCG protected against CSM-induced inflammation and cell apoptosis by attenuating oxidative stress via inhibiting ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB activation in AC16 cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that EGCG with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties may act as a promising cardioprotective agent against ROS-mediated cardiac injury. ? 2018","acetylcysteine; antioxidant; cigarette smoke; epigallocatechin gallate; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 8; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; reactive oxygen metabolite; antioxidant; catechin; CXCL8 protein, human; epigallocatechin gallate; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow cytometry; human; human cell; in vitro study; inflammation; MAPK signaling; oxidative stress; priority journal; Western blotting; analogs and derivatives; cardiac muscle cell; cell line; chemically induced; drug effect; MAPK signaling; metabolism; myocarditis; pathology; signal transduction; smoking; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Catechin; Cell Line; Humans; Interleukin-8; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Myocarditis; Myocytes, Cardiac; NF-kappa B; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Smoking"
"Serum Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer level predicts hepatocellular carcinoma development in E-negative chronic hepatitis B patients",2019,"BACKGROUND Liver cirrhosis is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Serum Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) is a novel serological marker for fibrosis. The role of M2BPGi in prediction of HCC is unknown. AIM To examine the role of serum M2BPGi in predicting HCC development in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients. METHODS Treatment-naive CHB patients with documented spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion were recruited. Serum M2BPGi was measured at baseline (within 3 years from HBeAg seroconversion), at 5 years and 10 years after HBeAg seroconversion and expressed as cut-off index (COI). Multivariate cox regression was performed to identify predictors for HCC development. ROC analysis was used to determine the cut-off value of M2BPGi. RESULTS Among 207 patients (57% male, median age at HBeAg seroconversion 40 years old) with median follow-up of 13.1 (11.8-15.5) years, the cumulative incidence of HCC at 15 years was 7%. Median M2BPGi levels were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared to those without HCC (baseline: 1.39 COI vs 0.38 COI, P < 0.001; 5-year: 1.45 COI vs 0.47 COI, P < 0.001; 10-year: 1.20 COI vs 0.55 COI, P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed age at HBeAg seroconversion [odds ratio (OR) = 1.196, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.034-1.382, P = 0.016] and baseline M2BPGi (OR = 4.666, 95%CI: 1.296-16.802, P = 0.018) were significant factors predictive of HCC. Using a cut-off value of 0.68 COI, baseline M2BPGi yielded AUROC of 0.883 with 91.7% sensitivity and 80.8% specificity. CONCLUSION High serum M2BPGi within 3 years after HBeAg seroconversion was a strong predictor for subsequent HCC development in treatment-naive HBeAg-negative CHB patients. ?

"Optic neuropathy as the first sign of central nervous system relapse in acute myeloid leukaemia: MRI findings and its diagnostic challenge",2019,"We describe the case of a 22-year-old man who presented with right eye visual impairment and oral mucositis. MRI revealed findings compatible with right optic neuritis. Herpes simplex virus 1 was detected in oral swab. He has a previous history of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and was in clinical remission. Initial investigations for possible relapse of AML with central nervous system (CNS) involvement were negative. Treatment for HSV-related optic neuritis was initiated but the patient's vision deteriorated. Repeat MRI revealed right optic nerve infarct, new left optic nerve abnormality and new leptomeningeal enhancement in the brain. Repeated cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed CNS relapse of AML. Despite prompt initiation of pulse steroid and high dose intrathecal cytarabine followed by cranial irradiation, the patient never regained his vision.

"Individual susceptibility to TMS affirms the precuneal role in meta-memory upon recollection",2019,"A recent virtual-lesion study using inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) confirmed the causal behavioral relevance of the precuneus in the evaluation of one’s own memory performance (aka mnemonic metacognition). This study’s goal is to elucidate how these TMS-induced neuromodulatory effects might relate to the neural correlates and be modulated by individual anatomical profiles in relation to meta-memory. In a within-subjects design, we assessed the impact of 20-min rTMS over the precuneus, compared to the vertex, across three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuro-profiles on 18 healthy subjects during a memory versus a perceptual task. Task-based functional MRI revealed that BOLD signal magnitude in the precuneus is associated with variation in individual meta-memory efficiency. Moreover, individuals with higher resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fcMRI) between the precuneus and the hippocampus, or smaller gray matter volume in the stimulated precuneal region exhibit considerably higher vulnerability to the TMS effect. These effects were not observed in the perceptual domain. Thus, we provide compelling evidence in outlining a possible circuit encompassing the precuneus and its mnemonic midbrain neighbor the hippocampus at the service of realizing our meta-awareness during memory recollection of episodic details. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; awareness; BOLD signal; clinical article; controlled study; episodic memory; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gray matter; hippocampus; human; human experiment; male; mesencephalon; metamemory; posterior parietal cortex; precuneus; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; rest; cognition; episodic memory; metacognition; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; physiology; procedures; recall; transcranial magnetic stimulation; young adult; Cognition; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Metacognition; Parietal Lobe; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Young Adult"
"Optimal Lymph Node Examination and Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage I Lung Cancer",2019,"Objective: To determine the optimal number of lymph nodes (LNs) examined and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I lung cancer. Methods: The National Cancer Database was queried for surgically treated patients with pathologic stage I lung cancer between 2006 and 2014 (N = 65,438). The optimal LN numbers were determined in the multivariate Cox model and were further validated in the cohort with clinical stage I disease (N = 117,112) in terms of nodal upstaging and prognostic stratification. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with suboptimal staging (number of LNs examined was less than than the optimum) was evaluated in each T stage. Results: The number of LNs examined correlated with tumor size (p < 0.001). There were increasing survival benefits with each additional LN examined—up to eight, nine, 10, and 11 nodes for patients with T1a, T1b, T1c, and T2a, respectively. Validation from the cohort with clinically staged disease showed that the threshold of eight to 11 LNs was an independent predictor of nodal upstaging (OR = 1.706, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.608–1.779) and survival outcome (hazard ratio = 0.890, 95% CI: 0.865–0.916). After propensity matching, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival in patients with stage T2a disease having suboptimal staging (hazard ratio = 0.841, 95% CI: 0.714–0.990), but not in patients with stage T1a to T1c disease. Conclusion: LN evaluation was important for accurate staging and adequate treatment, and examinations of an increasing number of nodes for progressively higher T components (i.e., eight, nine, 10, and 11 nodes for T1a, T1b, T1c, and T2a tumors, respectively) seemed crucial to predict upstaging and survival outcomes. Adjuvant chemotherapy might be beneficial to patients with stage T2a disease who have suboptimal nodal staging. ? 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","aged; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; data base; diagnostic accuracy; disease association; female; human; lung cancer; lymph node; lymphatic system examination; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overall survival; prediction; priority journal; tumor volume; validation study"
"An experience-based interactive lighting design approach using BIM and VR: A case study",2019,"A lighting condition has a significant influence on humans' concentration, performance, and eye comfort. A well-designed lighting environment is critical for work efficiency and human health. Lighting design is commonly based on designer's previous experience and computational lighting simulation results. Although simulations can provide relatively accurate calculation results, several difficulties exist in terms of measuring actual users' experience and reflecting their feedback into the design. In this traditional approach, users are unable to experience or feel realistic lighting effects until the installation phase. This lack of user experience in the design phase leads to increasing risk of redesign and revision, which are extremely time-consuming and reduce the efficiency of lighting design. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the gap between the lighting design and users' satisfaction. This research aims to enhance visualization of lighting design and thus improve the design efficiency by developing a real-time interactive lighting design approach using building information modeling (BIM) and virtual reality (VR) technologies. By integrating these technologies, the proposed approach is able to support user interactions, actual activities simulation, and personalized lighting design. In addition, the proposed approach can provide users with immersive and sensory experiences to evaluate their lighting design alternatives. The whole process of the approach includes 3D modeling in Revit, texture mapping in 3ds Max, simulation analysis in DIALux, and interactions development and VR realization in Unity. A case study was conducted to implement and validate the proposed approach. In this case study, users were able to experience realistic lighting effects and provide their feedback for improving the design in a sensory way while lighting simulation was automatically conducted simultaneously. The approach enables better user experience and provides a practical way to apply BIM and VR technologies to improve the efficiency of real-time interactive lighting design. ? 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

"Messenger RNA Delivery for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Applications",2019,"The ability to control cellular processes and precisely direct cellular reprogramming has revolutionized regenerative medicine. Recent advances in in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA technology with chemical modifications have led to development of methods that control spatiotemporal gene expression. Additionally, there is a current thrust toward the development of safe, integration-free approaches to gene therapy for translational purposes. In this review, we describe strategies of synthetic IVT mRNA modifications and nonviral technologies for intracellular delivery. We provide insights into the current tissue engineering approaches that use a hydrogel scaffold with genetic material. Furthermore, we discuss the transformative potential of novel mRNA formulations that when embedded in hydrogels can trigger controlled genetic manipulation to regenerate tissues and organs in vitro and in vivo. The role of mRNA delivery in vascularization, cytoprotection, and Cas9-mediated xenotransplantation is additionally highlighted. Harmonizing mRNA delivery vehicle interactions with polymeric scaffolds can be used to present genetic cues that lead to precise command over cellular reprogramming, differentiation, and secretome activity of stem cells-an ultimate goal for tissue engineering. ?

"Age-specific differences in the dynamics of protective immunity to influenza",2019,"Influenza A viruses evolve rapidly to escape host immunity, causing reinfection. The form and duration of protection after each influenza?virus infection are poorly understood. We quantify the dynamics of protective immunity by fitting individual-level mechanistic models to longitudinal serology from children and adults. We find that most protection in children but not adults correlates with antibody titers to the hemagglutinin surface protein. Protection against circulating strains wanes to half of peak levels 3.5–7 years after infection in both age groups, and wanes faster against influenza A(H3N2) than A(H1N1)pdm09. Protection against H3N2 lasts longer in adults than in children. Our results suggest that influenza antibody responses shift focus with age from the mutable hemagglutinin head to other epitopes, consistent with the theory of original antigenic sin, and might affect protection. Imprinting, or primary infection with a subtype, has modest to no effect on the risk of non-medically attended infections in adults. ? 2019, The Author(s).","hemagglutinin; membrane protein; influenza vaccine; virus antibody; virus antigen; antibody; antigen; immunity; infectious disease; influenza; protein; viral disease; virus; antibody response; Article; dynamics; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; genetic difference; immune response; immunity; influenza A (H1N1); influenza A (H3N2); Influenza A virus; limit of detection; lung function; maximum likelihood method; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; serology; seroprevalence; vaccination; virus infection; virus transmission; adolescent; adult; age; aged; biological model; blood; child; cross protection; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; immunological memory; immunology; incidence; influenza; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); isolation and purification; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; preschool child; randomized controlled trial (topic); time factor; virology; young adult; Influenza A virus; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross Protection; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hemagglutinins; Hong Kong; Humans; Immunologic Memory; Incidence; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Young Adult"

"Dietary natural products and their potential to influence health and disease including animal model studies",2019,"Although biological and pharmacological effects of dietary natural products have been intensively studied, there has been no bibliometric analysis performed on this research field up to now. The current study has aimed to identify and analyze the manuscripts on dietary natural products and their potential to influence health and disease including studies using animal models. Data, including words from titles and abstracts, publication and citation data, have been extracted from Web of Science database and analyzed by the VOSviewer software. Our search has yielded 1,014 manuscripts. The ratio of original articles to reviews was identified to be 1.5:1. Over half of the manuscripts have been published since 2010. The manuscripts have been contributed by 4,301 authors from 1,445 organizations in 76 countries/territories and published in 499 journals. The results from the current study point out that scientific research focusing on the potential of dietary natural products to affect health and disease status (including animal model studies) is expanding, and suggests an increasing significance of this scientific area. With the progressive development and improvement of animal studies, it should be expected that animal models of different human diseases (especially civilization ones) would be an integral part of the research for the evaluation of pharmaceuticals originated from dietary natural products like plants or plant materials. Moreover, natural products can also be fed to animals to improve the quality of animal products, with numerous resulting functional effects. ? 2018, Polish Academy of Sciences.

"Work-related and non-work-related accident fatal falls in Shanghai and Wuhan, China",2019,"Purpose: In China, despite annually fall accidents caused more than 80,000 deaths, studies on occupational falls were scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate into work-related and non-work-related fatal falls in two major cities, Shanghai and Wuhan, China. Methods: The police records of accident fatal falls in Shanghai (2004–2017) and Wuhan (2009–2014) were used. Poisson regression was used to show the rate ratios related to city, gender, age, occupation, and height of the falls. Chi-square test was used to examine the demographic differences between the two cities. Results: The annual fall mortality rates (per 100,000) were 0.35 and 0.49 in Shanghai and Wuhan, respectively. Work-related and non-work-related falls shared about equal proportion (rate ratio: 0.99). The demographics of work-related falls were similar in the two cities. Work-related falls were much more likely to occur in the males than in the females (Shanghai 88:2, Wuhan 76:3). Real estate constructions and household decoration accidents accounted for most work-related falls (Shanghai 55/90, Wuhan 66/79). Conclusions: In China, each year, construction-related fall mortalities could exceed 2000. These rates are similar to the USA and they are much higher than the official figures. Thus, safety measures for construction workers and household decoration workers should be improved, particularly for those self-employed workers and workers affiliated to small companies. Some compulsory safety course might also be needed to raise the safety awareness among these workers as well. Moreover, improving the safety of young children should be another area to prioritize in injury prevention. ? 2019","Accidents; Construction; Population statistics; Statistical tests; Chi-square tests; China; Construction workers; Injury prevention; Occupation; Poisson regression; Safety awareness; Safety measures; Occupational risks; accident prevention; article; awareness; chi square test; child; China; city; construction worker; female; gender; height; household; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; occupation; police; real estate"
"Fear of cancer recurrence among Chinese cancer survivors: Prevalence and associations with metacognition and neuroticism",2019,"Objective: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) represents a chronic burden for many cancer survivors. We determined FCR prevalence and potential correlates, specifically metacognitive styles and neuroticism among Chinese cancer survivors with breast or colorectal cancer. Methods: This study included 285 Chinese patients with breast (N?=?173) and colorectal (N?=?112) cancers at 8-week postsurgery. Participants completed a set of baseline questionnaires evaluating FCR (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form [FCRI-SF]), metacognition (Metacognitions Questionnaire-30), and neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire). Scores of 13 to 21 were indicative of subclinical FCR on the FCRI-SF. Scores greater than or equal to 22 indicated clinically significant levels of FCR. Fully adjusted multinomial logistic regressions identified correlates of subclinical and clinically significant FCR. Results: Respectively, 26.0% (n?=?74) and 11.2% (n?=?32) achieved scores indicating subclinical and clinically significant FCR. Expressing significantly more positive (OR?=?1.21, P?=.003) and negative (OR?=?1.19, P?=.005) beliefs about worry was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting subclinical FCR. Both higher neuroticism (OR?=?1.28, P?=.003) and more negative beliefs about worry (OR?=?1.19, P?=?0.035) were associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing clinically significant FCR. Conclusions: Positive and negative metacognitions may play an important role in the development of subclinical FCR. In particular, negative metacognition and neuroticism may elevate FCR from subclinical to a clinical level. The findings give insight into the identification of cancer survivors with subclinical or clinical FCR and aid the development of interventions aimed at changing metacognitive beliefs in order to manage FCR. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; age distribution; Article; cancer recurrence; cancer survivor; Chinese; controlled study; distress syndrome; educational status; employment status; Eysenck Personality Questionnaire; fear; Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Short Form; female; gender; Hong Kong; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; metacognition; Metacognitions Questionnaire 30; neurosis; patient attitude; patient worry; physical symptom distress; population research; prevalence; questionnaire; scoring system"
"Investigating injury severities of motorcycle riders: A two-step method integrating latent class cluster analysis and random parameters logit model",2019,"Due to the wide existence of heterogeneous nature in traffic safety data, traditional methods used to investigate motorcyclist rider injury severity always lead to masking of some underlying relationships which may be critical for the formulation of efficient safety countermeasures. Instead of applying one single model to the whole dataset or focusing on pre-defined crash types as done in previous studies, the present study proposes a two-step method integrating latent class cluster analysis and random parameters logit model to explore contributing factors influencing the injury levels of motorcyclists. A latent class cluster approach is first used to segment the motorcycle crashes into relatively homogeneous clusters. A mixed logit model is then elaborately developed for each cluster to identify its unique influential factors. The analysis was based on the police-reported crash dataset (2015–2017) of Hunan province, China. The goodness-of-fit indicators and the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves show that the proposed method is more accurate when modeling the riders’ injury severities. The heterogeneity found in each homogeneous subgroup supports the application of the random parameters logit model in the study. More importantly, the results demonstrate that segmenting motorcycle crashes into relatively homogeneous clusters as a preliminary step helps to uncover some important influencing factors hidden in the whole-data model. The proposed method is proved to have great potential for accounting for the source of heterogeneity. The injury risk factors identified in specific cases provide more reliable information for traffic engineers and policymakers to improve motorcycle traffic safety. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accident prevention; Cluster analysis; Motorcycles; Injury severity; Latent class; Motorcycle crashes; Random parameters logit; Unobserved heterogeneity; Health risks; China; classification; female; human; injury; injury scale; latent class analysis; male; mortality; motorcycle; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; statistical model; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Built Environment; China; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Latent Class Analysis; Logistic Models; Male; Motorcycles; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Wounds and Injuries"
"Dental caries status of Lisu preschool children in Yunnan Province, China: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Background: Dental caries is still considered a major public health concern for human beings, especially minority groups and those living in disadvantaged communities. The Lisu is a minority group in China of more than 702,000 people located primarily in Yunnan Province. The present study was aimed at studying the status of dental caries status, as well as its risk factors, among Lisu children aged 5 years in Yunnan Province, China. Methods: A multistage cluster sampling method was employed for participants' recruitment. Two calibrated dentists carried out the clinical examination with dental mirrors and CPI probes under an LED headlight. The dental caries experience was assessed by the dmft index. Oral hygiene status was evaluated using the visible plaque index (VPI). Information on the child's socio-demographic characteristics and oral health-related practices were collected using a parental questionnaire. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB) was employed to analyse the associations between the dental caries status and the children's social-demographic status and their oral health-related behaviours. Results: In all, 470 Lisu children aged 5 were invited, and 404 were examined. Their mean dmft (±SD) and caries prevalence were 5.6 ± 4.8 and 80%, respectively. Their mean VPI scores were 58% ± 21%. Lisu children who brushed their teeth at least once daily had higher dmft scores, and children from high-income families were more likely to have dental caries. Conclusion: The prevalence of dental caries among Lisu children aged 5 years in Yunnan, China was high, and their caries status was severe, with a majority of carious teeth untreated. The dental caries experience of Lisu children aged 5 was related to their brushing frequency and families' economic backgrounds. ? 2019 The Author(s).","China; cross-sectional study; dental caries; DMF index; female; health; human; male; mouth hygiene; preschool child; prevalence; Child, Preschool; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Caries; DMF Index; Female; Humans; Male; Oral Health; Oral Hygiene; Prevalence"
"Association of adipokines with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B patients on long-term nucleoside analogue",2019,"Background &amp; Aims: It is unknown how concomitant hepatic steatosis affects disease progression in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Adipokines such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) have been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We determined the significance of these metabolic markers in CHB-related liver injury. Methods: We recruited CHB patients on antiviral treatment for transient elastography assessment to determine liver stiffness (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, F3/F4, defined by EASL-ALEH criteria) and controlled attenuation parameter (hepatic steatosis, defined as???248?dB/m). Plasma FGF-21, AFABP and adiponectin levels were measured. Results: A total of 415 patients [mean age 59.6?years, 71.6% male, median treatment duration 6.2?years] were recruited. Patients with F3/F4 (N?=?151) had lower FGF-21 (11.7 vs 13.6?pg/mL, P?=?0.055), higher AFABP (126.8 vs 84.1?pg/mL, P?&lt;?0.001) and HOMA-IR (7.1 vs 5.1, P?=?0.004) levels compared to those without F3/F4 (N?=?264). Multivariate analysis showed that FGF-21 level was associated with hepatic steatosis (OR 1.005, 95% CI 1.001-1.009) and F3/F4 (OR 0.993, 95% CI 0.989-0.998), while AFABP level (OR 1.001, 95% CI 1-1.002), body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.107, 95% CI 1.037-1.182) and presence of diabetes mellitus (OR 2.059, 95% CI 1.206-3.516) were associated with F3/F4. With the combined presence of BMI???25?kg/m2, diabetes and AFABP?&gt;?105.9?pg/mL, the odds ratio for F3/F4 was 3.712 (95% CI 1.364-10.105, P?=?0.010). Conclusions: Low FGF-21 and high AFABP levels were associated with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis in CHB patients on antiviral treatment. Plasma AFABP, together with other metabolic risk factors, may aid identification of patients lacking fibrosis improvement during antiviral treatment. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Adaptor protein APPL1 coordinates HDAC3 to modulate brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in mice",2019,"Objectives: The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is considered as a promising therapeutic target for obesity. APPL1 (Adaptor protein containing the Pleckstrin homology domain, Phosphotyrosine binding domain and Leucine zipper motif) is an intracellular adaptor protein and its genetic variation is correlated with BMI and body fat distribution in diabetic patients. However, little is known about the roles of APPL1 in BAT thermogenesis. Materials/methods: In this study, adipose tissue specific knockout (ASKO) mice were generated to evaluate APPL1's role in BAT thermogenesis in vivo, and possible signaling pathways were further explored in cultured brown adipocytes. Results: After high fat diet challenge, APPL1 ASKO mice developed more severe obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared with control mice. Metabolic cage study showed that APPL1 deficiency impaired energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis in ASKO mice. PET-CT analysis showed decreased standardized uptake value (SUV) in the inter-scapular region which indicated impaired BAT activity in ASKO mice. Further study showed deletion of APPL1 attenuated brown fat specific gene expression, such as UCP1 and PGC1α in both BAT and brown adipocytes. In cultured brown adipocytes, upon cAMP stimulation, APPL1 shuttled from cytosol to nuclei. Co-IP and ChIP study showed that APPL1 could directly interact with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to mediate chromatin remodeling and UCP1 gene expression. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated the essential role of APPL1 in regulating brown adipocytes thermogenesis via interaction with HDAC3, which may have potential therapeutic implications for treatment of obesity. ? 2019 The Authors","adaptor protein; carbon dioxide; histone deacetylase 3; uncoupling protein 1; Appl1 protein, mouse; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase 3; signal transducing adaptor protein; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; basal metabolic rate; body height; body temperature; body weight; brown adipocyte; brown adipose tissue; chromatin assembly and disassembly; cold exposure; controlled study; diet induced obesity; disease severity; disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism; energy expenditure; fat content; food intake; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance test; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin level; insulin resistance; insulin tolerance test; lipid diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; obesity; priority journal; signal transduction; standardized uptake value; thermogenesis; tissue specificity; transmission electron microscopy; animal; brown adipose tissue; C57BL mouse; energy metabolism; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; knockout mouse; obesity; physiology; thermogenesis; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose Intolerance; Histone Deacetylases; Insulin Resistance; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Obesity; Thermogenesis"
"Alteration of the immune cell profiles in the pathophysiology of tubal ectopic pregnancy",2019,"Tubal ectopic pregnancy (TEP) refers to implantation of conceptus in the fallopian tube. It makes up over 98% of ectopic pregnancy (EP), which is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the first trimester of pregnancy. Immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface play important roles in the process of embryo implantation, stroma decidualization, and early placental development. Alterations in the composition, phenotype, and activity of the immune cells in the fallopian tubes contribute toward the onset of TEP. In this review, we compare the leukocytic proportions in decidua of normal pregnancy, and in decidua and fallopian tubes of TEP. The possible functions of these immune cells in the pathophysiology of TEP are also discussed. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Simulation training for crises during venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation",2019,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) education, in particular with regards to crisis management during the provision of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), is challenging due to its intrinsic characteristics-a complex, high risk, low volume clinical activity which requires dynamic decision making, interdisciplinary teamwork and communication, and rapid response. Simulation training that focuses on crisis resource management and interprofessional communication is well-suited to address these training needs. Institutional commitment to provide both capital and human resources is instrumental to the success of ECMO training programs. Future multicenter studies with standardized training curricula are required to investigate the impact of ECMO simulation training on patient outcome. ? Journal of Thoracic Disease.

"Reliability and validity of the Chinese (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong version) of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand on patients with upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders in Hong Kong",2019,"Objective: This study aimed to translate, culturally adopt and validate a Chinese version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) for use in patients with upper extremity musculoskeletal diseases in Hong Kong. Methods: We followed a standard five-stage process: forward translation, synthesis, backward translation, expert panel review and field-testing to achieve linguistic and conceptual equivalence. The version was officially known as Chinese (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong version) DASH. (Chinese QMH,HK version DASH) (http://www.dash.iwh.on.ca/sites/dash/public/translations/DASH_Chinese_HK_2013.pdf). Results: Its internal consistency was then evaluated with 138 participants suffering from upper extremity musculoskeletal conditions. The results were high in DASH-Disability/Symptom module (DASH-DS) (Cronbach alpha 0.97), DASH-Work module (DASH-W) (Cronbach alpha 0.97) and DASH-Sports / Performing Arts module (DASH-SM) (Cronbach alpha 0.99). The test-retest reliability was evaluated with a subgroup of participants who had completed the Chinese (QMH,HK version) DASH on two occasions, with a median interval of 6.5 days. The results were excellent among DASH-DS Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.98 and DASH-W (ICC = 0.90). Good test-retest reliability was found in DASH-SM (ICC = 0.89). Construct validity of DASH-DS showed good correlation with the sub-domains of physical functioning (r = ?.564) and social functioning (r = ?.544) of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Similarly, construct validity of DASH-W also showed good correlation with the sub-domains of physical functioning (r = ?.510) and bodily pain (r = ?.503) of SF-36. Conclusion: The Chinese (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong version) Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand is considered as a reliable and valid instrument that can provide a standardised measure of patient-centred outcomes for patients with upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders in Hong Kong. ?

"Pattern and predictors of medical care received by hepatitis B carriers during pregnancy and after delivery",2019,"Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the pattern and predictors of medical care received by hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers during pregnancy and after delivery in Hong Kong. Study design: The study is a retrospective analysis. Methods: Pregnant HBV carriers and their infants were followed up for 9–12 months after delivery. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to investigate what medical care they received for HBV before, during and after pregnancy. Results: Data were available for 412 HBV carriers. A total of 375 (91.0%) women were known HBV carriers before pregnancy. Routine antenatal screening picked out the remaining 37 (9.0%) HBV carriers; these women were younger, more likely to be smokers and had a lower level of education (P < 0.05) than known HBV carriers. In total, 356 of 412 (86.4%) HBV carriers did not receive any medical care for HBV during pregnancy. Known HBV carrier status, history of medical check-up and the use of antiviral treatment before pregnancy were significant predictors for HBV medical care during pregnancy (P < 0.05). The results show that 217 of 412 (52.6%) HBV carriers did not receive medical care for HBV after delivery. HBV medical care before pregnancy, use of antiviral treatment before pregnancy and a higher level of education were significant predictors for postpartum HBV medical care (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that HBV medical care before pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 7.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.21–18.65; P < 0.001) and the use of antiviral treatment (OR, 5.02; 95% CI, 1.41–17.81; P = 0.013) were associated with medical care during pregnancy. Medical care before pregnancy was also associated with postpartum HBV medical care (OR, 5.05; 95% CI, 3.29–7.51; P < 0.001). Conclusions: A significant proportion of HBV carriers did not receive HBV-related medical check-ups during and after pregnancy in Hong Kong despite the majority being aware of their carrier status. Medical care before pregnancy predicted antenatal and postpartum HBV medical care. ? 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health","disease transmission; disease vector; health care; health status; hepatitis; infectious disease; medical geography; pregnancy; adult; antiviral therapy; article; controlled study; education; female; Hepatitis B virus; Hong Kong; human; infant; interview; male; medical examination; nonhuman; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; retrospective study; smoking; virus carrier; hepatitis B; heterozygote; isolation and purification; postnatal care; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal care; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; vertical transmission; China; Hong Kong; Hepatitis B virus; antivirus agent; hepatitis B surface antigen; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Carrier State; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Postnatal Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prenatal Care; Retrospective Studies"

"A meta-analysis and systematic review of Memory Specificity Training (MeST) in the treatment of emotional disorders",2019,"The tendency to recall events from one's past in a non-specific and overgeneral way has been found to predict the onset and severity of a range of emotional disorders. Memory Specificity Training (MeST) was devised a decade ago in order to target and modify this tendency so as to reduce the symptoms of emotional disorder or to reduce the risk that such disorders might emerge over time. We present a meta-analytical review of research into the effects of MeST on autobiographical memory specificity in the context of emotional disorders (k = 13). MeST was associated with substantial improvement in memory specificity (d = ?1.21) and depressive symptoms (d = 0.47) and MeST groups outperformed control groups at post-intervention in terms of specificity (d = 1.08) and depressive symptoms (d = ?0.29). However, these effects were transitory and the benefit of MeST over control groups was mostly lost by follow-up assessment. There was mixed evidence in terms of MeST's effects on other processes associated with reduced specificity but MeST showed evidence of improving problem solving abilities and hopelessness. MeST holds promise as a novel intervention targeting reduced specificity but future studies are warranted with control groups that enable the investigation of MeST's mechanism of action and in studies with larger and more varied samples. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article; autobiographical memory; autobiographical memory specificity training; clinical effectiveness; depression; disease association; emotional disorder; evidence based medicine; follow up; hopelessness; human; memory disorder; meta analysis; problem solving; psychotherapy; symptom; systematic review; therapy effect"
"Prevalence and Associated Impacts of Cervical Esophageal Clearance Issues Post Chemoradiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)",2020,"At present, the nature and extent of upper esophageal stage clearance issues following nonsurgical management of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is not well elucidated. The aim of this study was to conduct an initial retrospective study of the prevalence and severity of upper esophageal clearance impairments in a cohort of patients post-NPC management. A secondary aim was to explore any observed relationship between severity of impairment with both (a) aspiration and (b) temporal oropharyngeal swallowing measures. A cohort of 134 NPC patients who received curative intent (chemo)radiotherapy (C/RT) and completed a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) between 2012 and 2015 were reviewed. An Esophageal Clearance parameter, based on the scale used in MBSImP was used to classify the presence and severity of esophageal impairment on thin liquid and semisolids. Data on oral and pharyngeal temporal measures, pharyngeal constriction, and penetration/aspiration were also collected. The prevalence of cervical esophageal clearance impairment was high with ratings > 0 observed among 83% and 97% of patients on thin liquid and semisolids, respectively. With the increasing impairment, significantly (p < 0.05) increased oral transit times were observed for liquid swallows, and increased pharyngeal transit times for semisolids. Significantly higher proportions of patients presented with penetration/aspiration in the group with more severe esophageal clearance impairment. Results confirm that cervical esophageal clearance impairment is highly prevalent post-C/RT treatment for NPC. Causality cannot be determined from this study; however, this initial evidence supports that esophageal impairment may coexist in patients post NPC, presenting with more severe oral/pharyngeal deficits, and the impact of this on swallow function needs to be considered. Further systematic research is required. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; aspiration; cervical esophageal clearance; chemoradiotherapy; clinical feature; digestive tract parameters; disease association; disease severity; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; nasopharynx carcinoma; pharyngeal constriction; pharynx disease; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; swallowing"
"Clara: Design of a new system for passive sensing of depression, stress and anxiety in the workplace",2019,"Collective evidence from research on the detriment of mental ill-health in the workplace consistently points to the need for better management of workplace mental health. However, difficulty in making a reliable, unobtrusive measurement of an employee’s mental health remains an obstacle in the way of effective interventions at an organizational level. In this paper, a system named Clara is proposed with aims to enable passive measurement, and hence effective management, of workplace mental health. A literature review of different approaches to measure depression, stress, and anxiety is presented, followed by a discussion on the design principles that guided the development of Clara. The overarching system architecture is then outlined, and individual components of the system are explored in finer details. The paper illustrates how Clara, with its passive measurement techniques, has the potential to enable objective assessment of workplace depression, stress and anxiety, allowing for delivery of timely interventions. ? 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Health; Learning systems; Stresses; Ubiquitous computing; Anxiety; Depression; Individual components; Mental health; Objective assessment; Organizational levels; Passive sensing; Unobtrusive measurement; Occupational risks"
"A retrospective evaluation of factors influencing the volume of healthy maxillary sinuses based on CBCT imaging",2019,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing the volume of healthy maxillary sinuses by means of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). The sinus volumes in bilateral CBCT images of healthy maxillary sinuses of patients aged 18 years or older were evaluated using dedicated 3D volumetric software. Differences in volume based on gender, age, sinus side, and dental status were analyzed statistically. The study included 174 healthy maxillary sinuses in 87 patients (60 women and 27 men) aged between 18 to 82 years with a mean age of 29.5 years. There were 73 dentate sinuses and 101 partially dentate or edentulous sinuses. Males had significantly larger maxillary sinus volumes compared to females. Subjects below the median age of 24.3 years had a significantly larger sinus volume than older subjects. There was no difference in sinus volume between left and right sides. When partially dentate and edentulous cases were pooled together and compared to dentate cases, there was no difference in sinus volume. Gender and age influence healthy maxillary sinus volume, while sinus side and dental status do not. Neither tooth loss nor increasing age could be correlated with ongoing pneumatization of the maxillary sinus in the present population. Thus, the reported increase of the maxillary sinus volume over life and following extraction of posterior teeth in the upper jaw might be considered a misconception. To prove this hypothesis, prospective studies comparing sinus volumes using standardized time intervals before and after tooth extraction in the posterior maxilla are needed. ? 2019 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.","adult; aged; Article; comparative study; cone beam computed tomography; controlled study; female; human; intrarater reliability; major clinical study; male; maxillary first premolar; maxillary sinus; measurement repeatability; nose mucosa; periodontal disease; prospective study; retrospective study; sex difference; tooth extraction; adolescent; age; anatomy and histology; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; maxillary sinus; middle aged; organ size; sex factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Humans; Male; Maxillary Sinus; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Young Adult"
"Upper limb disorders in anaesthetists – a survey of Association of Anaesthetists members",2019,"Upper limb disorders (affecting the hand, arm and neck) are common. The nature of anaesthetists’ work poses a potential extra risk from poor posture that may contribute to the development of upper limb disorders in this professional group. However, to date, the problem has received scant attention in the literature. Following a 2 to 3-month period of publicity via newsletter, email and social media, all 10,231 electronically accessible members of the Association of Anaesthetists were invited by email to complete an online survey that was administered by a third-party company. A total of 3884 usable responses were received (38%). Analysis of possible risk factors found a significant association between upper limb disorders and years since starting anaesthetic training, having children (irrespective of respondents’ sex or the number of children) and right-handedness. Years of practice and having children are less modifiable identified risk factors. However, right-handedness may be linked to the ergonomic design of the environment/equipment used within this specialty and may thus be a potentially modifiable risk factor worthy of further investigation. ? 2018 Association of Anaesthetists","adult; anesthesist; Article; body mass; body position; carpal tunnel syndrome; cervical disk hernia; controlled study; De Quervain tenosynovitis; e-mail; female; health survey; human; limb disease; major clinical study; male; medial epicondylitis; middle aged; publication; right handedness; risk factor; sex difference; shoulder impingement syndrome; social media; tennis elbow; upper limb; aged; ergonomics; medical society; musculoskeletal disease; occupational disease; questionnaire; Adult; Aged; Anesthetists; Ergonomics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Occupational Diseases; Posture; Risk Factors; Societies, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Upper Extremity"
"Suicide ideation, suicide attempts, their sociodemographic and clinical associates among the elderly Chinese patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders",2019,"Background: It is still unknown whether many well-identified risk factors of suicide could be applied to the elderly Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Methods: 1-month suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts together with their sociodemographic and clinical associates were analyzed by retrospective data on 263 elderly patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders at the Kangning Hospital, Shenzhen, China. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to examine the differences between patients with and without suicidality. Backward stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify the associated factors. Results: Among the selected patients, 17.87% had 1-month suicide ideation and 7.60% had lifetime suicide attempts. It was further observed that the elderly patients with schizophrenia who had 1-month suicide ideation were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts, suffer from severe hopelessness and negative symptoms, and have no pension. However, the backward stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that lifetime suicide attempts and negative symptoms were most significantly associated with 1-month suicide ideation. In contrast, lifetime suicide attempters were more likely to be men, receive a pension, display symptoms of hopelessness, have longer duration of illness and poor family relationships. The regression analyses also indicated that only hopelessness, relatively long duration of schizophrenia, and poor family relationships were the most significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts. Limitations: The retrospective design do not allow for causal inferences. Conclusions: Early interventions designed to decrease hopelessness, control negative symptoms, and improve family relationships may result in reduced risks of suicide among elderly Chinese patients with schizophrenia. ? 2019","aged; aging; alcohol abuse; Article; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; China; daily life activity; demography; disease duration; family relation; female; hopelessness; human; lifespan; major clinical study; male; married person; migrant; negative syndrome; pension; positive syndrome; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; sex difference; smoking; socioeconomics; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; terminal disease"
"Effort-based decision-making impairment in patients with clinically-stabilized first-episode psychosis and its relationship with amotivation and psychosocial functioning",2019,"Effort-based decision-making has recently been proposed as a potential mechanism contributing to motivational deficits (amotivation) in psychotic disorder. Previous research has identified altered effort allocation in chronic schizophrenia, but produced mixed results regarding its relationship with amotivation. No study has investigated effort allocation in first-episode psychosis (FEP). We examined effort-based decision-making in 45 clinically-stabilized FEP patients and 45 demographically-matched controls, using Effort-Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT) which measures allocation of physical effort for monetary reward at varying magnitude and probability levels. Our results showed that FEP patients did not demonstrate overall reduction in effort expenditure but displayed reduced willingness to expend effort for high-value/high-probability reward as compared to controls. In particular, such selective effort-related impairment was most pronounced in patients with high levels of amotivation. Furthermore, reduced allocation of greater effort for higher probability reward was related to poorer psychosocial functioning. Decreased effort exertion was generally unrelated to other symptom dimensions, self-report anhedonia, antipsychotic dose and cognitive deficits. This study thus provides the first evidence of effort-based decision-making impairment in FEP, and indicates that first-episode patients were not generally effort-averse but exhibited inefficient effort allocation by failing to make high-effort choices to maximize reward receipt. Our findings affirm the critical role of amotivation on aberrant effort allocation, and support the link between laboratory-based effort-cost measures and real-world psychosocial functioning in medicated FEP. Further longitudinal research is required to clarify trajectory of suboptimal effort allocation and its potential utility in predicting amotivation and functional outcomes in the early course of illness. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP","chlorpromazine; adolescent; adult; anhedonia; Article; behavior assessment; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; ecological momentary assessment; effort based decision making; effort expenditure for reward task; energy expenditure; evidence based practice; female; functional status; human; male; medical decision making; motivation; patient attitude; priority journal; psychosis; reward; self report; social psychology; symptom assessment; task performance"
"Overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the diabetic heart compromises ischemic postconditioning",2019,"Ischemia postconditioning (PTC) can reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the effectiveness of PTC cardioprotection is reduced or lost in diabetes and the mechanisms are largely unclear. Hyperglycemia can induce overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthesis (iNOS) in the myocardium of diabetic subjects. However, it is unknown whether or not iNOS especially its overexpression plays an important role in the loss of cardioprotection of PTC in diabetes. C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice were treated with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Part of diabetic C57BL6 mice were also treated with an iNOS specific inhibitor, 1400 W. Mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion with/without PTC. The hemodynamic parameters, plasma levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT), TNF-α, IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO) were monitored. The myocardial infarct size, superoxide anion (O 2 [rad]? ) generation, nitrotyrosine production and apoptosis were measured. The expression of phosphorylated Akt, endothelial NOS (eNOS), iNOS and Erk1/2 in ischemic heart were detected by immunoblot analysis. In diabetic C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice, the post-ischemic hemodynamics were impaired, the cTnT, TNF-α, IL-6 level, myocardial infarct size, apoptotic index, O 2 [rad]? and nitrotyrosine generation were increased and the Akt/eNOS signal pathways were inhibited. PTC improved hemodynamic parameters, reduced cTnT level, myocardial infarct size, apoptotic index, O 2 [rad]? and nitrotyrosine generation and activated Akt/eNOS and Erk1/2 signal pathways in both non-diabetic C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice as well as diabetic iNOS ?/? mice, but not in diabetic C57BL6 mice. PTC also increased NO production in both non-diabetic and diabetic C57BL6 and iNOS ?/? mice, and enhanced iNOS expression in non-diabetic C57BL6 mice. 1400 W restored the cardioprotection of PTC in diabetic C57BL6 mice. Our data demonstrated that PTC reduced myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in non-diabetic mice but not C57BL6 diabetic mice. Deletion of iNOS restored the cardioprotection of PTC in diabetic mice. Our findings suggest that iNOS plays a key role in the reduction of cardioprotection of PTC in diabetes and may provide a therapeutic target for diabetic patients. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","3 nitrotyrosine; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; glucose; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 6; nitric oxide; streptozocin; superoxide; troponin T; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; body weight; cardiac muscle; controlled study; glucose blood level; heart hemodynamics; heart infarction size; heart muscle ischemia; heart protection; hyperglycemia; immunoblotting; ischemic postconditioning; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; reperfusion injury; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus"
"Crosstalk of genetic variants, allele-specific DNA methylation, and environmental factors for complex disease risk",2019,"Over the past decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of phenotype-associated DNA sequence variants for potential explanations of inter-individual phenotypic differences and disease susceptibility. However, it remains a challenge for translating the associations into causative mechanisms for complex diseases, partially due to the involved variants in the noncoding regions and the inconvenience of functional studies in human population samples. So far, accumulating evidence has suggested a complex crosstalk among genetic variants, allele-specific binding of transcription factors (ABTF), and allele-specific DNA methylation patterns (ASM), as well as environmental factors for disease risk. This review aims to summarize the current studies regarding the interactions of the aforementioned factors with a focus on epigenetic insights. We present two scenarios of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions and non-coding regions for disease risk, via potentially impacting epigenetic patterns. While a SNP in a coding region may confer disease risk via altering protein functions, a SNP in non-coding region may cause diseases, via SNP-altering ABTF, ASM, and allele-specific gene expression (ASE). The allelic increases or decreases of gene expression are key for disease risk during development. Such ASE can be achieved via either a “SNP-introduced ABTF to ASM” or a “SNP-introduced ASM to ABTF.” Together with our additional in-depth review on insulator CTCF, we are convinced to propose a working model that the small effect of a SNP acts through altered ABTF and/or ASM, for ASE and eventual disease outcome (named as a “SNP intensifier” model). In summary, the significance of complex crosstalk among genetic factors, epigenetic patterns, and environmental factors requires further investigations for disease susceptibility. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Self-care peritoneal dialysis patients with cognitive impairment have a higher risk of peritonitis in the second year",2019,"Introduction: Cognitive impairment is common among patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). We hypothesize that cognitive impairment has a negative impact on the outcome of patients on PD, especially with regard to peritonitis.? Methods: This was a single-center 2-year prospective cohort study involving 206 patients at 1 PD unit. Cognitive impairment was defined by the latest Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score (HK-MoCA) multiple cut-offs as determined by age and years of education. Eighty percent of patients had come back for interval HK-MoCA. The HK-MoCA was performed at baseline and after 1 year on PD. Potential risk factors for cognitive impairment and peritonitis were studied separately for the first and second year. ? Results: For cognitive impairment at baseline, multivariate analyses showed that age (odds ratio [OR] 1.003, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.003 – 1.065, p = 0.03), female sex (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.60 – 7.97, p = 0.002), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.33 – 9.01, p = 0.01), and hemoglobin level (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 – 0.84, p = 0.003) were statistically significant factors. For cognitive impairment at 1 year, multivariate analyses showed that age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 – 1.012, p = 0.007), female sex (OR 5.87, 95% CI 1.86 – 18.5, p = 0.003), and PVD (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.07 – 12.84, p = 0.04) were statistically significant independent factors for cognitive impairment at 1 year. ? For self-care PD patients in the second year, patients with cognitive impairment had a higher rate of peritonitis and proportionately more patients suffered from both peritonitis and exit-site infection than non-cognitively impaired patients in the second year (0.50 vs 0.27 episodes per year, p = 0.048; 25% vs 7.2%, p = 0.049). Logistic regression showed that only HK-MoCA-defined cognitive impairment and HK-MoCA scores at 1 year were factors predicting peritonitis (risk ratio [RR] 3.2 [95% CI 1.03 – 9.95], p = 0.04 and RR 0.92 [95% CI 0.86 – 0.995], p = 0.04 respectively). ? Conclusions: In summary, increasing age, female sex, anemia, and presence of PVD are risk factors for cognitive impairment in PD patients. Self-care PD with cognitive impairment at 1 year has a higher risk for PD-related peritonitis in the second year. Interval HK-MoCA assessment is recommended to detect cognitive impairment in our local PD patients. ? 2019 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis.","creatinine; hemoglobin; triacylglycerol; adult; age; aged; Article; cognition; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; cross-sectional study; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; gender; high risk patient; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; Montreal cognitive assessment; outcome assessment; peripheral vascular disease; peritoneal dialysis; peritonitis; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; self care; very elderly; cognitive defect; complication; Hong Kong; hospitalization; peritoneal dialysis; peritonitis; prevalence; procedures; risk factor; self care; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Peritoneal Dialysis; Peritonitis; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Self Care"
"Culture-independent studies on bacterial dysbiosis in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: A systematic review",2019,"Imbalance within the resident bacterial community (dysbiosis), rather than the presence and activity of a single organism, has been proposed to be associated with, and to influence, the development and progression of various diseases; however, the existence and significance of dysbiosis in oral/oropharyngeal cancer is yet to be clearly established. A systematic search (conducted on 25/01/2018 and updated on 25/05/2018)was performed on three databases (Pubmed, Web of Science & Scopus)to identify studies employing culture-independent methods which investigated the bacterial community in oral/oropharyngeal cancer patients compared to control subjects. Of the 1546 texts screened, only fifteen publications met the pre-determined selection criteria. Data extracted from 731 cases and 809 controls overall, could not identify consistent enrichment of any particular taxon in oral/oropharyngeal cancers, although common taxa could be identified between studies. Six studies reported the enrichment of Fusobacteria in cancer at different taxonomic levels whereas four studies reported an increase in Parvimonas. Changes in microbial diversity remained inconclusive, with four studies showing a higher diversity in controls, three studies showing a higher diversity in tumors and three additional studies showing no difference between tumors and controls. Even though most studies identified a component of dysbiosis in oral/oropharyngeal cancer, methodological and analytical variations prevented a standardized summary, which highlights the necessity for studies of superior quality and magnitude employing standardized methodology and reporting. Indeed an holistic metagenomic approach is likely to be more meaningful, as is understanding of the overall metabolome, rather than a mere enumeration of the organisms present. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","bacterium; bacterium culture; disease association; dysbiosis; Fusobacteria; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; microbial community; microbial diversity; mouth flora; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma; Parvimonas; Review; species richness; systematic review; taxonomy; complication; dysbiosis; factual database; incidence; meta analysis (topic); microbiology; mouth tumor; oropharynx tumor; pathophysiology; squamous cell carcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Databases, Factual; Dysbiosis; Humans; Incidence; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Mouth Neoplasms; Oropharyngeal Neoplasms"
"Meta-analysis of current chemotherapy regimens in advanced pancreatic cancer to prolong survival and reduce treatment-associated toxicities",2019,"Unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is a highly lethal malignancy. Although numerous chemotherapeutic regimens are available, evidence regarding the survival extension,thelifequalityimprovement,theassociatedrisksand occurrenceratesofadverseeffects,isrequired.Theeffectsof19 chemotherapy regimens on survival and treatment-associated toxicities in the context of APC treatment were comparatively assessed. A total of 23 randomized controlled trials were included in this network meta-analysis. For overall survival, five regimens, Gemcitabine (Gem)+radiotherapy (Radio), Gem+cisplatin (Cis), Gem+erlotinib (Erl)+bevacizumab (Bev), Gem+capecitabine (Cap)+Erl, and Gem+exatecan, were the most effective treatments, according to their respective high surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Regarding the progression-free survival, five regimens, including Gem+Radio, Gem+Erl+Bev, Gem+Cis, Gem+Cap+Erl and Gem+pemetrexed, were the most effective treatments based on their SUCRA probabilities. Each regimen exhibited advantages and disadvantages, and 14 common treatment-associated toxicities were present in different proportions. The three principal toxic effects included haematological, gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms. To improve survival, chemotherapy regimens with high SUCRA probabilities require prioritizing. Although treatment-associated toxicities are unavoidable, the regimens presented toxicities in distinct proportions. Therefore, clinicians should assess the disease status of the patients, and balance the benefits and risks of the selected treatment. ? Spandidos Publications.

"Community-based cognitive social capital and self-rated health among older Chinese adults: The moderating effects of education",2019,"This study investigated the moderating role of education on the association between community-based cognitive social capital and self-rated health among older adults in urban Chinese communities. Data were derived from a community survey conducted in Suzhou, China, in November 2015. A sample of 456 respondents aged 60 or older completed interviews. Multiple-group analysis from a structural equation modeling perspective was adopted to examine the proposed model. The measurement model of community-based cognitive social capital featured four trust and reciprocity indicators. Measurement invariance was established across high and low education groups. Education was found to have a moderating effect on the association between community-based cognitive social capital and self-rated health, but only in the high education group. Education should be considered an important factor in future social capital policy and intervention plans. Policy and intervention implications are discussed. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Happy Family Kitchen Movement: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial of a Community-Based Family Holistic Health Intervention in Hong Kong",2020,"Families are often faced with long working hours and stressful urban lifestyles which adversely affect family well-being. The Happy Family Kitchen Movement project, which emphasized the interaction and integration of physical health and psychosocial health, was conducted to promote well-being and health in Hong Kong families. Social workers and teachers from 54 social service units and schools in collaboration with the research team designed and implemented a brief community-based family “holistic health” intervention for 1983 individuals from 1467 families. In a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, participants were allocated into positive physical activity (PPA), positive healthy diet (PHD), or control group. The positive psychology framework, which encompassed joy, gratitude, and savoring, was used to help families build positive attitudes with stronger motivation to engage in health promotion behaviors. Data were collected at pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 1-month and 3-month follow-up. Results showed that compared to the control, PPA was effective in improving subjective happiness at immediately post-intervention and PHD was effective in promoting family harmony at 1-month and subjective happiness at 3-month, with small effect size. Both PPA and PHD showed some evidence of effectiveness on mental quality of life at 3-month. Participants’ evaluation of the program provided evidence for the perceived usefulness of PPA and PHD. Qualitative data provided additional support for program effectiveness with in-depth insights into the participants’ experiences. These two innovative brief interventions could be a viable, attractive and low cost approach for promoting family “holistic health” in community settings. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","adult; article; controlled study; effect size; female; follow up; happiness; health promotion; healthy diet; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; motivation; philosophy; physical activity; program effectiveness; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; wellbeing"
"Change in albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for progression of kidney disease: a meta-analysis of treatment effects in randomised clinical trials",2019,"Background: Change in albuminuria has strong biological plausibility as a surrogate endpoint for progression of chronic kidney disease, but empirical evidence to support its validity is lacking. We aimed to determine the association between treatment effects on early changes in albuminuria and treatment effects on clinical endpoints and surrograte endpoints, to inform the use of albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint in future randomised controlled trials. Methods: In this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed for publications in English from Jan 1, 1946, to Dec 15, 2016, using search terms including “chronic kidney disease” “chronic renal insufficiency” “albuminuria” “proteinuria” and “randomized controlled trial”; key inclusion criteria were quantifiable measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria at baseline and within 12 months of follow-up and information on the incidence of end-stage kidney disease. We requested use of individual patient data from the authors of eligible studies. For all studies that the authors agreed to participate and that had sufficient data, we estimated treatment effects on 6-month change in albuminuria and the composite clinical endpoint of treated end-stage kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m2, or doubling of serum creatinine. We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression analysis to relate the treatment effects on albuminuria to those on the clinical endpoint across studies and developed a prediction model for the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint on the basis of the treatment effect on albuminuria. Findings: We identified 41 eligible treatment comparisons from randomised trials (referred to as studies) that provided sufficient patient-level data on 29 979 participants (21 206 [71%] with diabetes). Over a median follow-up of 3·4 years (IQR 2·3–4·2), 3935 (13%) participants reached the composite clinical endpoint. Across all studies, with a meta-regression slope of 0·89 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0·13–1·70), each 30% decrease in geometric mean albuminuria by the treatment relative to the control was associated with an average 27% lower hazard for the clinical endpoint (95% BCI 5–45%; median R2 0·47, 95% BCI 0·02–0·96). The association strengthened after restricting analyses to patients with baseline albuminuria of more than 30 mg/g (ie, 3·4 mg/mmol; R2 0·72, 0·05–0·99]). For future trials, the model predicts that treatments that decrease the geometric mean albuminuria to 0·7 (ie, 30% decrease in albuminuria) relative to the control will provide an average hazard ratio (HR) for the clinical endpoint of 0·68, and 95% of sufficiently large studies would have HRs between 0·47 and 0·95. Interpretation: Our results support a role for change in albuminuria as a surrogate endpoint for the progression of chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with high baseline albuminuria; for patients with low baseline levels of albuminuria this association is less certain.

"Dual effects of Chinese herbal medicines on angiogenesis in cancer and ischemic stroke treatments: Role of HIF-1 network",2019,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-induced angiogenesis has been involved in numerous pathological conditions, and it may be harmful or beneficial depending on the types of diseases. Exploration on angiogenesis has sparked hopes in providing novel therapeutic approaches on multiple diseases with high mortality rates, such as cancer and ischemic stroke. The HIF-1 pathway is considered to be a major regulator of angiogenesis. HIF-1 seems to be involved in the vascular formation process by synergistic correlations with other proangiogenic factors in cancer and cerebrovascular disease. The regulation of HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis is related to the modulation of HIF-1 bioactivity by regulating HIF-1α transcription or protein translation, HIF-1α DNA binding, HIF-1α and HIF-1α dimerization, and HIF-1 degradation. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines have a long history of clinical use in both cancer and stroke treatments in Asia. Growing evidence has demonstrated potential proangiogenic benefits of Chinese herbal medicines in ischemic stroke, whereas tumor angiogenesis could be inhibited by the active components in Chinese herbal medicines. The objective of this review is to provide comprehensive insight on the effects of Chinese herbal medicines on angiogenesis by regulating HIF-1 pathways in both cancer and ischemic stroke.

"Feasibility and preliminary efficacy of Ai Chi aquatic exercise training in Hong Kong's older adults with risk of falling: Design and methodology of a randomized controlled trial",2019,"Falls in older adults are a major global public health concern. Group exercise could mitigate fall risk but the traditional land-based group exercise may not be always suitable for older adults at risk of falling, especially for those with musculoskeletal problems. Ai Chi aquatic exercise program could provide a safe and low-impact exercise training for older adults. However, the feasibility and efficacy of the program has not been well-investigated. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of the Ai Chi aquatic exercise program, compared to the land-based exercise program for older adults with moderate to high risk of falling. Forty community-dwelling older adults aged 65 or above with moderate to high fall risk will be recruited. They will be randomly allocated in the Ai Chi Aquatic Exercise Group (intervention)or the Land-based Exercise Group (active control)receiving 16 sessions (8 weeks)of specific exercise training. Feasibility of both exercise groups will be examined by recruitment, adherence, retention, feedback, subjective exercise experiences and satisfaction. Preliminary efficacy will be determined by whether physical and psychological fall risk factors could be mitigated. Physical fall risk assessment will include tests for flexibility, muscle strength, gait and balance. Psychological fall risk will be evaluated by preliminary cognitive function, anxiety level, level of depression and fear of falling. The results could establish a solid foundation for worldwide development of a feasible, safe and effective Ai Chi aquatic exercise program for prevention of falls in older adults with risk of falling. ? 2019","aged; anxiety; aquatic exercise; Article; cognition; community dwelling person; controlled study; depression; fall risk; fall risk assessment; falling; fear of falling; feasibility study; feedback system; gait; Hong Kong; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; medical ethics; medical history; Mini Mental State Examination; muscle strength; Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment; physiotherapist; priority journal; psychological balance; public health; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; satisfaction; Tai Chi; training"
"Adolescent support for tobacco control policies and associations with tobacco denormalization beliefs and harm perceptions",2019,"Public support is crucial for advancing tobacco control policies. We investigated adolescent support for such policies, and its association with potential factors of social denormalization (SD) beliefs of smoking, tobacco industry denormalization (TID) beliefs (negative perceptions of the industry), and harm perceptions of smoking. In a cross-sectional survey in Hong Kong, 13,964 secondary school students (mean age 15.0 years, 51.3% boys) reported their support (yes/no) for each of 14 tobacco control policies (e.g., further increase tobacco tax). Tobacco-related beliefs and perceptions, and smoking status were also measured. Support for the 14 tobacco control policies ranged from 17.6% to 54.1%. In current non-smokers, SD beliefs, TID beliefs, and harm perceptions were all associated with support for all tobacco control policies. In current smokers, the study factors were each associated with support for two to three policies. To conclude, support for tobacco control policies was weak to moderate in Hong Kong adolescents. SD beliefs, TID beliefs, and harm perceptions of smoking were associated with policy support in current non-smokers. In current smokers, the corresponding associations were less consistent or weaker. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Ecological and socio-economic impacts of the red import fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), on urban agricultural ecosystems",2020,"The agricultural impacts of the Red Imported Fire Ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren 1972, have been well studied in North America, but have received less emphasis in Asia where the species was first detected in the early 2000’s. Simultaneously, with urbanization rapidly expanding in Asia, S. invicta impacts on the socio-economic benefits of urban farming are to this point unknown. Our study focuses on establishing a baseline on the geographic distribution of the S. invicta spread in Hong Kong urban agroecosystems and its potential impacts on native ant communities and farmers through a series of field surveys and interviews. Our results show that in 15?years, S. invicta has invaded half of the Hong Kong urban agroecosystems, with infestation levels slightly varying in farming practices (organic vs. traditional) but greatly among the different types of cultures. Ecologically, the presence of S. invicta and its increased abundance were associated with a decrease in ant community species richness and evenness. Economically, the farmers’ perception indicated that S. invicta could have impacts on crops production ranging from 10% to 80%, as well as important public health issues associated to indirect economic costs due to the aggressive stinging and consequences on other educational activities. Finally, all control methods used were mainly inefficient and maladjusted to these environments. With dense infested farm locations and current management, S. invicta prevalence and its cost are expected to expand. This prospective situation requests the development of professional guidance and management plans to impede S. invicta spread and rising impacts. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Joint effects of intensity and duration of cigarette smoking on the risk of head and neck cancer: A bivariate spline model approach",2019,"Objectives: This study aimed at re-evaluating the strength and shape of the dose-response relationship between the combined (or joint) effect of intensity and duration of cigarette smoking and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC). We explored this issue considering bivariate spline models, where smoking intensity and duration were treated as interacting continuous exposures. Materials and Methods: We pooled individual-level data from 33 case-control studies (18,260 HNC cases and 29,844 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium. In bivariate regression spline models, exposures to cigarette smoking intensity and duration (compared with never smokers) were modeled as a linear piecewise function within a logistic regression also including potential confounders. We jointly estimated the optimal knot locations and regression parameters within the Bayesian framework. Results: For oral-cavity/pharyngeal (OCP) cancers, an odds ratio (OR) >5 was reached after 30 years in current smokers of ?20 or more cigarettes/day. Patterns of OCP cancer risk in current smokers differed across strata of alcohol intensity. For laryngeal cancer, ORs >20 were found for current smokers of ?20 cigarettes/day for ?30 years. In former smokers who quit ?10 years ago, the ORs were approximately halved for OCP cancers, and ?1/3 for laryngeal cancer, as compared to the same levels of intensity and duration in current smokers. Conclusion: Referring to bivariate spline models, this study better quantified the joint effect of intensity and duration of cigarette smoking on HNC risk, further stressing the need of smoking cessation policies. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; Bayes theorem; bivariate spline model; cancer risk; case control study; cigarette smoking; clinical evaluation; confounding variable; controlled study; ex-smoker; exploratory research; exposure; female; head and neck cancer; high risk population; human; larynx cancer; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth cancer; nonsmoker; pharynx cancer; priority journal; retrospective study; smoking cessation; statistical analysis"
"Controversy around airborne versus droplet transmission of respiratory viruses: Implication for infection prevention",2019,"Purpose of reviewHealth agencies recommend transmission-based precautions, including contact, droplet and airborne precautions, to mitigate transmission of respiratory viruses in healthcare settings. There is particular controversy over the importance of aerosol transmission and whether airborne precautions should be recommended for some respiratory viruses. Here, we review the current recommendations of transmission-based precautions and the latest evidence on the aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses.Recent findingsViral nucleic acids, and in some instances viable viruses, have been detected in aerosols in the air in healthcare settings for some respiratory viruses such as seasonal and avian influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. However, current evidences are yet to demonstrate that these viruses can effectively spread via airborne route between individuals, or whether preventive measures in airborne precautions would be effective.SummaryStudies that use transmission events as outcome to demonstrate human-to-human transmission over the aerosol route or quantitative measurement of infectious respiratory viruses in the air are needed to evaluate the infectiousness of respiratory viruses over the aerosol route. When a respiratory virus in concern only leads to disease with low severity, airborne precautions are not likely to be justified. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Metformin Use and Gastric Cancer Risk in Diabetic Patients after Helicobacter pylori Eradication",2019,"Background: Although prior studies showed metformin could reduce gastric cancer (GC) risk in patients with diabetes mellitus, they failed to adjust for Helicobacter pylori infection and glycemic control. We aimed to investigate whether metformin reduced GC risk in H. pylori-eradicated diabetic patients and its association with glycemic control. Methods: This was a territory-wide cohort study using hospital registry database, recruiting all diabetic patients who were prescribed clarithromycin-based triple therapy for H. pylori infection from 2003 to 2012. Subjects were observed from H. pylori therapy prescription until GC diagnosis, death, or end of study (December 2015). Exclusion criteria included GC diagnosed within first year of H. pylori therapy, prior history of GC or gastrectomy, and failure of H. pylori eradication. The hazard ratio (HR) of GC with metformin (defined as at least 180-day use) was estimated by Cox model with propensity score adjustment for covariates (age, sex, comorbidities, medications [including insulin], and time-weighted average hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: During a median follow-up of 7.1 years (IQR = 4.7-9.8), 37 (0.51%) of 7266 diabetic patients developed GC at a median age of 76.4years (IQR = 64.8-81.5 years). Metformin use was associated with a reduced GC risk (adjusted HR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.98). There was a trend towards a lower GC risk with increasing duration (Ptrend = .01) and dose ofmetformin (Ptrend = .02). HbA1c level was not an independent risk factor for GC. Conclusions: Metformin use was associated with a lower GC risk among H. pylori-eradicated diabetic patients in a durationand dose-response manner, which was independent of HbA1c level. ?

"Glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure in type II diabetes: A longitudinal observational study comparing patients with and without severe mental illness",2019,"What is known on the subject?: People with severe mental illness (SMI) have a life expectancy of 15–20?years less than the general population, partly due to increased risk of physical disease, including type II diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. Little is known about changes in cardiovascular risk factors over time in people with both T2DM and SMI compared to those with T2DM and no SMI. What this paper adds to existing knowledge?: We investigated whether levels of cardiovascular risk factors, cholesterol, HbA1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure associated with adverse clinical outcomes are different in T2DM patients with and without SMI. We found significant differences in systolic blood pressure and HbA1c between the two groups. Fifty-five percent and twenty-nine percent of T2DM patients with comorbid SMI are at increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes due to sub-optimal HbA1c and systolic blood pressure levels, respectively. What are the implications for practice?: Many patients with T2DM and SMI have higher levels of cardiovascular risk compared to patients with T2DM only, and good management of risk factors is therefore particularly important in patients with both conditions. Achieving better control of HbA1c levels is likely to be central to addressing inequalities in outcomes for patients with both SMI and T2DM. Abstract Introduction Patients with both severe mental illness (SMI) and type II diabetes (T2DM) have lower life expectancy than patients with T2DM alone, partly due to poor control of cardiovascular risk factors in comorbid patients. Aim To compare levels of cholesterol, HbA1c and blood pressure in T2DM patients with and without SMI. Method We analysed longitudinal clinical records of 30,353 people with T2DM (657 with SMI; 29,696 controls without SMI) between 2001 and 2013 using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We used mixed-effects regression models to compare cardiovascular risk factors between SMI and controls. Results Patients with SMI had lower mean systolic blood pressure (SBP; β: ?2.49; SE?=.45 p?=?&lt;.01) and were more likely to have extreme (high and low) values of HbA1c and SBP (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.64 and 1.76:1.40, 2.21, respectively). Discussion People with T2DM and SMI have similar average values of cardiovascular risk factors to people with T2DM alone but are more likely to have values of HbA1c and SBP indicating increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Implications for Practice Improved management of cardiovascular risk factors in general, glycaemic control in particular, is central to addressing the increased risk of adverse outcomes in people with both SMI and T2DM. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition: Lessons from development, insights into cancer and the potential of EMT-subtype based therapeutic intervention",2019,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental developmental process wherein polarized epithelial cells lose their junctional architecture and apical-basal polarity to become motile mesenchymal cells, and there is emerging evidence for its role in propagating tumor dissemination. While many multifaceted nodules converge onto the EMT program, in this review we will highlight the fundamental biology of the signaling schemas that enable EMT. In many cancers, the property of tumor dissemination and metastasis is closely associated with re-enabling developmental properties such as EMT. We discuss the molecular complexity of the tumor heterogeneity in terms of EMT-based gene expression molecular subtypes, and the rewiring of critical signaling nodules in the subtypes displaying higher degrees of EMT can be therapeutically exploited. Specifically in the context of a deadly malignancy such as ovarian cancer where there are no defined mutations or limited biomarkers for developing targeted therapy or personalized medicine, we highlight the importance of identifying EMT-based subtypes that will improve therapeutic intervention. In ovarian cancer, the poor prognosis mesenchymal 'Mes' subtype presents with amplified signaling of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL, extensive crosstalk with other RTKs such as cMET, EGFR and HER2, and sustained temporal activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) leading to induction of EMT transcription factor Slug, underscoring a pathway addiction in Mes that can be therapeutically targeted. We will further examine the emergence of therapeutic modalities in these EMT subtypes and finally conclude with potential interdisciplinary biophysical methodologies to provide additional insights in deciphering the mechanistic and biochemical aspects of EMT. This review intends to provide an overview of the cellular and molecular changes accompanying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in development and the requisition of this evolutionarily conserved pathway in cancer progression and metastatic disease. Specifically, in a heterogeneous disease such as ovarian cancer lacking defined targetable mutations, the identification of EMT-based subtypes has opened avenues to tailor precision personalized medicine. In particular, using the oncogenic RTK AXL as an example, we will highlight how this classification enables EMT-subtype specific identification of targets that could improve treatment options for patients and how there is a growing need for biophysical approaches to model dynamic processes such as EMT. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","axl receptor tyrosine kinase; oncoprotein; protein tyrosine kinase; drug effect; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; human; metabolism; metastasis; ovary tumor; pathology; personalized medicine; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Ovarian Neoplasms; Precision Medicine; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases"
"Molecular characterisation of emerging pathogens of unexplained infectious disease syndromes",2019,"Introduction: The discoveries of HIV and Helicobacter pylori in the 1980s were landmarks in identification of novel pathogens causing unexplained infectious syndromes using conventional microbiological technologies. In the last few decades, advancement of molecular technologies has provided us with more robust tools to expand our armamentarium in this microbial hunting process. Areas covered: In this article, we give a brief overview of the most important molecular technologies we use for identification of emerging microbes associated with unexplained infectious syndromes, including 16S rRNA and other conserved targets sequencing for bacteria, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and other target gene sequencing for fungi, polymerase and other gene sequencing for viruses, as well as deep sequencing. Then, we use several representative examples to illustrate how these techniques have been used for the discoveries of a few notable bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens associated with unexplained infectious syndromes in the last 20–30 years. Expert opinion: In the past and present, characterization of emerging pathogens of unexplained infectious disease syndromes has relied on a combination of conventional culture- and phenotype-based technologies and nucleic acid amplification and sequencing. In the next era, we envisage more widespread adoption of next generation technologies that can detect both known and previously undescribed pathogens. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antifungal agent; internal transcribed spacer; RNA 16S; antifungal resistance; Candida auris; candidiasis; community acquired infection; critically ill patient; epidemic; gastroenteritis; Gram negative bacterium; hospital infection; human; infection; infection control; intestine lipodystrophy; Laribacter hongkongensis; microbial identification; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; molecular diagnosis; molecular genetics; nonhuman; onychomycosis; Review; SARS coronavirus; traveller diarrhea; Tropheryma whipplei; viral respiratory tract infection"

"ACC sulcal patterns and their modulation on cognitive control efficiency across lifespan: A neuroanatomical study on bilinguals and monolinguals",2019,"The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key structure implicated in the regulation of cognitive control (CC). Previous studies suggest that variability in the ACC sulcal pattern—a neurodevelopmental marker unaffected by maturation or plasticity after birth—is associated with intersubject differences in CC performance. Here, we investigated whether bilingual experience modulates the effects of ACC sulcal variability on CC performance across the lifespan. Using structural MRI, we first established the distribution of the ACC sulcal patterns in a large sample of healthy individuals (N = 270) differing on gender and ethnicity. Second, a participants’ subsample (N = 157) was selected to test whether CC performance was differentially affected by ACC sulcation in bilinguals and monolinguals across age. A prevalent leftward asymmetry unaffected by gender or ethnicity was reported. Sulcal variability in the ACC predicted CC performance differently in bilinguals and monolinguals, with a reversed pattern of structure–function relationship: asymmetrical versus symmetrical ACC sulcal patterns were associated with a performance advantage in monolinguals and a performance detriment to bilinguals and vice versa. Altogether, these findings provide novel insights on the dynamic interplay between early neurodevelopment, environmental background and cognitive efficiency across age. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Effect of linoleic acid on ischemic heart disease and its risk factors: A Mendelian randomization study",2019,"Background: The role of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in ischemic heart disease (IHD) is controversial, and dietary guidelines vary. Observationally, lower saturated fat intake and higher intake of vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid (LA), the main n-6 PUFA, is associated with lower IHD and diabetes; however, randomized controlled trials have not fully corroborated these benefits. We assessed how genetically predicted LA affected IHD and its risk factors, including diabetes, lipids, and blood pressure. We also assessed the role of LA in reticulocyte count, the red blood cell precursor, which has recently been identified as a possible causal factor in IHD. Methods: Two-sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments, i.e., Mendelian randomization, was used to obtain unconfounded estimates using genetic variants strongly (p value &lt; 5 × 10-8) and solely associated with LA, applied to an IHD case (n ? 76,014)-control (n ? 264,785) study (mainly based on the meta-analysis of CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes and UK Biobank CAD SOFT GWAS), the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis diabetes case (n = 26,676)-control (n = 132,532) study, lipids from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n = 196,475), and reticulocyte count and blood pressure from the UK Biobank (n ? 361,194). A weighted median and Mendelian randomization Egger were used for sensitivity analysis. Results: Genetically predicted LA was not associated with IHD or systolic blood pressure. Genetically predicted higher serum LA was associated with lower diabetes (odds ratio (OR) 0.97 per percentage in total fatty acid increase in LA, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 0.99) and lower lipids (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol), but may be associated with higher diastolic blood pressure. The findings were robust to different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selections, analytic methods, and correction for multiple testing. Conclusions: Our novel study suggests a benefit of LA for diabetes and lipids but no benefit for IHD, blood pressure, or reticulocyte count. Explicating these paradoxical findings would facilitate identification of effective new interventions for diabetes and IHD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; linoleic acid; lipid; low density lipoprotein; linoleic acid; adult; aged; analytic method; Article; blood pressure; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; erythrocyte; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid metabolism; female; genetic association; genetic variability; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; prediction; reticulocyte count; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; heart muscle ischemia; Mendelian randomization analysis; middle aged; procedures; risk factor; Female; Humans; Linoleic Acid; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Risk Factors"
"PiggyBac transposon tools for recessive screening identify B-cell lymphoma drivers in mice",2019,"B-cell lymphoma (BCL) is the most common hematologic malignancy. While sequencing studies gave insights into BCL genetics, identification of non-mutated cancer genes remains challenging. Here, we describe PiggyBac transposon tools and mouse models for recessive screening and show their application to study clonal B-cell lymphomagenesis. In a genome-wide screen, we discover BCL genes related to diverse molecular processes, including signaling, transcriptional regulation, chromatin regulation, or RNA metabolism. Cross-species analyses show the efficiency of the screen to pinpoint human cancer drivers altered by non-genetic mechanisms, including clinically relevant genes dysregulated epigenetically, transcriptionally, or post-transcriptionally in human BCL. We also describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo platform for BCL functional genomics, and validate discovered genes, such as Rfx7, a transcription factor, and Phip, a chromatin regulator, which suppress lymphomagenesis in mice. Our study gives comprehensive insights into the molecular landscapes of BCL and underlines the power of genome-scale screening to inform biology. ? 2019, The Author(s).","cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin plus prednisolone plus rituximab plus vincristine; myeloperoxidase; short hairpin RNA; syndecan 1; lymphocyte antigen receptor; biology; cancer; cell component; detection method; gene; gene expression; genetic analysis; genetics; genome; hematology; metabolism; protein; RNA; rodent; tumor; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; B cell lymphoma; comparative genomic hybridization; complementarity determining region; CRISPR-CAS9 system; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; DNA isolation; down regulation; downstream processing; flow cytometry; functional genomics; gene expression; gene inactivation; gene mutation; haplotype; heterozygosity loss; immunohistochemistry; melanoma; mouse; nested polymerase chain reaction; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; overall survival; plasmablastic lymphoma; progression free survival; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; RNA metabolism; RNA sequence; Sanger sequencing; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; somatic hypermutation; Streptococcus pyogenes; transposon; tumor suppressor gene; animal; B cell lymphoma; C57BL mouse; cell clone; CRISPR Cas system; gene dosage; gene expression regulation; genetic association study; genetic screening; genetics; human; metabolism; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; transgenic mouse; transposon; tumor gene; Mus; Animals; Clone Cells; CRISPR-Cas Systems; DNA Transposable Elements; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Neoplasm; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Testing; Humans; Loss of Heterozygosity; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Reproducibility of Results"
"The prevalence and impact of cervical spine pathologies in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma",2019,"Objectives: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and its treatment can lead to cervical spine pathologies such as metastases, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) and infection. However, the occurrence rate and relationship between timing of diagnosis and outcomes of the ever-advancing technology of radiation therapy is largely unknown. Hence, the aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and impact of cervical spine pathologies in patients with NPC. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study of all newly diagnosed cases of NPC from 2007 to 2016 at a tertiary referral oncology and spine centre with minimum 1-year post-treatment follow-up. All cervical spine pathologies, their treatment and outcomes were determined. Presentation, onset time and correlations of the cervical spine pathologies with mortality and risk factors were also analysed. Results: Out of 605 cases of verified cases of NPC, cervical spine pathologies were seen in 8.9% of patients. New onset neck pain was seen in 5.3%, symptomatic cervical spondylosis in 4.8%, cervical spine metastases in 2.5%, local tumour invasion in 0.8%, cervical ORN in 0.7%, osteomyelitis in 0.7%, radiculopathy in 0.3%, and myelopathy in 0.3%. Cervical spine pathologies were associated with an increased risk (odds ratio: 2.73) in overall mortality. Cervical spine metastases, invasion, ORN and infection were associated with significantly higher risk of mortality (p = 0.01–0.02). Conclusion: Cervical spine pathologies in patients with NPC are heterogenous but not uncommon. Neck pain is prevalent but is often benign. ORN and osteomyelitis of the cervical spine is uncommon but have large clinical implications including higher mortality with subtle presentations. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; Article; basilar impression; bone necrosis; cervical spine; cervical spondylosis; cervicobrachial neuralgia; cross-sectional study; erosion; female; fever; follow up; human; infection; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; nasopharynx carcinoma; neck pain; osteomyelitis; paresthesia; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; spinal cord disease; spine metastasis; tumor invasion"
"Establishment of a lethal aged mouse model of human respiratory syncytial virus infection",2019,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly among the children and the elderly. Despite extensive efforts, there is currently no formally approved vaccine and effective antiviral options against HRSV infection are limited. The development of vaccines and antiviral strategies for HRSV was partly hampered by the lack of an efficient lethal mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of the candidate vaccines or antivirals. In this study, we established a lethal HRSV mouse model by consecutively passaging a clinical HRSV isolate, GZ08-0. GZ08-18 was isolated from mouse bronchioalveolar lavage fluids at the 50th passage of GZ08-0. Importantly, all GZ08-18-inoculated mice succumbed to the infection by day 7 post infection, whereas all GZ08-0-inoculated mice recovered from the infection. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that GZ08-18 replicated to a higher titer in mouse lungs, induced more prominent lung pathology, and resulted in higher expression levels of a number of key pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ, MIP-1α, and TNF-α in comparison to that of GZ08-0. The cyclophosphamide pretreatment rendered the mice more susceptible to a lethal outcome with less rounds of virus inoculation. Full genome sequencing revealed 17 mutations in GZ08-18, some of which might account for the dramatically increased pathogenicity over GZ08-0. In addition, by using ribavirin as a positive control, we demonstrated the potential application of this lethal mouse model as a tool in HRSV investigations. Overall, we have successfully established a practical lethal mouse model for HRSV with a mouse-adapted virus, which may facilitate future in vivo studies on the evaluation of candidate vaccines and drugs against HRSV. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","antivirus agent; cyclophosphamide; gamma interferon; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; ribavirin; tumor necrosis factor; virus vaccine; antivirus agent; cyclophosphamide; ribavirin; animal experiment; animal model; antiviral therapy; Article; gene mutation; HEp-2 cell line; histopathology; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vivo study; inoculation; lung lavage; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory syncytial virus infection; virus culture; virus isolation; virus replication; virus strain; whole genome sequencing; aging; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell line; disease model; Human respiratory syncytial virus; lung; mortality; mutation; pathogenicity; pathology; physiology; respiratory syncytial virus infection; virology; virus genome; Aging; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Cell Line; Cyclophosphamide; Disease Models, Animal; Genome, Viral; Humans; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mutation; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Ribavirin; Virus Replication"
"Left and Right Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Functional Reserves Are Impaired in Anthracycline-Treated Long-Term Survivors of Childhood Cancers",2019,"Background: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functional reserves are altered in anthracycline-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancers. Methods: One hundred three survivors (55% men) aged 25.0 ± 5.8 years at 15.2 ± 5.8 years after chemotherapy and 61 healthy control subjects (52% men) were studied. Tissue Doppler–derived mitral and tricuspid systolic (s) and early diastolic (e) velocities and LV myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction (IVA) were determined at rest and during bicycle exercise. The slope of the LV force-frequency relationship was derived from changes in IVA with heart rate during exercise (ΔIVA/Δ[heart rate]). LV and RV functional reserves were further assessed by the systolic functional reserve index (Δs × [1 ? 1/s at baseline]) and diastolic functional reserve index (Δe × [1 ? 1/e at baseline]). Results: At baseline, mitral annular tissue Doppler indices were similar between survivors and control subjects (P >.05 for all), while tricuspid s and e velocities were significantly lower in survivors (P <.05 for both). The force-frequency relationship slope (P <.001), LV systolic functional reserve index (P <.001), and RV systolic functional reserve index (P =.001) were significantly lower in survivors than control subjects. For diastolic functional reserve, LV but not RV diastolic functional reserve index was significantly lower in survivors (P <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed survivor status (β = ?0.39, P <.001) and baseline LV IVA (β = 0.15, P <.044) as significant determinants of the LV force-frequency relationship. Conclusions: LV and RV functional reserves during exercise are impaired in anthracycline-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer. ? 2018 American Society of Echocardiography","anthracycline; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular parameters; childhood cancer survivor; controlled study; diastolic velocity; exercise; female; functional reserve index; heart contraction; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; human; isovolumic contraction; left ventricular force frequency relationship; left ventricular myocardial acceleration; long term survival; major clinical study; male; systolic velocity; ventricular diastolic functional reserve impairment; ventricular systolic functional reserve impairment"
"Establishment of porcine and human expanded potential stem cells",2019,"We recently derived mouse expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) from individual blastomeres by inhibiting the critical molecular pathways that predispose their differentiation. EPSCs had enriched molecular signatures of blastomeres and possessed developmental potency for all embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages. Here, we report the derivation of porcine EPSCs, which express key pluripotency genes, are genetically stable, permit genome editing, differentiate to derivatives of the three germ layers in chimeras and produce primordial germ cell-like cells in vitro. Under similar conditions, human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can be converted, or somatic cells directly reprogrammed, to EPSCs that display the molecular and functional attributes reminiscent of porcine EPSCs. Importantly, trophoblast stem-cell-like cells can be generated from both human and porcine EPSCs. Our pathway-inhibition paradigm thus opens an avenue for generating mammalian pluripotent stem cells, and EPSCs present a unique cellular platform for translational research in biotechnology and regenerative medicine. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","article; biotechnology; chimera; embryo; gene editing; gene expression; germ layer; human; human cell; human embryonic stem cell; in vitro study; induced pluripotent stem cell; nonhuman; pig; primordial germ cell; regenerative medicine; somatic cell; translational research; trophoblast; animal; blastoma; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cytology; embryonic stem cell; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mouse; nuclear reprogramming; pig; pluripotent stem cell; signal transduction; Animals; Blastomeres; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cellular Reprogramming; Embryonic Stem Cells; Germ Layers; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Mice; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Regenerative Medicine; Signal Transduction; Swine; Trophoblasts"
"Emergency Use of Branched Thoracic Endovascular Repair in the Treatment of Aortic Arch Pathologies",2019,"Background: Branched thoracic endovascular aortic repair (b-TEVAR)has revolutionized the treatment of aortic arch pathologies. However, b-TEVAR requires custom design and time for manufacturing, which limits its use in emergency situation. Methods: We retrospectively studied a series of 11 patients, who underwent emergency b-TEVAR in our institution. Stent grafts were either already available for the patient or from another patient with similar anatomy. Study endpoints were technical success, 30-day mortality, perioperative complications, early reinterventions, and subsequent image follow-up. Results: Between December 2012 and December 2017, 11 patients (5 male; age 67 ± 14 years)were treated emergently with b-TEVAR for type A dissection (n = 2), peripheral malperfusion despite ascending repair in type A dissection (n = 1), contained ruptured ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm (n = 2), symptomatic arch aneurysm (n = 4), and ruptured subclavian aneurysm (n = 2). Three patients received their personal custom-made endografts but were hospitalized and treated urgently because of new symptom onset; the remaining 8 patients were treated with endografts from other patients. Technical success was 100%. Thirty-day mortality was 9% (1 of 11). Perioperative complications included one major stroke (9%), one sepsis (9%), two respiratory failures (18%), one acute renal injury (9%), and one retroperitoneal hematoma (9%). There were five (45%)early reinterventions. With median 6 months (range, 1 to 28)of follow-up, 2 patients had persistent false lumen perfusion, whereas all supraaortic branches remained patent. Conclusions: Our experience provided an early insight to the feasibility and safety of b-TEVAR in an emergency situation, although the early reintervention rate was not negligible. The endograft was versatile, with potential off-the-shelf use in future. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","adult; aged; aortic aneurysm; aortic arch aneurysm; aortic disease; aortic dissection; aortic rupture; Article; branched thoracic endovascular aortic repair; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; emergency surgery; endoleak; endovascular aneurysm repair; false aneurysm; female; human; kidney injury; male; medical device complication; middle aged; pericardial effusion; peroperative complication; priority journal; respiratory failure; retroperitoneal hematoma; retrospective study; sepsis; subclavian artery; very elderly; aortic disease; emergency treatment; endovascular surgery; procedures; thoracic aorta; Aged; Aorta, Thoracic; Aortic Diseases; Emergency Treatment; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies"
"An empirical review of anonymity effects in peer assessment, peer feedback, peer review, peer evaluation and peer grading",2019,"Peer assessment has proven to have positive learning outcomes. Importantly, peer assessment is a social process and some claim that the use of anonymity might have advantages. However, the findings have not always been in the same direction. Our aims were: (a) to review the effects of using anonymity in peer assessment on performance, peer feedback content, peer grading accuracy, social effects and students’ perspective on peer assessment; and (b) to investigate the effects of four moderating variables (educational level, peer grading, assessment aids, direction of anonymity) in relation to anonymity. A literature search was conducted including five different terms related to peer assessment (e.g., peer feedback) and anonymity. Fourteen studies that used a control group or a within group design were found. The narrative review revealed that anonymous peer assessment seems to provide advantages for students’ perceptions about the learning value of peer assessment, delivering more critical peer feedback, increased self-perceived social effects, a slight tendency for more performance, especially in higher education and with less peer assessment aids. Some conclusions are that: (a) when implementing anonymity in peer assessment the instructional context and goals need to be considered, (b) existent empirical research is still limited, and (c) future research should employ stronger and more complex research designs. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"The longitudinal decline of white matter microstructural integrity in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and its association with executive function",2019,"The longitudinal decline in the integrity of several white matter (WM) tracts in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) has been documented. However, there is yet a clear relationship between this decline and that of executive function (EF), for the WM changes to meaningfully track progression in bvFTD. We sought to validate the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in tracking the progression of bvFTD with its associated decline in EF. Baseline and 1-year follow-up DTI scans were acquired from 23 patients with bvFTD and 26 healthy controls. EF composite score was derived via multiple tests. The longitudinal changes in DTI metrics were examined in both groups. Then, among patients (N = 18), we examined the associations between these changes and that of EF. Widespread WM alterations and decline in EF were observed only in patients. This EF decline was mostly associated with the disrupted integrity of the corpus callosum and anterior corona radiata. These longitudinal findings support the use of DTI in tracking the progression of bvFTD and its associated EF decline. ? 2019 The Authors","adult; Article; clinical article; cognitive function test; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; disease association; disease course; executive function; female; frontal variant frontotemporal dementia; genu (corpus callosum); human; image processing; male; neuroimaging; priority journal; splenium; white matter; aged; behavior; corpus callosum; diagnostic imaging; executive function; follow up; frontotemporal dementia; middle aged; pathology; physiology; psychology; time factor; white matter; Aged; Behavior; Corpus Callosum; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Executive Function; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Frontotemporal Dementia; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Time Factors; White Matter"

"Plasma Fibronectin Levels Identified via Quantitative Proteomics Profiling Predicts Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Seroclearance in Chronic Hepatitis B",2019,"BACKGROUND: Seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a potentially achievable target of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Plasma proteins relevant to HBsAg seroclearance remain undetermined. METHODS: We prospectively recruited treatment-naive CHB patients with spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance and matched HBsAg-positive controls. Plasma protein profiling was performed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based proteomics, with the expression of candidate proteins validated in a separate cohort. The predictive value of fibronectin was assessed at 3 years, 1 year (Year -1) before, and at the time (Year 0) of HBsAg seroclearance. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-seven plasma proteins were identified via proteomics, with 97 proteins showing altered expression. In the verification cohort (n = 90), median plasma fibronectin levels in patients with HBsAg seroclearance was higher than in controls (P = .009). In the longitudinal cohort (n = 164), patients with HBsAg seroclearance, compared with controls, had a higher median fibronectin levels at Year -1 (413.26 vs 227.95 ?g/mL) and Year 0 (349.45 vs 208.72 ?g/mL) (both P < .001). In patients with an annual HBsAg log reduction >0.5, Year -1 fibronectin level achieved an area under the receiving operator characteristic of 0.884 in predicting HBsAg seroclearance. CONCLUSIONS: Using proteomics-based technology, plasma fibronectin may be associated with HBsAg seroclearance and a potential predictor of ""functional cure"". ? The Author(s) 2019.

"Dose-response associations of cardiorespiratory fitness with all-cause mortality and incidence and mortality of cancer and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases: The UK Biobank cohort study",2019,"Objective: To investigate the association of cardiorespiratory fitness with all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cancer mortality and incidence. Design: Prospective population-based study. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: Of the 5 02 628 (5.5% response rate) participants recruited by UK Biobank, we included 73 259 (14.6%) participants with available data in this analysis. Of these, 1374 participants died and 4210 developed circulatory diseases, 1293 respiratory diseases and 4281 cancer, over a median of 5.0 years (IQR 4.3-5.7) follow-up. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality and circulatory disease, respiratory disease, COPD and cancer (such as colorectal, lung, breast and prostate) mortality/incidence. Fitness was estimated using a submaximal cycle ergometer test. Results: The HR for all-cause mortality for each metabolic equivalent of task (MET) higher fitness was 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.98). Similar results were observed for incident circulatory disease (HR 0.96 [0.95 to 0.97]), respiratory disease (HR 0.96 [0.94 to 0.98]), COPD (HR 0.90 [0.86 to 0.95) and colorectal cancer (HR 0.96 [0.92 to 1.00]). Nonlinear analysis revealed that a high level of fitness (>10METs) was associated with a greater incidence of atrial fibrillation (HR 1.24 [1.07 to 1.44]) and prostate cancer (HR 1.16 [1.02 to 1.32]) compared with average fitness. All results were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary factors, body composition, and morbidity at baseline and excluded events in the first 2 years of follow-up. Conclusions: Higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with lower risk of premature mortality and incidence of CVD, respiratory disease and colorectal cancer. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","adult; aged; cardiorespiratory fitness; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; epidemiology; female; human; incidence; male; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; prospective study; respiratory tract disease; United Kingdom; Adult; Aged; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiratory Tract Diseases; United Kingdom"
"Quality of sweatshop factory outdoor environments matters for workers’ stress and anxiety: A participatory smartphone-photography survey",2019,"Stress and anxiety are pervasive mental health problems in “sweatshop” manufacturing factories, leading to depression, violence, and suicide. Previous studies ascribed workers’ mental health problems to social-demographic and employment factors. Few have explored whether, and to what extent, the outdoor environment impacts workers’ stress and anxiety status. Without this understanding, we lose the opportunity to create evidence-based environmental interventions that promote mental health for tens of millions of sweatshop workers worldwide. This participatory smartphone-photography survey (PSPS) study focuses on a large manufacturing factory in China where many suicides have occurred. 79 factory workers photographed 237 outdoor factory sites and then answered questions about the environmental qualities of the photographed sites, as well as their stress and anxiety status. After controlling for sociodemographic and employment factors, the regression analysis shows environmental factors collectively were significantly associated with workers’ stress and anxiety status, and several specific environmental factors showed a significant association. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Increasing socioeconomic disparities in sedentary behaviors in Chinese children",2019,"Background: Sedentary behaviors are prevalent in Chinese children, however, the studies on their trends and socioeconomic disparities are scarce. We examined the time trends of daily television (TV) viewing and video game playing and the associated socioeconomic factors in Chinese children in Hong Kong, the most developed and westernized city in China. Methods: In a panel data study involving 538,300 primary four and 510,294 primary six students from 1999/2000 to 2008/09, data on socioeconomic status, sedentary behaviors (TV viewing and video game playing) and other lifestyle habits were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Trends in sedentary behaviors over time were assessed. Their socioeconomic disparities were examined by interactions in generalized estimating equations with the adjustment for weight status and extracurricular physical activities. Results: The age and sex-standardized prevalence of ?2 h daily TV viewing decreased from 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51.1-51.8%) in 1999/2000 to 43.8% (95% CI 43.4-44.2%) in 2008/09 (P for trend < 0.001), whereas that of ?1 h daily video game playing increased from 8.2% (95% CI 7.9-8.4%) to 22.4% (95% CI 22.0-22.7%). Both sedentary behaviors were more prevalent in boys than girls, but the disparities decreased over time (Ratio of odds ratio [ROR] = 0.996 and 0.924 for TV viewing and video game playing, respectively). In contrast, both sedentary behaviors were increasingly more prevalent in children whose parents had lower education levels or non-managerial/professional occupations (ROR 1.006-1.082). Conclusions: Children in lower socioeconomic families in Hong Kong were increasingly at risk of having sedentary behaviors over years and thus deserve more attention. Effective strategies targeting children and/or their parents of lower socioeconomic status are needed to reduce sedentary behaviors. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; attention; child; China; controlled study; education; female; girl; habit; health disparity; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; occupation; physical activity; prevalence; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; social status; socioeconomics; student; television viewing; video game; child behavior; epidemiology; psychology; statistics and numerical data; television; time factor; video game; Child; Child Behavior; Female; Health Status Disparities; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Sedentary Behavior; Socioeconomic Factors; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Television; Time Factors; Video Games"
"Monitoring and Treatment of Patients Undergoing Immunotherapy With Anti-CD20 Who are Exposed to HBV",2019,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a potentially fatal complication of immunosuppressive therapy, and can occur in individuals who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative but positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). While anti-HBc positivity indicates prior HBV exposure, it may also reflect clearance of HBsAg, but with viral persistence at low intrahepatic replicative and transcriptional levels.1 HBV reactivation can still occur during intense immunosuppression, including B cell–depleting therapy with anti-CD20 antibodies2 and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.3 While prevention via antiviral prophylaxis is recommended, it remains uncertain, from a global perspective, if this is an ideal and cost-effective strategy. An alternative is regular HBV DNA monitoring.4 However, this approach is problematic in resource-constrained regions, where the logistics of sample collection, transportation, and molecular analysis in dedicated facilities poses challenges.5 We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of simple monitoring strategies using routine liver biochemistry and serum HBsAg in preventing HBV-related complications during anti-CD20 therapy. ? 2019 AGA Institute","alanine aminotransferase; CD20 antibody; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; obinutuzumab; rituximab; virus DNA; adult; aged; blood level; clinical effectiveness; exposure; follow up; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunotherapy; lymphoma; major clinical study; patient monitoring; prospective study; Short Survey; virus reactivation"
"Quitting smoking in mainland China: A new role for hospital-based nurses",2019,"China has more than 300 million cigarette smokers and 1 million deaths every year attributed to smoking. Despite its huge economic implications, the lack of smoking and associated lifestyle-related data on China's outpatients makes it difficult for health care professionals to provide individualized assessments and targeted interventions. This study aimed to identify factors to inform nurse-led smoking behavioral assessments and cessation interventions. Clinical data from new patients attending the family medicine outpatient department from a large tertiary hospital in a major Southern China city were collected between March and December 2015. Data including basic demographics, medical history, vaccination history, current medication, and information on lifestyle risk factors were collected by frontline nurses during nursing assessment on their initial visit. Chi-square and Student's t tests were used as univariate analysis and post hoc regression analysis to explore which factors contributed toward smoking cessation. Of 7913 eligible visits, smokers and ex-smokers accounted for 13.5% and 2.4% of new patients, respectively, with a majority of them being young and male (gender ratio of 8:1) smokers. Multiple behavioral risks and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus in smokers were common; for example, 17.9% of smokers were also current drinkers, making alcohol users 8.5 to 16.7 times more likely to have smoked. Ex-smokers were more likely to be divorced, to be ex-drinkers, or to have higher diastolic blood pressure and concurrent hypertension. Smoking and associated lifestyle risk assessments run by registered nurses should be incorporated into current outpatient health histories and in targeted smoking cessation intervention programs. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","adult; China; female; human; male; middle aged; nurse; nurse attitude; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; risk reduction; smoking cessation; statistics and numerical data; Adult; China; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurse's Role; Nurses; Risk Reduction Behavior; Smoking Cessation; Surveys and Questionnaires"

"Long-Term Survival Outcome Between Living Donor and Deceased Donor Liver Transplant for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Intention-to-Treat and Propensity Score Matching Analyses",2019,"Background: Previous studies comparing outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) showed conflicting results, and most studies measured survival outcomes from the time of liver transplantation (LT). Method: This retrospective study was aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of HCC patients listed for LT using intention-to-treat (ITT) and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses. Clinicopathological data were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. Results: From 1995 to 2014, 375 HCC patients were listed for LT. ITT-LDLT group had 188 patients, whereas ITT-DDLT group had 187 patients. Twenty-seven patients (14.4%) and 122 patients (65.2%) were delisted from LDLT and DDLT waitlist, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were significantly better in ITT-LDLT group than ITT-DDLT group (94.1 vs. 77.5%, 81.4 vs. 48.7% and 75.9 vs. 40.8%). High alphafetoprotein (AFP) and ITT-DDLT treatment arm were independent poor prognostic factors affecting overall survival. LDLT group (n = 161) had more young patients, poorer liver function, higher AFP, more tumors outside Milan/UCSF criteria, when compared with DDLT group (n = 85). After PSM, the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall (95.4 vs. 98.5%, 80.0 vs. 92.3% and 73.4 vs. 84.4%) and recurrence-free (87.7% vs. 90.8%, 76.9% vs. 83.1% and 72.2% vs. 81.5%) survival rates were comparable between the matched LDLT and the matched DDLT group, respectively. Conclusion: Survival benefit of LDLT was observed for HCC patients with ITT analysis. Despite a more advanced tumor stage, overall and recurrence-free survival rates were comparable between LDLT and DDLT using PSM analysis. ? 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","alpha fetoprotein; basiliximab; cyclosporine; everolimus; hydrocortisone; mammalian target of rapamycin; mycophenolate mofetil; rapamycin; steroid; tacrolimus; abdominal abscess; abdominal bleeding; adult; Article; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical evaluation; comparative study; deceased donor; female; follow up; histopathology; human; human tissue; intention to treat analysis; kidney failure; liver cell carcinoma; liver function; liver graft; living donor; long term survival; major clinical study; male; opportunistic infection; outcome assessment; overall survival; postoperative complication; propensity score; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; survival rate; time to treatment; tumor differentiation; aged; cadaver; intention to treat analysis; liver cell carcinoma; liver transplantation; liver tumor; living donor; middle aged; mortality; pathology; propensity score; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Cadaver; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intention to Treat Analysis; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Living Donors; Male; Middle Aged; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"
"Novel developments of hepatitis B: treatment goals, agents and monitoring tools",2019,"Introduction: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality and hence should be a target for global elimination. In recent years, advances have been made in understanding the disease pathophysiology and the relationship to clinical outcome. Novel treatment targets are actively being sought in the hope of improving the treatment outlook. Areas covered: We discussed the cascade of cure of CHB with respect to the degree of persistence of viral genome and proteins. Several novel antiviral agents either targeting the virus or the host are in different clinical phases of development. Serum hepatitis B core-related antigen and HBV RNA are novel markers, which might have a role in the prediction of specific clinical outcomes such as development of hepatocellular carcinoma or virological relapse after cessation of antiviral therapy. These markers may also be used to monitor treatment response in the drug trials. Expert commentary: Global elimination of CHB is challenged by extremely low awareness of illness and poor access to care. CHB and its related complications can be reduced by birth dose vaccine, antiviral therapy, and alleviated by complication screening. Treatment options for CHB will expand in the next decade and early functional cure is not an impractical goal. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antiviral therapy; chronic hepatitis B; clinical outcome; comprehension; drug targeting; high income country; human; immune reconstitution; liver cell carcinoma; liver transplantation; long term care; low income country; morbidity; mortality; mortality rate; nonhuman; Review; risk factor; risk reduction; RNA interference; screening test; secondary prevention; seroconversion; treatment response; virus genome; World Health Organization; animal; blood; chronic hepatitis B; health care delivery; molecularly targeted therapy; pathophysiology; treatment outcome; virology; antivirus agent; biological marker; hepatitis B core antigen; virus RNA; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; Health Services Accessibility; Hepatitis B Core Antigens; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; RNA, Viral; Treatment Outcome"
"Lung cancer risk by geologic coal deposits: A case–control study of female never-smokers from Xuanwei and Fuyuan, China",2019,"Coal types vary around the world because of geochemical differences in their source deposits; however, the influence of coal emissions from different deposits on human health remains unexplored. To address this issue, we conducted the first study of the relationship between coal use from various deposits and lung cancer risk in Xuanwei and Fuyuan, counties in China where lung cancer rates are among the highest in the world among female never-smokers due to use of bituminous (“smoky”) coal for heating and cooking. We conducted a population-based case–control study of 1031 lung cancer cases and 493 controls among never-smoking women in Xuanwei and Fuyuan. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between coal use from various deposits across the lifecourse and lung cancer risk. There was substantial heterogeneity in risks by coal deposit (p = 7.8E-05). Compared to non-smoky coal users, risks by smoky coal deposit ranged from OR = 7.49 (95% CI: 3.43–16.38) to OR = 33.40 (95% CI: 13.07–85.34). Further, women born into homes that used smoky coal and subsequently changed to non-smoky coal had a higher risk (OR = 10.83 (95% CI: 4.61–25.46)) than women born into homes that used non-smoky coal and changed to smoky coal (OR = 4.74 (95% CI: 2.03–11.04, p difference = 0.04)). Our study demonstrates that various sources of coal have considerably different impact on lung cancer in this population and suggests that early-life exposure to carcinogenic emissions may exert substantial influence on health risks later in life. These factors should be considered when evaluating the health risks posed by exposure to coal combustion emissions. ? 2018 UICC","coal; coal; adult; Article; cancer risk; case control study; China; combustion; confidence interval; controlled study; cooking; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; gas; geographic distribution; health hazard; heating; human; indoor air pollution; life event; logistic regression analysis; lung cancer; lung carcinogenesis; major clinical study; nonsmoker; odds ratio; population research; priority journal; women's health; classification; clinical trial; lung tumor; middle aged; multicenter study; smoke; statistical model; Air Pollution, Indoor; Case-Control Studies; China; Coal; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lung Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Smoke"
"Transfusion of pathogen-reduced platelet components without leukoreduction",2019,"BACKGROUND: Leukoreduction (LR) of platelet concentrate (PC) has evolved as the standard to mitigate risks of alloimmunization, clinical refractoriness, acute transfusion reactions (ATRs), and cytomegalovirus infection, but does not prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Amotosalen–ultraviolet A pathogen reduction (A-PR) of PC reduces risk of transfusion-transmitted infection and TA-GVHD. In vitro data indicate that A-PR effectively inactivates WBCs and infectious pathogens. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A sequential cohort study evaluated A-PR without LR, gamma irradiation, and bacterial screening in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. The first cohort received conventional PC (control) processed without LR, but with gamma irradiation and bacterial screening. The second cohort received A-PR PC (test) processed without: LR, bacterial screening, or gamma irradiation. The primary efficacy outcome was the 1-hour corrected count increment. The primary safety outcome was treatment-emergent ATR. Secondary outcomes included clinical refractoriness, and 100-day status for engraftment, TA-GVHD, HSCT-GVHD, infections, and mortality. RESULTS: Mean corrected count increment (× 103) of 33 test PC recipients was similar (18.9 ± 8.8 vs. 16.6 ± 8.4; p = 0.296) to that of 31 control PC recipients. Test recipients had a reduced, but nonsignificant, incidence of ATR (test = 9.1%, Control = 19.4%; p = 0.296). The frequencies of clinical refractoriness (0 of 33 vs. 4 of 31 patients) and refractory transfusions (6.6% vs. 19.3%) were lower in the test cohort (p = 0.05 and 0.02), respectively. No patient in either cohort had TA-GVHD. Day 100 engraftment, HSCT-GVHD, mortality, and infectious disease complications were similar between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that A-PR PC without LR, gamma irradiation, or bacterial screening is feasible for support of HSCT. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Progressive Increase of Inflammatory CXCR4 and TNF-Alpha in the Dorsal Root Ganglia and Spinal Cord Maintains Peripheral and Central Sensitization to Diabetic Neuropathic Pain in Rats",2019,"Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is a common and serious complication of diabetic patients. The pathogenesis of DNP is largely unclear. The proinflammation proteins, CXCR4, and TNF- play critical roles in the development of pain, while their relative roles in the development of DNP and especially its progression is unknown. We proposed that establishment of diabetic pain models in rodents and evaluating the stability of behavioral tests are necessary approaches to better understand the mechanism of DNP. In this study, Von Frey and Hargreaves Apparatus was used to analyze the behavioral changes of mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at different phases of diabetes. Moreover, CXCR4 and TNF- of spinal cord dorsal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were detected by western blotting and immunostaining over time. The values of paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latencies (PWL) were reduced as early as 1 week in diabetic rats and persistently maintained at lower levels during the progression of diabetes as compared to control rats that were concomitant with significant increases of both CXCR4 and TNF- protein expressions in the DRG at 2 weeks and 5 weeks (the end of the experiments) of diabetes. By contrast, CXCR4 and TNF- in the spinal cord dorsal horn did not significantly increase at 2 weeks of diabetes while both were significantly upregulated at 5 weeks of diabetes. The results indicate that central sensitization of spinal cord dorsal may result from persistent peripheral sensitization and suggest a potential reference for further treatment of DNP. ? 2019 Dan Zhu et al.","chemokine receptor CXCR4; streptozocin; tumor necrosis factor; chemokine receptor CXCR4; Cxcr4 protein, rat; tumor necrosis factor; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; behavior change; comparative study; diabetes mellitus; disease exacerbation; dorsal root; heat hyperalgesia; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lumbar spinal cord; mechanical allodynia; neuropathic pain; nonhuman; pain threshold; paw withdrawal latency; protein expression; rat; sensitization; spinal cord; spinal cord dorsal horn; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; diabetic neuropathy; disease model; experimental diabetes mellitus; hyperalgesia; metabolism; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; spinal cord; spinal ganglion; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetic Neuropathies; Disease Models, Animal; Ganglia, Spinal; Hyperalgesia; Rats; Receptors, CXCR4; Signal Transduction; Spinal Cord; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
"Association of genetically predicted testosterone with thromboembolism, heart failure, and myocardial infarction: Mendelian randomisation study in UK Biobank",2019,"Objective: To determine whether endogenous testosterone has a causal role in thromboembolism, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Design: Two sample mendelian randomisation study using genetic variants as instrumental variables, randomly allocated at conception, to infer causality as additional randomised evidence. Setting: Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) randomised controlled trial, UK Biobank, and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes based genome wide association study. Participants: 3225 men of European ancestry aged 50-75 in REDUCE; 392 038 white British men and women aged 40-69 from the UK Biobank; and 171 875 participants of about 77% European descent, from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes based study for validation. Main outcome measures: Thromboembolism, heart failure, and myocardial infarction based on self reports, hospital episodes, and death. Results: Of the UK Biobank participants, 13 691 had thromboembolism (6208 men, 7483 women), 1688 had heart failure (1186, 502), and 12 882 had myocardial infarction (10 136, 2746). In men, endogenous testosterone genetically predicted by variants in the JMJD1C gene region was positively associated with thromboembolism (odds ratio per unit increase in log transformed testosterone (nmol/L) 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 3.46) and heart failure (7.81, 2.56 to 23.8), but not myocardial infarction (1.17, 0.78 to 1.75). Associations were less obvious in women. In the validation study, genetically predicted testosterone (based on JMJD1C gene region variants) was positively associated with myocardial infarction (1.37, 1.03 to 1.82). No excess heterogeneity was observed among genetic variants in their associations with the outcomes. However, testosterone genetically predicted by potentially pleiotropic variants in the SHBG gene region had no association with the outcomes. Conclusions: Endogenous testosterone was positively associated with thromboembolism, heart failure, and myocardial infarction in men. Rates of these conditions are higher in men than women. Endogenous testosterone can be controlled with existing treatments and could be a modifiable risk factor for thromboembolism and heart failure. ? 2019 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","dutasteride; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; testosterone; adult; aged; Article; biobank; British citizen; controlled study; death; disease association; European; female; gene; genetic analysis; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; heart failure; heart infarction; hormone action; human; JMJD1C gene; major clinical study; male; Mendelian randomization analysis; pathophysiology; pleiotropy; priority journal; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial (topic); self report; sex difference; SHBG gene; testosterone blood level; thromboembolism; United Kingdom; validation study; Caucasian; genetic variation; genetics; heart failure; heart infarction; middle aged; odds ratio; physiology; risk factor; thromboembolism; Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Odds Ratio; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Testosterone; Thromboembolism; United Kingdom"
"A multiethnic meta-analysis defined the association of rs12946942 with severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis",2019,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common type of scoliosis. Controlling its curve progression is the most important clinical task. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified several susceptibility loci associated with the development of AIS, the etiology of curve progression has been still unknown. Our previous GWAS has identified that rs12946942 showed significant association with severe AIS. To confirm the association, we conducted an international meta-analysis using four cohorts with different ethnicity. We analyzed 2272 severe AIS cases and 13,859 controls in total, and found the replication of significant association of rs12946942 (combined P = 7.23×10 ?13 ; odds ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.25?1.49). In silico analyses suggested that SOX9 is the most likely susceptibility gene for AIS curve progression in the locus. ? 2019, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Human Genetics.","adolescent; adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Article; disease severity; ethnicity; gene locus; genetic association; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; genotype; Hong Kong; human; meta analysis; Scandinavia; ethnology; female; genetic polymorphism; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; male; scoliosis; SOX9 protein, human; transcription factor Sox9; Adolescent; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Genetic; Scoliosis; SOX9 Transcription Factor"
"Treatment Status of Elderly Patients With Severe Mental Disorders in Rural China",2019,"This study was performed to compare the treatment status between older (?65 years) and younger adults (18-64 years) with severe mental illness (SMI) and explore factors associated with treatment status in rural China. Persons with SMI were identified in one mental health survey in 2015 in 6 townships of Xinjin County, Chengdu, China. Logistic regressions were conducted to explore factors associated with treatment status. Older adults with SMI, especially major depressive disorder, reported significantly lower rates of treatment than younger group. Older age, longer duration of illness, and poor mental status were risk factors for never-treated status in these patients. Never-treated status (46.3%) and poor treatment status in these older patients are serious issues. Different treatment statuses in these patients had various influencing factors. It is crucial to develop culture-specific, community-based mental health services to improve early identification, diagnosis, treatment, and recovery of older adults with SMI in rural China. ?

"A black phosphorus/manganese dioxide nanoplatform: Oxygen self-supply monitoring, photodynamic therapy enhancement and feedback",2019,"Selecting the timing of laser treatment is an important task for improving O2-dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficiency. Here, a black phosphorus-based strategy was developed for dual-mode monitoring oxygen self-supply, enhancing photodynamic therapy, and feeding back therapeutic effect. The hybridized nanoplatform (R-MnO2-FBP) was prepared by assembly of Rhodamine B (RhB)-encapsulated manganese dioxide (R-MnO2) as O2 supplier and indicator, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled peptide-functionalized black phosphorus as the theranostic agent. The time-dependent assays suggested that the O2 release was proportional to the liberation of Mn2+ and RhB in the R-MnO2-FBP system. After specific delivery into cancer cells, R-MnO2-FBP was dissociated in the acidic and H2O2-rich environment and generated oxygen to overcome hypoxia-associated PDT resistance. In the meantime, it released both Mn2+and RhB dye, leading to dual-mode (magnetic resonance imaging/fluorescence imaging) monitoring of the oxygen self-supply process. More significantly, the imaging-guided PDT in hypoxic cells displayed 51.6% of cell apoptosis at optimizing timing of laser application, which could also be confirmed by the FITC fluorescence recovery induced by the activated caspase-3 in apoptotic cells.

Every year, seasonal influenza epidemics lead to substantial hospitalizations and pose intense pressure on blood transfusion service worldwide, especially in an ageing population of Hong Kong which often see bi-annual influenza outbreaks. However, limited quantitative studies have been performed to assess the impacts of influenza and other respiratory infections on blood supply. Methods: We estimated the impacts of respiratory infections on donor attendance and blood inventory, considering the confounding effects of weather conditions. The method only required influenza-like illness data from the existing sentinel surveillance network, local weather data, donor attendance records from blood transfusion service and blood inventory levels from local healthcare system. Results: We estimated the number of donor attendance dropped by 6–10% when the number of consultations with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) reported by sentinel general outpatient clinics exceeded five per 1000 consultations, which is a moderate activity level and has been observed frequently in Hong Kong. Blood inventory decreased with increased ILI consultation rates reported by sentinel general outpatient clinics. Adverse weather conditions had negative impacts on both donor attendance and blood inventory. Conclusion: Epidemics of influenza and other respiratory infections coupled with adverse weather conditions affected blood supply in Hong Kong. The pressure on blood transfusion service to maintain a stable and sufficient blood supply during influenza seasons should not be overlooked, especially in an ageing population of Hong Kong. ? 2019 International Society of Blood Transfusion","Article; blood; blood donor; blood inventory; blood transfusion; consultation; epidemic; flu like syndrome; health care system; Hong Kong; human; outpatient; priority journal; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract infection; retrospective study; season; sentinel surveillance; statistical analysis; weather; blood bank; blood donor; Hong Kong; hospitalization; influenza; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; Blood Banks; Blood Donors; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Humans; Influenza, Human; Seasons; Weather"
"Electromyography activity level in rapid eye movement sleep predicts neurodegenerative diseases in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder: a 5-year longitudinal study",2019,"Objectives: To investigate whether baseline electromyography (EMG)activity during rapid eye movement (REM)sleep predicts the development of neurodegenerative diseases over time in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). Methods: A total of 216 patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD were recruited from September 1997 to December 2016 with a mean follow-up duration of 5.0 ± 3.7 years (median: 4.0, range: 0.5–19.0). Neurodegenerative diseases were ascertained according to standard diagnostic criteria during follow-up. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curves were employed to evaluate the dynamic predictive performance of EMG activity over time. Both tonic and phasic EMG activity were dichotomized into ‘mild’ and ‘severe’ categories by the ROC curves estimated optimal cut-offs. Results: A total of 58 patients (26.9%)developed neurodegenerative diseases. The predictive performance of tonic EMG activity was stable (area under the curve of approximately 0.68)over time, while the performance of phasic EMG activity was significantly superior to chance only after five years of follow-up. The optimal cut-off for prediction at five years was 15.4% (sensitivity, 0.69; specificity, 0.57)and 7.8% (sensitivity, 0.79; specificity, 0.47)for tonic and phasic EMG activity, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses further revealed that severe tonic (adjusted HR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.35–5.62)and phasic EMG activity (adjusted HR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.10–8.71)were associated with early development of Parkinson's disease (PD)and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), respectively. Conclusions: Tonic but not phasic EMG activity may serve as a stable biomarkers for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in iRBD. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","age distribution; aged; Article; cognition assessment; controlled study; degenerative disease; dementia; diffuse Lewy body disease; disease course; electromyography; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; parasomnia; Parkinson disease; polysomnography; prediction; priority journal; proportional hazards model; REM sleep; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference"
"Effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells towards pancreatic lineage and pancreatic beta cell function",2019,"Animal and epidemiological studies demonstrated association of persistent exposure of TCDD, an endocrine disrupting chemical, to susceptibility of type 2 diabetes (T2D). High doses of TCDD were commonly employed in experimental animals to illustrate its diabetogenic effects. Data linking the epigenetic effects of low doses of TCDD on embryonic cells to T2D susceptibility risks is very limited. To address whether low dose exposure to TCDD would affect pancreatic development, hESCs pretreated with TCDD at concentrations similar to human exposure were differentiated towards pancreatic lineage cells, and their global DNA methylation patterns were determined. Our results showed that TCDD-treated hESCs had impaired pancreatic lineage differentiation potentials and altered global DNA methylation patterns. Four of the hypermethylated genes (PRKAG1, CAPN10, HNF-1B and MAFA) were validated by DNA bisulfite sequencing. PRKAG1, a regulator in the AMPK signaling pathway critical for insulin secretion, was selected for further functional study in the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1E cells. TCDD treatment induced PRKAG1 hypermethylation in hESCs, and the hypermethylation was maintained after pancreatic progenitor cells differentiation. Transient Prkag1 knockdown in the INS-1E cells elevated glucose stimulated insulin secretions (GSIS), possibly through mTOR signaling pathway. The current study suggested that early embryonic exposure to TCDD might alter pancreatogenesis, increasing the risk of T2D. ? 2019 The Authors","Alkylation; Animals; Cell culture; DNA; Endocrine disrupters; Gene encoding; Insulin; Methylation; Stem cells; GSIS; hESCs; PRKAG1; TCDD; Type-2 diabetes; Cell signaling; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; cell; diabetes; endocrine disruptor; health risk; pollution effect; pollution exposure; TCDD; AMPK signaling; animal cell; Article; CAPN10 gene; cell differentiation; cell function; cell lineage; concentration (parameter); controlled study; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; embryonic stem cell; exposure; gene; gene knockdown; HNF 1B gene; insulin release; MAFA gene; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; organogenesis; pancreas cell; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; PRKAG1 gene; rat; validation process; animal; cell differentiation; cell line; cytology; drug effect; embryonic stem cell; human; metabolism; pancreas islet beta cell; pollutant; toxicity; Animalia; Rattus; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; DNA Methylation; Embryonic Stem Cells; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Insulin Secretion; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Rats"
"Association between depression and subsequent peptic ulcer occurrence among older people living alone: A prospective study investigating the role of change in social engagement",2019,"Objective: To examine whether baseline depression predicts subsequent peptic ulcer disease (PUD)in older people living alone and whether social engagement plays a role in such an association. Methods: Between May 2010 and May 2015, 2, 850 older people living alone were recruited from eight Grade-A hospitals in the People's Republic of China and followed for up to 36 months. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to investigate how the incidence of PUD varied with depression and social engagement status. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were estimated to examine the association between depression and incidence of PUD and assess the role of social engagement in this relationship. Results: Kaplan–Meier curves indicated that the 36-month cumulative incidence of PUD was higher in depressed (10.1%)than non-depressed participants (5.3%). However, among the depressed participants, increased or continued social engagement reduced the incidence to 6.2% and 7.9%, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that baseline depression was associated with subsequent PUD development (hazard ratio [HR]= 2.520, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.525–3.356). The incidence of PUD was similar in non-depressed and depressed participants who reported increased (HR = 1.956, 95% CI: 0.913–3.374)or continued social engagement (HR = 1.827, 95% CI: 0.918–3.690)during the follow-up period. However, depressed participants who reported decreased (HR = 2.485, 95% CI: 1.459–3.295)or no social engagement (HR = 2.896, 95% CI: 1.817–4.228)were more likely to develop PUD than those without depression. Conclusions: Baseline depression was associated with subsequent incidence of PUD, but this association appears to be reduced by increased or continued social engagement. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","amoxicillin; clarithromycin; esomeprazole; omeprazole; aged; Article; China; depression; disease association; false negative result; female; follow up; functional status assessment; gastrointestinal endoscopy; geriatric depression scale short form; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; peptic ulcer; prospective study; senescence; social aspect; social behavior; social engagement"
"p53 Promotes chemoresponsiveness by regulating hexokinase II gene transcription and metabolic reprogramming in epithelial ovarian cancer",2019,"Metabolic reprogramming (including the Warburg effect) is a hallmark of cancer, yet the association between the altered metabolism and chemoresistance remains elusive. Hexokinase II (HKII) is a key metabolic enzyme and is upregulated in multiple cancers. In this study, we examined the impact of targeting metabolism via silencing of HKII on chemoresistance in ovarian cancer (OVCA). In addition, the regulatory molecular mechanism of tumor metabolism was examined using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in epithelial OVCA cell lines of various histological subtypes. We demonstrated that cisplatin (CDDP)-induced p53-mediated HKII downregulation is a determinant of chemosensitivity in OVCA. Silencing of HKII sensitized chemoresistant OVCA cells to apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. As a negative regulator, p53 suppressed HKII transcription by promoter binding and decreased glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key regulator of cell proliferation involved in Akt signaling axis. Our Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and molecular studies also revealed that PDK1, an upstream activator strongly correlates with HKII expression and regulates its metabolic activity. Finally, we demonstrated that the clinically approved drug metformin sensitizes chemoresistant OVCA cells to CDDP via PDK1-HKII pathway. Collectively, our data implicate that p53--PDK1-HKII axis is a central regulatory component of metabolism conferring chemoresistance in OVCA. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","6 phosphofructokinase; cisplatin; hexokinase; hexokinase ii; lactate dehydrogenase; metformin; proteasome; protein kinase B; protein p53; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase 2; unclassified drug; cisplatin; hexokinase; PDK1 protein, human; protein kinase B; protein p53; TP53 protein, human; aerobic glycolysis; Akt signaling; apoptosis; Article; cancer resistance; cancer survival; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; clinical outcome; controlled study; drug response; drug sensitization; female; gain of function mutation; gene expression profiling; gene knockdown; gene silencing; genetic transcription; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; loss of function mutation; ovary carcinoma; OVCA cell line; overall survival; priority journal; promoter region; protein content; protein degradation; drug effect; drug resistance; drug therapy; gene expression regulation; genetics; nuclear reprogramming; pathology; signal transduction; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Cell Proliferation; Cellular Reprogramming; Cisplatin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hexokinase; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Acetyl-Transferring) Kinase; Signal Transduction; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"
"Temporal patterns of driving fatigue and driving performance among male taxi drivers in Hong Kong: A driving simulator approach",2019,"This study uses a questionnaire survey and a driving simulator test to investigate the temporal patterns of variations in driving fatigue and driving performance in 50 male taxi drivers in Hong Kong. Each driver visited the laboratory three times: before, during, and after a working shift. The survey contained a demographic questionnaire and the Brief Fatigue Inventory. A following-braking simulator test session was conducted at two speeds (50 and 80 km/h) by each driver at each of his three visits, and the driver's performance in brake reaction, lane control, speed control, and steering control were recorded. A random-effects modeling approach was incorporated to address the unobserved heterogeneity caused by the repeated measures. In the results, a recovery effect and a lagging effect were defined for the driving fatigue and performance measures because their temporal patterns were concavely quadratic and had a 1-hour delay compared to the temporal patterns of occupied taxi trips and taxi crash risk in Hong Kong. Demographic variables, such as net income and driver age, also had significant effects on the measured driving fatigue and performance. Policies regarding taxi management and operation based on the modeling results are proposed to alleviate the taxi safety situation in Hong Kong and worldwide. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automobile drivers; Automobile simulators; Population statistics; Random processes; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Surveys; Taxicabs; Demographic variables; Driving fatigue; Driving performance; Driving simulator; Questionnaire surveys; Random effects model; Temporal pattern; Unobserved heterogeneity; Braking performance; adult; car; car driving; commercial phenomena; deceleration; fatigue; Hong Kong; human; male; middle aged; psychomotor performance; questionnaire; safety; traffic accident; young adult; Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Commerce; Deceleration; Fatigue; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychomotor Performance; Safety; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Is prostate specific antigen (PSA) density necessary in selecting prostate cancer patients for active surveillance and what should be the cutoff in the Asian population?",2019,"Background: To investigate the role of Prostate Specific Antigen density (PSAD) in selecting prostate cancer patients for active surveillance (AS) and to determine a cutoff PSAD in identifying adverse pathological outcomes. Methods: Data from 287 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Six different AS protocols, the University of Toronto; Royal Marsden; John Hopkins; University of California San Francisco (UCSF); Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS), were applied to the cohort. Pre-operative demographics and pathological outcomes were analysed. Statistical analyses on the predictive factors of adverse pathological outcomes and significance of PSAD were performed. A cutoff PSAD with best balance between sensitivity and specificity in identifying adverse pathological outcome was determined. Results: PSAD predicted adverse pathological outcomes better than Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level alone. The PSAD was significantly lower (0.12–0.13 ng/dl/ml) in protocols including PSAD (the John Hopkins and PRIAS) compared with the other four protocols not including PSAD as a selection criteria (0.21–0.25 ng/dl/dl, P = 0.00). PSAD predicted adverse pathological outcomes in all protocols not incorporating PSAD as an inclusion criteria (P = 0.00–0.02). By the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, it was found that a PSAD level of 0.19 ng/ml/ml had the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in predicting pathological adverse disease (Area under curve = 0.63, P = 0.004). Conclusion: PSAD is necessary in selecting prostate cancer patients for active surveillance. It predicts adverse pathological outcomes in patients eligible for active surveillance better than PSA level alone. A PSAD cutoff at 0.19 ng/ml/ml has the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in predicting pathological adverse disease. We recommend using AS protocol incorporating PSAD as a selection criteria (in particular the PRIAS protocol with a cutoff PSAD at 0.2 ng/ml/ml) when recruiting prostate cancer patients for AS. ? 2018","prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; Asian; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; disease surveillance; Gleason score; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; prostate volume; prostatectomy; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; transrectal ultrasonography; treatment outcome"
"Prevalence, Safety and Long-Term Retention Rates of Biologics in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2015",2019,"Background: Biologic agents were initially introduced as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but have since been used for other medical conditions. As new biologics become increasingly widespread in treatment regimens, it is important to understand their safety and utilization in the post-marketing context. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate long-term prescribing patterns and the safety of biologics in real clinical settings in Hong Kong. Methods: This was a population-based drug utilization study in Hong Kong using a territory-wide electronic medical database Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS). Patients who received biologic treatments from 2001 to 2015 were identified and their corresponding demographic and clinical details retrieved from CDARS. The annual prevalence of biologic prescriptions, the long-term retention rates and incidence rates of infections associated with biologic treatments were evaluated. Results: A total of 30,298 patients (male: 44%) prescribed biologic treatments were identified from CDARS from 2001 to 2015. The annual prevalence of biologic prescriptions increased from 0.1 to 16.1 per 100 persons for both sexes. Infliximab had the highest first-year retention rate of 95.6% among all biologics and continuously attained the highest retention rate from second to fifth year. The overall incidence rate of serious infections was less than five per 100 person-years. Specifically, the incidence rates of tuberculosis, upper and lower respiratory infections and herpes zoster were 0.52, 3.24, 4.99 and 1.01 per 100 person-years, respectively. Conclusion: This population-based study revealed an increasing prevalence of biologic prescribing. Results from the study described the long-term retention rates and incidence rates of serious infections of biologic treatments for all indications, and confirmed the safety of biologic treatments. Since this study provides an overview of all biologic utilization, further studies on cost effectiveness, safety and compliance of treatment in different patient groups are still warranted. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","abatacept; adalimumab; aflibercept; basiliximab; bevacizumab; biological product; cetuximab; denosumab; etanercept; golimumab; infliximab; palivizumab; panitumumab; ranibizumab; rituximab; thymocyte antibody; tocilizumab; trastuzumab; ustekinumab; adult; aged; arthralgia; Article; chronic kidney failure; cost effectiveness analysis; drug safety; drug utilization; female; health care personnel; herpes zoster; Hong Kong; human; infant; infection; infection risk; leukemia; lower respiratory tract infection; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; population research; prescription; priority journal; psoriasis; respiratory syncytial virus infection; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; treatment duration; tuberculosis; upper respiratory tract infection"
"A statistical measure for the skewness of X chromosome inactivation based on case-control design",2019,"Background: Skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI), which is a non-random process, is frequently observed in both healthy and affected females. Furthermore, skewed XCI has been reported to be related to many X-linked diseases. However, no statistical method is available in the literature to measure the degree of the skewness of XCI for case-control design. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods for such a task. Results: In this article, we first proposed a statistical measure for the degree of XCI skewing by using a case-control design, which is a ratio of two logistic regression coefficients after a simple reparameterization. Based on the point estimate of the ratio, we further developed three types of confidence intervals (the likelihood ratio, Fieller's and delta methods) to evaluate its variation. Simulation results demonstrated that the likelihood ratio method and the Fieller's method have more accurate coverage probability and more balanced tail errors than the delta method. We also applied these proposed methods to analyze the Graves' disease data for their practical use and found that rs3827440 probably undergoes a skewed XCI pattern with 68.7% of cells in heterozygous females having the risk allele T active, while the other 31.3% of cells keeping the normal allele C active. Conclusions: For practical application, we suggest using the Fieller's method in large samples due to the non-iterative computation procedure and using the LR method otherwise for its robustness despite its slightly heavy computational burden. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Disease control; Genes; Higher order statistics; Random processes; Case-control; Confidence interval; Coverage probabilities; Likelihood ratio method; Logistic regressions; Skewness; Statistical measures; X-chromosome inactivation; Iterative methods; allele; case control study; female; genetics; heterozygote; human; statistical model; X chromosomal inheritance; X chromosome; X chromosome inactivation; Alleles; Case-Control Studies; Chromosomes, Human, X; Female; Genes, X-Linked; Heterozygote; Humans; Models, Statistical; X Chromosome Inactivation"
"Longitudinal evaluation of periodontitis and tooth loss among older adults",2019,"Aim: To evaluate pattern of change in periodontal variables and tooth loss in a twelve-year follow-up study of older adults living in Sweden. Methods: In a prospective population study of older adults, a clinical examination and radiographic dental examination were performed at baseline (2001–2003) and after 12?years (2013–2015). In 375 individuals, the number and proportion of sites with a distance ?4?mm and ?5?mm from cemento-enamel junction to the bone level, the number and proportion of teeth with pockets ?5?mm and number of teeth lost were calculated. Dental caries was registered. Periodontitis was defined as having ?2 sites with ?5?mm distance from cemento-enamel junction to the marginal bone level and ?1 tooth with pockets ?5?mm. Results: A diagnosis of periodontitis was evident in 39% of the individuals, and 23% of the individuals lost ?3 teeth over the study period. The proportion of sites with ?4?mm and ?5?mm bone loss increased with age, while the proportion of teeth with pockets remained stable. Periodontitis was the strongest predictor for losing ?3 teeth, OR 2.9 (p?'.001) in the final model.

"Ciliochoroidal detachment after Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation: A retrospective study",2019,"Background: To investigate the occurrence of ciliochoroidal detachment (CCD), its risk factors and its impact on the success rate after Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study carried out at Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China. Patients with uncontrolled glaucoma who underwent AGV implantation alone or combined with phacoemulsification (AGV-Phaco) in the hospital from April 1, 2013 to July 31, 2016 were included. The preoperative and postoperative CCD was defined when the detachment between ciliary body and choroid was detected by the ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) respectively. The main outcomes included the incidence of CCD and the success rate at 6 months after surgery. Results: In total, 97 male and 56 female patients were included. CCD was observed in 92 (57.8%) eyes. The glaucoma diagnosis in the Non-CCD and CCD group included primary open angle glaucoma (21(31.3%) vs 33(35.9%)), primary angle closure glaucoma (10(14.9%) vs 13(14.1%)), secondary glaucoma (25(37.3%) vs (28(30.4%)) and so on. The preoperative median IOP (interquartile range) were 21.7(16.0,32.0) mmHg and 23.0(16.0,33.0) mmHg in the Non-CCD group and CCD group. Previous surgical history (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 13.34; odds ratio (OR) 4.06; p = 0.02) and shorter axial length (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97 OR 0.78; p = 0.02) were the two risk factors of CCD. The success rate between the CCD and Non-CCD group was not significantly different (64.3% vs 62.5%, p = 0.86) at 6 months. Conclusions: The incidence of CCD is 57.8% after AGV surgery. Eyes with previous surgical procedure was prone to CCD occurrence and longer axial length was protective against CCD. But at 6 months postoperatively, CCD did not reduce the success rate of AGV surgery and may not be a worrisome complication. ? 2019 The Author(s).","acoustic microscopy; adult; adverse device effect; aged; choroid disease; ciliary body; eye axis length; female; glaucoma; glaucoma drainage implant; human; intraocular pressure; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; pathology; physiology; postoperative complication; retrospective study; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Axial Length, Eye; Choroid Diseases; Ciliary Body; Female; Glaucoma; Glaucoma Drainage Implants; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Logistic Models; Male; Microscopy, Acoustic; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tomography, Optical Coherence"
"Psychiatric problems among returned migrants in Mexico: updated findings from the Mexican Migration Project",2019,"Purpose: Migration is often a stressful process that can have deleterious effects on health. We study the potential mental health consequences of migration by comparing Mexican migrants to the United States who have since returned to Mexico with Mexicans who have never migrated. Methods: Data from the Mexican Migration Project were used to compare returned migrants and non-migrants in Mexico for the years 2007–2016 (N = 7716). Random intercept logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between characteristics of migration and psychiatric problems. Coarsened exact matching was implemented to account for the selection bias inherent to migration. Results: Relatively healthier Mexicans were more likely to migrate to the United States, regardless of their documentation status. Returned migrants in Mexico who traveled to the United States while undocumented were significantly more likely to report that they experienced psychiatric problems when compared with non-migrant Mexicans, even after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, pre-migration health, and community-level factors. Conclusions: Undocumented return migrants in Mexico are at-risk of developing psychiatric problems, despite evidence that suggests migrants tend to be healthier than non-migrants before they travel to the United States. Mental health services should encompass strategies for migrants on both sides of the border. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; ethnology; female; health status; human; male; mental disease; Mexico; migration; psychology; statistical model; undocumented immigrant; United States; Adult; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Disorders; Mexico; Transients and Migrants; Undocumented Immigrants; United States"
"Development and feasibility of a brief Zero-time Exercise intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour and enhance physical activity: A pilot trial",2019,"A brief intervention using Zero-time Exercise (ZTEx), a foot-in-the-door approach, was developed to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity. ZTEx refers to the integration of simple strength- and stamina-enhancing physical activity into daily life, which can be done anytime, anywhere and by anyone. This paper presents the development, feasibility, and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention under the Hong Kong Jockey Club FAMILY Project. Needs assessments were conducted with social workers from the?Christian Family Services Center(CFSC) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD). This single group prospective ZTEx intervention trial, guided by the Health Action Process Approach, included a 3-hr core session at baseline and a 1-hr booster session at 1-month follow-up. Fifty-six participants?(social and service-related workers) from CFSC (n?=?28) and SWD (n?=?28) received the intervention and completed the self-administered questionnaires at baseline. Forty-nine and 43 participants completed the 1-month and 3-month self-administered questionnaires, respectively. Fifteen participants attended the focus group interviews to share their feedback on ZTEx intervention after implementing their community-based ZTEx activities. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted with missing data replaced by baseline values. Participants reported significant decreases in sitting time by 27 (2, 52) minutes (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 36 (0.2, 71) minutes on a weekday, increases in physical activity while seated by 0.7 (0.2, 1.4) days and 1.1 (0.6, 1.7) days in a week, and improvements in perceived knowledge, outcome expectancies and plan on doing ZTEx at the 1-month and 3-month follow-up, respectively. Balance and muscle strength significantly improved at the 1-month follow-up. The effect ranged from small to large?(Cohen's d: 0.27–1.05, all p?<?0.05). The qualitative feedbacks support the quantitative findings. Our findings show early evidence that ZTEx effectively reduced sedentary behaviour and enhanced physical activity and fitness. Further trials on this simple and low-cost intervention as the first step to promote higher intensity exercise are warranted. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; article; controlled study; exercise; expectancy; family service; feasibility study; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; intervention study; interview; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; needs assessment; physical activity; prospective study; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; sedentary time; social welfare; social worker"
"Active Interest Mentorship for Soon-to-Retire People: A Self-Sustaining Retirement Preparation Program",2019,"Retirement is a major life transition that often leads to maladjustments and mental health hazards. In this study, we developed an innovative retirement preparation program, the Active Interest Mentorship Scheme (AIMS), which utilized active interest development as a positive entry point through which to engage soon-to-retire people. Each retiree received a 1-year mentorship 6 months before retirement. Adopting a quasi-experimental design, the study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the AIMS in protecting retirees’ well-being. The well-being status of 161 retirees was assessed at 4-month intervals. Measures included self-esteem, life satisfaction, positive affect, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Serial trend analysis revealed a general improvement in well-being at 4 months after mentorship, followed by a mark reversion in some variables at 2 months after retirement. Upon completion of the program, participants generally returned to a level of well-being that was comparable with or better than preretirement levels. The first 2 months after retirement appeared to be the most distressing. The findings support the efficacy, as well as feasibility of the innovative retirement preparation program. ?

"The association of depression following percutanous coronary intervention with adverse cardiovascular events: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Percutanous coronary intervention (PCI) has been increasingly used for patients suffered from severe coronary artery disease. However, physical trauma and potential adverse events related to the procedure often result in detrimental psychological stress. Accumulating evidences have shown that depression is closely related to coronary artery disease. However, the association of depression following percutanous coronary intervention with adverse cardiovascular events is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: This review is designed to assess the prognostic association of depression following PCI with adverse cardiac events. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following databases will be searched, PubMed, the EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science of English-language publications from inception to 30 October 2018. Cross-referencing from retrieved studies will be conducted additionally, and observational studies were included. Two independent review authors will do the study selection on the basis of the study eligibility criteria. Extracted data will be used for quantitative and qualitative evidence synthesis as well as to assess methodological quality of studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa checklist.

"RAB27A promotes melanoma cell invasion and metastasis via regulation of pro-invasive exosomes",2019,"Despite recent advances in targeted and immune-based therapies, advanced stage melanoma remains a clinical challenge with a poor prognosis. Understanding the genes and cellular processes that drive progression and metastasis is critical for identifying new therapeutic strategies. Here, we found that the GTPase RAB27A was overexpressed in a subset of melanomas, which correlated with poor patient survival. Loss of RAB27A expression in melanoma cell lines inhibited 3D spheroid invasion and cell motility in vitro, and spontaneous metastasis in vivo. The reduced invasion phenotype was rescued by RAB27A-replete exosomes, but not RAB27A-knockdown exosomes, indicating that RAB27A is responsible for the generation of pro-invasive exosomes. Furthermore, while RAB27A loss did not alter the number of exosomes secreted, it did change exosome size and altered the composition and abundance of exosomal proteins, some of which are known to regulate cancer cell movement. Our data suggest that RAB27A promotes the biogenesis of a distinct pro-invasive exosome population. These findings support RAB27A as a key cancer regulator, as well as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in melanoma. ? 2018 UICC","Ras related protein Rab 27A; RAB27A protein, human; Ras related protein Rab 27A; Article; biogenesis; cancer survival; cell invasion; cell motility; cell motion; cell size; controlled study; correlational study; exosome; gene knockdown; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; melanoma cell; melanoma cell line; metastasis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein depletion; protein expression; tumor invasion; tumor spheroid; animal; biosynthesis; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; conditioned medium; exosome; experimental melanoma; genetics; HEK293 cell line; melanoma; melanosome; metabolism; mouse; multicellular spheroid; nevus; pathology; physiology; proteomics; skin tumor; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Culture Media, Conditioned; Exosomes; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Melanoma; Melanoma, Experimental; Melanosomes; Mice; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Nevus; Proteomics; rab27 GTP-Binding Proteins; Skin Neoplasms; Spheroids, Cellular"
"A Community-Based Response to a Suicide Cluster: A Hong Kong Experience",2019,"Background: A 45-month community-based suicide prevention program was launched in response to the emergence of a suicide cluster in 2010 in Hong Kong. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, document the implementation and outcomes of the project, and identify factors that contribute to the outcomes. Method: The program was delivered following the five key components of the public health approach: (a) community consensus building; (b) surveillance and monitoring; (c) development of coordinated action strategies; (d) interventions development and implementation at the universal, selective, and indicated levels; and (d) program evaluation. Results: A significant decreasing trend of suicide was found in the study site during the intervention period, whereas no changes were found in the three control sites. Spatial analysis also showed that the suicide cluster subsided after the intervention. Three impacts and one challenge of the program were identified from the qualitative feedback of the program stakeholders. Limitations: More investigations should be made to assess the sustainability of this community-based suicide prevention effort in the long run. Conclusion: A community-based suicide prevention program was successfully implemented to address the suicide cluster. A reduction in the suicide rate was observed after the intervention. ? 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",""
"Right-Sided Location Not Associated With Missed Colorectal Adenomas in an Individual-Level Reanalysis of Tandem Colonoscopy Studies",2019,"Background & Aims: Interval cancers occur more frequently in the right colon. One reason could be that right-sided adenomas are frequently missed in colonoscopy examinations. We reanalyzed data from tandem colonoscopies to assess adenoma miss rates in relation to location and other factors. Methods: We pooled data from 8 randomized tandem trials comprising 2218 patients who had diagnostic or screening colonoscopies (adenomas detected in 49.8% of patients). We performed a mixed-effects logistic regression with patients as cluster effects with different independent parameters. Factors analyzed included location (left vs right, splenic flexure as cutoff), adenoma size, form, and histologic features. Analyses were controlled for potential confounding factors such as patient sex and age, colonoscopy indication, and bowel cleanliness. Results: Right-side location was not an independent risk factor for missed adenomas (odds ratio [OR] compared with the left side, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75–1.17). However, compared with adenomas ?5 mm, the OR for missing adenomas of 6–9 mm was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44–0.87), and the OR for missing adenomas of ?10 mm was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.33–0.77). Compared with pedunculated adenomas, sessile (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.16–2.85) and flat adenomas (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.49–4.10) were more likely to be missed. Histologic features were not significant risk factors for missed adenomas (OR for adenomas with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.34–1.37 and OR for sessile serrated adenomas, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.47–1.64 compared with low-grade adenomas). Men had a higher number of adenomas per colonoscopy (1.27; 95% CI, 1.21–1.33) than women (0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93). Men were less likely to have missed adenomas than women (OR for missed adenomas in men, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.94). Conclusions: In an analysis of data from 8 randomized trials, we found that right-side location of an adenoma does not increase its odds for being missed during colonoscopy but that adenoma size and histologic features do increase risk. Further studies are needed to determine why adenomas are more frequently missed during colonoscopies in women than men. ? 2019 AGA Institute","Article; colonoscopy; colorectal adenoma; human; Medline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; systematic review; tumor localization; tumor volume; adenomatous polyp; aged; cancer grading; colon polyp; colorectal tumor; diagnostic error; early cancer diagnosis; female; male; middle aged; pathology; predictive value; procedures; sex factor; time factor; Adenomatous Polyps; Aged; Colonic Polyps; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diagnostic Errors; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Predictive Value of Tests; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Tumor Burden"

"Antibiotic-laden cement wrap: A simple but effective way of treating patients with megaprosthesis infection",2019,": Infection is one of the commonest causes for megaprosthesis failure. The current treatment includes antibiotics but no surgery, debridement, prosthesis removal and joint fusion, prosthesis revision or amputation. Success in controlling infection may be less than 50% in implant revision. The overall risk of amputation is more than 20%. We believe that repeated debridement with antibiotic-laden cement wrap (ALCW) may be a reliable alternative for managing the megaprosthesis infection. The purposes of this article are to identify whether ALCW is an effective way of eradicating the megaprosthesis infection, the associated complications and the functional outcome after management by ALCW. Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with megaprosthesis infection. From January 2014 to June 2016, there were five patients with tumour megaprosthesis infection who had undergone the ALCW procedure. Ages ranged from 17 to 59 years of age. Male to female ratio was 4:1. The patients studied had humeral (1), proximal femoral (1), distal femoral (1) and proximal tibial (2) prostheses. All patients had follow-ups more than 1 year (21–52 months) after treatment. Results: All patients recovered from their implant infection and the implants were retained in all patients. There was no sign of infection in the most recent follow-up. One patient died of osteosarcoma recurrence. One patient had a large block of cement causing plastic insert dislodgement in the shoulder joint 1 year after surgery. Another patient with a dislocated hip cup had revision carried out in the final debridement. The most recent Musculoskeletal Tumor society (MSTS) scores ranged from 21 to 30. All patients were satisfied with their treatment. Conclusions: In this preliminary report of a small number of patients, ALCW has achieved 100% infection control. ALCW may be an easy and effective alternative for managing the megasprosthesis infection. The complications associated can be avoidable. The functional outcome is excellent. ?

"Anaesthetic considerations in nonagenarians and centenarians",2019,"Purpose of reviewThe ageing population is a global public health issue and we can expect to encounter more and more older patients requiring anaesthetic care. Age itself is no longer the sole reason for declining a patient for anaesthesia and surgery. Undoubtedly, managing patients at the extremities of age is challenging and demanding, not only because of multiple comorbidities, but also the poorer functional status, frailty and decline in general well being that must be managed during the perioperative journey. In this article, we will focus on three important aspects of anaesthetic care for this patient group, namely, comorbidity, frailty and perioperative cognitive dysfunction; and give recommendations on how anaesthetists should tackle these aspects for the 'older old' and the 'oldest old', based on current best evidence.Recent findingsThe 'oldest old' (nonagerians and centenarians) are the fastest-growing geriatric population worldwide. Evidence has demonstrated that an enhanced care programme designed for elderly patients is safe, feasible and could diminish both complications and length of stay after surgery. Studies are emerging on frailty measurement and the association with outcomes of anaesthesia and surgery and have resulted in new recommendations on best practices for postoperative brain health and nomenclature of perioperative neurocognitive disorder.SummaryComorbidity, frailty and perioperative cognitive dysfunction are significant perioperative concerns specific to elderly patients and clearly associated with adverse outcomes after surgery. These anaesthetic concerns should be anticipated and properly managed through the perioperative pathway so that their potential complications can be mitigated. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"A multiplicative approach to polyvictimization: A study of intimate partner violence types as risk factors for child polyvictimization in South Korea",2019,"Drawing on a new typology of intimate partner violence (IPV), this paper tests the relationship between indicators of totalitarian and anarchic IPV and child polyvictimization incidence and severity. The paper argues for and utilizes a quantitative approach to study polyvictimization severity. Polyvictimization is operationalized as a multiplicative relationship between physical abuse and neglect in a random sample of 204 children from Kyunggi province, South Korea. The indicator of totalitarian IPV significantly predicted polyvictimization severity and incidence even when a traditional measure of intimate terrorism was held constant. The indicator of anarchic IPV significantly predicted polyvictimization severity but not incidence when a traditional measure of intimate terrorism was held constant. Implications are discussed. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The role of sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm disruption as risk factors of Alzheimer's disease",2019,"Emerging evidence suggests that sleep deprivation (SD) and circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) may interact and increase the risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review inspects different pathophysiological aspects of SD and CRD, and shows that the two may impair the glymphatic-vascular-lymphatic clearance of brain macromolecules (e.g., β-amyloid and microtubule associated protein tau), increase local brain oxidative stress and diminish circulatory melatonin levels. Lastly, this review looks into the potential association between sleep and circadian rhythm with stress granule formation, which might be a new mechanism along the AD pathogenic pathway. In summary, SD and CRD is likely to be associated with a positive risk in developing Alzheimer's disease in humans. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","amyloid beta protein; melatonin receptor; orexin; tau protein; melatonin; Alzheimer disease; circadian rhythm; circadian rhythm sleep disorder; disease association; genetic code; glymphatic system; human; macromolecule; molecular clock; nervous system inflammation; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein blood level; Review; risk factor; sleep; Alzheimer disease; animal; complication; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; sleep deprivation; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Glymphatic System; Humans; Melatonin; Oxidative Stress; Sleep Deprivation"
"Global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses",2019,"Bats are a unique group of mammals of the order Chiroptera. They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat-animal and bat-human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Development of dual-component protein microparticles in all-aqueous systems for biomedical applications",2019,"Protein microparticles assisted by an emulsion droplet template have shown great promise in drug/cell delivery and tissue engineering, as well as diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, the usage of non-aqueous solvents involved in the oil-containing emulsion and their single-component nature severely hamper their use in medical applications. To address these limitations, here we present a facile strategy to fabricate dual-component protein (DCP) microparticles via the microfluidic electrospray technique. Due to the affinity partitioning properties of the all-aqueous system (AAS), electrostatic complexation takes place between the two oppositely charged proteins to form dual-component protein-protein structures in the all-aqueous droplets. We demonstrate that hemoglobin-bovine serum albumin (Hb-BSA) DCP microparticles possess characteristics resembling those of natural red blood cells, including remarkable softness and the ability to pass through narrow channels. Moreover, in vitro results show that other hemoglobin-immunoglobulin (Hb-BSA) DCP microparticles exhibit good cytocompatibility towards human stem cells. Accordingly, this work provides a novel engineering strategy using all-aqueous droplets as a template to design new biocompatible DCP microparticles for biomedical applications. ?

"Should Patients with NAFLD/NASH Be Surveyed for HCC?",2019,"Background Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the magnitude of the association still needs to be determined to define the need for a specific surveillance strategy. Methods We based our assessment on a previously published review by White et al (1992-2011) and on a systematic review(2012-2017). Results The new search identified 328 abstracts. Combining both eras (1992-2011 and 2012-2017), 25 studies were included in the analysis. Four were prospective, 2 described a retrospective analysis of a prospective database, and the others were retrospective. All studies were published after 2004, but the inclusion period of half of them ended before the year 2000. Studies showed variation in the definition of NAFLD, in the incidence of fibrosis/cirrhosis, in the presence of comorbidities (potentially affecting HCC incidence), and in the type and duration of screening. Considering only studies strictly including patients with or without cirrhosis, the reported incidence of HCC in NAFLD patients with cirrhosis was between 6.7 and 15% at 5 to 10 years, whereas the incidence in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis was 2.7% at 10 years and 23 per 100 000 person-years. Conclusions Hepatocellular carcinoma screening in NAFLD patients with cirrhosis is mandatory. However, the currently observed low (and insufficiently documented) incidence of HCC in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis does not justify a systematic surveillance. Research efforts should focus on developing a score, which could aid the clinician in identifying NAFLD patients without cirrhosis who are at higher risk of developing HCC. ?

"Evolution and Advancement of Adult Spinal Deformity Research and Clinical Care: An Overview of the Scoli-RISK-1 Study",2019,"Study Design: Narrative review. Objective: The prevalence of adult spinal deformity (ASD) has been cited anywhere between 2-32%, while the prevalence in the elderly population has been estimated at 68%. Neurologic complications following ASD surgery remains a concern. Previous literature reported incidence of neurologic complications varied between 1-10%, while non-neurologic complications reported were as high as 50%. To assess the incidence of neurologic deficits, complications, and outcomes following ASD surgery, an international group of spine deformity surgeons initiated a prospective, multicenter, international, observational study: Scoli-RISK-1. Methods: Two hundred seventy-two patients were enrolled from 15 centers with ASD having primary or revision surgery with a major Cobb?80°, revision including an osteotomy, and/or a complex 3-column osteotomy. Patients had lower extremity muscle strength (LEMS) exams performed preoperatively and at specific time points through 2-year follow-up. Results: Preoperatively, 203 patients (74.9%) had no LEMS impairment (normal) and 68 (25.1%) had a LEMS of <50 (abnormal). Compared with baseline, 23.0% of all patients experienced a LEMS decline at discharge, with this rate decreasing to 17.1% at 6-weeks and to 9.9% at 6-months and remaining stable at 10.0% at 2-years. Conclusion: This study revealed that a decline in LEMS after complex ASD surgery is common and more frequent than previously reported. We identified such a decline in 23.0% of patients at discharge, with neurologic function recovering over time to a decline of 10.0% at 2-years postoperatively. The Scoli-RISK-1 study revealed valuable information regarding the incidence, natural history, and prognosis of neurologic and non-neurologic complications following ASD surgery and provides useful information for patient counseling. ?

"Assessing the impact of the economic crises in 1997 and 2008 on suicides in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea using a strata-bootstrap algorithm",2020,"The Asian economic crises of 1997 and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had far-reaching impacts on Asian and other global economies. Turmoil in the banking and finance sectors led to downturns in stock markets, resulting in bankruptcies, house repossessions and high unemployment. These crises have been shown to be correlated with a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicides, and it is important to understand the implication of these impacts and how such recessions affect the health of affected populations. With the benefit of hindsight, did lessons learned from the negative effects of the 1997 Asian economic recession impact the aftermath of the 2008 GFC in Asian countries? Utilising a framework based on a simple strata-bootstrap algorithm using daily data–where available–we investigate the trend in suicide rates over time in three different populations (Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea), and examine whether there were any changes in the pattern of suicide rates in each country subsequent to both the 1997 Asian and 2008. We find that each country responded differently to each of the crises and the suicide rates for certain age-gender specific groups in each country were more affected. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Relationship between polyunsaturated fatty acids and psychopathology in the NEURAPRO clinical trial",2019,"Background: Deficiencies in membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids are thought to contribute to the pathophysiological processes underlying psychotic disorders. Emerging evidence suggests that the levels of PUFA are related to clinical symptoms but significant heterogeneity exists between studies. Here, we investigated associations of membrane PUFA with clinical symptoms and functioning in a large sample of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Methods: A total of 285 participants of the NEURAPRO clinical trial were investigated for erythrocyte PUFA levels, including the n-3 index, n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Severity of general psychopathology [Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)], psychotic symptoms (BPRS psychosis subscale), negative symptoms [Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)], manic symptoms [Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)], depressive symptoms [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)], and functioning [Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS), Global Functioning Social (GF-S) and Role (GF-R) scales] were assessed concurrently. Partial correlation taking into account the effects of gender, age, and smoking was used to examine the relationship between PUFAs and symptoms severity. Results: The n-3 index negatively correlated with the severity of general psychopathology, psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and manic symptoms. The n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio positively correlated with severity of psychotic and depressive symptoms. The n-3 PUFA DHA negatively correlated with the severity of general psychopathology, positive, manic, and depressive symptoms. EPA negatively correlated with manic symptoms. Nervonic acid, an n-9 monounsaturated fatty acid, positively correlated with general psychopathology, positive and negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, and manic symptoms. The long-chain saturated fatty acid tetracosanoic acid positively correlated with general psychopathology, positive, manic, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Partially consistent with a previous study, psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and symptoms of mania were associated with several classes of FAs in the present study. These findings support the relevance of membrane fatty acids for the onset of psychotic symptoms and indicate that FAs should be further evaluated as biomarkers in the UHR for psychosis group. ? 2007-2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Exercise Alleviates Obesity-Induced Metabolic Dysfunction via Enhancing FGF21 Sensitivity in Adipose Tissues",2019,"Geng et al. identify FGF21 signaling in adipose tissues as an obligatory molecular transducer of exercise, conferring its metabolic benefits on systemic glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Exercise sensitizes FGF21 actions in adipose tissues, which in turns sends humoral signals to coordinate multi-organ crosstalk for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. ? 2019 The AuthorsExercise promotes adipose remodeling and improves obesity-induced metabolic disorders through mechanisms that remain obscure. Here, we identify the FGF21 signaling in adipose tissues as an obligatory molecular transducer of exercise conferring its metabolic benefits in mice. Long-term high fat diet-fed obese mice exhibit compromised effects of exogenous FGF21 on alleviation of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied with markedly reduced expression of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) and β-Klotho (KLB) in adipose tissues. These impairments in obese mice are reversed by treadmill exercise. Mice lacking adipose KLB are refractory to exercise-induced alleviation of insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, and ectopic lipid accumulation due to diminished adiponectin production, excessive fatty acid release, and enhanced adipose inflammation. Mechanistically, exercise induces the adipose expression of FGFR1 and KLB via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, exercise sensitizes FGF21 actions in adipose tissues, which in turn sends humoral signals to coordinate multi-organ crosstalk for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. ? 2019 The Authors","adiponectin; beta Klotho protein; fatty acid; fibroblast growth factor 21; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; Klotho protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; recombinant fibroblast growth factor; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; diet induced obesity; exercise; fatty acid synthesis; glucose metabolism; homeostasis; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hyperlipidemia; inflammation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; transcription initiation; treadmill exercise"
"To what extent does physical activity explain the associations between neighborhood environment and depressive symptoms in older adults living in an Asian metropolis?",2019,"Purpose: This study aimed to examine physical activity (PA) as a mediator of both neighborhood environment-depressive symptoms associations and the moderating effects of living arrangements on these associations. Methods: 909 Hong Kong Chinese older adults aged 65 + years and living in pre-selected communities stratified by walkability and socio-economic status participated in this cross-sectional observational study. Exposure variables were objectively-quantified neighborhood attributes. The outcome measure was presence of depressive symptoms. Scores on validated Chinese versions of international PA questionnaires were examined as mediators of environment-depressive symptoms associations and of the moderating effects of living arrangements (living alone vs. living with others) on these associations. Results: Neighborhood connectivity, prevalence of public transport, and pedestrian infrastructure were positively related to depressive symptoms; and frequency of walking for transport was identified as a suppressor of these positive associations. Living arrangements moderated the associations of a considerable number of measures of access to destinations of daily living with depressive symptoms, and most of these moderating effects were partially mediated by frequency of walking for transport. Conclusions: Ultra-dense, well-connected, pedestrian-friendly, destination-rich neighborhoods may contribute to lowering the risk of depressive symptoms in Hong Kong older adults by enabling them to frequently walk to local destinations of daily living and, thus, maintain their independence and bond with the community. These potential pathways of influence appear to be particularly important for older adults living alone. Future studies need to identify mechanisms other than PA that contribute to unexplained environment-depression relationships. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","aged; Article; Asian; Chinese; community; cross-sectional study; depression; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; observational study; physical activity; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; social status; walkability; walking"
"Advancing Care for Head and Neck Cancers in a Multidisciplinary Tumour Board in the East",2019,"Managing head and neck cancers is an excellent example of the importance of teamwork, with head and neck surgeons, clinical oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and other allied health professionals specialised in this disease site working together. The reliable imaging and dedicated pretreatment work-up entailing the comprehensive anatomical description of tumour involvement by the radiologists, the expertise of surgeons in performing en-bloc gross tumour resection, the uneventful speedy postoperative rehabilitation and recovery by the speech therapists and nutritionists, as well as the dedicated treatment planning of clinical oncologists in delivering precise preoperative or postoperative (chemo)radiotherapy to maximise the therapeutic potentials are the pillars of treatment success. A multidisciplinary tumour board involving all of these key players is essential to provide the highest level of recommendation based on evidence-based medicine and to bring patients new hopes and the best chance of cure. This review illustrates the seamless collaborative teamwork within a well-established multidisciplinary tumour board in managing one of the most intractable cancers in the East, taking enlightenment and inspiration from the West. ? 2019","antineoplastic agent; bevacizumab; clodronic acid; pentoxifylline; Article; bone necrosis; brachytherapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; chemoradiotherapy; debridement; diet therapy; dietitian; evidence based medicine; head and neck cancer; human; larynx cancer; lip cancer; lip reconstruction; medical expert; medical specialist; mouth cancer; multidisciplinary team; nasopharynx cancer; nose cavity cancer; oncologist; paramedical personnel; paranasal sinus cancer; pathologist; patient care; pharynx cancer; postoperative care; preoperative chemotherapy; preoperative radiotherapy; priority journal; radiation injury; radiologist; rehabilitation care; reliability; second cancer; side effect; skull base tumor; speech language pathologist; speech therapy; surgeon; swallowing"
"Do search engine helpline notices aid in preventing suicide? Analysis of archival data",2019,"Background: Search engines display helpline notices when people query for suicide-related information. Objective: In this study, we aimed to examine if these notices and other information displayed in response to suicide-related queries are correlated with subsequent searches for suicide prevention rather than harmful information. Methods: Anonymous suicide-related searches made on Bing and Google in the United States, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in a span of 10 months were extracted. Descriptive analyses and regression models were fit to the data to assess the correlation with observed behaviors. Results: Display of helpline notices was not associated with an observed change in the likelihood of or future suicide searches (P=.42). No statistically significant differences were observed in the likelihood of people making future suicide queries (both generally and specific types of suicide queries) when comparing search engines in locations that display helpline notices versus ones that do not. Pages with higher rank, being neutral to suicide, and those shown among more antisuicide pages were more likely to be clicked on. Having more antisuicide Web pages displayed was the only factor associated with further searches for suicide prevention information (hazard=1.18, P=.002). Conclusions: Helpline notices are not associated with harm. If they cause positive change in search behavior, it is small. This is possibly because of the variability in intent of users seeking suicide-related information. Nonetheless, helpline notice should be displayed, but more efforts should be made to improve the visibility and ranking of suicide prevention Web pages. ?Qijin Cheng, Elad Yom-Tov.","female; human; Internet; male; search engine; suicide; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Search Engine; Suicide"
"Etiology-specific analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma transcriptome reveals genetic dysregulation in pathways implicated in immunotherapy efficacy",2019,"Immunotherapy has emerged in recent years as arguably the most effective treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the failure of a large percentage of patients to respond to immunotherapy remains as the ultimate obstacle to successful treatment. Etiology-associated dysregulation of immune-associated (IA) genes may be central to the development of this differential clinical response. We identified immune-associated genes potentially dysregulated by alcohol or viral hepatitis B in HCC and validated alcohol-induced dysregulations in vitro while using large-scale RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thirty-four clinically relevant dysregulated IA genes were identified. We profiled the correlation of all genomic alterations in HCC patients to IA gene expression while using the information theory-based algorithm REVEALER to investigate the molecular mechanism for their dysregulation and explore the possibility of genome-based patient stratification. We also studied gene expression regulators and identified multiple microRNAs that were implicated in HCC pathogenesis that can potentially regulate these IA genes’ expression. Our study identified potential key pathways, including the IL-7 signaling pathway and TNFRSF4 (OX40)-NF-κB pathway, to target in immunotherapy treatments and presents microRNAs as promising therapeutic targets for dysregulated IA genes because of their extensive regulatory roles in the cancer immune landscape. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Prognostic implications of statin intolerance in stable coronary artery disease patients with different levels of high-sensitive troponin",2019,"Background: The prognostic implication of statin in tolerance (SI) in those with stable CAD remains unclear. We hypothesized that SI is of higher prognostic significance in stable CAD patients with elevated high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI). Methods: A total of 952 stable CAD patients from the prospective Hong Kong CAD study who had complete clinical data, biomarker measurements and who were prescribed statin therapy were studied. Results: We identified 13 (1.4%) and 125 (13.1%) patients with complete and partial SI, respectively. At baseline, patients with SI were more likely to have diabetes mellitus and a higher hs-cTnI level, but no difference in LDL-C level compared with those without SI. After 51 months of follow-up, patients with SI had a higher mean LDL-C level than those without SI. A total of 148 (15.5%) patients developed major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Both SI (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.19, P = 0.02) and elevated hs-cTnI (HR 3.18, 95% CI 2.07-4.89, P < 0.01) were independent predictors of a MACE in patients with stable CAD. When stratified by hs-cTnI level, SI independently predicted MACE-free survival only in those with elevated hs-cTnI (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.01-2.24, P = 0.04). Conclusions: SI independently predicted MACE in patients with stable CAD and high hs-cTnI, but not in those with low hs-cTnI. Hs-cTnI may be used to stratify stable CAD patients who have SI for intensive lipid-lowering therapy using non-statin agents. ? 2019 The Author(s).","atorvastatin; ezetimibe; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; troponin I; acute coronary syndrome; add on therapy; aged; Article; cardiac patient; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; clinical study; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; disease free survival; drug tolerability; female; follow up; groups by age; Hong Kong; human; hypertension; lipid analysis; major clinical study; male; observational study; patient coding; peripheral vascular disease; prediction; predictive value; prescription; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; retrospective study; selection bias; sex ratio; treatment outcome"
"Dating CAFE Ambassador Programme: Chinese College Students to Help Peers in Dating Violence",2019,"Dating violence prevention programs have been understudied in Asia, including China. The current study sought to evaluate the feasibility of the Dating Compassion, Assessment, reFerral, and Education (CAFE) Ambassador Programme in China. This program is designed to enhance the behavioral intentions of Chinese students to help peers who are experiencing dating violence and to compare students’ attitudes toward dating violence, students’ subjective norms about helping peers, and students’ perceived behavioral control in helping peers before and after attending the 7.5 hour program. A quasi-experimental design was used, including two student groups (n = 85) assessed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Quantitative pre- and postintervention measurements, in conjunction with qualitative focus group interviews, were used to evaluate the program’s effectiveness. The findings indicated a significant enhancement in the behavioral intentions of participants in the intervention group to help peers experiencing dating violence, a stronger subjective norm regarding helping others, and an enhanced sense of perceived behavioral control to help, compared with the control group, over time. Focus group data revealed that students who participated in the program developed a more comprehensive definition of dating violence, increased awareness of dating violence in peers, a shift in their focus concerning the role of intention in dating violence and felt more responsible for helping their peers. The findings support the effectiveness of the Dating CAFE Ambassador Programme. ? 2019 Society for Public Health Education.","adult; article; awareness; China; college student; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; dating violence; education; experimental design; feasibility study; follow up; human; human experiment; interview; major clinical study; partner violence; patient referral; quantitative analysis"
"Cyber Behaviors among Heterosexual and Sexual Minority Youth: Subgroup Differences and Associations with Health Indicators",2019,"To examine the associations of adolescent sexual orientation with cyber behaviors and health indicators 5 years later during young adulthood and test whether cyber behaviors contribute to sexual orientation health disparities. Data were drawn from Waves 2 and 7 from the NEXT Generational Health Study, a nationally representative cohort of U.S. adolescents (n = 2012). Multiple linear regressions were used to examine differences between sexual orientation subgroups (defined based on sexual attraction) in five cyber behaviors and five health indicators. Mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether cyber behaviors mediated the associations between bisexual attraction and health indicators. Relative to heterosexual peers, bisexual youth spent more time engaging in cyber behaviors and social media, and reported more psychosomatic symptoms and poorer general health. Gay and questioning males spent less time playing video games than heterosexual males. Bisexual females reported more depressive symptoms and less optimism and happiness than heterosexual females. Time spent on cyber behaviors and social media was a significant mediator of adolescent bisexual attraction and worse health outcomes in young adulthood. Frequency of cyber behaviors differed between sexual minority subgroups. Bisexual youth in particular had more psychosomatic symptoms and poorer general health. Engagement in cyber behaviors and social media use contributed to increased health disparities among bisexual youth. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","adolescent; adult; bisexuality; cohort analysis; female; health disparity; health status indicator; heterosexuality; human; male; psychology; sexual and gender minority; social media; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Bisexuality; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Status Disparities; Health Status Indicators; Heterosexuality; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Media; United States; Young Adult"
"Large-Scale Multi-Class Image-Based Cell Classification with Deep Learning",2019,"Recent advances in ultra-high-throughput microscopy have enabled a new generation of cell classification methodologies using image-based cell phenotypes alone. In contrast to current single-cell analysis techniques that rely solely on slow and costly genetic/epigenetic analysis, these image-based analyses allow morphological profiling and screening of thousands or even millions of single cells at a fraction of the cost, and have been proven to demonstrate the statistical significance required for understanding the role of cell heterogeneity in diverse biological applications, ranging from cancer screening to drug candidate identification/validation processes. This paper examines the efficacies and opportunities presented by machine learning algorithms in processing large scale datasets with millions of label-free cell images. An automatic single-cell classification framework using convolutional neural network (CNN) has been developed. A comparative analysis of its efficiency in classifying large datasets against conventional k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) based methods are also presented. Experiments have shown that our proposed framework can efficiently identify multiple types cells with over $99\%$ accuracy based on the phenotypic label-free bright-field images; and CNN-based models perform well and relatively stable against data volume compared with kNN and SVM. ? 2013 IEEE.","Cells; Computer architecture; Convolution; Cytology; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Image classification; Imaging techniques; Learning algorithms; Microprocessor chips; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Throughput; Bright fields; Cell classification; Convolutional neural network; Informatics; Multi-class classification; Classification (of information); Article; bright field microscopy; cancer screening; cell heterogeneity; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; data accuracy; deep learning; drug identification; epigenetics; human; human cell; information processing; k nearest neighbor; live cell imaging; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; measurement precision; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phenotype; support vector machine; THP-1 cell line; validation process; algorithm; cells; classification; cytology; factual database; image processing; microscopy; procedures; Algorithms; Cells; Cytological Techniques; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy"
"Detecting comments showing risk for suicide in YouTube",2019,"Natural language processing (NLP) with Cantonese, a mixture of Traditional Chinese, borrowed characters to represent spoken terms, and English, is largely under developed. To apply NLP to detect social media posts showing suicide risk, which is a rare event in regular population, is even more challenging. This paper tried different text mining methods to classify comments in Cantonese on YouTube whether they indicate suicidal risk. Based on word vector feature, classification algorithms such as SVM, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM are employed to detect the comments’ risk level. To address the imbalance issue of the data, both re-sampling and focal loss methods are used. Based on improvement on both data and algorithm level, the LSTM algorithm can achieve more satisfied testing classification results (84.3% and 84.5% g-mean, respectively). The study demonstrates the potential of automatically detected suicide risk in Cantonese social media posts. ?

"Effect of evidence-based therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background The combination pharmacotherapy of antiplatelet agents, lipid-modifiers, ACE inhibitors/ ARBs and beta-blockers are recommended by international guidelines. However, data on effectiveness of the evidence-based combination pharmacotherapy (EBCP) is limited. Objectives To determine the effect of EBCP on mortality and Cardiovascular events in patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or cerebrovascular disease. Methods Publications in EMBASE and Medline up to October 2018 were searched for cohort and case-control studies on EBCP for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The main outcomes were all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events. Meta-analyses were performed based on random effects models. Results 21 studies were included. Comparing EBCP to either monotherapy or no therapy, the pooled risk ratios were 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.66) for all-cause mortality, 0.70 (0.62 to 0.79) for vascular mortality, 0.73 (0.64 to 0.83) for myocardial infarction and 0.79 (0.68 to 0.91) for cerebrovascular events. Optimal EBCP (all 4 classes of drug prescribed) had a risk ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.50 (0.40 to 0.64). This benefit became more dilute as the number of different classes of drug comprising EBCP was decreased—for 3 classes of drug prescribed the risk ratio was 0.58 (0.49 to 0.69) and for 2 classes, the risk ratio was 0.67 (0.60 to 0.76). Conclusions EBCP reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with CHD or cerebrovascular disease. The different classes of drugs comprising EBCP work in an additive manner, with optimal EBCP conferring the greatest benefit.

"Dental students’ awareness, preparedness and barriers towards managing tobacco-using patients-a cross-sectional study",2019,"Aims: To evaluate Hong Kong dental students’ perceived awareness, preparedness and barriers towards managing tobacco-using patients. Methods: A validated questionnaire was administered to dental students who were in their clinical years (the third, fourth, fifth and sixth year of study) in 2017 at the University of Hong Kong. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: (1) awareness towards practicing tobacco cessation counselling (TCC), (2) preparedness in terms of confidence, knowledge and clinical practices when managing tobacco-using patients, and (3) perceived barriers to counselling. Results: All 206 invited students had participated this study. Most (93%) agreed that dentists should deliver TCC. However, only around a quarter (26%) of students were well-prepared to help patients in tobacco cessation. While 60% of students agreed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was helpful for patients to quit tobacco use, only 28% understood its mechanism of action, and merely 16% were knowledgeable enough to introduce NRT to their patients. Two-thirds (62%) of students felt they did not have sufficient skills at this stage of their training. Conclusions: Most Hong Kong dental students had good awareness that dental professionals had an important role to promote tobacco cessation in their patient pools. However, not many of them were well-prepared to manage tobacco-using patients. Common barriers were found to be patients’ apathy and students’ inadequate familiarity with NRT. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Hepatitis E virus infection and its associated adverse feto-maternal outcomes among pregnant women in Qinhuangdao, China",2019,"Background and aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the positive rate of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and the possible adverse outcomes in pregnant women of Qinhuangdao, China. Methods: Serum samples of 946 pregnant women were collected from July 2017 to October 2017 in Qinhuangdao First Hospital. All samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HEV RNA was tested by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) and the PCR products were sequenced. Results: Of the 946 samples, the positive rate of anti-HEV IgM (15/365, 4.11%), anti-HEV IgG (74/365, 20.27%) and both anti-HEV IgM and IgG (12/365, 3.29%) were significantly higher (p <.05) in third trimester pregnant women than in the first (3/288, 1.04%; 36/288, 12.5%; 4/288, 1.39%), and second trimesters (6/293, 2.05%; 29/293, 9.90%; 2/293, 0.68%). The average alanine transaminase (ALT) level (34.49 ± 10.15) and the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (13/18, 72.22%) in the both anti-HEV IgM and IgG positive group were significantly higher than other groups (p <.05). HEV RNA was detected in 1/181 (0.55%) of pregnant women with a history of HEV infection and the detected HEV strain belonged to subgenotype 4a. Conclusions: This study showed that pregnant women who have HEV infection can possibly lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"In Vitro and In Vivo Renoprotective Effects of Telbivudine in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients Receiving Nucleotide Analogue",2019,"Aim: Renal toxicity of adefovir disoproxil (ADV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a significant concern in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Early observational clinical data suggested that telbivudine (LdT) might have renoprotective effects. Methods: In this prospective study, consecutive CHB patients on combined lamivudine (LAM) + ADV/TDF were switched to LdT + ADV/TDF at recruitment and were followed up for 24?months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the modification of diet in renal disease equation. The effects of LdT on cell viability and expression of kidney injury or apoptotic biomarkers were investigated in cultured renal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2. Results: Thirty-one patients (median age 55?years, 90.3% male) were recruited (54.8% TDF: 45.2% ADV). Serum HBV DNA was undetectable at all time points. Median eGFR was 70.2 (IQR 62.6–77.9) and 81.5 (IQR 63.6–99.1) mL/min/1.73?m2 at baseline and 24?months, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Downstaging of chronic kidney disease was observed in eight (25.8%) patients and was more common in ADV-treated compared to TDF-treated patients (7/8 vs. 1/17, p = 0.011; OR 16, 95% CI 1.643–155.766, p = 0.017). In vitro data showed that adding LdT to ADV or TDF was associated with improved cell viability and lower expression of injury and apoptotic biomarkers compared with ADV or TDF alone. Treatment was prematurely discontinued in four(12.9%) patients due to myalgia. Conclusions: Clinical and in vitro data suggest that LdT has renoprotective effects in patients on long-term ADV/TDF treatment. LdT may be considered as an adjuvant therapy in this special group of patients with renal impairment (NCT03778567). ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","activating transcription factor 4; adefovir dipivoxil; biological marker; caspase 12; creatine kinase; creatinine; glucose regulated protein 78; hepatitis B(e) antigen; interleukin 18; kidney injury molecule 1; lamivudine; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; RNA; telbivudine; tenofovir disoproxil; virus DNA; adult; antiviral therapy; apoptosis; Article; cell viability; chronic hepatitis B; clinical article; combination drug therapy; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; creatinine blood level; drug safety; drug substitution; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; glucosuria; HK-2 [Human kidney] cell line; human; human cell; hypoalbuminemia; hypophosphatemia; in vitro study; kidney function; kidney injury; male; monotherapy; myalgia; priority journal; protein expression; proteinuria; renal protection; side effect"

"Deregulated GATA6 modulates stem cell-like properties and metabolic phenotype in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Accumulating evidence illustrates the significance of cell plasticity in the molecular biology of liver cancer. Reprogramming of mature parenchymal cells to a less differentiated state by key molecular targets contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hereby, we investigated the role of GATA6, a transcription factor implicated in hepatocyte lineage specification, in HCC. Our results demonstrated a lower expression of GATA6 in HCC tissues compared to the corresponding nontumoral liver tissues. Moreover, GATA6 underexpression, as observed in about 50% cases in our clinical cohort, was associated with a poorer degree of tumor cell differentiation and worse disease-free survival outcome. In vitro, silencing of GATA6 in HCC cells augmented cell migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells by activating epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Self-renewal was also enhanced in vitro. Consistently, in vivo tumorigenicity and self-renewal was promoted upon GATA6 knockdown. Notably, suppression of GATA6 converts HCC cells to a metabolic phenotype recapitulating stem-cell state. Expression of glycolytic markers was elevated in GATA6-knockdown clones accompanied by increased glucose uptake; while overexpression of GATA6 resulted in opposite effects. Further to this, we identified that GATA6 bound to the promoter region of PKM gene and regulated PKM2 transcription. Taken together, downregulation of GATA6 directs HCC cells to glycolytic metabolism and fosters tumorigenicity, self-renewal and metastasis. GATA6 is a transcriptional regulator and a genetic switch that converts the phenotypic reprogramming of HCC cells. It is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for liver cancer. ? 2019 UICC","biological marker; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase M2; transcription factor GATA 6; unclassified drug; GATA6 protein, human; transcription factor GATA 6; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer stem cell; carcinogenicity; cell differentiation; cell invasion; cell lineage; cell migration; cell self-renewal; controlled study; disease free survival; down regulation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene knockdown; gene silencing; genetic transcription; glucose transport; glycolysis; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver tissue; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; phenotype; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; animal; cancer stem cell; cancer transplantation; down regulation; female; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; metabolism; pathology; prognosis; survival analysis; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Self Renewal; Down-Regulation; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; GATA6 Transcription Factor; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycolysis; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Prognosis; Survival Analysis"
"Preventing an Antigenically Disruptive Mutation in Egg-Based H3N2 Seasonal Influenza Vaccines by Mutational Incompatibility",2019,"Wu et al. characterize the incompatibility between two major egg-adaptive mutations in human H3N2 virus hemagglutinin, G186V and L194P, which confer either minimal or significant antigenic change, respectively. This study suggests that the antigenically disruptive mutation L194P that occurs during egg-based influenza vaccine production can be prevented by mutational incompatibility. ? 2019 The AuthorsEgg-based seasonal influenza vaccines are the major preventive countermeasure against influenza virus. However, their effectiveness can be compromised when antigenic changes arise from egg-adaptive mutations on influenza hemagglutinin (HA). The L194P mutation is commonly observed in egg-based H3N2 vaccine seed strains and significantly alters HA antigenicity. An approach to prevent L194P would therefore be beneficial. We show that emergence of L194P during egg passaging can be impeded by preexistence of a G186V mutation, revealing strong incompatibility between these mutations. X-ray structures illustrate that individual G186V and L194P mutations have opposing effects on the HA receptor-binding site (RBS), and when both G186V and L194P are present, the RBS is severely disrupted. Importantly, wild-type HA antigenicity is maintained with G186V, but not L194P. Our results demonstrate that these epistatic interactions can be used to prevent the emergence of mutations that adversely alter antigenicity during egg adaptation. ? 2019 The Authors","influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; influenza vaccine; virus antigen; adaptive immunity; animal cell; Article; comparative study; controlled study; crystal structure; drug conformation; female; gene mutation; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; hydrogen bond; Influenza A virus (H3N2); nonhuman; priority journal; receptor binding; seasonal influenza; sequence database; virus mutation; virus strain; adaptation; animal; binding site; chemistry; chick embryo; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; Influenza A virus (H3N2); missense mutation; pharmaceutics; procedures; protein conformation; virus culture; X ray crystallography; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Antigens, Viral; Binding Sites; Chick Embryo; Crystallography, X-Ray; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Mutation, Missense; Protein Conformation; Technology, Pharmaceutical; Virus Cultivation"
"Economic costs attributable to smoking in Hong Kong in 2011: A possible increase from 1998",2019,"Background: Reduction in smoking prevalence does not necessarily reduce the costs of smoking as evidence shows in developed countries. We provide up-to-date estimates for direct and indirect costs attributable to smoking in Hong Kong in 2011 and compare with our 1998 estimates. Methods: We took a societal perspective to include lives and life years lost, health care costs and time lost from work in the costing. We followed guidelines on estimating costs of active smoking for those aged 35 years or above (35+) and costs due to second-hand smoking (SHS) exposure for 35+, infants aged 12 months and under and children aged 15 and below. All costs are in US dollars. Results: We estimated that 6154 deaths among 35+ in Hong Kong in 2011 were attributable to active smoking, an increase of 10% from 1998. Besides, 672 deaths were attributable to SHS exposure, that is, 10% of the total 6826 smoking-attributable deaths. The estimate of productive life lost due to deaths from active smoking by those aged under 65 years in 2011 was $166 million, an increase of about 4% over the estimate in 1998. Our conservative estimate of the annual tobacco-related disease cost in 2011 was $716 million which accounted for 0.3% of GDP. If we added the value of attributable lives lost, the annual cost would be $4.7 billion. Conclusion: Despite the reduction in smoking prevalence, smoking-attributable disease still imposes a substantial economic burden on Hong Kong society. These findings support more stringent and effective tobacco control legislation, policies, and measures. Implications: Current evidence shows reduction in smoking prevalence does not necessarily reduce the economic costs of smoking. Most studies in developed countries employed a societal perspective, including costs of productivity loss and indirect costs, but not all studies estimated costs associated with second-hand smoking (SHS). The present study estimated the total costs of smoking in Hong Kong including direct and indirect costs attributable to active smoking and to SHS exposure. Our study confirms the pattern of smoking epidemic in developed countries, forewarns the increasing economic burdens from tobacco, and provides East Asian countries with a prediction of their own future costs. ?

"Long-term data on entecavir treatment for treatment-naive or lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B infection in kidney transplant recipients",2019,"Introduction: Entecavir (ETV) showed short-term efficacy and safety in HBsAg-positive kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), but long-term data are lacking. Methodology: We retrospectively reviewed 30 HBsAg-positive KTRs who received ETV during 2007-2017. Results: Eighteen treatment-na?ve (Group I) and 12 lamivudine-resistant (Group II) patients received ETV for 48.4?±?35.2 and 66.0?±?26.0?months, respectively. Both groups show significant HBV DNA decline, but Group I achieved earlier undetectability after 11.9?±?9.6?months (compared with 28.8?±?24.2?months in Group II, P?=.033). Group I showed higher rates of undetectable HBV DNA (89%, 94%, 94%, 100%, and 100% at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60?months, respectively, compared with 25%, 50%, 50%, 91%, and 91% in Group II, P?=.003). ALT normalized after 6.0?±?1.9 and 6.8?±?2.1?months in Group I and Group II, respectively. Four patients (33.3%) in Group II developed drug resistance (2 had persistent viraemia and 2 had virological breakthrough, at 40.3?±?15.0?months). Group II showed higher liver stiffness after 5?years (7.7?±?4.1?kPa, compared with 5.0?±?1.6?kPa in Group I, P?=.046) and incidence of cirrhosis (4 patients [33.3%], compared with 1 [5.6%] patient in Group I, P?=.049). Two patients (one in each group) developed hepatocellular carcinoma. Renal allograft function remained stable during follow-up of 63.2?±?33.4?months for both groups. There was no difference in patient and graft survival between two groups at 5?years (P?=.62 and.36, respectively). Conclusion: ETV showed favorable long-term efficacy and tolerability in treatment-na?ve KTRs. One-third of lamivudine-resistant subjects showed non-response or viral breakthrough after ETV treatment. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"A territorywide prevalence study on blood-borne and enteric viral hepatitis in Hong Kong",2019,"Background. Viral hepatitis epidemiological data are important for the World Health Organization plan of eliminating viral hepatitis. We aimed to document the prevalence of viral hepatitis A to E in Hong Kong. Methods. This community-based study was open to all Hong Kong Chinese citizens aged =18 years. Baseline data and risk factors were collected. Hepatitis A-E serology was measured, including hepatitis B e antigen, antibodies to hepatitis B e antigen, antibodies to hepatitis D, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive participants, and antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) in HBsAg-negative participants. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and genotypes were determined in anti-HCV-positive participants. Results. A total of 10 256 participants were recruited from February 2015 to July 2016. Overall HBsAg seroprevalence was 7.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3%-8.3%), which was reduced significantly with HBV vaccination (odds ratio, 0.15 [95% CI,.11-.21]). Among HBsAg-negative participants, anti-HBc seroprevalence increased from 5.4% (<26 years) to 60.1% (>65 years). No hepatitis D virus (HDV) cases were detected. Anti-HCV positivity was 0.5% (95% CI,.3%-.6%). Prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) was 65.2% (95% CI, 64.2%-66.1%) and 33.3% (95% CI, 32.4%-34.2%), respectively, and were influenced by age, family income, and being born in mainland China. Conclusions. HBV seroprevalence remained high despite universal vaccination. High anti-HBc seroprevalence underlines the potential issue of HBV reactivation during profound immunosuppression. HCV and HDV remained uncommon. Anti-HAV seroprevalence had decreased whereas anti-HEV seroprevalence had risen. ? 2019 The Author(s).","hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antibody; hepatitis B(e) antigen; virus DNA; hepatitis antibody; hepatitis antigen; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; demography; disease burden; enteric virus; epidemiological data; female; hepatitis A; Hepatitis A virus; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; Hepatitis delta virus; hepatitis E; Hong Kong; human; male; middle aged; priority journal; risk factor; serology; seroprevalence; vaccination; viral clearance; virus detection; virus hepatitis; virus reactivation; epidemiology; immunology; prevalence; seroepidemiology; virus hepatitis; Adult; Aged; Female; Hepatitis Antibodies; Hepatitis Antigens; Hepatitis Viruses; Hepatitis, Viral, Human; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Seroepidemiologic Studies"
"Panel-based exome sequencing for neuromuscular disorders as a diagnostic service",2019,"Background: Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Accurate molecular genetic diagnosis can improve clinical management, provides appropriate genetic counseling and testing of relatives, and allows potential therapeutic trials. Objective: To establish the clinical utility of panel-based whole exome sequencing (WES) in NMDs in a population with children and adults with various neuromuscular symptoms. Methods: Clinical exome sequencing, followed by diagnostic interpretation of variants in genes associated with NMDs, was performed in a cohort of 396 patients suspected of having a genetic cause with a variable age of onset, neuromuscular phenotype, and inheritance pattern. Many had previously undergone targeted gene testing without results. Results: Disease-causing variants were identified in 75/396 patients (19%), with variants in the three COL6-genes (COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3) as the most common cause of the identified muscle disorder, followed by variants in the RYR1 gene. Together, these four genes account for almost 25% of cases in whom a definite genetic cause was identified. Furthermore, likely pathogenic variants and/or variants of uncertain significance were identified in 95 of the patients (24%), in whom functional and/or segregation analysis should be used to confirm or reject the pathogenicity. In 18% of the cases with a disease-causing variant of which we received additional clinical information, we identified a genetic cause in genes of which the associated phenotypes did not match that of the patients. Hence, the advantage of panel-based WES is its unbiased approach. Conclusion: Whole exome sequencing, followed by filtering for NMD genes, offers an unbiased approach for the genetic diagnostics of NMD patients. This approach could be used as a first-tier test in neuromuscular disorders with a high suspicion of a genetic cause. With uncertain results, functional testing and segregation analysis are needed to complete the evidence. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

"The role of AMP-activated protein kinase as a potential target of treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer worldwide with a very high recurrence rate and very dismal prognosis. Diagnosis and treatment in HCC remain difficult, and the identification of new therapeutic targets is necessary for a better outcome of HCC treatment. AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) is an essential intracellular energy sensor that plays multiple roles in cellular physiology and the pathological development of chronic diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the important regulation of AMPK in HCC. This review aims to comprehensively and critically summarize the role of AMPK in HCC. Methods: Original studies were retrieved from NCBI database with keywords including AMPK and HCC, which were analyzed with extensive reading. Results: Dysregulation of the kinase activity and expression of AMPK was observed in HCC, which was correlated with survival of the patients. Loss of AMPK in HCC cells may proceed cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion through different oncogenic molecules and pathways. Conclusions: We identified several AMPK activators which may possess potential anti-HCC function, and discussed the clinical perspective on the use of AMPK activators for HCC therapy. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"The influence of hospital accreditation: A longitudinal assessment of organisational culture",2019,"Background: A growing body of evidence supports the link between hospital organisational culture and health outcomes. Organisational culture is thus an essential consideration for hospital accreditation, a practice of systematically assessing the quality of hospital care against accepted standards. This study assesses the interplay between accreditation and hospital professional staff perception of organisational culture. Methods: A prospective cohort study design was used to explore the influence of accreditation on organisational culture within a large, publicly-funded, university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. All full-time hospital and academic physicians, nurses and allied health professionals were invited to participate. Organisational culture was evaluated using the Competing Values Framework through the Quality Improvement Implementation Survey. Organisational culture was assessed longitudinally at 9 months prior to accreditation, 3 months following and 15 months after accreditation. To capture potential shifts in staff perception of organisational culture through the accreditation process, we conducted a between time-point comparison using a linear trend model. Results: 545 clinical staff completed the organisational culture survey pre-accreditation, 378 three- months post-accreditation and 141 15-months post-accreditation. Hierarchical culture was the dominant organisational culture domain pre-accreditation, followed by rational, developmental and group culture, respectively. Following accreditation, hierarchical culture declined but remained dominant, while group and developmental culture increased. However, the decline in hierarchical culture was U-shaped with scores increasing at 15-months post-accreditation, though not to pre-accreditation levels. When stratified by professional group, hierarchical culture declined following accreditation with corresponding increases in group culture and developmental culture among physicians and nurses, respectively. While allied health professionals did not perceive any significant cultural differences directly following accreditation, a significant increase in hierarchical culture and corresponding decrease in group culture was found 15-months post-accreditation. Conclusions: This study suggests the hospital accreditation process may contribute to shifts in staff perception of organisational culture. Our findings also indicate differential views of organisational culture across professional groups. Finally, we note the striking dominance of hierarchical culture in this Hong Kong hospital across all time points, far surpassing other studies, even those in which hierarchical culture prevailed. ? 2019 The Author(s).","accreditation; article; cohort analysis; doctor nurse relation; Hong Kong; human; organizational culture; organizational theory; perception; prospective study; staff; teaching hospital; total quality management; adult; female; health care quality; hospital; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; organization and management; organizational culture; young adult; Accreditation; Adult; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Organizational Culture; Prospective Studies; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Quality Improvement; Young Adult"

"Trends in statin prescription prevalence, initiation, and dosing: Hong Kong, 2004–2015",2019,"Background and aims: Clinical practice guidelines recommend specific statin doses for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Little is known about how statin utilization and dosing have evolved over time in Hong Kong. The aim of this study was to describe trends in statin prevalence, initiation, and dosing from 2004 to 2015. Methods: Patients receiving public health services, who were prescribed a statin, were included if they received a lipid test at a single center (n = 580,672). Using the territory-wide electronic health record, prescribed daily statin dose, nondaily dose frequency, and statin dose intensity were determined for statin prescriptions from 2004 to 2015. Statin prescription prevalence and initiation rates were estimated using the appropriate at-risk population in the hospital catchment area as the denominator. Prescribed daily doses were stratified by primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention status to assess changes in statin dosing over time. Results: The prescription prevalence of statins was higher in 2015 (8.68%; 95% CI, 8.60%–8.75%) as compared with 2004 (1.82%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78%–1.86%). Initiation rates for new statin users increased from 2004 to 2013. High-intensity statins were infrequently prescribed. New users generally had higher statin initiation rates for primary prevention. There were small increases in the prescribed daily doses of statins. Nondaily statin dosing was infrequent (0.42% of all prescriptions). Conclusions: The prevalence and initiation of statin prescriptions increased in Hong Kong, and was in part driven by low-intensity statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","amlodipine plus atorvastatin; atorvastatin; ezetimibe plus simvastatin; fluindostatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; mevinolin; pravastatin; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; adult; aged; Article; electronic health record; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prescription; primary prevention; priority journal; secondary prevention; trend study; very elderly"

In this case report, we describe a Brucella mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm acquired from ingestion of sheep placenta. Clinical symptoms included fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis was confirmed by blood culture and computed tomography (CT) angiography. The patient had increased abdominal pain during hospitalization, and repeated CT showed a rapidly enlarging mycotic aneurysm. Emergent endovascular repair was successfully performed using a bifurcated stent graft, and combined intravenous and oral antibiotics were administrated.

"Disability-specific associations with child health and functioning",2019,"This study examined the health profile of children with different types of disabilities and explored the disability-specific associations with various types of health and functioning using a large nonclinical sample of children. A cross-sectional school survey was conducted during 2016 and 2017. A total of 4114 children (aged 6–18 years) receiving primary or secondary education, or their proxy, in Hong Kong participated in the study. Disabilities were categorized as (a) physical disabilities; (b) learning and developmental disabilities; (c) intellectual disabilities; (d) internalizing disorders or mental illness; and (e) autism spectrum disorder. Health-related quality of life (QoL), sleep-related QoL, activities of daily living (ADL), emotional functioning, and social functioning were assessed and compared between children with disabilities and those without. The results showed that children with disabilities showed poorer physical functioning, health-related QoL, and emotional and social functioning than their counterparts without disabilities. Disability-specific associations with health were found: (a) physical disabilities and intellectual disabilities were associated with greater difficulties in ADL; (b) language impairment and Attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were negatively associated with sleep-related QoL; (c) all types of disabilities but hearing impairment were negatively associated with health-related QoL (HRQoL); and (d) language impairment, ADHD, internalizing disorder, as well as autism spectrum disorder were associated with greater abnormal behavioral difficulties. The findings warrant the development of tailor-made intervention programs and give insights to effective resource allocation for the children in need. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Measuring luteinising hormone pulsatility with a robotic aptamer-enabled electrochemical reader",2019,"Normal reproductive functioning is critically dependent on pulsatile secretion of luteinising hormone (LH). Assessment of LH pulsatility is important for the clinical diagnosis of reproductive disorders, but current methods are hampered by frequent blood sampling coupled to expensive serial immunochemical analysis. Here, we report the development and application of a Robotic APTamer-enabled Electrochemical Reader (RAPTER) electrochemical analysis system to determine LH pulsatility. Through selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), we identify DNA aptamers that bind specifically to LH and not to related hormones. The aptamers are integrated into electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors on a robotic platform. E-AB enables rapid, sensitive and repeatable determination of LH concentration profiles. Bayesian Spectrum Analysis is applied to determine LH pulsatility in three distinct patient cohorts. This technology has the potential to transform the clinical care of patients with reproductive disorders and could be developed to allow real-time in vivo hormone monitoring. ? 2019, The Author(s).","aptamer; DNA; luteinizing hormone; pyroxylin; blood; concentration (composition); detection method; developmental biology; electrochemical method; hormone; secretion; Article; blood sampling; clinical practice; conformational transition; controlled study; dissociation constant; electrochemical analysis; electron transport; endocrine disease; female; human; hypothalamic amenorrhea; potentiometry; robotics"
"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and ischemic heart disease: a Mendelian Randomization study",2019,"Tryptophan is an essential amino acid. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, is positively associated with cardiac events, and may be relevant to cancer. We used Mendelian Randomization to obtain unconfounded estimates of the association of IDO1 with ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke and their risk factors, all-cancer, cancer of the prostate, lung and bronchus, and breast. We obtained genetic instruments independently and strongly (p-value &lt; 5 × 10?8) predicting plasma IDO1 from a proteome genome-wide association study (GWAS), and applied them to consortia GWAS of the outcomes, including the UK Biobank SOFT CAD GWAS (cases &lt; = 76 014, non-cases &lt; = 264 785) for IHD. Estimates were obtained using inverse variance weighting; with MR-Egger, weighted median and MR-PRESSO as sensitivity analyses. IDO1 was inversely associated with IHD (odds ratio (OR) 0.96 per standard deviation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.00, p-value = 0.04), diabetes (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97) and prostate cancer (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99) with a directionally consistent estimate for stroke (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.02) but not with blood pressure, or the other cancers considered.

"Prevention of perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission",2019,"Purpose: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains endemic and continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. It is a global health issue and the World Health Organization aims to eradicate HBV by 2030. Since vertical transmission accounts for the majority of chronic HBV infection, pregnancy offers an excellent opportunity to achieve complete HBV eradication by providing effective immunization of the offspring. Methods: We reviewed recent publications identified from PubMed database using a combination of the relevant keywords for HBV, pregnancy, vertical transmission, immunoprophylaxis failure and antiviral treatment. Results: We summarized the evidence of factors associated with, and measures to reduce and prevent maternal to child transmission, including the use of antiviral treatment during pregnancy to prevent immunoprophylaxis failure. Evidence suggested that highly viremia mother can be offered antenatal antiviral treatment to prevent immunoprophylaxis failure. We elaborated the viral load threshold to start maternal antiviral treatment and the importance of timely neonatal vaccination. A clinical algorithm to manage HBV carriers during pregnancy was proposed. Conclusion: Eradication of HBV is achievable with optimal management of HBV carriers, especially during pregnancy by interruption of vertical transmission. Routine antenatal screening and neonatal immunoprophylaxis remain the key measures to reduce the global HBV burden, and additional antenatal antiviral treatment could further minimize the chance of persistent infection in newborns. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","antivirus agent; creatine kinase; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; lamivudine; telbivudine; tenofovir disoproxil; clinical effectiveness; disease burden; disease transmission; drug safety; evidence based medicine; HELLP syndrome; hepatitis B; human; immunoprophylaxis; infection control; infection prevention; nonhuman; passive immunization; pregnancy; Review; seroconversion; treatment failure; vertical transmission; virus load; virus transmission"
"The Human Alarm System for Sensational News, Online News Headlines, and Associated Generic Digital Footprints: A Uses and Gratifications Approach",2020,"By adopting the uses and gratifications approach to understand two evolutionary needs—the environmental surveillance need and social involvement need—this study investigated the use of alarm and prosocial words in news headlines and the associated generic digital footprints. We analyzed over 170,000 online news headlines and the number of associated clicks and “likes” for each news story on an online news platform. Our results support the idea of a human alarm system for sensational news as a psychological survival mechanism designed to detect and pay attention to threatening news such as catastrophes and diseases. News headlines with alarm words indirectly attracted more “likes,” indicating a concern with survival, through an increased number of clicks to select that news item. Furthermore, the results of a conditional indirect effect model showed that while online readers selectively clicked on news headlines with alarm words, the presence of a prosocial word in the headline increased the likelihood that readers would “like” it. ?

"IVD progenitor cells: a new horizon for understanding disc homeostasis and repair",2019,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is associated with low back pain. In IVDs, a high mechanical load, high osmotic pressure and hypoxic conditions create a hostile microenvironment for resident cells. How IVD homeostasis and function are maintained under stress remains to be understood; however, several research groups have reported isolating native endogenous progenitor-like or otherwise proliferative cells from the IVD. The isolation of such cells implies that the IVD might contain a quiescent progenitor-like population that could be activated for IVD repair and regeneration. Increased understanding of endogenous disc progenitor cells will improve our knowledge of IVD homeostasis and, when combined with tissue engineering techniques, might hold promise for future therapeutic applications. In this Review, the characteristics of progenitor cells in different IVD compartments are discussed, as well as the potency of different cell populations within the IVD. The stem cell characteristics of these cells are also compared with those of mesenchymal stromal cells. On the basis of existing evidence, whether and how IVD degeneration and the hostile microenvironment might affect endogenous progenitor cell function are considered, and ways to channel the potential of these cells for IVD repair are suggested. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","5' nucleotidase; CD11b antigen; CD133 antigen; CD14 antigen; CD19 antigen; CD34 antigen; CD79a antigen; endoglin; HLA DR antigen; octamer transcription factor 4; oxygen; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; Thy 1 membrane glycoprotein; transcription factor NANOG; transcription factor Sox2; antigen expression; cell differentiation; cell function; cell isolation; cell lineage; cell population; cell proliferation; disease association; human; hypoxia; intervertebral disk degeneration; intervertebral disk stem cell; low back pain; mesenchymal stem cell; microenvironment; nonhuman; osmotic pressure; priority journal; protein expression; Review; stem cell; stem cell niche; stem cell transplantation; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; tissue repair; weight bearing"
"Exploring the linkage between the neighborhood environment and mental health in Guangzhou, China",2019,"The relationship between the neighborhood environment and mental health has been investigated mostly in developed countries. Yet few studies have systematically examined the impact of the neighborhood-level built-environment and social environment on mental health within different localities in the Chinese context. Based on a household survey and geographical data in Guangzhou, China, this study aimed to explore the linkage between the neighborhood environment and mental health, with a particular focus on aspects of the built-environment that are related to new urbanism or compact cities and contextual social capital, using three geographic delineations. Our findings indicated that built-environment indicators based on a road network buffer had a higher explanatory power towards residents’ mental health than did those based on a circular buffer. The analytical models demonstrated that neighborhood floor-area ratio, building density, and per capita green area were positively correlated with mental health. Neighborhood safety and contextual neighborhood interactions and reciprocity had positive associations with mental health. These findings provide policy makers and urban planners with valuable information on the role of the compact city strategy and the neighborhood social environment to improve the mental health of residents. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Comparison of dexmedetomidine vs. remifentanil combined with sevoflurane during radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma: A randomized controlled trial 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1103 Clinical Sciences",2019,"Background: Remifentanil is widely used for ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We determined whether dexmedetomidine could be an alternative to remifentanil for RFA of HCC under general anesthesia with sevoflurane. Methods: We prospectively randomized patients scheduled to undergo RFA for HCC to a dexmedetomidine (DEX) group or remifentanil (REMI) group (47 patients each). In the DEX group, a bolus infusion (0.4 μg kg - 1 ) was started 15 min before anesthesia induction and continued at 0.2 μg kg - 1 h - 1 until 10 min before the end of surgery. In the REMI group, 3 μg kg - 1 h - 1 of remifentanil was administered from 15 min before anesthesia induction to the end of the surgery. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain intensity. Secondary endpoints included analgesic requirement, postoperative liver function, patient comfort, and hemodynamic changes. Group allocation was concealed from patients and data analysts but not from anesthesiologists. Results: Postoperative pain intensity, analgesic consumption, comfort, liver function, and time to emergence and extubation did not differ between the two groups. Heart rate, but not mean arterial pressure, was significantly lower in the DEX group than in the REMI group, at 1 min after intubation and from 30 min after the start of the surgery until anesthesia recovery. Sevoflurane concentration and dosage were significantly lower in the DEX group than in the REMI group. Conclusion: During RFA for HCC, low-dose dexmedetomidine reduced the heart rate and need for inhalational anesthetics, without exacerbating postoperative discomfort or liver dysfunction. Although it did not exhibit outstanding advantages over remifentanil in terms of pain management, dexmedetomidine could be a safe alternative adjuvant for RFA under sevoflurane anesthesia.

"Regression of BRAFV600E mutant adult glioblastoma after primary combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor targeted therapy: A report of two cases",2019,"Background: Up to 15% of young adults with glioblastoma have the activating oncogenic BRAFV600E mutation, an actionable target of the MAPK signal transduction pathway governing tumor cell proliferation. Small molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK, a downstream protein immediately following BRAF, have been shown to confer a survival advantage for patients with BRAFV600E mutant advanced melanoma. We describe our experience using this combined target therapy for two patients with BRAFV600E mutant glioblastoma (GBM) as primary treatment due to extenuating clinical circumstances that prohibited the prescription of standard treatment. Case Presentation: The two patients were both 22 years old on presentation. After the initial tumor resection, they both developed rapid deterioration in performance status within a few weeks due to leptomeningeal metastases. In view of the critical condition, BRAF and MEK inhibitors were prescribed as first line treatment. The two patients both achieved dramatic clinical response, which was parallel to the impressive radiological regression of the disease. Unfortunately, the duration of disease control was short as drug resistance developed rapidly. The two patients died 7 and 7.5 month after initial diagnosis of GBM. Conclusions: Primary treatment with inhibitors of BRAF and MEK can lead to tumor regression for patients with BRAFV600E mutant glioblastoma. We therefore recommend that all young GBM patients should undergo BRAFV600E mutation testing, especially for those with unusual aggressive clinical course. ? 2019 Impact Journals LLC.

"Differences Between the East and the West in Managing Advanced-Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer",2020,"Lung cancer is a common cancer associated with high mortality rates worldwide. Unfortunately, it usually presents at a late stage, precluding the chance of curative therapy. The discovery of oncogenic driver mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer over the past 20 years has led to new molecular targeted therapies that have dramatically improved treatment efficacy and quality of life. New generations of therapy that target the drug-resistant mutations have also quickly evolved, benefiting patients who are refractory or intolerant to first-line targeted therapy. Eastern patients, from Southeast Asia, Japan and China, are known to have a higher incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation. Therefore, compared with the West, more patients would benefit from these recent advances. In contrast, survival of patients without driver mutations has benefited from advances in novel therapeutics, including the immune checkpoint inhibitors. The current review aims to highlight the recent developments in the management of advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer and to compare the differences in clinical practice between Eastern and Western countries. ? 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists","alectinib; bevacizumab; brigatinib; carboplatin; ceritinib; cisplatin; erlotinib; etoposide; gefitinib; icotinib; osimertinib; paclitaxel; pembrolizumab; advanced cancer; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer resistance; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; China; cost effectiveness analysis; disease free survival; human; Japan; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; population research; practice guideline; priority journal; progression free survival; prospective study; Southeast Asia"
"Effect of preoperative injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles on rates of sentinel lymph node dissection in women undergoing surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (SentiNot study)",2019,"Background: One-fifth of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have invasive breast cancer (IBC) on definitive histology. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is performed in almost half of women having surgery for DCIS in Sweden. The aim of the present study was to try to minimize unnecessary SLND by injecting superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles at the time of primary breast surgery, enabling SLND to be performed later, if IBC is found in the primary specimen. Methods: Women with DCIS at high risk for the presence of invasion undergoing breast conservation, and patients with DCIS undergoing mastectomy were included. The primary outcome was whether this technique could reduce SLND. Secondary outcomes were number of SLNDs avoided, detection rate and procedure-related costs. Results: This was a preplanned interim analysis of 189 procedures. IBC was found in 47 and a secondary SLND was performed in 41 women. Thus, 78·3 per cent of patients avoided SLND (P < 0·001). At reoperation, SPIO plus blue dye outperformed isotope and blue dye in detection of the sentinel node (40 of 40 versus 26 of 40 women; P <?0·001). Costs were reduced by a mean of 24·5 per cent in women without IBC (3990 versus 5286; P < 0·001). Conclusion: Marking the sentinel node with SPIO in women having surgery for DCIS was effective at avoiding unnecessary SLND in this study.

"Human health risk assessment of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: A review",2019,"The extensive use of antibiotics leading to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance poses high health risks to humans, but to date there is still lack of a quantitative model to properly assess the risks. Concerns over the health risk of antibiotic residues in the environment are mainly (1) the potential hazard of ingested antibiotic residues in the environment altering the human microbiome and promoting emergence and selection for bacteria resistance inhabiting the human body, and (2) the potential hazard of creating a selection pressure on environmental microbiome and leading to reservoirs of antibiotic resistance in the environment. We provide a holistic view of health risk assessment of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment in contrast with that of the antibiotic resistant bacteria and discuss the main knowledge gaps and the future research that should be prioritized to achieve the quantitative risk assessment. We examined and summarized the available data and information on the four core elements of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response assessment, and risk characterization. The data required to characterize the risks of antibiotic residues in the environment is severely limited. The main future research needs have been identified to enable better assessments of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: (1) establishment of a standardized monitoring guide of antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance in the environment, (2) derivation of the relationship between antibiotic levels and pathogenic antibiotic-resistance development in different settings, and (3) establishment of the dose-response relationship between pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria and various infection diseases. After identification of key risk determinant parameters, we propose a conceptual framework of human health risk assessments of antibiotic residues in the environment. Capsule: A holistic view of human health risk assessment of antibiotic residues in the environment was provided. ? 2018 The Authors","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; conceptual framework; dose-response relationship; health risk; infectious disease; literature review; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; air; antibiotic resistance; dose response; drug monitoring; dust; egg; fish; grain; health hazard; human; meat; microbiome; milk; minimum inhibitory concentration; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; shrimp; soil; vegetable; bacterium; risk assessment; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Humans; Risk Assessment"

"Transformable nanotherapeutics enabled by ICG: towards enhanced tumor penetration under NIR light irradiation",2019,"Tumor penetration is the bottleneck for current cancer nanomedicine, limiting the ultimate antitumor efficacy in the clinic. Herein, by exploiting the well-known instability of indocyanine green (ICG), we report the preparation of near infrared (NIR) light responsive nanoparticles (NP) for enhanced tumor penetration. ICG crosslinks hydroxyethyl starch (HES) and doxorubicin (DOX) conjugates (HES-SS-DOX) via noncovalent interactions, facilitating the formation of ICG@HES-SS-DOX NP. The light triggered degradation of ICG leads to the dissociation of such NP, and the resulting HES-SS-DOX has been shown to penetrate deeper in both H22 tumor spheroids and tumor bearing mice, due to the photothermal effect of ICG. Therefore, the disintegrable ICG@HES-SS-DOX NP have better tumor penetration capacity than their counterparts, which originally cannot dissociate under NIR light stimulation. The reported ICG@HES-SS-DOX NP might be potent in treating malignant tumors with dense extracellular matrices, such as liver and pancreatic cancers. This study opens up a novel functionality of FDA-approved ICG for cancer nanotherapeutics. ?

"Choline acetyltransferase–expressing T cells are required to control chronic viral infection",2019,"Although widely studied as a neurotransmitter, T cell–derived acetylcholine (ACh) has recently been reported to play an important role in regulating immunity. However, the role of lymphocyte-derived ACh in viral infection is unknown. Here, we show that the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of ACh production, is robustly induced in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in an IL-21–dependent manner. Deletion of Chat within the T cell compartment in mice ablated vasodilation in response to infection, impaired the migration of antiviral T cells into infected tissues, and ultimately compromised the control of chronic LCMV clone 13 infection. Our results reveal a genetic proof of function for ChAT in T cells during viral infection and identify a pathway of T cell migration that sustains antiviral immunity. ? 2017 The Authors.","choline acetyltransferase; interleukin 21; minoxidil; choline acetyltransferase; interleukin 21; interleukin derivative; cell; enzyme activity; gene expression; hormone; immunity; infectious disease; viral disease; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell compartmentalization; cell migration; Chat gene; controlled study; enzyme mechanism; enzyme synthesis; gene; gene expression; immune response; Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; molecular cloning; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; T lymphocyte; vasodilatation; virus entry; virus infection; animal; C57BL mouse; cell motion; enzymology; female; genetics; immunology; lymphocyte activation; lymphocytic choriomeningitis; male; transgenic mouse; Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; Mus; Animals; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Movement; Choline O-Acetyltransferase; Female; Interleukins; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis; Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Vasodilation"
"The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCF1 is a hepatic oncofetal protein that promotes chemoresistance, EMT and cancer stemness in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate multidrug resistance and cancer stem cell properties in various model systems. Yet, their biological significance in cancers, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of ABCF1 in HCC and explored its potential as a therapeutic target. ABCF1 was highly expressed in fetal mouse livers but not in normal adult livers. ABCF1 expression was upregulated in HCCs. These results demonstrate that ABCF1 functions as a hepatic oncofetal protein. We further demonstrated elevated ABCF1 expression in HCC cells upon acquiring chemoresistance. Suppression of ABCF1 by siRNA sensitized both parental cells and chemoresistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Reversely, ABCF1 overexpression promoted chemoresistance and drug efflux. In addition, overexpression of ABCF1 enhanced migration, spheroid and colony formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction. RNA sequencing analysis revealed EMT inducers HIF1α/IL8 and Sox4 as potential mediators for the oncogenic effect of ABCF1 in HCC progression. Together, this study illustrates that ABCF1 is a novel potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment. ? 2019 The Author(s)","ABC transporter; ABCF1 protein; cisplatin; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; interleukin 18; oncofetal antigen; small interfering RNA; transcription factor Sox4; unclassified drug; ABCF1 gene; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cancer resistance; cancer stemness; carcinoma cell; cell migration; colony formation; controlled study; drug transport; embryo; epithelial mesenchymal transition; fetus; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; oncological parameters; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; RNA sequence; spheroid cell; upregulation"
"Loss of cell adhesion molecule L1 like promotes tumor growth and metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Esophageal squamous cells carcinoma (ESCC) is a major common thoracic tumor characterized by distinctly high incidences and mortality rates. Despite advances in multimodality therapy, the mortality rate of ESCC remains high and understanding of molecular alterations leading to the development and progression of ESCC is still very limited. In this study, a new tumor suppressor candidate, cell adhesion molecule with homology to L1CAM (CHL1), located at 3p26 which was frequently deleted in ESCC was identified. Reduced expression of CHL1 correlated with poor differentiation, increased invasion, and lymph-node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, and decreased overall survival. Methylation-specific PCR and FISH assays revealed that down-regulation of CHL1 in both ESCC cell lines and clinical samples were associated with promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity. Functional studies using lentiviral-based overexpression and knockdown systems provided direct support of CHL1 to function as an important tumor suppressor with both anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis abilities, through Merlin and SEMA3B-Np1-mediated inhibition of AKT signaling pathway. Further characterization of CHL1 may provide a novel therapeutic target in ESCC treatment. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","cell adhesion molecule; cell adhesion molecule L1; merlin; neuropilin 1; semaphorin; semaphorin 3B; unclassified drug; cell adhesion molecule; CHL1 protein, human; adult; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cell differentiation; cell invasion; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme inhibition; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; heterozygosity loss; human; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; metastasis potential; mouse; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; protein depletion; protein expression; protein function; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; cancer staging; cell proliferation; DNA methylation; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; heterozygosity loss; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; promoter region; signal transduction; survival analysis; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; DNA Methylation; Down-Regulation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Loss of Heterozygosity; Male; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Signal Transduction; Survival Analysis"
"Social media addiction: Its impact, mediation, and intervention",2019,"This research examined the relations of social media addiction to college students’ mental health and academic performance, investigated the role of self-esteem as a mediator for the relations, and further tested the effectiveness of an intervention in reducing social media addiction and its potential adverse outcomes. In Study 1, we used a survey method with a sample of college students (N = 232) and found that social media addiction was negatively associated with the students’ mental health and academic performance and that the relation between social media addiction and mental health was mediated by self-esteem. In Study 2, we developed and tested a two-stage self-help intervention program. We recruited a sample of college students (N = 38) who met criteria for social media addiction to receive the intervention. Results showed that the intervention was effective in reducing the students’ social media addiction and improving their mental health and academic efficiency. The current studies yielded original findings that contribute to the empirical database on social media addiction and that have important theoretical and practical implications. ? 2018, Masaryk University.

"Donor limb assessment after vascularized groin lymph node transfer for the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema: Clinical and lymphoscintigraphy findings",2019,"Introduction: Vascularized lymph node transfer is an established treatment for secondary lymphedema. Different donor sites of lymph node flap have been described. In our institute, vascularized groin lymph node (VGLN) flap is the workhorse flap for treating breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Potential complications of VGLN flap harvesting include seroma formation, thigh dysaesthesia, and iatrogenic lymphedema. Methods: Between August 2013 and June 2016, 30 consecutive patients with a mean age of 60 years underwent VGLN transfer for BCRL. Reverse mapping of lower limb lymphatics with patent blue solution was performed in all cases. The donor limb conditions were assessed clinically with limb circumference measurement and radiologically with lymphoscintigraphy. Postoperative lymphoscintigraphy findings and transport indexes were compared between the donor and nonoperated limbs. Results: The mean follow-up period was 22.11 ± 7.83 months. Three (10%) patients developed groin seroma and 18 (60%) patients complained of transient thigh dysaesthesia. There was no clinically detectable donor limb lymphedema. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed at a mean of 13 months after operation. The mean transport indexes of the nonoperated limbs and donor limbs were 2.04 and 3.32, respectively. For the donor limbs, all patients had normal distribution pattern of contrast uptake. No dermal backflow pattern was demonstrated. Conclusion: With good knowledge of groin anatomy and meticulous surgical skills, VGLN flap can be harvested without causing major consequence to the donor limb. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","disulfine blue; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer-related lymphedema; clinical article; donor site; female; follow up; human; iatrogenic disease; inguinal lymph node; limb; limb dysesthesia; lymph vessel; lymphedema; lymphoscintigraphy; normal distribution; priority journal; seroma; surgical technique; tissue flap; vascularization; vascularized groin lymph node flap; breast tumor; complication; diagnostic imaging; inguinal canal; lymph node; lymphedema; middle aged; organ donor; pathology; prospective study; surgical flaps; transplantation; vascularization; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Inguinal Canal; Lymph Nodes; Lymphedema; Lymphoscintigraphy; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Surgical Flaps; Transplant Donor Site"

"Global Disparities in Breast Cancer Genetics Testing, Counselling and Management",2019,"Hereditary breast cancers, mainly due to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, account for only 5–10% of this disease. The threshold for genetic testing is a 10% likelihood of detecting a mutation, as determined by validated models such as BOADICEA and Manchester Scoring System. A 90–95% reduction in breast cancer risk can be achieved with bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy in unaffected BRCA mutation carriers. In patients with BRCA-associated breast cancer, there is a 40% risk of contralateral breast cancer and hence risk-reducing contralateral mastectomy is recommended, which can be performed simultaneously with surgery for unilateral breast cancer. Other options for risk management include surveillance by mammogram and breast magnetic resonance imaging, and chemoprevention with hormonal agents. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and development of multigene panel testing, the cost and time taken for genetic testing have reduced, making it possible for treatment-focused genetic testing. There are also drugs such as the PARP inhibitors that specifically target the BRCA mutation. Risk management multidisciplinary clinics are designed to quantify risk, and offer advice on preventative strategies. However, such services are only possible in high-income settings. In low-resource settings, the prohibitive cost of testing and the lack of genetic counsellors are major barriers to setting up a breast cancer genetics service. Family history is often not well documented because of the stigma associated with cancer. Breast cancer genetics services remain an unmet need in low- and middle-income countries, where the priority is to optimise access to quality treatment. ? 2019, Soci?t?

"Apparent diffusion coefficient as an imaging biomarker for spinal disease activity in axial spondyloarthritis",2019,"Background: A quantifiable imaging measure to gauge the intensity of individual inflammatory lesions in axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) has not been well established. Previous studies have shown that diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI reflects disease activity in axial SpA. Purpose: To determine the association between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at MRI of discovertebral lesions and disease activity in individuals with axial SpA. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 243 study participants (mean age 6 standard deviation, 43.2 years 6 13.5) with back pain who fulfilled the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria for SpA were recruited from four rheumatology centers between April 2014 and March 2018. There were 132 men (mean age, 41.4 years 6 13.3) and 111 women (mean age, 45.3 years 6 13.4). Clinical, biochemical, and radiologic parameters were collected. All participants underwent whole-spine MRI by using a short inversion time inversion-recovery sequence and DW imaging. Two independent readers identified the presence of discovertebral lesions. ADCs were measured and normalized with normal bone marrow. Regression analysis was performed to determine association between the mean, maximum, and normalized mean and maximum ADCs of the discovertebral lesions and disease activity and functional parameters (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI], Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI], and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global Index [BASGI]). Results: Ninety-one discovertebral lesions (five cervical, 61 thoracic, 25 lumbar) were present in 55 of the 243 study participants (22.6%). After adjusting for confounding factors, increased maximum ADC was independently associated with increased BASFI (regression coefficient [b] = 1.94 [×1023 mm2/sec], P = .04). Increased normalized maximum ADC was independently associated with BASDAI question 2 (ie, back pain score) (b = 0.45, P = .01), mean stiffness score (b = 0.41, P = .04), and BASGI (b = 0.43, P = .04). Increased normalized mean ADC was independently associated with BASDAI question 2 (b = 0.61, P = .04). Conclusion: Apparent diffusion coefficients at MRI of discovertebral lesions were associated with disease activity, functional impairment, and patient global assessment in axial spondyloarthritis. ?

"Relating the blood-thinning effect of pentoxifylline to the reduction in the elastic modulus of human red blood cells: An: in vivo study",2019,"The blood thinning properties of pentoxifylline have been attributed to its ability to increase the deformability of red blood cells and improve their rheological properties. To interpret and substantiate these observations a novel approach is taken by measuring the stiffness of individual red blood cells from healthy humans before and after subscription to pentoxifylline for nine days. Atomic force microscopy nanoindentation experiments reveal that the elastic modulus of the red blood cells decreased by 30%-40%, after pentoxifylline subscription. This decrease in elastic modulus is related to the ability of pentoxifylline to increase the production of ATP and lower Ca2+ concentrations in red blood cells. The present in vivo experiments provide a deeper understanding of the mode of action of pentoxifylline, and pave the way to using indentation in medicine. A further unique advantage of this study is that it was performed on healthy volunteers, rather than requiring in vitro incubation. ?

"Roles of methylated DNA biomarkers in patients with colorectal cancer",2019,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cancer globally; therefore, early diagnosis and surveillance of this cancer are of paramount importance. Current methods of CRC diagnosis rely heavily on endoscopy or radiological imaging. Noninvasive tests including serum detection of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) are associated with low sensitivity and specificity, especially at early stages. DNA methylation biomarkers have recently been found to have higher accuracy in CRC detection and enhanced prediction of prognosis and chemotherapy response. The most widely studied biomarker in CRC is methylated septin 9 (SEPT9), which is the only FDA-approved methylation-based biomarker for CRC. Apart from SEPT9, other methylated biomarkers including tachykinin-1 (TAC1), somatostatin (SST), and runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) have been shown to effectively detect CRC in a multitude of sample types. This review will discuss the performances of various methylated biomarkers used for CRC diagnosis and monitoring, when used alone or in combination. ? 2019 Zhiyao Ma et al.","carcinoembryonic antigen; DNA; septin; septin 9; somatomedin binding protein 3; somatostatin; tachykinin; tachykinin 1; transcription factor RUNX3; tumor marker; Twist related protein 1; unclassified drug; tumor marker; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; colorectal cancer; DNA methylation; human; occult blood test; Review; colorectal tumor; genetics; pathology; Biomarkers, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Methylation; Humans"
"Emerging challenges in pharmacotherapy research on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder—outcome measures beyond symptom control and clinical trials",2019,"Although pharmacological therapies are recommended as a key component in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, their use continues to prompt intense debate. Despite considerable research efforts, several gaps in the knowledge base and several questions over the quality of evidence exist. Particular issues surrounding pharmacological treatments include uncertainties about long-term effectiveness and safety, safety profiles in adults, and the comparative effectiveness of different medications. In this Review, we focus on four key methodological issues for future research: (1) the use of appropriate trial designs; the need for (2) outcome measures targeting effectiveness beyond symptom control and (3) safety outcome measures; and (4) the application of clinical and administrative research databases to assess real-world outcomes. Potential solutions include increased use of randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal trials and large pharmacoepidemiological studies that use electronic health-care records on the long-term effectiveness and safety of medications. Pragmatic head-to-head randomised trials would also provide direct evidence on comparative effectiveness and safety profiles. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","attention deficit disorder; comparative effectiveness; electronic health record; human; knowledge base; outcome assessment; patient safety; pharmacoepidemiology; priority journal; Review; study design; attention deficit disorder; child; clinical trial (topic); evidence based medicine; female; male; methodology; personalized medicine; treatment outcome; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Clinical Trials as Topic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Precision Medicine; Research Design; Treatment Outcome"
"Methylated Septin 9 and Carcinoembryonic Antigen for Serological Diagnosis and Monitoring of Patients with Colorectal Cancer After Surgery",2019,"With the increasing incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC), early and accurate diagnosis is of paramount priority to combat this cancer. Epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation are innovative biomarkers for CRC, due to their stability, frequency, and accessibility in bodily fluids. In this study, blood samples were prospectively collected from patients before and after operation for CRC for determination of methylated septin 9 (mSEPT9) and compared to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The sensitivity of using mSEPT9 methylation status for diagnosing CRC was significantly higher than using elevated CEA levels (73.2% vs 48.2%; p value < 0.001). The sensitivities of both tests increased with higher tumor staging (P = 0.004 and 0.04 respectively). Combined mSEPT9 and CEA had higher accuracy than single CEA or mSEPT9 (P = 0.009 and 0.532 separately). An increase in the methylation level of mSEPT9 detected in the post-operative samples was associated with a higher mortality rate (15.2% vs 1.8%; P = 0.024) and the presence of metastasis (27.3% vs 7.0%; P = 0.013). mSEPT9 was more sensitive than CEA for diagnosing CRC, and combined mSEPT9 and CEA was more accurate. After curative resection, detection of increased mSEPT9 methylation level may indicate adverse outcomes. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Is the safety-in-numbers effect still observed in areas with low pedestrian activities? A case study of a suburban area in the United States",2019,"In previous studies, the safety-in-numbers effect has been found, which is a phenomenon that when the number of pedestrians or cyclists increases, their crash rates decrease. The previous studies used data from highly populated areas. It is questionable that the safety-in-numbers effect is still observed in areas with a low population density and small number of pedestrians. Thus, this study aims at analyzing pedestrian crashes in a suburban area in the United States and exploring if the safety-in-numbers effect is also observed. We employ a Bayesian random-parameter Poisson-lognormal model to evaluate the safety-in-numbers effects of each intersection, which can account for the heterogeneity across the observations. The results show that the safety-in-numbers effect were found only at 32 intersections out of 219. The intersections with the safety-in-numbers effect have relatively larger pedestrian activities whereas those without the safety-in-numbers effect have extremely low pedestrian activities. It is concluded that just encouraging walking might result in serious pedestrian safety issues in a suburban area without sufficient pedestrian activities. Therefore, it is plausible to provide safe walking environment first with proven countermeasures and a people-oriented policy rather than motor-oriented. After safe walking environments are guaranteed and when people recognize that walking is safe, more people will consider walking for short-distance trips. Eventually, increased pedestrian activities will result in the safety-in-numbers effects and walking will be even further safer. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian networks; Codes (symbols); Population statistics; Bayesian approaches; Log-normal model; Pedestrian crashes; Population densities; Random parameter model; Random parameters; Safety in numbers; Walking environments; Pedestrian safety; Bayes theorem; environmental planning; human; pedestrian; policy; population density; safety; suburban population; traffic accident; United States; walking; Accidents, Traffic; Bayes Theorem; Environment Design; Humans; Pedestrians; Policy; Population Density; Safety; Suburban Population; United States; Walking"
"Safety and immunogenicity of an 8 year interval heterologous prime-boost influenza A/H7N7-H7N9 vaccination",2019,"Background: Influenza A/H7N9 viruses are undergoing antigenic drift since their emergence in 2013, and vaccination strategies are needed for pandemic preparedness. Two doses of adjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine (IIV1 A/H7N9) are needed for optimal serological responses. However, administering 2 doses in a pandemic setting might be challenging. We evaluated the immunogenicity of “boosting” with IIV1 A/H7N9 in subjects “primed” 8 years previously with IIV1 A/H7N7. Methods: We administered 1 booster dose containing 45 mcg of IIV1 A/H7N9 hemagglutinin to 17 recipients of 2 prior doses of IIV1 A/H7N7, and to 10 influenza A/H7-na?ve subjects. We tested their post-boosting sera for antibodies (Ab) against homologous influenza A/H7N9 using a hemagglutination inhibition assay; and compared their Ab titers to those in stored sera from recipients of AS03-adjuvanted IIV1 A/H7N9 against 9 strains of influenza A/H7N9 viruses. Results: The percentage of subjects with Ab titers ?40 on Days 9 and 29 post boosting, respectively, was 65% and 41% in primed subjects and 10% and 0% in unprimed subjects. The Ab titers in recipients of AS03-adjuvanted IIV1 A/H7N9 were higher than those in the prime-boost group against a panel of influenza A/H7N9 viruses, except for 2 highly pathogenic strains. Conclusions: Priming with IIV1 A/H7 results in serological responses following a delayed boost with 1 dose of unadjuvanted IIV1 A/H7N9, despite lack of antibody response after the prime. Optimizing prime-boost approaches would benefit pandemic preparedness.

"Course, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of disordered eating in pregnancy",2019,"Objective: Although eating disorders in pregnancy have been studied extensively, little research attention has been given to disordered eating. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence and levels of disordered eating in the perinatal period, and to identify risk factors and adverse outcomes of disordered eating during pregnancy. Method: A prospective longitudinal design with a quantitative approach was adopted. A consecutive sample of 1,470 Chinese pregnant women from hospitals in Hong Kong was assessed using standardized instruments at five time points from the first trimester to 6 months postpartum. Results: The levels of disordered eating changed significantly across trimesters. Higher levels of disordered eating in pregnancy were significantly associated with higher levels of disordered eating at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum, greater anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower 1-min Apgar scores, and abnormal birth weight. Discussion: The present study pointed to the need for more research and clinical attention to antenatal disordered eating given that it is associated with anxiety, depression, postpartum disordered eating and obstetric outcomes. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; anxiety disorder; Apgar score; Article; body weight disorder; Chinese; controlled study; depression; disease course; eating disorder; female; first trimester pregnancy; Hong Kong; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; perinatal period; pregnancy; pregnancy disorder; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; puerperium; quantitative study; risk factor; complication; eating disorder; pregnancy complication; psychology; risk factor; Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"Vascular progenitor cell senescence in patients with Marfan syndrome",2019,"Vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) present in the adventitia of the vessel wall play a critical role in the regulation of vascular repair following injury. This study aimed to assess the function of VPCs isolated from patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). VPCs were isolated from control and MFS donors and characterized. Compared with control-VPCs, MFS-VPCs exhibited cellular senescence as demonstrated by increased cell size, higher SA-β-gal activity and elevated levels of p53 and p21. RNA sequencing showed that several cellular process-related pathways including cell cycle and cellular senescence were significantly enriched in MFP-VPCs. Notably, the expression level of TGF-β1 was much higher in MFS-VPCs than control-VPCs. Treatment of control-VPCs with TGF-β1 significantly enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (ROS) and induced cellular senescence whereas inhibition of ROS reversed these effects. MFS-VPCs displayed increased mitochondrial fusion and decreased mitochondrial fission. Treatment of control-VPCs with TGF-β1 increased mitochondrial fusion and reduced mitochondrial fission. Nonetheless, treatment of mitofusin2 (Mfn2)-siRNA inhibited TGF-β1-induced mitochondrial fusion and cellular senescence. Furthermore, TGF-β1-induced mitochondrial fusion was mediated by the AMPK signalling pathway. Our study shows that TGF-β1 induces VPC senescence in patients with MFS by mediating mitochondrial dynamics via the AMPK signalling pathway. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Stress and burden faced by family caregivers of people with schizophrenia and early psychosis in Hong Kong",2019,"Background/Aim: Families, especially in Chinese society, play a crucial role in care provision for relatives with schizophrenia, but the burden of caregiving has shown to cause significant distress among caregivers. The aim of the study is to assess the degree of stress and burden among caregivers of relatives with schizophrenia and early psychosis in Hong Kong. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 454 caregivers recruited from two mental health non-governmental organisations and the outpatient clinic of a psychiatric hospital. Data were collected through a questionnaire administered via face-to-face or telephone interview. Results: Caregivers attributed most of their conflicts with the ill relative or other family members to their own lack of knowledge of patient symptoms (56.4%), other family members’ lack of knowledge of patient symptoms (46.9%) or the ill relative's refusal to take medications (43.0%). Most of the caregivers had corresponding stress scores of 5 (scale: 1–5; mean = 3.88, 3.85 and 4.19, respectively). Nearly, a third (30.2%) of the caregivers surveyed reported an overall stress score of 5 (mean = 3.56). Regarding psychosocial problems, 78.0%, 49.8% and 45.8% of caregivers experienced anxiety, reduced socialising and insomnia, respectively. Conclusions: Caregivers of relatives with schizophrenia and early psychosis experience significant stress and psychosocial burden. To help them cope with distress, community support services should be strengthened. Moreover, long-acting injectable antipsychotics are worth considering to alleviate caregiver burden due to ill relatives’ medication compliance issues. ? 2019 Royal Australasian College of Physicians","adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; caregiver burden; cross-sectional study; distress syndrome; female; Hong Kong; human; insomnia; major clinical study; male; priority journal; psychosocial disorder; schizophrenia; scoring system; social behavior; treatment refusal; adolescent; caregiver; clinical trial; coping behavior; cost of illness; epidemiology; family health; mental stress; middle aged; multicenter study; psychological rating scale; psychology; psychosis; questionnaire; schizophrenia; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Health; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Effluents of wastewater treatment plants promote the rapid stabilization of the antibiotic resistome in receiving freshwater bodies",2019,"Treated wastewater discharged into the environment acts as a disturbance of the natural microbial communities in terms of taxonomic composition and of functional gene pool, including antibiotic resistance genes. We tested whether stochastic and heterogeneous site-specific trajectories or generalities, potentially driven by deterministic processes, control the fate of allochthonous bacteria from anthropogenic sources and the persistence of their functional traits in freshwater. Finding generalities would allow the identification of wastewater treatments that could be effective in abating determinants of antibiotic resistance. We analysed the short-term response of native bacterial communities in waters exposed to the disturbance of wastewater at different dilutions, using a metagenomic approach that revealed both microbial community composition and the scope and abundance of the resistome that can pose indirect risks to human health. We found that the taxonomic composition of the communities after the disturbance was driven by case-specific stochastic processes, whereas the resistome had a deterministic trajectory, rapidly stabilising its functional traits with higher proportions of wastewater effluents, regardless of differences in taxonomic composition, richness of antibiotic resistance genes and of bacterial taxa, phenotypic features of the bacterial communities, and type of wastewater treatment. The observed deterministic proliferation of resistomes in freshwater bodies receiving wastewater effluents, suggests that this process may contribute to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance, and thus calls for new legislations promoting alternative tertiary treatments for the wastewater reuse, and targeting bacterial functional traits and not only bacterial abundances. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Convergence of numerical methods; Effluents; Genes; Health risks; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Wastewater reclamation; Water; Allochthonous bacteria; Antibiotic resistance genes; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Microbiome; Resistance genes; Wastewater effluents; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; bacitracin; beta lactam antibiotic; bleomycin; carbomycin; chloramphenicol; fosfomycin; fosmidomycin; fresh water; kasugamycin; macrolide; peracetic acid; polymyxin; puromycin; quinolone; rifamycin; RNA 16S; sulfonamide; tetracycline; trimethoprim; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; fresh water; abundance; bacterium; community composition; gene; health risk; microbial community; stabilization; taxonomy; wastewater treatment plant; Aeromonas; aminoglycoside resistance; antibiotic resistome; Arcobacter; Article; bacterial cell; beta-lactam resistance; Brevibacterium; chloramphenicol resistance; chlorination; Deinococcus; disinfection; effluent; fluoroquinolone resistance; freshwater environment; health hazard; high throughput sequencing; hospital waste; industrial waste; lake ecosystem; macrolide resistance; Markov chain; metagenomics; microbial community; nonhuman; polymyxin resistance; population abundance; priority journal; river ecosystem; species composition; taxonomic rank; tetracycline resistance; trimethoprim resistance; ultraviolet radiation; urban area; vancomycin resistance; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; human; waste water; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Fresh Water; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Waste Water"
"Increased GITRL impairs the function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and exacerbates primary sj?gren syndrome",2019,"Although the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) has been reported in autoimmune disorders, it is largely unclear how MDSCs contribute to the development of primary Sj?gren syndrome (pSS). In this study, we found significantly increased MDSCs with gradually diminished suppressive capacity during disease development in mice with experimental Sj?gren syndrome (ESS). The ligand for glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein (GITRL) was increased along ESS progression, whereas the increased GITRL was found to attenuate the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs. Moreover, blocking GITR signal in MDSCs significantly restored their immunosuppressive function and alleviated ESS progression in mice. In pSS patients, expanded MDSCs were found to express low levels of arginase. Significantly increased serum GITRL levels were closely correlated with patients with higher Sj?gren syndrome disease activity index. Furthermore, treatment with recombinant GITRL markedly reduced the immunosuppressive function of human MDSCs. Together, our studies have demonstrated a critical role of GITRL in modulating the suppressive function of MDSCs, which may facilitate the validation of GITRL as a therapeutic target for the treatment of pSS. ? 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","arginase; glucocorticoid induced TNFR family related protein; glucocorticoid induced TNFR family related protein ligand; ligand; membrane protein; recombinant glucocorticoid induced TNFR family related protein ligand; recombinant protein; unclassified drug; TNFSF18 protein, human; Tnfsf18 protein, mouse; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell activity; cell damage; cell function; clinical article; controlled study; disease activity; disease course; disease exacerbation; experimental disease; female; human; human cell; immunomodulation; immunopathogenesis; mouse; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; signal transduction; Sjoegren syndrome; validation study; adult; animal; C57BL mouse; immunology; male; metabolism; middle aged; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; Sjoegren syndrome; Adult; Animals; Female; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Middle Aged; Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells; Sjogren's Syndrome; Tumor Necrosis Factors"
"Long-Term Outcomes of the Benefit-Finding Group Intervention for Alzheimer Family Caregivers: A Cluster-Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial",2019,"Objectives: To examine the effects of the group benefit-finding therapeutic intervention (BFT) for Alzheimer family caregivers up to 10-month follow-up. Methods: This was a cluster-randomized double-blind controlled trial in social centers and clinics. Participants included 129 caregivers. Inclusion criteria were 1) primary caregiver aged 18 years and older and without cognitive impairment, 2) providing 14 or more care hours per week to a relative with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease, and 3) scoring 3 or more on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Exclusion criterion was care-recipient having parkinsonism or other forms of dementia. BFT (using cognitive reappraisal to find positive meanings) was evaluated against two forms of psychoeducation as controls—standard and simplified (lectures only) psychoeducation. All interventions had eight weekly sessions of 2 hours each. Primary outcome was depressive symptoms, whereas secondary outcomes were global burden, role overload, and psychological well-being. Measures were collected at baseline, postintervention, and 4- and 10-month follow-up. Results: Mixed-effects regression showed that BFT's effect on depressive symptoms conformed to a curvilinear pattern, in which the strong initial effect leveled out after postintervention and was maintained up to 10-month follow-up; this was true when compared against either control group. The effect on global burden was less impressive but moderate effect sizes were found at the two follow-ups. For psychological well-being, there was an increase in the BFT group at 4-month follow-up and a return to baseline afterward. No effect on role overload was found. Conclusion: Benefit-finding reduces depressive symptoms as well as global burden in the long-term and increases psychological well-being in the medium-term. ? 2019 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","adult; Alzheimer disease; Article; benefit finding therapeutic intervention; benefit-finding; caregiver; caregiver burden; caregiver support; cognitive defect; controlled study; depression; disease burden; female; follow up; functional disease; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; male; psychoeducation; psychological well-being; randomized controlled trial"
"Companion animal ownership and human well-being in a metropolis—The case of Hong Kong",2019,"Global urbanization has given cause for a re-assessment of the nature and importance of the relationship between humans and domesticated animals. In densely-populated urban societies, where loneliness and alienation can be prevalent, the use of animals as human companions has taken on heightened importance. Hong Kong is the world’s most urbanised political entity, and thus provides an ideal context for the exploration of the role of animals in the provision of companionship for human beings in cities. A web-based survey with descriptive analyses, regression, and ANOVA was conducted. Six-hundred-and-forty-seven companion animal owners and 312 non-owners completed the survey that examined their socio-demographic information, companion animal ownership status, and physical-psychosocial well-being. The statistically significant findings appear to suggest that socio-demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, housing, and education level) have stronger predictive values than companion animal ownership status with respect to the well-being of people in Hong Kong. Due the unique environmental features in Hong Kong, the positive impacts of companion animal ownership on the physical well-being of owners may be limited by the city’s cramped living space and the limited number of people who own companion animals. However, results suggested that companion animals may still serve as a social lubricant between the owners and their significant others, thereby playing a heightened role significant role in enhancing general social connectedness in a metropolis. Given the importance of animals as human companions, it is suggested that relevant administrative agencies need to consider the development of policies and facilities which are conducive to both the maintenance and development of the bonds between humans and their companion animals and the physical and psychosocial health of both. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Atrial fibrillation and risk of dementia: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and effect of anticoagulation",2019,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the cardiovascular risk factors for dementia. Several longitudinal studies have reported an association between AF and dementia independently of stroke history. Although the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood, proposed mechanisms include cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation, genetic factors, cerebral microbleeds, and recurrent silent cerebral ischemia. Oral anticoagulation can be used to minimize risk of cognitive decline and dementia, given that brain insults can be caused by chronic microemboli or microbleeds. However, controversy on the effects of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants on this risk exists. This article will address these aspects, with data on the studies already published and a critical view on this subject. ? 2019 Silva, Miranda, Liu, Tse and Roever.","anticoagulant agent; age; Alzheimer disease; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; Article; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; dementia; disease course; drug effect; human; pathogenesis; prevalence; risk factor; risk reduction; therapy effect"
"Effects of urbanization on metabolic syndrome via dietary intake and physical activity in Chinese adults: Multilevel mediation analysis with latent centering",2019,"Rationale: China has undergone rapid urbanization in the past decades. Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors such as abdominal obesity, raised blood pressure, and elevated glucose. Existing studies have not explicitly examined the urbanization effect on metabolic syndrome. Objective: The present study aims to examine the temporal effects of urbanization on metabolic syndrome in the Chinese context and evaluate dietary intake and physical activity as potential mediating factors. Method: The study sample comprised 6,217 Chinese adults aged between 30 and 65 recruited in 218 communities from 2000 to 2009 waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Growth in urbanization of the communities was derived using latent growth modeling on continuous urbanization index from 2000 to 2009. The participants reported their physical activity and dietary intake. Body mass index and biomarkers were measured at 2009 for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Multilevel mediation analysis with novel latent centering approach was conducted across gender to evaluate direct and indirect effects of urbanization on metabolic syndrome via changes in dietary intake and physical activity. Results: The sample displayed linear increasing trends in urbanization, intakes of red meat, dairy products and fast food and declining cereal intake and physical activity with significant inter-individual variations. Controlling for individual-level and community-level covariates, urbanization showed a positive but non-significant direct effect on metabolic syndrome across gender. There were significant and positive indirect effects from urbanization to metabolic syndrome via changes in physical activity in males and via changes in fast food intake in females. Conclusions: The present results highlight the health impact of urbanization as a dynamic process at the community level on metabolic syndrome via different indirect pathways of lifestyle factors across gender. Methodological and practical implications are discussed in relation to these modifiable lifestyle factors in the urbanizing Chinese society. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; body mass; dietary intake; health risk; lifestyle; longitudinal gradient; metabolism; modernization; nutrition; physical activity; public health; risk factor; urbanization; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cereal; China; Chinese; controlled study; dairy product; dietary intake; disease marker; fast food; female; food analysis; health survey; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; nutritional health; physical activity; red meat; trend study; urbanization; China"
"Incident Type 2 Diabetes in OSA and Effect of CPAP Treatment: A Retrospective Clinic Cohort Study",2019,"Background: The relationship between OSA and glucose metabolism remains controversial. This retrospective study investigated the relationship between OSA and incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a clinic cohort of Chinese adults in Hong Kong, and the effect of long-term CPAP treatment. Methods: Data for diagnosis of incident T2D and CPAP usage were obtained from the territory-wide electronic health administration system and records of protocolized evaluation of CPAP adherence at the sleep clinic. The relationship between baseline OSA and incident T2D and the effect of CPAP therapy were examined by Cox regression models. Risk of incident T2D over the continuum of apnea-hypopnea index was examined with cubic spline analysis. Results: Of 1,206 subjects with overnight sleep studies and clinical assessment in 2006 through 2013, 152 developed diabetes (median follow-up, 7.3 years). In fully adjusted models, untreated moderate or patients with severe OSA had higher risk of developing diabetes, hazard ratios 2.01 (95% CI, 1.06-3.81) and 2.62 (95% CI, 1.40-4.93) respectively, with a trend to plateau in those with severe OSA. No interaction was demonstrated between OSA and obesity. Regular CPAP use, which was attained in about one-third of subjects with moderate-severe OSA, was associated with reduction of diabetes incidence from 3.41 to 1.61 per 100 person-years, and of adjusted hazard risk to that of non-OSA. Conclusions: OSA severity independently predicted incident diabetes. Regular long-term CPAP use was associated with reduced risk of incident T2D, after adjustment for various baseline metabolic risk factors and subsequent body weight change. ? 2019","adult; apnea hypopnea index; Article; body mass; Chinese; cohort analysis; disease severity; female; hazard ratio; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oxygen desaturation; oxygen desaturation index; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; retrospective study; sleep disordered breathing; waist circumference"
"A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial of Strengths Model Case Management in Hong Kong",2019,"Purpose: This study evaluates the effectiveness of the strengths model of case management (SMCM) for people with severe mental illness in Hong Kong. This is the first controlled trial outside the United States to investigate the impacts of SMCM on caseworkers as well as service users alongside fidelity measures. Method: Service users and their caseworkers were recruited from three types of supported accommodation for this 12-month nonrandomized controlled trial. Mixed modeling was used to investigate within-subject differences. Results: Results indicated that SMCM was effective in helping users progress toward their recovery goals and in alleviating emotional exhaustion among caseworkers. However, it was ineffective in improving, hope, well-being, work alliance, and psychiatric symptoms. High intervention fidelity was associated with positive outcomes. Conclusions: Conceptually, SMCM has the potential to improve service users’ functional but not personal recovery. It is also potentially conducive to the well-being of caseworkers. ?

"Associations of growth from birth to puberty with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years: evidence from Hong Kong’s “Children of 1997” birth cohort",2019,"The role of early growth in later health is controversial. We examined the associations of growth at different phases from birth to puberty with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years. In the population-representative “Children of 1997” birth cohort, growth was measured as (i) weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at birth and WAZ gains from 0 to 2 and 2 to 8 years and (ii) body-mass-index-for-age z score (BAZ) and length/height-for-age z score (LAZ) at 3 months and BAZ and LAZ gains from 3 months to 3 years, 3 to 8 years and 8 to 14 years, based on the World Health Organization growth standards/references. Adjusted partial least squares regression was used to assess simultaneously the associations of growth with height-, age- and sex-specific systolic (SBPZ) and diastolic blood pressure z scores (DBPZ), low- (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TG) at ~17.5 years. Among 3410 children, higher WAZ, BAZ and LAZ gains from initial size to 8 years were associated with higher SBPZ. Higher gains in WAZ and BAZ from 2 to 8 years were consistently associated with higher DBPZ, LDL and TG and lower HDL. Lower LAZ at 3 months and higher LAZ gain from 3 months to 3 years were associated with lower HDL and higher TG. Greater growth in weight, body mass index and length/height had negative associations with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years, but the differences by growth measure, phase and outcome suggest a complex underlying process. ? 2018, The Japanese Society of Hypertension.","cholesterol oxidase; growth factor; high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; peroxidase; triacylglycerol; adolescent; age; Article; birth weight; blood pressure; body height; body mass; breast feeding; child; child growth; colorimetry; diastolic blood pressure; education; female; human; hypertension; immunization; infant; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; obesity; partial least squares regression; passive smoking; prevalence; risk factor; sex difference; sphygmomanometry; systolic blood pressure; underweight"
"Potent immunomodulation and angiogenic effects of mesenchymal stem cells versus cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells for treatment of heart failure",2019,"Background: Optimal cell type as cell-based therapies for heart failure (HF) remains unclear. We sought to compare the safety and efficacy of direct intramyocardial transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs) in a porcine model of HF. Methods: Eight weeks after induction of HF with myocardial infarction (MI) and rapid pacing, animals with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were randomly assigned to receive direct intramyocardial injection of saline (MI group), 2 × 108 hESC-CMs (hESC-CM group), or 2 × 108 hiPSC-MSCs (hiPSC-MSC group). The hearts were harvested for immunohistochemical evaluation after serial echocardiography and hemodynamic evaluation and ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) induction by in vivo programmed electrical stimulation. Results: At 8 weeks post-transplantation, LVEF, left ventricular maximal positive pressure derivative, and end systolic pressure-volume relationship were significantly higher in the hiPSC-MSC group but not in the hESC-CM group compared with the MI group. The incidence of early spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) episodes was higher in the hESC-CM group but the incidence of inducible VT was similar among the different groups. Histological examination showed no tumor formation but hiPSC-MSCs exhibited a stronger survival capacity by activating regulatory T cells and reducing the inflammatory cells. In vitro study showed that hiPSC-MSCs were insensitive to pro-inflammatory interferon-gamma-induced human leukocyte antigen class II expression compared with hESC-CMs. Moreover, hiPSC-MSCs also significantly enhanced angiogenesis compared with other groups via increasing expression of distinct angiogenic factors. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that transplantation of hiPSC-MSCs is safe and does not increase proarrhythmia or tumor formation and superior to hESC-CMs for the improvement of cardiac function in HF.

Much effort has focused on the statistical and biological interpretation of such effect measure modification (EMM) because of the importance to public health. However, EMM remains difficult to conceptualize because it apparently violates everyday understanding of causes as usually acting consistently, making it difficult to predict when EMM may occur and raises questions about how to determine the external validity of interventions without extensive retesting by population or subpopulation. Study Design and Setting: Methods exposition. Results: We propose that EMM can be thought of as mediation of an intervention (or exposure) on outcome by mechanism(s) whose relevance differs between population groups, which can be illustrated in causal diagrams, that is, directed acyclic graphs and selection diagrams, meaning external validity can be formally considered as mediation according to “selection variables.” EMM can then be represented graphically and its consequences predicted. Conclusion: This new conceptualization of EMM transforms EMM from a concept that violates everyday understanding of causes into an insight generating means of thinking about interventions (or exposures) in terms of their mediating mechanism(s) and corresponding population- or subpopulation-specific attributes to help target interventions effectively. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","article; external validity; human; human experiment; population group; thinking"

"Compulsory mental health treatment in Hong Kong: Which way forward?",2019,"On 25 to 26 August 2017, the 'Compulsory Mental Health Treatment in Hong Kong: Which Way Forward?' conference was held in Hong Kong. Academics and practitioners from the United Kingdom, United States, New Zealand, and Hong Kong came together to discuss such important topics as the philosophical justifications for compulsory treatment, constitutional and human rights, and how compulsory powers are and should be used in practice. Speakers and conference participants then engaged in roundtable discussions on various issues that arose, in particular how reform of the law regulating compulsory mental health treatment in Hong Kong should proceed. ? 2019 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.","adult; female; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; human rights; involuntary commitment; male; mental health; New Zealand; physician; review; United Kingdom; United States; ethics; Hong Kong; mental disease; mental health; organization; procedures; Congresses as Topic; Hong Kong; Humans; Involuntary Treatment, Psychiatric; Mental Disorders; Mental Health"
"The Effects of Recovery-Oriented Cognitive–Behavior Approach for Chinese With Severe Mental Illness",2019,"Purpose: Hope and meaning in life are essential components of personal growth and happiness. Built on the recovery model, this study attempted to evaluate the effects of a recovery-oriented cognitive–behavior approach (CBA) in enhancing hope and meaning in life among a group of people with severe mental illness in Hong Kong. Method: A matched-pair comparison approach was adopted. Twenty-seven experimental group participants received recovery-oriented CBA, while 25 participants received standard counseling services. Assessments were administered at preintervention and at 6 and 12 months of intervention. Results: Repeated measures analyses of covariance indicated that the recovery-oriented CBA was more effective than the control condition in improving the mental health recovery process (basic functioning, finding new potentials, and spirituality) and a sense of hope (planning in achieving goals). Conclusion: Given these initial positive results, more vigorous studies and refinement of this recovery-oriented CBA are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of this combined intervention approach. ?

"How Might Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) Inhibitors Operate in Cardiovascular Disease?",2019,"Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors, acting via epigenetic mechanisms, have been developed recently as potential new treatments for cancer, including prostate cancer, and inflammatory conditions. Some BET inhibitors, such as RVX-208, also raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-1 levels. A recent meta-analysis of three small trials (n = 798) found that RVX-208 protected against major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), raising the question as to whether this protective effect was an artefact, a chance finding, or mediated by HDL-C, anti-inflammatory pathways, or other factors. Notably, the effect of RVX-208 on MACE was largely driven by revascularizations, but fewer interventions in the treatment arm could have arisen accidently from favorable effects of RVX-208 on HDL-C and C-reactive protein influencing decisions about patient care. A larger (n = 2400) trial of RVX-208, BETonMACE (NCT02586155), with a more restricted definition of MACE, excluding hospitalizations, will shortly provide clarity. A successful BETonMACE trial would raise the question as to whether RVX-208 operates via lipids, inflammation, or other means, because several previous HDL-C modulators and anti-inflammatories have not provided effective means of treating cardiovascular disease and reducing overall mortality. Re-conceptualizing cardiovascular disease within the well-established evolutionary biology theory that growth and specifically reproduction trade-off against longevity might provide a more comprehensive explanation. Drivers of the gonadotropic axis, particularly androgens, suppress both HDL-C and the immune system while promoting ischemic heart disease and stroke. As such, any effects of RVX-208 on cardiovascular disease might be the result of reducing androgens, of which higher HDL-C and reduced inflammation are biomarkers. Notably, several other effective treatments for cardiovascular disease, such as statins and spironolactone, are known anti-androgens. Results of the BETonMACE trial, and corresponding insight about the mechanism of BET inhibitors in cardiovascular disease, are eagerly awaited. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","androgen; apabetalone; bromodomain inhibitor; C reactive protein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; spironolactone; apabetalone; bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein, human; cardiovascular agent; protein; quinazolinone derivative; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial (topic); human; inflammation; ischemic heart disease; mortality; priority journal; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cardiovascular disease; drug effect; genetic epigenesis; meta analysis; Animals; Cardiovascular Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Proteins; Quinazolinones"
"Population density is beneficially associated with 12-year diabetes risk marker change among residents of lower socio-economic neighborhoods",2019,"We examined associations of neighborhood population density with 12-year changes in diabetes risk (post-challenge plasma glucose), and potential moderation by neighborhood socio-economic status (SES) among 4,816 Australians. In lower SES neighborhoods, post-challenge plasma glucose increased by 6% in low-density, remained stable in medium-density and decreased by 3% in high-density neighborhoods. In medium SES neighborhoods, glucose remained stable in high-density, but increased by 2% and 3% in medium- and low-density neighborhoods, respectively. In higher SES neighborhoods, no significant interaction effect between time and density was observed. Densification may make protective contributions for diabetes risk in lower and medium SES neighborhoods. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","glucose; diabetes; epidemiology; health risk; neighborhood; population density; socioeconomic status; urbanization; adult; aged; Article; Australian; diabetes mellitus; female; glucose blood level; human; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; population density; priority journal; risk factor; social status; time; Australia"

"Whole-genome sequencing data-based modeling for the investigation of an outbreak of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a neonatal intensive care unit in Hong Kong",2019,"We describe a nosocomial outbreak of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) ST59-SCCmec type V in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Hong Kong. In-depth epidemiological analysis was performed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the CA-MRSA isolates collected from patients and environment during weekly surveillance and healthcare workers from the later phase of the outbreak. Case–control analysis was performed to analyze potential risk factors for the outbreak. The outbreak occurred from September 2017 to February 2018 involving 15 neonates and one healthcare worker. WGS analysis revealed complicated transmission dynamics between patients, healthcare worker, and environment, from an unrecognized source introduced into the NICU within 6?months before the outbreak. In addition to enforcement of directly observed hand hygiene, environmental disinfection, cohort nursing of colonized and infected patients, together with contact tracing for secondary patients, medical, nursing, and supporting staff were segregated where one team would care for CA-MRSA-confirmed/CA-MRSA-exposed patients and the other for newly admitted patients in the NICU only. Case–control analysis revealed use of cephalosporins [odds ratio 49.84 (3.10–801.46), p = 0.006] and length of hospitalization [odds ratio 1.02 (1.00–1.04), p = 0.013] as significant risk factors for nosocomial acquisition of CA-MRSA in NICU using multivariate analysis.

"Mesenchymal stem cells for inflammatory airway disorders: Promises and challenges",2019,"The regenerative and immunomodulatory characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them attractive in the treatment of many diseases. Although they have shown promising preclinical studies of immunomodulation and paracrine effects in inflammatory airway disorders and other lung diseases, there are still challenges that have to be overcome before MSCs can be safely, effectively, and routinely applied in the clinical setting. A good understanding of the roles and mechanisms of the MSC immunomodulatory effects will benefit the application of MSC-based clinical therapy.

"IL-10-producing regulatory B cells restrain the T follicular helper cell response in primary Sj?gren’s syndrome",2019,"Increased numbers of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases including primary Sj?gren’s syndrome (pSS), but how the Tfh cell response is regulated during autoimmune pathogenesis remains largely unclear. Here, we first found negative correlations between IL-10+ regulatory B (Breg) cell numbers and Tfh cell responses and disease activity in patients with pSS and mice with experimental Sj?gren’s syndrome (ESS). Moreover, we detected high expression of IL-10 receptor on Tfh cells and their precursors in both humans and mice. In culture, IL-10 suppressed human and murine Tfh cell differentiation by promoting STAT5 phosphorylation. By using an adoptive transfer approach and two-photon live imaging, we found significantly increased numbers of Tfh cells with enhanced T cell homing into B cell follicles in the draining cervical lymph nodes of RAG-2?/? mice transferred with IL-10-deficient B cells during ESS development compared with those of RAG-2?/? mice transferred with wild-type B cells. In ESS mice, CD19+CD1dhiCD5+ Breg cells with decreased IL-10 production exhibited severely impaired suppressive effects on T cell proliferation. Consistently, CD19+CD24+CD38hi Breg cells from pSS patients showed significantly reduced IL-10 production with defective inhibitory function in the suppression of autologous Tfh cell expansion. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of IL-10-producing Breg cells markedly suppressed the Tfh cell response and ameliorated ESS progression in ESS mice. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for IL-10-producing Breg cells in restraining the effector Tfh cell response during pSS development. ? 2019, CSI and USTC.","ADP ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase 1; CD19 antigen; CD1d antigen; CD24 antigen; CD5 antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 10 receptor; STAT5 protein; adoptive transfer; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell culture; cell expansion; cervical lymph node; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine production; disease activity; female; fluorescence imaging; human; human cell; immune response; in vitro study; in vivo study; lymphocyte count; lymphocyte differentiation; lymphocyte homing; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; regulatory B lymphocyte; Sjoegren syndrome; T lymphocyte; Tfh cell; two photon live imaging; wild type"

"Cost-effectiveness of bivalent versus monovalent vaccines against hand, foot and mouth disease",2020,"Objectives: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) were responsible for 43.3% (235 123/543 243) and 24.8% (134 607/543 243) of all laboratory-confirmed hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases during 2010–2015 in China. Three monovalent EV71 vaccines have been licensed in China while bivalent EV71/CA16 vaccines are under development. A comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of bivalent EV71/CA16 versus monovalent EV71 vaccination would be useful for informing the additional value of bivalent HFMD vaccines in China. Methods: We used a static model parameterized with the national HFMD surveillance data during 2010–2013, virological HFMD surveillance records from all 31 provinces in mainland China during 2010–2013 and caregiver survey data of costs and health quality of life during 2012–2013. We estimated the threshold vaccine cost (TVC), defined as the maximum additional cost that could be paid for a cost-effective bivalent EV71/CA16 vaccine over a monovalent EV71 vaccine, as the outcome. The base case analysis was performed from a societal perspective. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying assumptions governing HFMD risk, costs, discounting and vaccine efficacy. Results: In the base case, choosing the bivalent EV71/CA16 over monovalent EV71 vaccination would be cost-effective only if the additional cost of the bivalent EV71/CA16 compared with the monovalent EV71 vaccine is less than 4.7 (95% CI 4.2–5.2). Compared with the TVC in the base case, TVC increased by up to 8.9 if all the test-negative cases were CA16-HFMD; decreased by 1.1 with an annual discount rate of 6% and exclusion of the productivity loss; and increased by 0.14 and 0.3 with every 1% increase in bivalent vaccine efficacy against CA16-HFMD and differential vaccine efficacy against EV71-HFMD, respectively. Conclusions: Bivalent EV71/CA16 vaccines can be cost-effective compared with monovalent EV71 vaccines, if suitably priced. Our study provides further evidence for determining the optimal use of HFMD vaccines in routine paediatric vaccination programme in China. ? 2019 The Author(s)","coxsackievirus A16 vaccine; Enterovirus 71 vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; Article; child; China; cost effectiveness analysis; Coxsackievirus A16; disease burden; disease surveillance; drug cost; Enterovirus A71; gross national product; hand foot and mouth disease; health care cost; human; infant; major clinical study; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; vaccination; Willingness To Pay"

"Burnout in orthopaedic surgeons: A systematic review",2019,"Occupational burnout is a syndrome composing of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and low sense of personal accomplishment. Burnout has been shown to negatively affect both the personal lives and professional performance of doctors. Orthopaedic surgery is a challenging specialty, and while burnout has been studied in orthopaedic surgeons, a comprehensive review article in this area is lacking. Hence we performed a systematic review to summarise the evidence regarding burnout in orthopaedic surgeons. We conducted a systematic literature review using the terms “orthopaedic surgeons” and “burnout” and related terms. Studies were reviewed by two independent reviewers. English articles that were (a) peer-reviewed original research articles; (b) measures burnout directly in study participants; (c) uses validated scales for burnout assessment; and (d) on orthopaedic surgeons, were included. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by panel discussion. 216 papers were identified and 14 papers were selected for qualitative synthesis. The prevalence of burnout varied considerably between orthopaedic surgeons from different centres and of different seniority. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the burnout rate in orthopaedic surgeons is different from doctors in other specialties. A range of risk factors and protective factors associated with burnout were identified. Similar to prior studies in the general medical population, key determinants of burnout included personal, family, working environment and career factors. One paper identified an association between burnout and irritable behaviour during operation, yet no studies have assessed the effect of burnout on orthopaedic patient outcomes. We did not identify papers on the management of burnout in orthopaedic surgeons. To conclude, the evidence on burnout in orthopaedic surgeons is preliminary and key methodological limitations have been noted in the current studies. Large-scale prospective studies are warranted to better understand the determinants and effects of burnout in orthopaedic surgeons, in order to guide appropriate interventions against this occupational mental health hazard. ? 2019 Delhi Orthopedic Association","career; emotional stress; family; human; irritability; mental health; orthopedic surgeon; prevalence; priority journal; professional burnout; Review; risk factor; systematic review; work environment"
"The misconception of antibiotic equal to an anti-inflammatory drug promoting antibiotic misuse among chinese university students",2019,"Massive misuse of antibiotics is one of the most important reasons for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Misconceptions of antibiotics contribute to antibiotic misuse behaviors. This study aims to examine whether university students hold the misconception that Antibiotic is a Xiaoyanyao (literally means anti-inflammatory drug in Chinese), and association between this misconception and antibiotic misuse behaviors. A cross-sectional study was conducted among university students using the cluster random sampling method in six universities of six regions in China (one university per region). The Chi-square test was used to assess the relationship between the misconception and antibiotic misuse behaviors. Logistic regression was conducted to identify the risk factors for antibiotic misuse behaviors. 11,192 of university students completed the entire questionnaire. There were 3882 (34.7%) students who were considered to have the misconception. Female students were more likely to have the misconception compared with males (36.7% vs. 32.6%, P < 0.001). Those students with a background of social science/humanities were more likely to have the misconception compared with those from science and medicine (44.1% vs. 30.3% vs. 20.1%, P < 0.001). Students came from rural areas compared with those from urban areas (37.5% vs. 32.5%, P < 0.001) were more likely to have the misconception. Students who had the misconception were 1.51 (95% CI 1.21–1.89, P < 0.001) times, 1.34 (95% CI 1.21–1.48, P < 0.001) times, and 1.36 (95% CI 1.24– 1.50, P < 0.001) times more likely to report self-medication, request to obtain antibiotics, and take antibiotics prophylactically than those who did not have this misconception, respectively. The high proportion of university students' misconception on Antibiotic is a Xiaoyanyao is worth more attention. Effective health education and interventions need to be promoted among university students and the whole population. ? 2018 by the authors.

"Chinese adults' nutrition label literacy in Hong Kong: Implications for nurses",2019,"The study aimed to investigate Chinese adults' nutrition label literacy in Hong Kong. It employed a web-based survey with structured questions. A total of 368 Chinese adults aged 18-59 participated in the survey and their nutrition label literacy was measured by the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). About two-thirds (68%) of the participants had limited nutrition literacy skills. Although they were able to identify correctly the calorie and sugar content of food products, 44% and 48% of them had difficulty in determining the consumption of calories and serving food sizes respectively. Another finding from the survey was that those with lower education level and of older age had significantly lower mean nutrition label literacy scores, which indicated that they were at higher risk for food insecurity. The findings showed that the nutrition label literacy level of Hong Kong's general public is quite low. This study can provide insights for nurses and healthcare professionals on how to educate people with lower education level and/or of advanced age to use nutrition labels more effectively and to further nutrition label literacy study and research, particularly in Hong Kong. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; female; food packaging; health literacy; Hong Kong; human; male; middle aged; nutritional status; procedures; questionnaire; standards; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Female; Food Labeling; Health Literacy; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Finding cancer driver mutations in the era of big data research",2019,"In the last decade, the costs of genome sequencing have decreased considerably. The commencement of large-scale cancer sequencing projects has enabled cancer genomics to join the big data revolution. One of the challenges still facing cancer genomics research is determining which are the driver mutations in an individual cancer, as these contribute only a small subset of the overall mutation profile of a tumour. Focusing primarily on somatic single nucleotide mutations in this review, we consider both coding and non-coding driver mutations, and discuss how such mutations might be identified from cancer sequencing datasets. We describe some of the tools and database that are available for the annotation of somatic variants and the identification of cancer driver genes. We also address the use of genome-wide variation in mutation load to establish background mutation rates from which to identify driver mutations under positive selection. Finally, we describe the ways in which mutational signatures can act as clues for the identification of cancer drivers, as these mutations may cause, or arise from, certain mutational processes. By defining the molecular changes responsible for driving cancer development, new cancer treatment strategies may be developed or novel preventative measures proposed. ? 2018, International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","DNA directed DNA polymerase epsilon; telomerase reverse transcriptase; transcription factor; amino acid substitution; cancer genomics; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; copy number variation; DNA damage; DNA polymorphism; DNA replication; DNA sequence; epigenetics; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic variation; genomics; human; missense mutation; mutation rate; next generation sequencing; nonsense mutation; oncogene; phenotype; priority journal; purifying selection; Review; somatic mutation; transcriptomics; tumor gene; tumor suppressor gene; whole genome sequencing"
"Saliva as a diagnostic specimen for testing respiratory virus by a point-of-care molecular assay: a diagnostic validity study",2019,"Objectives: Automated point-of-care molecular assays have greatly shortened the turnaround time of respiratory virus testing. One of the major bottlenecks now lies at the specimen collection step, especially in a busy clinical setting. Saliva is a convenient specimen type that can be provided easily by adult patients. This study assessed the diagnostic validity, specimen collection time and cost associated with the use of saliva. Methods: This was a prospective diagnostic validity study comparing the detection rate of respiratory viruses between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) among adult hospitalized patients using Xpert ? Xpress Flu/RSV. The cost and time associated with the collection of saliva and nasopharyngeal specimens were also estimated. Results: Between July and October 2017, 214 patients were recruited. The overall agreement between saliva and NPA was 93.3% (196/210, κ 0.851, 95% CI 0.776–0.926). There was no significant difference in the detection rate of respiratory viruses between saliva and NPA (32.9% (69/210) versus 35.7% (75/210); p 0.146). The overall sensitivity and specificity were 90.8% (81.9%–96.2%) and 100% (97.3%–100%), respectively, for saliva, and were 96.1% (88.9%–99.2%) and 98.5% (94.7%–99.8%), respectively, for NPA. The time and cost associated with the collection of saliva were 2.26-fold and 2.59-fold lower, respectively, than those of NPA. Conclusions: Saliva specimens have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of respiratory viruses by an automated multiplex Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-waived point-of-care molecular assay when compared with those of NPA. The use of saliva also reduces the time and cost associated with specimen collection. ? 2018 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","antivirus agent; ribavirin; sialidase inhibitor; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; cost; coughing; diabetes mellitus; dyspnea; female; heart disease; hospital patient; human; hypertension; influenza; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nasopharyngeal aspiration; nonhuman; point of care testing; priority journal; prospective study; respiratory syncytial virus infection; respiratory virus; saliva; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; viral respiratory tract infection; virus detection; comparative study; economics; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; isolation and purification; molecular diagnosis; nasopharynx; Pneumovirus; procedures; reproducibility; respiratory tract infection; saliva; specimen handling; time factor; validation study; virology; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Costs and Cost Analysis; Female; Humans; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nasopharynx; Point-of-Care Testing; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Respiratory Syncytial Viruses; Respiratory Tract Infections; Saliva; Sensitivity and Specificity; Specimen Handling; Time Factors"

"Broad and effective protection against Staphylococcus aureus is elicited by a multivalent vaccine formulated with novel antigens",2019,"The demand for a prophylactic vaccine against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has motivated numerous dedicated research groups to design and develop such a vaccine. In this study, we have developed a multivalent vaccine, Sta-V5, composed of five conserved antigens involved in three important virulence mechanisms. This prototype vaccine conferred up to 100% protection against multiple epidemiologically relevant S. aureus isolates in five different murine disease models. The vaccine not only elicits functional antibodies that mediate opsonophagocytic killing of S. aureus but also mounts robust antigen-specific T-cell responses. In addition, our data implied that γδ T cells contribute to the protection induced by Sta-V5 in a murine skin infection model. ? 2019 Deng et al.","bacterial antigen; bacterial protein; bacterium antibody; cytokine; Staphylococcus vaccine; animal; Bagg albino mouse; disease model; female; genetics; immunology; microbiology; mouse; sepsis; skin; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Sepsis; Skin; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcal Vaccines; Staphylococcus aureus"

We incorporated the empirical data from a matched cohort of PEP and non-PEP groups to simulate lifetime costs and outcomes for subjects with DM with or without PEP. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted with results presented as a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Results: With an assumption that the PEP effect would last for 5 years as shown by the empirical data, the incremental cost per subject was US $197 and the incremental QALYs gained were 0.06 per subject, which resulted in an ICER of US $3290 per QALY gained compared with no PEP across the lifetime. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 66% likelihood that PEP is cost-effective compared with non-PEP when willingness-to-pay for a QALY is ?US $46 153 (based on per capita GDP 2017). Conclusions: Based on this carefully measured cost of PEP and its potentially large benefits, PEP could be highly cost-effective from a societal perspective as an adjunct intervention for patients with DM. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; aged; Article; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; disease assessment; economic aspect; female; health care utilization; health program; human; incremental cost effectiveness ratios; intervention study; long term care; male; middle aged; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; patient empowerment program; primary medical care; probability; quality adjusted life year; risk assessment; Risk Assessment and Management Program; sensitivity analysis; sex difference; simulation; willingness to pay; case control study; economics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient education; patient participation; primary health care; statistics and numerical data; Case-Control Studies; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Participation; Primary Health Care"
"Host and microbiome multi-omics integration: applications and methodologies",2019,"The study of the microbial community—the microbiome—associated with a human host is a maturing research field. It is increasingly clear that the composition of the human’s microbiome is associated with various diseases such as gastrointestinal diseases, liver diseases and metabolic diseases. Using high-throughput technologies such as next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry–based metabolomics, we are able to comprehensively sequence the microbiome—the metagenome—and associate these data with the genomic, epigenomics, transcriptomic and metabolic profile of the host. Our review summarises the application of integrating host omics with microbiome as well as the analytical methods and related tools applied in these studies. In addition, potential future directions are discussed. ? 2019, International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RNA 16S; transcriptome; bacterial microbiome; Enterobacteriaceae; epigenetics; gene sequence; genetic variation; genotype; human; immune system; metabolome; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial gene; microbiome; next generation sequencing; phenotypic variation; priority journal; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism; species diversity; whole genome sequencing"
"Serum growth differentiation factor 15 is associated with glucose metabolism in the third trimester in Chinese pregnant women",2019,"Objective: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has been demonstrated to increase in diabetes as a protective factor. However, studies assessing relationships between GDF15 levels and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether GDF15 levels are related to GDM in Chinese subjects. Methods: We included 200 GDM patients and 200 matched normal controls in the second trimester as well as 130 GDM patients and 130 matched normal controls in the third trimester. Serum GDF15 levels of all participants were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then, according to GDF15 levels, we equally divided the participants in the second and third trimesters into four subgroups respectively. The relationships of serum GDF15 levels with glucolipid metabolism indicators were analyzed. Results: In the third trimester, GDF15 levels were significantly higher in the GDM patients than in the normal controls (P < 0.001). Additionally, fasting blood glucose (FBG), 1-h postprandial glucose (1h-PG), 2-h postprandial glucose (2h-PG), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) and area under curve of glucose (AUCG) from the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were positively associated with GDF15 levels (P < 0.05), even after adjusting for age, pregestational BMI, changes of BMI until the third trimester, gestational age, twin and family history of diabetes. Moreover, GDF15 levels were higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester (P < 0.001). No significant relationships were found between GDF15 levels and glucolipid metabolism in the second trimester (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Serum GDF15 levels were positively correlated with glucose metabolism in the third trimester in Chinese pregnant women. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","glucose; growth differentiation factor 15; growth differentiation factor 15; adult; area under the curve; Article; body mass; Chinese; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; human; lipid metabolism; major clinical study; oral glucose tolerance test; pathogenesis; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; protein blood level; second trimester pregnancy; third trimester pregnancy; Asian continental ancestry group; carbohydrate metabolism; immunology; metabolism; pregnancy; third trimester pregnancy; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Female; Growth Differentiation Factor 15; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third"
"Podocyte GSK3 is an evolutionarily conserved critical regulator of kidney function",2019,"Albuminuria affects millions of people, and is an independent risk factor for kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity and death. The key cell that prevents albuminuria is the terminally differentiated glomerular podocyte. Here we report the evolutionary importance of the enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) for maintaining podocyte function in mice and the equivalent nephrocyte cell in Drosophila. Developmental deletion of both GSK3 isoforms (α and β) in murine podocytes causes late neonatal death associated with massive albuminuria and renal failure. Similarly, silencing GSK3 in nephrocytes is developmentally lethal for this cell. Mature genetic or pharmacological podocyte/nephrocyte GSK3 inhibition is also detrimental; producing albuminuric kidney disease in mice and nephrocyte depletion in Drosophila. Mechanistically, GSK3 loss causes differentiated podocytes to re-enter the cell cycle and undergo mitotic catastrophe, modulated via the Hippo pathway but independent of Wnt-β-catenin. This work clearly identifies GSK3 as a critical regulator of podocyte and hence kidney function. ? 2019, The Author(s).","beta catenin; caspase 3; creatinine; cyclin A2; doxycycline; glycogen synthase kinase 3; lithium; nephrin; wheat germ agglutinin; Wnt protein; beta catenin; glycogen synthase kinase 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; Hippo protein, mouse; isoprotein; protein serine threonine kinase; verteporfin; albuminuria; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell cycle; cell survival; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine blood level; Drosophila; enzyme inhibition; gene deletion; genotype; glomerulosclerosis; hippo signaling; human; human tissue; hypertension; immunohistochemistry; kidney function; mitosis; mouse; nonhuman; podocyte; polymerase chain reaction; protein depletion; protein protein interaction; rat; transmission electron microscopy; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; blood; cell line; disease model; drug effect; enzymology; gene silencing; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; kidney; kidney disease; kidney failure; male; metabolism; pathology; physiology; podocyte; proteomics; urine; Wistar rat; Albuminuria; Animals; beta Catenin; Cell Cycle; Cell Line; Disease Models, Animal; Drosophila; Gene Deletion; Gene Silencing; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Mice; Podocytes; Protein Isoforms; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proteomics; Rats, Wistar; Renal Insufficiency; Verteporfin"
"Guidelines for multi-model comparisons of the impact of infectious disease interventions",2019,"Background: Despite the increasing popularity of multi-model comparison studies and their ability to inform policy recommendations, clear guidance on how to conduct multi-model comparisons is not available. Herein, we present guidelines to provide a structured approach to comparisons of multiple models of interventions against infectious diseases. The primary target audience for these guidelines are researchers carrying out model comparison studies and policy-makers using model comparison studies to inform policy decisions. Methods: The consensus process used for the development of the guidelines included a systematic review of existing model comparison studies on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination, a 2-day meeting and guideline development workshop during which mathematical modellers from different disease areas critically discussed and debated the guideline content and wording, and several rounds of comments on sequential versions of the guidelines by all authors. Results: The guidelines provide principles for multi-model comparisons, with specific practice statements on what modellers should do for six domains. The guidelines provide explanation and elaboration of the principles and practice statements as well as some examples to illustrate these. The principles are (1) the policy and research question - the model comparison should address a relevant, clearly defined policy question; (2) model identification and selection - the identification and selection of models for inclusion in the model comparison should be transparent and minimise selection bias; (3) harmonisation - standardisation of input data and outputs should be determined by the research question and value of the effort needed for this step; (4) exploring variability - between- and within-model variability and uncertainty should be explored; (5) presenting and pooling results - results should be presented in an appropriate way to support decision-making; and (6) interpretation - results should be interpreted to inform the policy question. Conclusion: These guidelines should help researchers plan, conduct and report model comparisons of infectious diseases and related interventions in a systematic and structured manner for the purpose of supporting health policy decisions. Adherence to these guidelines will contribute to greater consistency and objectivity in the approach and methods used in multi-model comparisons, and as such improve the quality of modelled evidence for policy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","clinical decision making; comparative study; consensus development; cost effectiveness analysis; drug efficacy; health care policy; health care quality; human; infection; mathematical model; practice guideline; Review; standardization; vaccination; communicable disease; cost benefit analysis; decision making; health care policy; theoretical model; Communicable Diseases; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Health Policy; Humans; Models, Theoretical"
"Effectiveness of EV-A71 vaccination in prevention of paediatric hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with EV-A71 virus infection requiring hospitalisation in Henan, China, 2017–18: a test-negative case-control study",2019,"Background: Inactivated monovalent enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) vaccines are now available in China to reduce the substantial public health burden of hand, foot, and mouth disease. However, post-licensure monitoring of vaccine effectiveness is important. We did an observational test-negative study of EV-A71 vaccine effectiveness. Methods: Children with hand, foot, and mouth disease who were admitted to Henan Children's Hospital (Zhengzhou, China) within 7 days of illness onset were invited to participate in this test-negative case-control study. Participant vaccination history with EV-A71, including the number of doses received and the date of each dose of vaccination, was elicited from parents or legal guardians of participants with a standardised questionnaire. Children must have received two doses before hospitalisation to be counted as fully vaccinated. Patients who had received a single dose before hospitalisation were classified as partly vaccinated. Children who had received no EV-A71 vaccine before hospitalisation were classified as unvaccinated. Throat swabs and stool samples collected from patients were tested by RT-PCR to identify EV-A71 and other enteroviruses. The primary outcome of the study was paediatric hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with EV-A71 requiring hospitalisation. We estimated vaccine effectiveness with conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Findings: Between Feb 15, 2017, and Feb 15, 2018, we enrolled 1803 children aged 6–71 months with hand, foot, and mouth disease. 234 (13%) children tested positive for EV-A71, 1529 (85%) tested positive for other enteroviruses—528 (29%) were positive for Coxsackievirus (CV)-A6 and 342 (19%) were positive for CV-A16—and 29 (2%) tested negative for all enteroviruses. 11 (1%) children with neither throat swab nor stool testing results were excluded from further analyses. Overall vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 85·4% (95% CI 53·2 to 95·4) for fully vaccinated children and 63·1% (13·1 to 84·3) for partly vaccinated children. The vaccine effectiveness for full vaccination was estimated to be 91·1% (35·1 to 98·8) among non-severe cases compared with 73·3% (?32·6 to 94·6) in severe cases. The vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination was 77·9% (4·3 to 94·9) in children aged 24–71 months and 40·8% (?71·1 to 79·5) in children aged 6–23 months. We found no significant association between full or partial vaccination and CV-A6 or CV-A16-related hand, foot, and mouth disease. Interpretation: EV-A71 vaccination was effective in preventing non-severe hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with EV-A71 virus infection in children aged 6–71 months, and we found evidence that one dose of vaccination provided partial protection for children aged 24–71 months. Introduction of multivalent vaccines could further reduce the burden of hand, foot, and mouth disease.

"The role of WASp in T cells and B cells",2019,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a form of primary immunodeficiency (PIDs) resulting from mutations of the gene that encodes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp). WASp is the first identified and most widely studied protein belonging to the actin nucleation-promoting factor family and plays significant role in integrating and transforming signals from critical receptors on the cell surface to actin remodeling. WASp functions in immune defense and homeostasis through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton-dependent cellular processes as well as processes uncoupled with actin polymerization like nuclear transcription programs. In this article, we review the mechanisms of WASp activation through an understanding of its structure. We further discuss the role of WASp in adaptive immunity, paying special attention to some recent findings on the crucial role of WASp in the formation of immunological synapse, the regulation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and in the prevention of autoimmunity. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","B lymphocyte receptor; F actin; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein; actin filament; actin polymerization; adaptive immunity; autoimmune disease; B lymphocyte; cell adhesion; cell migration; cytokine release; human; immunoglobulin production; immunological synapse; lymphocyte function; microtubule organizing center; nonhuman; priority journal; prophylaxis; protein conformation; protein structure; Review; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; Tfh cell"
"Diversity of phenotypically non-dermatophyte, non-Aspergillus filamentous fungi causing nail infections: importance of accurate identification and antifungal susceptibility testing",2019,"Onychomycosis is most commonly caused by dermatophytes. In this study, we examined the spectrum of phenotypically non-dermatophyte and non-Aspergillus fungal isolates recovered over a 10-year period from nails of patients with onychomycosis in Hong Kong. A total of 24 non-duplicated isolates recovered from 24 patients were included. The median age of the patients was 51 years, and two-thirds of them were males. One-third and two-thirds had finger and toe nail infections respectively. Among these 24 nail isolates, 17 were confidently identified as 13 different known fungal species, using a polyphasic approach. These 13 species belonged to 11 genera and ?9 families. For the remaining seven isolates, multilocus sequencing did not reveal their definite species identities. These seven potentially novel species belonged to four different known and three potentially novel genera of seven families. 33.3%, 41.7% and 95.8% of the 24 fungal isolates possessed minimum inhibitory concentrations of >1 ?g/mL to terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole, respectively, the first line treatment of onychomycosis. A high diversity of moulds was associated with onychomycosis. A significant proportion of the isolates were potentially novel fungal species. To guide proper treatment, molecular identification and antifungal susceptibility testing should be performed for these uncommonly isolated fungal species. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Global, regional, and national burden of neurological disorders, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016",2019,"Background: Neurological disorders are increasingly recognised as major causes of death and disability worldwide. The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders. Methods: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach. Findings: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247–308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million [8·8–9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34–44] and DALYs by 15% [9–21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26–30] and DALYs by 27% [24–31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6–46·1]), migraine (16·3% [11·7–20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0–12·1]), and meningitis (7·9% [6·6–10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 [1·05–1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8–35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8–17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable). Interpretation: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

"Neurocognitive function, performance status, and quality of life in pediatric intracranial germ cell tumor survivors",2019,"Background: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCT) are more common in Asia than in the West, accounting for about 15% of brain tumors in Asian children. The survival rate for intracranial GCT is excellent, but there are concerns about the effects of radiotherapy on neuropsychological function and quality of life of patients. Methods: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCT) are more common in Asia than in the West, accounting for about 15% of brain tumors in Asian children. The survival rate for intracranial GCT is excellent, but there are concerns about the effects of radiotherapy on neuropsychological function and quality of life of patients. Intracranial GCT survivors in Hong Kong aged ? 6?years who received cranial irradiation in the past 15?years were recruited. Neurocognitive function and performance status were assessed by the Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence scale and Karnofsky/Lansky performance scales (KPS), respectively. Quality of life was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scales. A chart review was performed for tumor characteristics and complications related to the tumor and its treatment. Results: Twenty-five intracranial GCT survivors were recruited. Longer length of time since treatment was associated with lower IQ scores. Larger tumor size was associated with lower KPS scores. Hemiparesis, poor manual dexterity, and complications with multi-organ involvement were associated with significantly lower KPS scores. Higher irradiation dosage was associated with lower PedsQL physical scores. Conclusions: The majority of GCT survivors had average intellectual functioning, satisfactory performance status and relatively good quality of life, except in the physical aspect. Comprehensive evaluation and long-term follow-up of GCT survivors are essential to provide timely support and improve long-term outcomes. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adolescent; age; Article; Asia; Asian; brain function; cancer radiotherapy; cancer survivor; cancer therapy; child; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; dexterity test; ear disease; endocrine disease; ethnic difference; eye disease; female; Generic Core Scale; germ cell tumor; hemiparesis; hemiplegia; Hong Kong; Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence scale; human; hypopituitarism; intelligence; intelligence quotient; intracranial germ cell tumor; Karnofsky Performance Status; kidney disease; Lansky Performance Status; male; mental disease; mood disorder; multiple organ failure; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; neuropsychology; nose disease; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; pediatrics; peripheral neuropathy; physical disability; preschool child; quality of life; quality of life assessment; radiation dose; rating scale; respiratory failure; respiratory tract disease; school child; scoring system; skull irradiation; survival rate; throat disease; treatment duration; tumor characteristics; tumor volume; brain tumor; cancer survivor; neoplasm; neuropsychological test; psychology; psychomotor performance; radiotherapy dosage; retrospective study; Adolescent; Brain Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Child; Cranial Irradiation; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Quality of Life; Radiotherapy Dosage; Retrospective Studies"
"Impaired autophagic degradation of lncRNA ARHGAP5-AS1 promotes chemoresistance in gastric cancer",2019,"Chemoresistance remains the uppermost disincentive for cancer treatment on account of many genetic and epigenetic alterations. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging players in promoting cancer initiation and progression. However, the regulation and function in chemoresistance are largely unknown. Herein, we identified ARHGAP5-AS1 as a lncRNA upregulated in chemoresistant gastric cancer cells and its knockdown reversed chemoresistance. Meanwhile, high ARHGAP5-AS1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Intriguingly, its abundance is affected by autophagy and SQSTM1 is responsible for transporting ARHGAP5-AS1 to autophagosomes. Inhibition of autophagy in chemoresistant cells, thus, resulted in the upregulation of ARHGAP5-AS1. In turn, it activated the transcription of ARHGAP5 in the nucleus by directly interacting with ARHGAP5 promoter. Interestingly, ARHGAP5-AS1 also stabilized ARHGAP5 mRNA in the cytoplasm by recruiting METTL3 to stimulate m6A modification of ARHGAP5 mRNA. As a result, ARHGAP5 was upregulated to promote chemoresistance and its upregulation was also associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer. In summary, impaired autophagic degradation of lncRNA ARHGAP5-AS1 in chemoresistant cancer cells promoted chemoresistance. It can activate the transcription of ARHGAP5 in the nucleus and stimulate m6A modification of ARHGAP5 mRNA to stabilize ARHGAP5 mRNA in the cytoplasm by recruiting METTL3. Therefore, targeting ARHGAP5-AS1/ARHGAP5 axis might be a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance in gastric cancer. ? 2019, The Author(s).","ARHGAP AS1; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; sequestosome 1; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; apoptosis assay; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; BGC-823 cell line; cancer cell culture; cancer resistance; cell viability assay; cytoplasm; degradation; female; gene expression; human; human cell; human cell culture; male; overall survival; plasmid; priority journal; progression free survival; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SGC-7901 cell line; stomach cancer"
"Developing an integrated intervention to address intimate partner violence and psychological distress in Congolese refugee women in Tanzania",2019,"Background: Multi-sectoral, integrated interventions have long been recommended for addressing mental health and its social determinants (e.g., gender-based violence) in settings of ongoing adversity. We developed an integrated health and protection intervention to reduce psychological distress and intimate partner violence (IPV), and tested its delivery by lay facilitators in a low-resource refugee setting. Methods: Formative research to develop the intervention consisted of a structured desk review, consultation with experts and local stakeholders (refugee incentive workers, representatives of humanitarian agencies, and clinical experts), and qualitative interviews (40 free list interviews with refugees, 15 key informant interviews). Given existing efforts by humanitarian agencies to prevent gender-based violence in this particular refugee camp, including with (potential) perpetrators, we focused on a complementary effort to develop an integrated intervention with potential to reduce IPV and associated mental health impacts with female IPV survivors. We enrolled Congolese refugee women with elevated psychological distress and past-year histories of IPV (n = 60) who received the intervention delivered by trained and supervised lay refugee facilitators. Relevance, feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were evaluated through quantitative and qualitative interviews with participants. We assessed instrument test-retest reliability (n = 24), inter-rater reliability (n = 5 interviews), internal consistency, and construct validity (n = 60). Results: We designed an 8-session intervention, termed Nguvu ('strength'), incorporating brief Cognitive Processing Therapy (focused on helping clients obtaining skills to overcome negative thoughts and self-perceptions and gain control over the impact these have on their lives) and Advocacy Counseling (focused on increasing autonomy, empowerment and strengthening linkages to community supports). On average, participants attended two-thirds of the sessions. In qualitative interviews, participants recommended adaptations to specific intervention components and provided recommendations regarding coordination, retention, safety concerns and intervention participation incentives. Analysis of the performance of outcome instruments overall revealed acceptable reliability and validity. Conclusions: We found it feasible to develop and implement an integrated, multi-sectoral mental health and IPV intervention in a refugee camp setting. Implementation challenges were identified and may be informative for future implementation and evaluation of multi-sectoral strategies for populations facing ongoing adversity.

"Adolescent Smoking in Hong Kong: Prevalence, Psychosocial Correlates, and Prevention",2019,"Preventing adolescent smoking is important as smoking is typically initiated by young people. This article reviews the prevalence, psychosocial correlates, and prevention of smoking in Hong Kong adolescents. The past 30-day smoking prevalence in adolescents decreased from 9.6% in 2003 to 2.5% in 2017. Tobacco advertisements, parental and best friends smoking, nonintact families, poor family relationships, lower socioeconomic status, being a new immigrant, poor knowledge of smoking-related harm, positive attitudes toward smoking, overestimation of peer smoking, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with smoking outcomes, whereas positive youth development, authoritative mother and permissive father, family functioning, school competence, and stronger tobacco industry denormalization beliefs were protective against smoking. Along with tobacco tax increase, ban on tobacco advertisements, smoke-free law and pictorial warnings, educational efforts through theater performances, social norms campaigns, and positive adolescent training programs have been conducted to prevent adolescent smoking. To achieve the ultimate goal of tobacco endgame, further tax increase, plain packaging, banning point-of-sale display of tobacco products, smoke-free area extension, and raising minimum age of purchase should be implemented. The government proposed law to ban e-cigarettes, and heated tobacco products should be passed soon to protect children and adolescents from using these products. ? 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","academic achievement; adolescent smoking; cigarette smoking; depression; family functioning; family relation; health care policy; Hong Kong; human; immigrant; outcome assessment; prevalence; priority journal; professional knowledge; Review; smoking ban; smoking cessation; smoking prevention; social competence; social norm; social psychology; social status; tobacco industry; tobacco use"
"Small-molecule-based fluorescent sensors for selective detection of reactive oxygen species in biological systems",2019,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) encompass a collection of intricately linked chemical entities characterized by individually distinct physicochemical properties and biological reactivities. Although excessive ROS generation is well known to underpin disease development, it has become increasingly evident that ROS also play central roles in redox regulation and normal physiology. A major challenge in uncovering the relevant biological mechanisms and deconvoluting the apparently paradoxical roles of distinct ROS in human health and disease lies in the selective and sensitive detection of these transient species in the complex biological milieu. Small-molecule-based fluorescent sensors enable molecular imaging of ROS with great spatial and temporal resolution and have thus been appreciated as excellent tools for aiding discoveries in modern redox biology. We review a selection of state-of-the-art sensors with demonstrated utility in biological systems. By providing a systematic overview based on underlying chemical sensing mechanisms, we wish to highlight the strengths and weaknesses in prior sensor works and propose some guiding principles for the development of future probes. ? 2019 by Annual Reviews.

The distribution of the ratios of infant to mother anti-HPV antibodies (i.e., infant-anti-HPV/mother- anti-HPV) was summarized. Results: All mothers and infants were seropositive to HPV 6 and HPV 11. Anti-HPV 6/11 geometric mean titers (GMTs) in peripartum maternal blood and in cord blood of infant born to study participants were highly correlated. A 100% of infants born to seropositive mothers were also seropositive. The GMT ratios of peripartum maternal blood vs. those in cord blood were HPV 6: 1.23 [0.43, 3.49] and HPV 11: 1.29 [0.54, 3.07] in the 9vHPV vaccine group and HPV 6: 1.33 [0.41, 4.29] and HPV 11: 1.19 [0.45, 3.13] in the qHPV vaccine?group, respectively. Conclusions: These results indicate that antibodies induced by the 9vHPV vaccine cross the placenta, which could potentially be beneficial against HPV6/11 infection and related disease such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. ? 2018, ? 2018 Merck Shark & Dohme Corp.","human papillomavirus 11 antibody; human papillomavirus 6 antibody; unclassified drug; virus antibody; Wart virus vaccine; hepatitis antibody; Wart virus vaccine; adolescent; adult; antibody titer; Article; child; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; female; follow up; human; Human papillomavirus type 11; Human papillomavirus type 6; immune response; immunization; immunoassay; infant; maternal blood; newborn; papillomavirus infection; passive immunization; perinatal period; placental transfer; pregnant woman; randomized controlled trial; umbilical cord blood; blood; fetus blood; immunology; mother; passive immunization; pregnancy; vaccine immunogenicity; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Double-Blind Method; Female; Fetal Blood; Hepatitis Antibodies; Human papillomavirus 11; Human papillomavirus 6; Human Papillomavirus Recombinant Vaccine Quadrivalent, Types 6, 11, 16, 18; Humans; Immunity, Maternally-Acquired; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Infant; Mothers; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Pregnancy; Young Adult"
"A robust and powerful test for case–control genetic association study on X chromosome",2019,"Hundreds of genome-wide association studies were conducted to map the disease genes on autosomes in human beings. It is known that many complex diseases are sex-determined and X chromosome is expected to play an important role. However, only a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms on X chromosome were found to be significantly associated with the diseases under study. On the other hand, to balance the genetic effect between two sexes, X chromosome inactivation occurs in most of X-linked genes by silencing one copy of two X chromosomes in females and dosage compensation is achieved. A few association studies on X chromosome incorporated the information on dosage compensation. However, some of them require the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and some need to specify the underlying genetic model. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel method for association by taking account of different dosage compensation patterns. The proposed test is a robust approach because it requires neither specifying the underlying genetic models nor the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Further, the proposed method allows for different deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium between cases and controls. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method generally outperforms the existing methods in terms of controlling the size and the test power. Finally, we apply the proposed test to the meta-analysis of the Graves' disease data for its practical use. ?

"Photo-crosslinked gelma hydrogel as drug carriers to locally applicate abaloparatide in promoting bone defect regeneration",2019,"Statement of Purpose: Bone healing usually need several months to complete. Additionally, fracture patients with osteoporosis usually need longer time to healing. In order to promote bone remodeling and reduce the healing time, different growth factors and other peptides as well as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), vascular endothelial growth factors, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) had been administration locally via the biomaterials to promote bone regeneration. Abaloparatide, one of the analog of human parathyroid hormone, was approved by FDA in 2017 in postmenopausal women suffered with osteoporosis. When compared to teriparatide, abaloparatide had similar anabolic effects but had fewer effects on bone resorption. More importantly, the risk of hypercalcemia, the most severe side effects caused by PTH related protein, are lower in patients received abaloparatide treatment versus teriparatide. Gelatin as a denatured form of the protein collagen has no antigenity and can be resorbed completely in vivo. Gelatin modified by chemical grafting has a wider range of applications, especially for the delivering of genes and drugs. Methacrylate gelatin (GelMA) which was modified by methacrylic (MA) has better plasticity and mechanical properties. 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) can be used as photoinitiator to initiate the GelMA hydrogel formation. In this study, we tried to develop photo-crosslinked GelMA hydrogel as drug carriers to prolong the release of abaloparatide in vitro and promote bone defect regeneration in vivo. ? 2019 Omnipress - All rights reserved.","Controlled drug delivery; Crosslinking; Defects; Diseases; Drug interactions; Grafting (chemical); Hydrogels; Mechanical properties; Proteins; Targeted drug delivery; Bone morphogenetic proteins; Bone regeneration; Bone resorption; Chemical grafting; Hydrogel formation; Parathyroid hormones; Postmenopausal women; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Bone"
"MR4Cancer: A web server prioritizing master regulators for cancer",2019,"During cancer stage transition, a master regulator (MR) refers to the key gene controlling cancer initiation and progression by orchestrating the associated target genes (termed as its regulon). Due to their inherent importance, MRs can serve as critical biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and therapeutic targets. However, it is challenging to infer key MRs that might explain gene expression profile changes between two groups due to lack of context-specific regulons, whose expression level can collectively reflect the activity of likely MRs. There is also a need to design an easy-to-use tool of MR identification for research community. Results: First, we generated cancer-specific regulons for 26 cancer types by analyzing highthroughput omics data from TCGA, and extracted noncancer-specific regulons from public databases. We subsequently developed a web server MR4Cancer, integrating the regulons with statistical inference to identify and prioritize MRs driving a phenotypic divergence of interest. Based on the input gene list (e.g. differentially expressed genes) or expression profile with two groups, MR4Cancer outputs rankedMRs by enrichment testing against the predefined regulons. Gene Ontology and canonical pathway analyses are also conducted to elucidate the function of likely MRs. Moreover, MR4Cancer provides dynamic network visualization for MR-target relations, and users can interactively interrogate the network to produce new hypotheses and high-quality figures for publication. Finally, the presented case studies highlighted the performance of MR4Cancer. We expect this user-friendly and powerful web tool will provide researchers novel insights into tumorigenesis and therapeutic intervention. ? 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

"Self-stigma, stigma coping and functioning in remitted bipolar disorder",2019,"Objective: Stigma has a deleterious effect on functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). However, there has been no research investigating how stigma coping predicts self-stigma and functioning in BD. Furthermore, how different stages of self-stigma might affect functioning is unclear. The following hypotheses were examined: (1) Stigma coping by withdrawal and secrecy was associated with more self-stigma; (2) Stigma coping by withdrawal and secrecy was associated with worse social functioning; and (3) Later stages of self-stigma were associated with worse social functioning. Methods: A random sample of remitted BD in a regional psychiatric clinic was examined using a cross-sectional design (n = 115). Self-stigma was measured using the Chinese versions of Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (C-SSMIS). Social functioning was assessed using the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST). Stigma coping was evaluated using the Stigma Coping Orientation Scale (SCOS). Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that coping by secrecy was associated with the stereotype agreement subscale of C-SSMIS, while coping by withdrawal was associated with the C-SSMIS self-concurrence and self-esteem decrement subscales. Another regression analysis showed that FAST total score was associated with the self-esteem decrement subscale of C-SSMIS and the severity of depressive and manic symptoms. Conclusion: We showed that self-esteem decrement, the final stage of self-stigma, was the most crucial stage in determining psychosocial functioning. Our findings suggested that stigma-reduction intervention should be arranged during the early stage of BD and targeted at various dysfunctional stigma coping. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; bipolar disorder; coping behavior; cross-sectional study; depression; disease classification; disease severity; female; human; male; mania; psychological well-being; remission; self esteem; social interaction; stigma; bipolar disorder; mental hospital; middle aged; pathophysiology; self concept; social stigma; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Bipolar Disorder; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Remission Induction; Self Concept; Social Stigma"
"Influenza epidemiology and influenza vaccine effectiveness during the 2015-2016 season: Results from the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network",2019,"Background: The Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network is an international platform whose primary objective is to study severe cases of influenza requiring hospitalization. Methods: During the 2015-2016 influenza season, 11 sites in the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network in nine countries (Russian Federation, Czech Republic, Turkey, France, China, Spain, Mexico, India, and Brazil) participated in a prospective, active-surveillance, hospital-based epidemiological study. Influenza infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated using a test-negative approach. Results: 9882 patients with laboratory results were included of which 2415 (24.4%) were positive for influenza, including 1415 (14.3%) for A(H1N1)pdm09, 235 (2.4%) for A(H3N2), 180 (1.8%) for A not subtyped, 45 (0.5%) for B/Yamagata-lineage, 532 (5.4%) for B/Victoria-lineage, and 33 (0.3%) for B not subtyped. Of included admissions, 39% were < 5 years of age and 67% had no underlying conditions. The odds of being admitted with influenza were higher among pregnant than non-pregnant women (odds ratio, 2.82 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.90 to 4.19]). Adjusted IVE against influenza-related hospitalization was 16.3% (95% CI, 0.4 to 29.7). Among patients targeted for influenza vaccination, adjusted IVE against hospital admission with influenza was 16.2% (95% CI, - 3.6 to 32.2) overall, 23.0% (95% CI, - 3.3 to 42.6) against A(H1N1)pdm09, and - 25.6% (95% CI, - 86.3 to 15.4) against B/Victoria lineage. Conclusions: The 2015-2016 influenza season was dominated by A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria-lineage. Hospitalization with influenza often occurred in healthy and young individuals, and pregnant women were at increased risk of influenza-related hospitalization. Influenza vaccines provided low to moderate protection against hospitalization with influenza and no protection against the predominant circulating B lineage, highlighting the need for more effective and broader influenza vaccines. ? 2019 The Author(s).","influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Brazil; child; China; controlled study; Czech Republic; disease severity; disease surveillance; drug efficacy; female; France; high risk population; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; India; infant; influenza; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); Influenza B virus; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; Mexico; newborn; pregnant woman; prospective study; protection; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Russian Federation; Spain; trend study; Turkey (republic); virus strain; virus transmission; immunology; influenza; isolation and purification; middle aged; odds ratio; pregnancy; preschool child; season; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Seasons; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"
"Unilateral versus bilateral lower extremity motor deficit following complex adult spinal deformity surgery: is there a difference in recovery up to 2-year follow-up?",2019,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Scoli-RISK-1 is a multicenter prospective cohort designed to study neurologic outcomes following complex adult spinal deformity (ASD). The effect of unilateral versus bilateral postoperative motor deficits on the likelihood of long-term recovery has not been previously studied in this population. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether bilateral postoperative neurologic deficits have a worse recovery than unilateral deficits. STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter, international cohort study. METHODS: In a cohort of 272 patients, neurologic decline was defined as deterioration of the American Spinal Injury Association Lower Extremity Motor Scores (LEMS) following surgery. Patients with lower extremity neurologic decline were grouped into unilateral and bilateral cohorts. Differences in demographics, surgical variables, and patient outcome measures between the two cohorts were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 265 patients had LEMS completed at discharge. Unilateral decline was seen in 32 patients (12%), while 29 (11%) had bilateral symptoms. At 2 years, there was no significant difference in either median LEMS (unilateral 50.0, interquartile range [IQR] 47.5–50.0; bilateral 50.0, IQR 48.0–50.0, p=.939) or change in LEMS from baseline (unilateral 0.0, IQR ?1.0 to 0.0; bilateral 0.0, IQR ?1.0 to 0.0, p=.920). In both groups, approximately two-thirds of patients saw recovery to at least their preoperative baseline by 2 years postoperatively (unilateral n=15, 63%; bilateral n=14, 67%). The mean Scoliosis Research Society-22R (SRS-22R) score at 2 years was 3.7±0.6 versus 3.2±0.6 (p=.009) for unilateral and bilateral groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for neurologic recovery of new motor deficits following complex adult spinal deformity is similar with both unilateral and bilateral weaknesses. Despite similar rates of neurologic recovery, patient reported outcomes for those with bilateral motor decline measured by SRS-22R are worse at 2 years after surgery. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; backache; bilateral lower extremity motor deficit; Cobb angle; cohort analysis; convalescence; female; follow up; human; length of stay; Lower Extremity Motor Score; lower limb; major clinical study; male; middle aged; motor dysfunction; multicenter study; musculoskeletal disease assessment; numeric rating scale; operation duration; patient-reported outcome; postoperative complication; priority journal; prognosis; Scoliosis Research Society 22r; scoring system; secondary analysis; spine malformation; spine surgery; surgical patient; unilateral lower extremity motor deficit; adverse event; aged; clinical trial; lower limb; neurosurgery; pathology; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; scoliosis; spine; walking; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Neurosurgical Procedures; Postoperative Complications; Scoliosis; Spine; Walking"
"Sialyl Lewisx-P-selectin cascade mediates tumor–mesothelial adhesion in ascitic fluid shear flow",2019,"Organ-specific colonization suggests that specific cell–cell recognition is essential. Yet, very little is known about this particular interaction. Moreover, tumor cell lodgement requires binding under shear stress, but not static, conditions. Here, we successfully isolate the metastatic populations of cancer stem/tumor-initiating cells (M-CSCs). We show that the M-CSCs tether more and roll slower than the non-metastatic (NM)-CSCs, thus resulting in the preferential binding to the peritoneal mesothelium under ascitic fluid shear stress. Mechanistically, this interaction is mediated by P-selectin expressed by the peritoneal mesothelium. Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 carrying an uncommon non-sulfated sialyl-Lewisx (sLex) epitope serves as a distinct P-selectin binding determinant. Several glycosyltransferases, particularly α1,3-fucosyltransferase with rate-limiting activity for sLex synthesis, are highly expressed in M-CSCs. Tumor xenografts and clinical samples corroborate the relevance of these findings. These data advance our understanding on the molecular regulation of peritoneal metastasis and support the therapeutic potential of targeting the sLex-P-selectin cascade. ? 2019, The Author(s).","alpha 1,3 fucosyltransferase; aselizumab; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; glycosyltransferase; PADGEM protein; sialidase; somatomedin C receptor; 5-acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)-galactosyl-(1-4)-(fucopyranosyl-(1-3))-N-acetylglucosamine; fucosyltransferase; galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase; oligosaccharide; PADGEM protein; SELP protein, human; somatomedin C receptor; adhesion; cancer; cell component; enzyme; enzyme activity; gene expression; growth; molecular analysis; protein; tumor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; ascites fluid; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; cell isolation; controlled study; down regulation; flow cytometry; gene expression; gene knockdown; genetic stability; genetic transfection; genotype; HEY A8 cell line; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; mesothelium; metastasis; microfluidics; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; ovary cancer; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; shear stress; SK-OV-3 cell line; tissue microarray; tumor growth; tumor volume; upregulation; Western blotting; xenograft; animal; ascites fluid; cancer transplantation; carcinoma; cell adhesion; epithelium; female; HEK293 cell line; hydrodynamics; mechanical stress; metabolism; metastasis; ovary tumor; pathology; peritoneum; peritoneum tumor; secondary; tumor cell line; Animals; Ascitic Fluid; Carcinoma; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelium; Female; Fucosyltransferases; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Hydrodynamics; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Transplantation; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Oligosaccharides; Ovarian Neoplasms; P-Selectin; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Peritoneum; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Stress, Mechanical"
"The functional ALDH2 polymorphism is associated with breast cancer risk: A pooled analysis from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium",2019,"Background: Epidemiological studies consistently indicate that alcohol consumption is an independent risk factor for female breast cancer (BC). Although the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) polymorphism (rs671: Glu>Lys) has a strong effect on acetaldehyde metabolism, the association of rs671 with BC risk and its interaction with alcohol intake have not been fully elucidated. We conducted a pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies, with individual data on Asian ancestry women participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Methods: We included 12,595 invasive BC cases and 12,884 controls for the analysis of rs671 and BC risk, and 2,849 invasive BC cases and 3,680 controls for the analysis of the gene-environment interaction between rs671 and alcohol intake for BC risk. The pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with rs671 and its interaction with alcohol intake for BC risk were estimated using logistic regression models. Results: The Lys/Lys genotype of rs671 was associated with increased BC risk (OR?=?1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.30, p?=?0.014). According to tumor characteristics, the Lys/Lys genotype was associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p?=?0.008), progesterone receptor (PR)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.03–1.36, p?=?0.015), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative BC (OR?=?1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.48, p?=?0.012). No evidence of a gene-environment interaction was observed between rs671 and alcohol intake (p?=?0.537). Conclusion: This study suggests that the Lys/Lys genotype confers susceptibility to BC risk among women of Asian ancestry, particularly for ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-negative tumor types. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Mesenchymal stem cells and their mitochondrial transfer: A double-edged sword",2019,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to many diseases including organ degeneration and cancer. Mesenchymal stem cells/stromal cells (MSCs) provide a valuable source for stem cell-based therapy and represent an emerging therapeutic approach for tissue regeneration. Increasing evidence suggests that MSCs can directly donate mitochondria to recover from cell injury and rescue mitochondrial damage-provoked tissue degeneration. Meanwhile, cancer cells and cancer stromal cells also cross-talk through mitochondrial exchange to regulate cancer metastasis. This review summarizes the research on MSCs and their mitochondrial transfer. It provides an overview of the biology, function, niches and signaling that play a role in tissue repair. It also highlights the pathologies of cancer growth and metastasis linked to mitochondrial exchange between cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells. It becomes evident that the function of MSC mitochondrial transfer is a double-edged sword. MSC mitochondrial transfer may be a pharmaceutical target for tissue repair and cancer therapy. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cytarabine; doxorubicin; etoposide; methotrexate; vincristine; acute lung injury; bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer growth; cardiac muscle cell; cell proliferation; drug resistance; heart muscle ischemia; human; induced pluripotent stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cell; inflammation; leukemia; lung injury; mesenchymal stem cell; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; metastasis; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial transfer; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; Review; signal transduction; stroma cell; therapy effect; tissue repair; wound healing"
"Brain activation and functional connectivity during Chinese writing: An fMRI study",2019,"How the brain processes writing in Chinese is largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with kinematic recording, this study examined the brain activation and functional connectivity associated with writing to dictation of Chinese characters, contrasted with drawing circles, in 33 healthy adults. It was found that writing Chinese characters recruited activation in the bilateral precentral gyrus, superior/medial frontal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, cerebellum and the left precuneus that were associated with the central and peripheral processes of writing. Functional connectivity related to Chinese writing was observed between the left precuneus and both the left pre/postcentral gyrus and the bilateral cerebellum that likely supports motor processing, whereas functional connectivity observed between the right fusiform gyrus and both the bilateral inferior/middle occipital gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus likely supports orthographic processing. Moreover, the functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus reflected the interaction between linguistic and motor processes, supporting the interactive hypothesis concerning the relationship between central and peripheral processes of writing. These findings illustrate the neural mechanisms of Chinese writing, extending our knowledge of the cognitive processing required for this form of human communication. ? 2019","adult; article; cerebellum; Chinese script; clinical article; drawing; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; fusiform gyrus; human; human experiment; inferior frontal gyrus; male; middle frontal gyrus; middle occipital gyrus; postcentral gyrus; precuneus; primary motor cortex; superior frontal gyrus; writing"
"Transfer of extracellular vesicle-associated-RNAs induces drug resistance in ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma",2019,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation is an actionable mutation in lung adenocarcinoma. Nonetheless tumour consists of heterogeneous cell subpopulations with diverse phenotypes and genotypes, and cancer cells can actively release extracellular vesicles (EVs) to modulate the phenotype of other cells in the tumour microenvironment. We hypothesized that EVs derived from a drug-resistant subpopulation of cells could induce drug resistance in recipient cells. We have established ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and subclones. The subclones have been characterized and the expression of EV-RNAs determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of EV transfer on drug resistance were examined in vitro. Serum EV-RNA was assayed serially in two patients prescribed ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK-TKI) treatment. We demonstrated that the EVs from an ALK-TKI-resistant subclone could induce drug resistance in the originally sensitive subclone. EV-RNA profiling revealed that miRNAs miR-21-5p and miR-486-3p, and lncRNAs MEG3 and XIST were differentially expressed in the EVs secreted by the resistant subclones. These circulating EV-RNA levels have been found to correlate with disease progression of EML4-ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma in patients prescribed ALK-TKI treatment. The results from this study suggest that EVs released by a drug-resistant subpopulation can induce drug resistance in other subpopulations and may sustain intratumoural heterogeneity. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Adipocyte-secreted exosomal microRNA-34a inhibits M2 macrophage polarization to promote obesity-induced adipose inflammation",2019,"Persistent, unresolved inflammation in adipose tissue is a major contributor to obesity-associated metabolic complications. However, the molecular links between lipid-overloaded adipocytes and inflammatory immune cells in obese adipose tissues remain elusive. Here we identified adipocyte-secreted microRNA-34a (miR-34a) as a key mediator through its paracrine actions on adipose-resident macrophages. The expression of miR-34a in adipose tissues was progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity. Adipose-selective or adipocyte-specific miR-34a–KO mice were resistant to obesity-induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation, and this was accompanied by a significant shift in polarization of adipose-resident macrophages from proinflammatory M1 to antiinflammatory M2 phenotype. Mechanistically, mature adipocyte-secreted exosomes transported miR-34a into macrophages, thereby suppressing M2 polarization by repressing the expression of Kr?ppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). The suppressive effects of miR-34a on M2 polarization and its stimulation of inflammatory responses were reversed by ectopic expression of Klf4 in both bone marrow–derived macrophages and adipose depots of obese mice. Furthermore, increased miR-34a expression in visceral fat of overweight/obese subjects correlated negatively with reduced Klf4 expression, but positively with the parameters of insulin resistance and metabolic inflammation. In summary, miR-34a was a key component of adipocyte-secreted exosomal vesicles that transmitted the signal of nutrient overload to the adipose-resident macrophages for exacerbation of obesity-induced systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. ? 2018 American Society for Clinical Investigation.All right reserved.","glucose; insulin; kruppel like factor 4; microRNA 34a; kruppel like factor; kruppel like factor 4; microRNA; MIRN34 microRNA, mouse; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone marrow derived macrophage; cell polarity; ectopic expression; exosome; gene expression; glucose intolerance; inflammation; insulin resistance; intra-abdominal fat; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; paracrine signaling; priority journal; adipocyte; animal; exosome; genetics; inflammation; knockout mouse; macrophage; metabolism; obesity; panniculitis; pathology; Adipocytes; Animals; Exosomes; Inflammation; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Knockout; MicroRNAs; Obesity; Panniculitis"
"Fostering Civic Awareness and Participation Among Older Adults in Hong Kong: An Empowerment-Based Participatory Photo-Voice Training Model",2019,"Social and civic participation are important tenets for both the age-friendly city and active aging frameworks promoted by the World Health Organization. Yet older adults are often under-represented in civic affairs. This study examines the effects of using photo-voice as a method in facilitating older adults’ civic participation. Specifically, an empowerment-based participatory photo-voice training model was implemented among older adults with limited formal education in Hong Kong. We conducted three focus groups comprising 12 older adults and one in-depth interview with a social worker. Findings revealed that photo-voice is an effective tool in capturing older adults’ views that would have otherwise been difficult to articulate in words or in writing, and in enhancing older adults’ ability and willingness to participate in community and civic affairs. These findings underscore the importance of using novel techniques to build a more inclusive society that incorporates the views of older adults. ?

"Which of the four models? Examining the measurement properties of the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS) in healthcare and socialcare prelicensure curriculum in Hong Kong",2019,"Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS) is one of the popular measures of perceptions of collaboration. In its original inception, a four-factor model was proposed but subsequent study offered alternative measurement models: three-factor model, two-factor model, and further revision of the three-factor model. Despite the changes in the model structures, none of these has been examined in the Asian context which could have paved the way for local researchers to start representing Asian perspectives in the discussion of interprofessional practice and cooperation in medical education. This study therefore aimed to examine the measurement properties of the IEPS by testing the four a priori models using the data from 335 Chinese students from eight prelicensure health and social care programs from two universities in Hong Kong. Through item analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and regression, the results suggest that the 12-item, three-factor model best represented the sample and was invariant across genders and year levels.

"Weighted composite quantile regression for longitudinal mixed effects models with application to AIDS studies",2019,"In longitudinal data studies, a conjunct feature of the multitudinous statistical methods is to depict the conditional mean of outcome variable. However, the conditional mean is not the best measure of centrality which may be affected by outliers. As an available alterative, composite quantile regression (CQR) can result in robust estimation results even for non-normal error distributions in regression analysis instead of the least square estimation (LSE). In this paper, we develop a weighted CQR of longitudinal mixed model from a likelihood framework based on the composite asymmetric Laplace distribution (CALD). Using the mixture representation of the CALD, we establish the joint hierarchical likelihood of the model and achieve the iterative weighted least square estimators of unknown parameters via the MCEM (Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization) algorithm. Finally, the developed procedures are illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations and an AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) data analysis. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Data handling; Information analysis; Intelligent systems; Iterative methods; Maximum principle; Monte Carlo methods; Random processes; Regression analysis; AIDS data; Longitudinal data; MCEM algorithm; Quantile regression; Random effects; Diseases"
"Anoikis resistant mediated by FASN promoted growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma",2019,"The pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma (OS) occurs commonly, which resulted from anoikis resistant (AR) of tumor cells as reported by previous studies, but the exact roles of AR in osteosarcoma were not fully studied. Our previous investigations showed fatty acid synthase (FASN) was relating to clinical features of patients with OS. In this study, we aim to explore the functions of FASN in the AR OS cells in vitro and in vivo and study the downstream effectors of FASN. In the present study, we used our established cell model to study the AR. We revealed that AR promoted cell proliferation and migration as determined by colony formation assay and transwell assay. In addition, AR assisted tumor growth in vivo. In the AR cells, the expression of FASN was higher. Thus, we constructed lentiviruses to silence or overexpress FASN in four cell lines to study functions of FASN. Silence of FASN reduced cell colonies and migration while overexpression of FASN increased colonies and migration in suspended cells. Loss of functions of FASN induced cell apoptosis in suspended OS cells while gain of function of FASN suppressed apoptosis as determined by flow cytometry. We found the levels of p-ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL declined when FASN was silenced while they increased when FASN was overexpressed. In addition, results showed that the levels of FASN and its potential related molecules (p-ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL) increased in 143B-AR and MG-63-AR cells. In vivo study showed that inhibition of FASN decreased pulmonary metastasis of OS. In conclusion, we showed that anoikis resistant and FASN as two interactional factors facilitated the progress of osteosarcoma. ? 2019, The Author(s).","fatty acid synthase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein bcl xl; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anoikis; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cell culture; cell migration; cell proliferation; colony formation; controlled study; female; flow cytometry; gene overexpression; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; osteosarcoma; priority journal"
"Multicentre evaluation of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in detecting urinary tract tuberculosis with urine samples",2019,"Genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) accounts for up to 40% of extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases. Rapid tests for GUTB are urgently needed because it is often associated with delayed health-care seeking, leading to serious consequences. This study evaluated the performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in the rapid diagnosis of urinary tract tuberculosis (UTB) and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis with urine specimens. In all, 302 patients were included from four hospitals in China. Suspected UTB patients were tested with Xpert, smear, and MGIT 960 culture. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was conducted for culture-positive cases. The performance of the assays was evaluated against MGIT 960 culture and a composite reference standard (CRS). Among all participants, 150 (49.7%) had CRS-positive UTB, of whom 36 (24.0%) were culture-confirmed. Against culture, Xpert and smear achieved a sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI: 81.3–99.3%) and 22.2% (95% CI: 10.1–39.2%), respectively. Against CRS, the sensitivity of Xpert, smear and culture was 41.3% (95% CI: 33.4–49.7%), 7.3% (95% CI: 3.7–12.7%), and 24.0% (95% CI: 17.4–31.6%). Xpert had better performance than smear and culture in detecting UTB from urine samples and could be considered for the diagnosis of UTB. Moreover, Xpert showed better performance than MGIT 960-based DST using urine culture. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Use of learning analytics data in health care–related educational disciplines: Systematic review",2019,"Background: While the application of learning analytics in tertiary education has received increasing attention in recent years, a much smaller number have explored its use in health care-related educational studies. Objective: This systematic review aims to examine the use of e-learning analytics data in health care studies with regards to how the analytics is reported and if there is a relationship between e-learning analytics and learning outcomes. Methods: We performed comprehensive searches of papers from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and ERIC) to identify relevant papers. Qualitative studies were excluded from this review. Papers were screened by 2 independent reviewers. We selected qualified studies for further investigation. Results: A total of 537 papers were screened, and 19 papers were identified. With regards to analytics undertaken, 11 studies reported the number of connections and time spent on e-learning. Learning outcome measures were defined by summative final assessment marks or grades. In addition, significant statistical results of the relationships between e-learning usage and learning outcomes were reported in 12 of the identified papers. In general, students who engaged more in e-learning resources would get better academic attainments. However, 2 papers reported otherwise with better performing students consuming less e-learning videos. A total of 14 papers utilized satisfaction questionnaires for students, and all were positive in their attitude toward e-learning. Furthermore, 6 of 19 papers reported descriptive statistics only, with no statistical analysis. Conclusions: The nature of e-learning activities reported in this review was varied and not detailed well. In addition, there appeared to be inadequate reporting of learning analytics data observed in over half of the selected papers with regards to definitions and lack of detailed information of what the analytic was recording. Although learning analytics data capture is popular, a lack of detail is apparent with regards to the capturing of meaningful and comparable data. In particular, most analytics record access to a management system or particular e-learning materials, which may not necessarily detail meaningful learning time or interaction. Hence, learning analytics data should be designed to record the time spent on learning and focus on key learning activities. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies. ?

"Clinical prognostic model for older patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"Background: Older patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are often not prescribed standard therapy. It is important to know which older patients would be candidates for aggressive therapy based on their prognosis, and to develop a model that can help determine prognosis. Methods: Data on older patients (?70 years) enrolled on 38 NCI cooperative group trials of advanced NSCLC from 1991 to 2011 were analyzed. Multivariable Cox PH model was built with a stepwise selection. We derived a prognostic score using the estimated Cox PH regression coefficient. We then calculated the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of survival in the testing set. Results: The final analysis included 1467 patients, who were randomly divided into a training (n = 963) and a testing set (n = 504). The prognostic risk score was calculated as: 3 (if male) + 3 (if PS = 1) + 8 (if PS = 2) + 11 (if initial stage = IV) + 4 (if weight loss). Patients were classified into two prognostic groups: good (0–8) and poor (?9). The median survival in the two groups in the testing set were 13.15 (95% CI, 10.82–15.91) and 8.52 months (95% CI, 7.5–9.63), respectively. The model had area under the 1-year and 2-year ROCs (0.6 and 0.65, respectively) that were higher than existing models. Conclusions: Male gender, poor performance status, distant metastases and recent weight loss predict for poor overall survival (OS) in older patients with advanced NSCLC. This study proposes a simple prognostic model for older adults with advanced NSCLC. ? 2019","aged; area under the curve; Article; body weight loss; cancer staging; distant metastasis; female; human; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; scoring system"
"Ectopic expression of recipient CD47 inhibits mouse macrophage-mediated immune rejection against human stem cell transplants",2019,"Like conventional transplants, immunosuppression is required to facilitate survival and function of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derivatives after implantation into xenogeneic recipients. We have previously reported that T cells alone are sufficient to reject allogeneic murine ESC derivatives; and strategies that inhibit T-cell activation, including coreceptor and costimulation blockade, prevent hESC derivatives from being rejected. This study aimed to investigate, in addition to T cells, whether macrophages contribute to transplant rejection of hESC xenografts with nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice that lack functional T and B cells but have macrophages. We show that acute rejection against hESC-derived endothelial cells (hESC-ECs) was mediated, to some degree, by infiltrating macrophages that phagocytosed them. Transgenic expression of murine CD47 on cell surface of hESCECs mitigates macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and improves their survival after transplantation. Our results highlightthatinnateimmune cells, such asmacrophages, canrejecthESC derivatives, raising concern againstthe use of NOD/SCID as transplant recipients for testing in vivo function of hESC-derived tissues. Augmenting CD47 signaling promotes survival and function of hESC derivatives after xenogeneic transplantation. ?

"Nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Sorafenib-experienced Asian cohort analysis",2019,"Background & Aims: Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is approved in several countries to treat sorafenib-experienced patients with HCC, based on results from the CheckMate 040 study (NCT01658878). Marked differences exist in HCC clinical presentation, aetiology, treatment patterns and outcomes across regions. This analysis assessed the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in the Asian cohort of CheckMate 040. Methods: CheckMate 040 is an international, multicentre, open-label, phase I/II study of nivolumab in adults with advanced HCC, regardless of aetiology, not amenable to curative resection or local treatment and with/without previous sorafenib treatment. This analysis included all sorafenib-experienced patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) overall population and Asian cohort. The analysis cut-off date was March 2018. Results: There were 182 and 85 patients in the ITT population and Asian cohort, respectively. In both populations, most patients were older than 60 years, had BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) Stage C disease, and had received previous systemic therapy. A higher percentage of Asian patients had HBV infections, extrahepatic metastases and prior therapies. Median follow-up was 31.6 and 31.3 months for the ITT and Asian patients, respectively. Objective response rates were 14% and 15% in the ITT population and Asian cohort, respectively. In the Asian cohort, patients with HBV, HCV or those who were uninfected had objective response rates of 13%, 14% and 21%, respectively. The median duration of response was longer in the ITT (19.4 months) vs. Asian patients (9.7 months). Median overall survival was similar between the ITT (15.1 months) and Asian patients (14.9 months), and unaffected by aetiology in Asian patients. The nivolumab safety profile was similar and manageable across both populations. Conclusion: Nivolumab safety and efficacy are comparable between sorafenib-experienced ITT and Asian patients. Lay summary: The CheckMate 040 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were refractory to previous sorafenib treatment or chemotherapy. This subanalysis of the data showed that treatment responses and safety in patients in Asia were similar to those of the overall treatment population, providing support for nivolumab as a treatment option for these patients.

"Inflammasome activation and Th17 responses",2019,"Immune sensing of exogenous molecules from microbes (e.g., pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and nonmicrobial molecules (e.g., asbestos, alum, and silica), as well as endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (e.g., ATP, uric acid crystals, and amyloid A) activates innate immunity by inducing immune-related genes, including proinflammatory cytokines, which further facilitate the development of adaptive immunity. The roles of transcriptional responses downstream of immune sensing have been widely characterized in informing adaptive immunity; however, few studies focus on the effect of post-translational responses on the modulation of adaptive immune responses. Inflammasomes activated by the previously described endo- and exogenous stimuli autocatalytically induce intracellular pro-caspase-1, which cleaves the inactive precursors of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 into bioactive proinflammatory cytokines. IL-1β and IL-18 not only contribute to the host defense against infections by activating phagocytes, such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, but also induce T-helper 17 (Th17)- and Th1-mediated adaptive immune responses. In synergy with IL-6 and IL-23, IL-1β activates IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling to drive the differentiation of IL-17-producing Th17 cells, which not only play critical roles in host protective immunity to infections of bacteria, fungi, and certain viruses but also participate in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and tumorigenesis. Consequently, targeting inflammasomes and IL-1/IL-1R signaling may effectively improve the treatment of Th17-associated disorders, such as autoinflammatory diseases and cancers, thereby providing novel insights into drug development. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","absent in melanoma 2 protein; cryopyrin; ifi16 protein; inflammasome; interleukin 1; interleukin 1 receptor; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein; nlrc4 protein; nucleotide binding domain and leucine rich repeat containing protein 1; protein; pyrin; unclassified drug; cytokine; inflammasome; Article; autoimmune disease; autoinflammatory disease; cell plasticity; cytokine release; helper cell; human; immune response; lymphocyte differentiation; malignant neoplasm; necroptosis; nonhuman; priority journal; pyroptosis; signal transduction; Th17 cell; transcription regulation; adaptive immunity; animal; cell differentiation; cytology; immunology; phagocyte; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cytokines; Humans; Inflammasomes; Phagocytes; Signal Transduction; Th1 Cells; Th17 Cells"

"The double hazard in recovery journey: The experiences of UK Chinese users of mental health services",2019,"Background: The recent interest in recovery from mental health problems has not meaningfully addressed the perspectives of ethnic minorities. Aim: To contribute to the discussion of recovery-oriented service with a study on the experience of Chinese people using UK mental health services. Methods: In-depth life history interviews were carried out with the users. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four themes emerged as hindrances to personal recovery: (1) language difficulty creates hurdles, (2) diagnostic label is experienced as a double-edged sword, (3) treatment-related stigma and (dis)empowerment are identified, and (4) grievances are found in hospitalisation. Discussion: Having mental illness and being an ethnic minority in the UK experienced double hazard in their recovery journey. While the deprivation of agency and the stigma process in the health care system hinders their recovery, they are further disadvantaged by their ethnic minority status. Four pointers for service improvement, that apply to Chinese users in the United Kingdom and have general implications for users beyond this group, are proposed. ?

"Oxyresveratrol exerts ATF4- and Grp78-mediated neuroprotection against endoplasmic reticulum stress in experimental Parkinson’s disease",2019,"Objectives: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is one of the key mechanisms contributing to Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathology. Pathways triggered by ER stress are protective at early stages and initiate apoptosis when the damage is extensive. Methods: We have previously reported that oxyresveratrol rescues cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis in a cell culture model of PD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the neuroprotective mechanism of oxyresveratrol extends to PD-associated ER stress. For this purpose, we employed two cellular models; to induce severe ER stress, Mes23.5 cells were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and for ER stress driven by chaperones, human neuroblastoma cells were stably transfected to overexpress familial mutants of α-synuclein (α-syn). Results: Our results indicate that oxyresveratrol exhibits distinct modes of protection in both models. In the 6-OHDA model, it inhibited the transcription of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which controls the fate of pro-apoptotic proteins. On the other hand, in the α-syn model, oxyresveratrol suppressed mutant A30P oligomer formation, thereby facilitating a reduction of the ER-chaperone, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78). Discussion: In summary, oxyresveratrol is protective against ER stress induced by two different triggers of PD. Owing to its wide range of defense mechanisms, oxyresveratrol is an ideal candidate for a multifactorial disease like PD. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Ten-year follow up of patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder from an early intervention service: Predictors of clinical remission and functional recovery",2019,"The long-term recovery rate of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders has been persistently low despite the implementation of early intervention (EI) services internationally. It is, therefore, important to identify the modifiable factors during the early stage of the illness that predict long-term remission and recovery. The aim of this study is to explore the predictive value of the early stage clinical factors on the clinical remission and functional recovery at 10-year follow-up of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who received a 2-year EI service. Patients who received the EI service throughout the region of Hong Kong between 1st July 2001 and 30th June 2002 and with a diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were identified from the centralized hospital database (Clinical Management system, CMS). Semi-structured clinical interview was conducted at 10-year follow-up with a successful interview rate of 74.3% (n = 107). Clinical data was systematically retrieved each month for the first three years from the CMS and written clinical records using a standardized data entry form based on operationalized definitions. Results found shorter duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) predicted long-term clinical remission; higher educational level and shorter period of unemployment during the initial three years of the illness predicted functional recovery. Higher educational level, longer period of employment and planned medication discontinuation during the initial three years predicted complete recovery. The current study demonstrates the long-term impact of DUP and suggests improvement of employment during the early stage of illness could be a potential target for further improvement of the service. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adolescent; adult; Article; controlled study; database management system; disease course; educational status; female; follow up; Hong Kong; hospital; human; information retrieval; major clinical study; male; medical record; medication compliance; mental health service; mental patient; predictive value; priority journal; remission; risk factor; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; semi structured interview; time to treatment; unemployment; early intervention; employment; follow up; psychosis; schizophrenia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Early Medical Intervention; Educational Status; Employment; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Psychotic Disorders; Remission Induction; Schizophrenia; Young Adult"

"Treatment outcome and pattern of failure in hepatoblastoma treated with a consensus protocol in Hong Kong",2019,"Background and aim: We reviewed the results and pattern of failure of the consensus HB/HCC 1996 treatment protocol for pediatric hepatoblastoma (HB) in Hong Kong. The role of SIOPEL and Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration (CHIC) risk stratification was evaluated. Methods: Patients enrolled on the protocol from 1996 to 2014 were included. PRETEXT staging, SIOPEL, and CHIC risk groups were retrospectively assigned. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled with median age at diagnosis of 1.1 years and median follow-up time of 6.8 years. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was raised (>100?ng/mL) in 58 (97%) patients. Five (8%) had metastases at presentation and 7 (12%) experienced tumor rupture prior to or during treatment. Twenty-nine patients (48%) received a first-line cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine regimen only while 23 (38%) also had alternative chemotherapeutic agents. Hepatic resection could be performed in 48 (80%) patients. Three (5%) patients underwent upfront liver transplantation. Five-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 69.2%?±?6.1% and 77.6%?±?5.5% respectively. Among the 16 patients with relapse/progression, 9 had intrahepatic failure only, 5 had distant failure only, and 2 had combined local and distant failure. Predictors of inferior outcome included advanced Evans staging, disease involving both lobes, rupture, low AFP, and suboptimal response to first-line chemotherapy. Assigned in 44 patients, PRETEXT staging, SIOPEL, and CHIC risk groups significantly predicted EFS and OS. Conclusions: Although the consensus HB/HCC 1996 protocol led to cure in three-quarters of pediatric HB patients, an upfront risk stratification system is required to identify and improve the outcome of high-risk patients. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alpha fetoprotein; APC protein; carboplatin; cisplatin; docetaxel; doxorubicin; etoposide; fluorouracil; ifosfamide; irinotecan; topotecan; vincristine; antineoplastic agent; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; child; consensus; event free survival; female; follow up; hepatoblastoma; high risk population; Hong Kong; human; liver failure; liver resection; liver transplantation; major clinical study; male; metastasis; multimodality cancer therapy; multiple cycle treatment; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; surgical margin; survival rate; treatment failure; treatment outcome; tumor regression; hepatoblastoma; infant; liver tumor; longitudinal study; mortality; pathology; preschool child; prospective study; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Child; Child, Preschool; Combined Modality Therapy; Consensus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatoblastoma; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"
"Influence of functional, psychological, and environmental factors on falls among community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong",2019,"Aim: The growth of the ageing population has been rapid. However, this ageing population is not homogeneous; individuals have different levels of functionality and psychosocial status, and some are members of at-risk or high-risk groups. As such, studies on the functional, psychological, and environmental factors of falls among community-dwelling older adults are imperative. By investigating the effect of life satisfaction, as well as environmental and functional factors, on falls among community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong, this study aims to address this concern. Methods: The study recruited 249 participants. Both self-reported questionnaires and home safety assessments were administrated. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that life satisfaction and instrumental activities of daily living were significant predictors of falls. Significant differences between fallers and non-fallers were found in functional and psychological areas. The presence of home hazards was low and not associated with falls in this population. However, this variable was negatively associated with life satisfaction and predicted by one of its domains, satisfaction of possession. Conclusion: These results can help health-care and social service providers to identify the needs and types of support required for effective fall prevention and to better tailor and target community intervention for older adults. ? 2018 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society","aged; aging; article; community dwelling person; controlled study; daily life activity; environmental factor; female; high risk population; home safety; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; life satisfaction; major clinical study; male; questionnaire; social work; daily life activity; demography; environmental planning; falling; Hong Kong; independent living; psychology; satisfaction; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Accidental Falls; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Environment Design; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Independent Living; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Residence Characteristics"
"Therapeutic Implications of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Attenuating Influenza A(H5N1) Virus-Associated Acute Lung Injury",2019,"Background Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses can cause severe forms of acute lung injury (ALI) in humans, where pulmonary flooding leads to respiratory failure. The therapeutic benefits of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated in a model of ALI due to influenza A(H5N1) virus. However, clinical translation is impractical and limited by a decline in efficacy as the age of the donor increases. Umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs) are easier to obtain by comparison, and their primitive source may offer more-potent therapeutic effects. Methods Here we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of UC-MSCs on the mechanisms of pulmonary edema formation and alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability of A(H5N1)-infected human alveolar epithelial cells. UC-MSCs were also tested in a mouse model of influenza ALI. Results We found that UC-MSCs were effective in restoring impaired alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability of A(H5N1)-infected human alveolar epithelial cells. UC-MSCs consistently outperformed bone marrow MSCs, partly because of greater growth factor secretion of angiopoietin 1 and hepatocyte growth factor. Conditioned UC-MSC medium and UC-MSC exosomes were also able to recapitulate these effects. However, UC-MSCs only slightly improved survival of A(H5N1)-infected mice. Conclusions Our results suggest that UC-MSCs are effective in restoring alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability in A(H5N1)-associated ALI and confer functional in addition to practical advantages over conventional bone marrow MSCs. ?

"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in a dermatomyositis patient with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 antibody and interstitial lung disease despite an initial response to immunosuppressant",2019,"We report a 24-year-old man with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) antibody-positive dermatomyositis (DM) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum. By comparing serial thoracic high-resolution computed tomography scans, we demonstrated the distinct time course showing a paradoxical occurrence of pneumomediastinum despite a radiological improvement of ILD. Our case shows that pneumomediastinum in DM can occur regardless of associated ILD and it is a serious complication that should be considered in DM patients presenting with pulmonary manifestations. Cutaneous vasculopathy may be associated with pneumomediastinum and could potentially be a useful indicator of future disease. ? 2017 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","C reactive protein; creatine kinase; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 antibody; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; oxygen; prednisolone; protein antibody; rituximab; tacrolimus; unclassified drug; autoantibody; IFIH1 protein, human; immunosuppressive agent; interferon induced helicase C domain containing protein 1; adult; antibody detection; Article; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; creatine kinase blood level; debridement; dermatomyositis; disease association; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug megadose; dyspnea; finger ulcer; human; image analysis; immunosuppressive treatment; interstitial lung disease; lung emphysema; lung function test; lung infiltrate; male; oxygen saturation; oxygen therapy; pneumomediastinum; priority journal; protein blood level; thorax radiography; treatment duration; treatment response; young adult; blood; complication; dermatomyositis; diagnostic imaging; immunology; interstitial lung disease; pneumomediastinum; time factor; x-ray computed tomography; Autoantibodies; Dermatomyositis; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1; Lung Diseases, Interstitial; Male; Mediastinal Emphysema; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult"
"Particle deposition in the human lung: Health implications of particulate matter from different sources",2019,"Although ambient particulate matter or particles have been found to be associated with morbidity and mortality all over the world, specific health effects of particles from different sources need further elucidation. The objective of this work is to predict the deposition of particles from different sources in the human lung. The whole lung, consisting of 24 generations of branches from trachea to alveoli, was approximated using a one-dimensional lumped “trumpet” model with a variable cross-sectional area. The aerosol dynamics equation was numerically solved using a finite difference method to investigate the transport and deposition of particles in the lung model. Particles from various sources were assumed to be different in both size and density. We found that in general, coarse particles (> 2.5 ?m) were mainly deposited in the tracheobronchial (TB) region by impaction, and fine particles (< 2.5 ?m) were mainly deposited in the pulmonary (P) region by sedimentation and diffusion. However, the coarse particles with low density can be deposited in P region by sedimentation. As a comparison, our results found that soil particles, which are coarse with low density, were deposited in the deep lung more than traffic particles, which are fine with high density.

For humans, exposure to infected birds can cause conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms. NDV infections in mammals are rarely reported. In this study, using next-generation sequencing, an NDV was identified and isolated from Vero cells inoculated with the nasal swab of an aborted dromedary fetus in Dubai, during the time when an NDV outbreak occurred in a pigeon farm located in close proximity to the dairy camel farm where the mother of the aborted dromedary fetus resided, and there were a lot of pigeons in the camel farm. Genome analysis revealed that the structurally and functionally important features of other NDVs were also present in this dromedary NDV genome. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and complete polyprotein showed that the virus belonged to sub-genotype VIg of class II NDV and is most closely related to pigeon NDVs in Egypt in the same year. The present study is the first that demonstrated isolation of NDV in dromedaries. Further study is warranted to investigate the relationship between NDV infection and abortion.",""
"An insight into the health-related quality of life of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients who are braced, observed, and previously braced",2019,"Study Design.Prospective cross-sectional study.Objective.To determine the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients undergoing bracing, previously braced and observation only.Summary of Background Data.HRQoL is an important treatment outcome measure for AIS. A poor HRQoL may also negatively influence the success of bracing by reducing the likelihood of good brace compliance. Yet, the HRQoL thresholds for patients undergoing observation only, brace treatment or previous brace treatment is not well understood.Methods.Chinese AIS patients with refined Scoliosis Research Society 22-item (SRS-22r) Questionnaire and 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire scores were consecutively recruited for this cross-sectional study. Patients were grouped based on their treatment modality (observation only, bracing, previously braced, and postoperatively). Coronal and sagittal Cobb angles, degree of apical vertebral rotation, and curve type were studied. Spearman correlation test, independent t test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey Post-hoc test were performed for statistical analysis.Results.A total of 652 AIS patients with mean age of 14.8±1.9 years and mean Cobb angle of 18.6°±10.0° was studied. The respective mean SRS-22r total scores for bracing, observation, and previously braced groups were 4.20, 4.54, and 4.42, and mean EQ-5D-5L scores were 0.87, 0.95, and 0.92. The total and domain scores were correlated with coronal Cobb angles (P<0.001) while only EQ-5D-5L correlated with sagittal Cobb angles (P<0.001). Curves greater than 40° had worse HRQoL (P<0.001). Currently braced patients had significantly worse HRQoL than those under observation, as indicated by lower EQ-5D-5L (0.08) and SRS-22r (0.35) scores (P<0.001 to P<0.05). Previously braced patients had better HRQoL than currently braced patients, with 0.05 higher EQ-5D-5L score (P<0.001), and 0.23 higher SRS-22r score (P<0.001). However, currently braced patients were more satisfied with treatment (1.94 difference; P<0.001) than previously braced. There were no gross differences between patients previously braced and undergoing observation only.Conclusion.The negative impact of bracing on HRQoL is only transient as previously braced patients have superior HRQoL. It appears as though the EQ-5D-5L scores are more sensitive to changes in the sagittal profile as compared with SRS-22r. Our study highlights the differences in HRQoL between patients only being observed, undergoing bracing or previous brace treatment and the importance of monitoring HRQoL throughout follow-up. Further longitudinal studies may help determine the timing and threshold of HRQoL changes during the entire duration of bracing as well as after brace weaning.Level of Evidence: 2. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis: A systematic review",2019,"Background: Conventional treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities by anticoagulation alone has been proven to be insufficient to prevent recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Early restoration of venous patency and preservation of valvular function by endovascular surgery has been advocated. The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) against catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. Methods: Three hundred sixty-nine articles were identified through screening of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from January 2006 to December 2016. Results: Fifteen retrospective studies and one prospective registry, totalling 1170 patients, were recruited for qualitative synthesis. The venous patency rate ranged from 75% to 100% with mean follow-up of 12.3 months. The rates of PTS and recurrent DVT were less than 17% and 15%, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 0.26%. Compared with CDT, PMT was shown to reduce PTS at 1 year (Villalta score: 2.1 ± 3.0 in the PMT group and 5.1 ± 4.1 in the CDT group, P=0.03) and bleeding complications (packed cells transfused: 0.2 ± 0.3 units in the pharmacomechanical thrombectomy group and 1.2 ± 0.7 units in the CDT group, P<0.05). Conclusion: Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT in terms of restoration of venous patency, prevention of DVT recurrence, and PTS. Compared with CDT alone, PMT offers a lower risk of PTS and bleeding complications. ? 2019 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.","angioplasty; bleeding; blood clot lysis; blood transfusion; brain hemorrhage; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; deep vein thrombosis; epistaxis; follow up; gastritis; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; hemolytic anemia; hospitalization; human; injury scale; intensive care unit; lower extremity deep vein thrombosis; mechanical thrombectomy; mortality; outcome assessment; phlebography; postthrombosis syndrome; retroperitoneal hemorrhage; Review; rheolytic thrombectomy; systematic review; thrombus aspiration; vascular patency; acute disease; adverse event; fibrinolytic therapy; lower limb; mechanical thrombectomy; pathophysiology; postthrombosis syndrome; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; vascularization; vein thrombosis; fibrinolytic agent; Acute Disease; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Lower Extremity; Mechanical Thrombolysis; Postthrombotic Syndrome; Risk Factors; Thrombolytic Therapy; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Patency; Venous Thrombosis"
"The ribosomal maturation factor P from Mycobacterium smegmatis facilitates the ribosomal biogenesis by binding to the small ribosomal protein S12",2019,"The ribosomal maturation factor P (RimP) is a highly conserved protein in bacteria and has been shown to be important in ribosomal assembly in Escherichia coli. Because of its central importance in bacterial metabolism, RimP represents a good potential target for drug design to combat human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, to date, the only RimP structure available is the NMR structure of the ortholog in another bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Here, we report a 2.2 ? resolution crystal structure of MSMEG_2624, the RimP ortholog in the close M. tuberculosis relative Mycobacterium smegmatis, and using in vitro binding assays, we show that MSMEG_2624 interacts with the small ribosomal protein S12, also known as RpsL. Further analyses revealed that the conserved residues in the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains of MSMEG_2624 are essential for binding to RpsL. However, neither of the two domains alone was sufficient to form strong interactions with RpsL. More importantly, the linker region was essential for in vivo ribosomal biogenesis. Our study provides critical mechanistic insights into the role of RimP in ribosome biogenesis. We anticipate that the MSMEG_2624 crystal structure has the potential to be used for drug design to manage M. tuberculosis infections. ? 2019 Chu et al.","Biosynthesis; Escherichia coli; Proteins; Bacterial metabolism; Bacterial pathogens; Mycobacterium smegmatis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; N-and C-terminal domains; Ribosome biogenesis; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Strong interaction; Crystal structure; bacterial protein; protein RpsL; ribosomal maturation factor P; ribosome protein; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; protein binding; ribosome protein; affinity chromatography; amino terminal sequence; Article; binding assay; biogenesis; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; crystal structure; hydrogen bond; in vitro study; in vivo study; Mycobacterium smegmatis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein processing; protein purification; tandem mass spectrometry; biosynthesis; chemistry; metabolism; protein domain; ribosome; Streptococcus pneumoniae; X ray crystallography; Bacterial Proteins; Crystallography, X-Ray; Mycobacterium smegmatis; Protein Binding; Protein Domains; Ribosomal Proteins; Ribosomes; Streptococcus pneumoniae"
"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Rehabilitative Interventions for Unilateral Spatial Neglect and Hemianopia Poststroke From 2006 Through 2016",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of activity-based, nonactivity-based, and combined activity- and nonactivity-based rehabilitative interventions for individuals presenting with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and hemianopia. Data Sources: We searched CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed from 2006 to 2016. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a score of 6 or more in the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale that examined the effects of activity-based and nonactivity-based rehabilitation interventions for people with USN or hemianopia. Two reviewers selected studies independently. Data Extraction: Extracted data from the published RCTs. Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. Data Synthesis: A total of 20 RCTs for USN and 5 for hemianopia, involving 594 and 206 stroke participants respectively, were identified. Encouraging results were found in relation to activity-based interventions for visual scanning training and compensatory training for hemianopia (MD=5.11; 95% confidence intervals [95% CI], 0.83-9.4; P=.019; I 2 =25.16% on visual outcomes), and optokinetic stimulation and smooth pursuit training for USN (SMD=0.49; 95% CI, 0.01-0.97; P=.045; I 2 =49.35%) on functional performance in activities of daily living, (SMD=0.96; 95% CI, 0.09-1.82; P=.031; I 2 =89.57%) on neglect. Conclusions: Activity-based interventions are effective and commonly used in the treatment of USN and hemianopia. Nonactivity-based and combined approaches, for both impairments, have not been refuted, because more studies are required for substantiated conclusions to be drawn. ? 2018 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","cerebrovascular accident; clinical effectiveness; daily life activity; hemianopia; human; meta analysis; neglected disease; optokinetic stimulation; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; stroke rehabilitation; systematic review; unilateral spatial neglect; cerebrovascular accident; complication; hemianopia; perception disorder; procedures; stroke rehabilitation; Hemianopsia; Humans; Perceptual Disorders; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation"

"Transmission risk of avian influenza virus along poultry supply chains in Guangdong, China",2019,"Objectives: Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) poise significant risk to human health and the poultry industry. We evaluated the transmission risk along the poultry supply chain. Methods: During October 2015 and July 2016, four rounds of cross-sectional surveys were performed to characterize AIV spread in farms, transport vehicles, slaughterhouses, wholesale and retail live poultry markets (LPMs). Poultry cloacal and oral swabs, environmental swabs, bioaerosol samples and human sera were collected. Poultry and environmental samples were tested for AIVs by rRT-PCR, further subtyped by next generation sequencing. Previous human H9N2 infections were identified by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization tests. Logistic regression was fitted to compare AIV transmission risk in different settings. Results: AIVs was detected in 23.9% (424/1771) of the poultry and environmental samples. AIV detection rates in farms, transport vehicles, wholesale and retail LPMs were 4.5%, 11.1%, 30.3% and 51.2%, respectively. 5.2%, 8.3% and 12.8% of the poultry workers were seropositive in farms, wholesale and retail LPMs, respectively. The regression analysis showed that virus detection and transmission risk to human increased progressively along the poultry supply chain. Conclusions: Strengthening control measures at every level along the poultry supply chain, using a one health approach, is crucial to control AIV circulation. ? 2019","agricultural land; article; avian influenza virus; case report; China; clinical article; hemagglutination inhibition; human; Influenza A virus (H9N2); market; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; poultry; prevalence; risk assessment; slaughterhouse; virus detection; worker"
"Survival in lung cancer among female never-smokers in rural Xuanwei and Fuyuan counties in Eastern Yunnan Province, China",2019,"Background and objective Lung cancer rates among women in rural Xuanwei and Fuyuan counties in eastern Yunnan province, China, are among the highest in the world, even though almost all women are non-smokers, and they tend to develop lung cancer at a younger age than other locations by roughly 5 yr-10 yr. This study investigated the survival of lung cancer patients among female never-smokers. Methods The female neversmokers, who had lived for many years in Xuanwei and Fuyuan counties, with lung cancer newly-diagnosed between July 2006 to March 2010, were followed up through the end of 2016. Age-standardized relative survival for all cases was calculated using local life table. The Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test were used to analyze the relationship between the variables and the prognosis in univariate analysis. Cox regression analysis was employed in the multivariate analysis. Results Among 1,250 total subjects, 1,075 died and the remaining 175 were censored during the follow-up, with a median follow-up period of 69 months (95%CI: 61.9-76.0). Overall, the mean age was (54.8 ± 10.9) yr, with variable clinical stages: 3.5% of cases were stage I, 8.7% stage II, 20.7% stage III, 29.7% stage IV, and 37.4% stage unknown. The 645 patients(51.6%) with cyto-histological diagnosis contains 303 with Squamous cell carcinoma, and 231 with adenocarcinoma, 24 with small cell, 43 with other specified type and 39 with unknown histological type. Only 215 (17.2%) patients received surgery, 487 (39.0%) were treated without surgery, and 548 (43.8%) did not receive any specific anticancer therapy. The 5-year observed survival rate and age-standardized relative survival were 8.9% (95%CI: 7.0-10.6), and 10.1% (95%CI: 3.7-20.5) respectively, with a median survival of 13.2 months. The 5-year survival rates were 41.1% for stage I, 22.4% for stage II, 5.3% for stage III, 1.3% for stage IV, 11.2% for missing stage, 17.9% for adenocarcinoma, and 5.6% for squamous cell carcinoma respectively. Surgery significantly improved 5-year survival rate compared with non-surgery (34.8% vs 3.2%, P<0.001). The patients with non-treatment, aged 65 years and older, living in rural areas and farmer with low socioeconomic status had poorer survival, whereas the patients treated in provincial hospitals and chest X-ray screening had better survival. Cox multivariate analysis further showed that stage of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM), treatment status, hospital-level, and X-ray screening were factors correlated with survival. Conclusion Patients with lung cancer among female never-smokers in Xuanwei and Fuyuan experience poorer survival, because they are less likely to be diagnosed at early stage, as well as less likely to receive surgery and comprehensive treatment. Furthermore low socioeconomic status and poor health security are also responsible for the low survival. ? 2019, Chinese Journal of Lung Cancer.

"FAM134B promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in vitro and its correlations with clinicopathologic features",2019,"Family with sequence similarity 134, member B (FAM134B) is an autophagy regulator of endoplasmic reticulum first discovered to be involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The present study examined the functional behavior of FAM134B in cancer cells and the association of FAM134B expression with clinicopathologic factors in patients with ESCC. Expression at both the mRNA and protein levels was investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The results were correlated with the clinical and pathological features of the patients. In addition, in vitro functional assays were used to investigate the roles of FAM134B in ESCC cells in response to gene silencing with shRNA lentiviral particles. Overexpression of FAM134B mRNA and protein was present in 31.2% (n = 29/93) and 36.6% (n = 41/112), respectively, in tumors, whereas downregulation occurred in 39.8% (n = 37/93) and 63.4% (n = 71/112), respectively. Expression of FAM134B protein in ESCC correlated with histologic grade (P =.002) and pathologic stage (P =.012). In vitro suppression of FAM134B in ESCC induced significant reductions of cell proliferation and colony formation (P <.05). In addition, suppression of FAM134B caused reduction of wound healing, migration, and invasion capacities of ESCC. To conclude, FAM134B could play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of ESCC, and FAM134B protein expression has potential predictive value. Therefore, development of strategies targeting FAM134B could have therapeutic value in the management of patients with ESCC. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","family with sequence similarity 134, member b protein; lentivirus vector; messenger RNA; protein; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; membrane protein; RETREG1 protein, human; signal peptide; small interfering RNA; tumor marker; adult; Article; autophagy; cancer cell; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell invasion assay; cell proliferation; cell proliferation assay; colony formation; distant metastasis; endoplasmic reticulum; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line; esophagus mucosa; female; functional behavior; gene silencing; HaCat cell line; HKESC-1 cell line; human; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; KYSE-150 cell line; KYSE-450 cell line; KYSE-520 cell line; KYSE-70 cell line; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pathogenesis; predictive value; protein blood level; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; surgical margin; survival time; tumor cell; tumor differentiation; tumor promotion; Western blotting; wound healing; wound healing assay; cancer grading; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; follow up; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mortality; pathology; prognosis; survival rate; tumor cell line; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Membrane Proteins; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Prognosis; RNA, Small Interfering; Survival Rate"
"The Hong Kong Survey on the Epidemiology of Trauma Exposure and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",2019,"This study examined the epidemiology of trauma exposure (TE) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among community-dwelling Chinese adults in Hong Kong. Multistage stratification sampling design was used, and 5,377 participants were included. In Phase 1, TE, probable PTSD (p-PTSD), and psychiatric comorbid conditions were examined. In Phase 2, the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-I) was used to determine the weighted diagnostic prevalence of lifetime full PTSD. Disability level and health service utilization were studied. The findings showed that the weighted prevalence of TE was 64.8%, and increased to 88.7% when indirect TE types were included, with transportation accidents (50.8%) reported as the most common TE. The prevalence of current p-PTSD among participants with TE was 2.9%. Results of logistic regression suggested that nine specific trauma types were significantly associated with p-PTSD; among this group, severe human suffering, sexual assault, unwanted or uncomfortable sexual experience, captivity, and sudden and violent death carried the greatest risks for developing PTSD, odds ratio (OR) = 2.32–2.69. The occurrence of p-PTSD was associated with more mental health burdens, including (a) sixfold higher rates for any past-week common mental disorder, OR = 28.4, (b) more mental health service utilization, p <.001, (c) poorer mental health indexes in level of symptomatology, suicide ideation and functioning, p <.001, and (d) more disability, ps <.001–p =.014. The associations found among TE, PTSD, and health service utilization suggest that both TE and PTSD should be considered public health concerns. ? 2019 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies",""
"Guidelines for Perioperative Care in Esophagectomy: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS?) Society Recommendations",2019,"Introduction: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs provide a format for multidisciplinary care and has been shown to predictably improve short term outcomes associated with surgical procedures. Esophagectomy has historically been associated with significant levels of morbidity and mortality and as a result routine application and audit of ERAS guidelines specifically designed for esophageal resection has significant potential to improve outcomes associated with this complex procedure. Methods: A team of international experts in the surgical management of esophageal cancer was assembled and the existing literature was identified and reviewed prior to the production of the guidelines. Well established procedure specific components of ERAS were reviewed and updated with changes relevant to esophagectomy. Procedure specific, operative and technical sections were produced utilizing the best current level of evidence. All sections were rated regarding the level of evidence and overall recommendation according to the evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: Thirty-nine sections were ultimately produced and assessed for quality of evidence and recommendations. Some sections were completely new to ERAS programs due to the fact that esophagectomy is the first guideline with a thoracic component to the procedure. Conclusions: The current ERAS society guidelines should be reviewed and applied in all centers looking to improve outcomes and quality associated with esophageal resection. ? 2018, Soci?t?

"Apigenin and its methylglyoxal-adduct inhibit advanced glycation end products-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in endothelial cells",2019,"Protein glycation in the body can lead to malfunction of intracellular and extracellular proteins. Reactive carbonyl species (RCS) have been identified to be key intermediates in the reactions. The reaction products, generally termed as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), have been implicated in the development of diabetic complications. In this study, the activity of apigenin (API), a natural flavone in scavenging RCS and the molecular mechanism involved in its protective effect against AGEs-induced oxidative stress and inflammation were examined in vitro. Results showed that API could directly trap methylglyoxal (MGO) to form API-MGO adducts, thus inhibiting AGEs formation. API and di-apigenin adduct (DMA) were found to inhibit AGEs-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by significantly suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (30% relative to control) and decreasing the protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules by 30–70%. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that the protective effect was likely mediated via suppression of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway initiated by AGEs-RAGE (receptor for AGEs) interaction and induction of ERK/nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway with subsequent up-regulation of antioxidant defense molecules. In summary, our results suggest that API possesses great potential to protect against AGEs-associated health disorders by modulating cellular inflammatory and antioxidant defense signaling pathways. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","advanced glycation end product; apigenin; carbohydrate derivative; di methylglyoxal apigenin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; methylglyoxal; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; reactive carbonyl species; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; Article; cell free system; cell viability; chondrocyte; controlled study; cytokine release; drug mechanism; human; human cell; in vitro study; inflammation; macrophage; molecular weight; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; ultraviolet spectroscopy; umbilical vein endothelial cell; upregulation"
"Rates and predictors of disengagement of patients with first-episode psychosis from the early intervention service for sychosis service (EASY) covering 15 to 64 years of age in Hong Kong",2019,"Aim: This study aims at assessing the rate and predictors of disengagement of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) from the early intervention (EI) service in Hong Kong (EASY) that covers age 15 to 64. Methods: All FEP patients aged 15 to 64 years who were newly registered with the EASY programme of Kowloon West Psychiatric Unit from January to December 2012 were included. Data on socio-demographic, clinical characteristics and disengagement over 3 years of the EI service were obtained retrospectively through systematic clinical record review. Predictors of 3 different types of disengagement and their rate of occurrence were identified: complete disengagement (type I), disengaged and re-engaged through hospitalization (type II) and re-engaged as outpatient (type III). Results: Among the 277 patients included for analysis, 36 patients (13%) had type I disengagement, 17.2% (N = 21) were of age 15 to 25 and 9.7% (N = 15) were of age 25 to 64. Type II and type III disengagements were 4.3% and 13.4%, respectively. Early-stage poor drug compliance significantly predicted type I and type II disengagements. History of substance use, suicidal attempts and poor drug compliance predicted type III disengagement. Younger patients had significant earlier disengagement (χ2 = 5.01, df = 1, P =.025). Conclusion: Results of the current study highlighted the different patterns of disengagement for different age groups and the importance of identifying the high-risk group at early stage of the illness. With the expansion of EI service for wider age group, studies of the differential needs of patient with different ages would be important to guide the future service development. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","acute psychosis; adolescent; adult; age distribution; Article; bipolar disorder; controlled study; depressive psychosis; early intervention; female; high risk population; Hong Kong; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; mental health care; outpatient care; prediction; priority journal; psychosis; retrospective study; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; substance use; suicide attempt; survival analysis; early intervention; middle aged; patient attitude; psychology; psychosis; risk factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Early Medical Intervention; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult"

Results: Higher HCY was associated with higher body mass index, free testosterone and lower FSH, fasting glucose (P < 0.001; P < 0.001; P = 0.005; P < 0.001) and ovulation rate among all participants (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.86; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83 tertiles 2 and 3 versus tertile 1, respectively). The HHCY group had lower oestradiol and higher free testosterone (P = 0.04; P < 0.001) than the controls. In the metabolic syndrome group, LH, LH–FSH ratio and sex hormone-binding globulin were lowest in the metabolic syndrome group (all P < 0.001). In the HHCY group, ovulation rate decreased and the second or third trimester pregnancy loss rate increased compared with controls (OR 1.678, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.70; OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42) with treatment adjustment. Compared with the controls, ovulation, conception, pregnancy, second or third trimester pregnancy loss and live birth rates were statistically lower in the metabolic syndrome group after adjusting treatment (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.70; OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.65; OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.44; OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.33; OR 2.42 95% CI 1.42 to 4.10), and pregnancy, pregnancy loss and live birth rates remained significantly different after adjusting for treatment and sex-hormone factors (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.99; OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.82; OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.50). Conclusions: In women with PCOS, HHCY contributes to increased pregnancy loss and reduced ovulation, and metabolic syndrome was related to defects in ovulation, conception, pregnancy, pregnancy loss and live birth, indicating that the two conditions lead to defects at various reproductive stages. ? 2019","glucose; homocysteine; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; adult; Article; birth rate; body mass; China; comparative study; conception; controlled study; disease association; female; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; live birth; major clinical study; metabolic syndrome X; multicenter study; ovary polycystic disease; ovulation; pregnancy; reproduction; secondary analysis; third trimester pregnancy"
"The role of ginsenoside Rb1, a potential natural glutathione reductase agonist, in preventing oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of H9C2 cells",2020,"Background: Oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis is a key pathological process in ischemic heart disease. Glutathione reductase (GR) reduces glutathione disulfide to glutathione (GSH) to alleviate oxidative stress. Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) prevents the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes; however, the role of GR in this process is unclear. Therefore, the effects of GRb1 on GR were investigated in this study. Methods: The antiapoptotic effects of GRb1 were evaluated in H9C2 cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and Western blotting. The antioxidative effects were measured by a reactive oxygen species assay, and GSH levels and GR activity were examined in the presence and absence of the GR inhibitor 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the binding of GRb1 to GR. The direct influence of GRb1 on GR was confirmed by recombinant human GR protein. Results: GRb1 pretreatment caused dose-dependent inhibition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cell apoptosis, at a level comparable to that of the positive control N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The binding energy between GRb1 and GR was positive (?6.426 kcal/mol), and the binding was stable. GRb1 significantly reduced reactive oxygen species production and increased GSH level and GR activity without altering GR protein expression in H9C2 cells. Moreover, GRb1 enhanced the recombinant human GR protein activity in vitro, with a half-maximal effective concentration of ?2.317 μM. Conversely, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea co-treatment significantly abolished the GRb1's apoptotic and antioxidative effects of GRb1 in H9C2 cells. Conclusion: GRb1 is a potential natural GR agonist that protects against oxidative stress–induced apoptosis of H9C2 cells. ? 2019","ginsenoside Rb 1; glutathione; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal cell; antiapoptotic activity; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; EC50; embryo; H9c2(2-1) cell line; heart protection; in vitro study; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; MTT assay; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; rat; staining; upregulation; Western blotting"
"The unique trimeric assembly of the virulence factor HtrA from Helicobacter pylori occurs via N-terminal domain swapping",2019,"Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of specific bacterial virulence factors can significantly contribute to antibacterial drug discovery. Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that infects almost half of the world's population, leading to gastric disorders and even gastric cancer. H. pylori expresses a series of virulence factors in the host, among which high-temperature requirement A (HpHtrA) is a newly identified serine protease secreted by H. pylori. HpHtrA cleaves the extracellular domain of the epithelial cell surface adhesion protein E-cadherin and disrupts gastric epithelial cell junctions, allowing H. pylori to access the intercellular space. Here we report the first crystal structure of HpHtrA at 3.0 ? resolution. The structure revealed a new type of HtrA protease trimer stabilized by unique N-terminal domain swapping distinct from other known HtrA homologs. We further observed that truncation of the N terminus completely abrogates HpHtrA trimer formation as well as protease activity. In the presence of unfolded substrate, HpHtrA assembled into cage-like 12-mers or 24-mers. Combining crystallographic, biochemical, and mutagenic data, we propose a mechanistic model of how HpHtrA recognizes and cleaves the well-folded E-cadherin substrate. Our study provides a fundamental basis for the development of anti- H. pylori agents by using a previously uncharacterized HtrA protease as a target. ? 2019 Zhang et al.

"Utilization of a mobile dental vehicle for oral healthcare in rural areas",2019,"Oral diseases remain one of the major global public health challenges, and the worldwide urban–rural disparities in oral health are significant. Residents in rural areas generally suffer from a higher prevalence and severity of dental caries and periodontal disease, yet they face numerous difficulties and barriers in accessing oral healthcare. Conventional strategies, such as building of dental clinics or, hospitals, or the provision of outreach services by using disposable materials, are neither practical nor effective in rural settings. Mobile dental vehicles (MDVs) have been proposed as an alternative strategy to supplement the traditional oral healthcare in many regions. They have usually been utilized in school-based oral health programs, providing dental care to the homeless or migrants, and screening programs for the population for various oral diseases. Due to their high mobility, MDVs are particularly valuable for the underserved populations living in rural areas. The advance of dental devices enables MDVs to be operated in a self-sufficient manner. This allows the MDV to function almost as well as a conventional dental clinic, providing a variety of dental treatments, including scaling, restoration, and oral surgery. This article discusses the use of MDVs as a solution to urban–rural inequality in receiving oral healthcare. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The respiratory tract microbiome and its relationship to lung cancer and environmental exposures found in rural china",2019,"We previously reported that bacterial diversity in sputum samples from never-smoking women in rural China varied by lung cancer status and household air pollution (HAP) exposure type. Here, we expand on our associations between environmental exposures and respiratory tract microbiota with an additional 90 never-smoking women from Xuanwei, China. DNA from sputum samples of cases (n = 45) and controls (n = 45) was extracted using a multistep enzymatic and physical lysis, followed by a standardized clean up. V1–V2 regions of 16S rRNA genes were Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified. Purified amplicons were sequenced by 454 FLX Titanium pyrosequencing and high-quality sequences were evaluated for diversity and taxonomic membership. In our population of never-smokers, increased risk of lung cancer was associated with lower alpha diversity compared to higher alpha diversity (Shannon: ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 3.84 [1.02–14.48], ORlow = 3.78 [1.03–13.82]; observed species: ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 2.37 [0.67–8.48], ORlow = 2.01 [0.58–6.97]; Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) whole tree: ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 3.04 [0.85–10.92], ORlow = 2.53 [0.72–8.96]), as well as a decreased relative abundance of Fusobacteria (ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 1.24 [0.42–3.66], ORlow = 2.01 [0.63–6.44], ptrend = 0.03). Increasing alpha diversity was associated with smoky coal use compared to clean fuel use among all subjects (observed species, P = 0.001; PD whole tree, P = 0.006; Shannon, P = 0.0002), as well as cases (observed species, P = 0.02; PD whole tree, P = 0.03; Shannon, P = 0.03) and controls (observed species, P = 0.01; PD whole tree, P = 0.05; Shannon, P = 0.002). Increased diversity was also associated with presence of livestock (observed species, P = 0.02; PD whole tree, P = 0.02; Shannon, P = 0.03) in the home for cases. Our study is the first to report that decreased microbial diversity is associated with risk of lung cancer. Larger studies are necessary to elucidate the direct and indirect effects attributed to the disease-specific, HAP-specific, and animal-specific associations. Environ. Mol.

"Impact of obesity on longitudinal changes to cardiac structure and function in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus",2019,"Aims: Few prospective studies have evaluated the natural progression of left ventricular (LV) remodelling in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of obesity on longitudinal cardiac structural and functional changes in patients with T2DM. Methods and results: This study comprised of 274 patients with T2DM (mean age, 62.2 ± 11.4 years; male, 51.5%). Echocardiographic parameters including LV geometry, systolic, and diastolic functions were measured at baseline and follow-up. The median follow-up was 24 months (from 12 months to 48 months). The entire cohort showed a significant increase in LV wall thickness, LV mass (LVM), and prevalence of concentric hypertrophy (19.6-27.3%). Further, systolic function and diastolic function had deteriorated at follow-up assessment. Multivariable adjusted linear regression demonstrated that baseline body mass index (BMI) predicted longitudinal change to LVM (β = 0.29, P &lt; 0.01) and LV ejection fraction (β = -0.15, P &lt; 0.05). Patients were divided into three groups according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI &lt;23 kg/m2), overweight (BMI between 23 kg/m2 and 27.5 kg/m2), or obese (BMI ?27.5 kg/m2). Importantly, obesity at baseline predicted a greater longitudinal increase in LVM and decrease in LV ejection fraction compared with overweight and normal weight patients. Conclusion: Being obese at baseline was associated with greater longitudinal increase in LV mass and greater deterioration in LV systolic function. ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Bicomponent nanofibrous scaffolds with dual release of anticancer drugs and biomacromolecules",2019,"Multifunctional scaffolds with dual release of small molecular drugs and biomacromolecules have potential in many applications such as cancer postoperative care, which require appropriate administration of anticancer drugs and biomacromolecules in a spatiotemporal manner. Herein, a systematic investigation into the dual release of anticancer drugs and biomacromolecules from the bicomponent nanofibrous scaffolds is performed. Their release behavior is affected by different fabrication techniques and different polymers used. We show that the bicomponent scaffold fabricated by dual-source dual-power emulsion electrospinning enables dual release of anticancer drugs and biomacromolecules in a controlled manner, holding promise for combinational cancer postoperative care. ? 2019 Materials Research Society.","Diseases; Emulsification; Nanofibers; Targeted drug delivery; Anticancer drug; Biomacromolecules; Dual release; Fabrication technique; Multifunctional scaffold; Nanofibrous scaffolds; Postoperative care; Release behaviors; Controlled drug delivery"
"Antibiotic Resistance Genes in the Human-Impacted Environment: A One Health Perspective",2019,"Antibiotic resistance and its environmental component are gaining more attention as part of combating the growing healthcare crisis. The One Health framework, promulgated by many global health agencies, recognizes that antimicrobial resistance is a truly inter-domain problem in which human health, animal agriculture, and the environment are the core and interrelated components. This prospectus presents the status and issues relevant to the environmental component of antibiotic resistance, namely, the needs for advancing surveillance methodology: the environmental reservoirs and sources of resistance, namely, urban wastewater treatment plants, aquaculture production systems, soil receiving manure and biosolid, and the atmosphere which includes longer range dispersal. Recently, much work has been done describing antibiotic resistance genes in various environments; now quantitative, mechanistic, and hypothesis-driven studies are needed to identify practices that reduce real risks and maintain the effectiveness of our current antibiotics as long as possible. Advanced deployable detection methods for antibiotic resistance in diverse environmental samples are needed in order to provide the surveillance information to identify risks and define barriers that can reduce risks. Also needed are practices that reduce antibiotic use and thereby reduce selection for resistance, as well as practices that limit the dispersal of or destroy antibiotic-resistant bacteria or their resistance genes that are feasible for these varied environmental domains. ? 2019 Soil Science Society of China","activated sludge; agriculture; anthropogenic effect; antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial activity; bacterium; detection method; gene; health impact; human activity; public health; soil pollution; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Animalia"
"High ecological and human health risks from microcystins in vegetable fields in southern China",2019,"Frequent cyanobacterial blooms in the eutrophic waters produce a variety of toxins such as the monocyclic heptapeptide microcystins, greatly harming aquatic ecosystems and human health. However, little information of microcystins in agricultural fields is known. This field study of three common microcystin variants (MC-LR, MC-RR, and MC-YR) in vegetables (n = 161), soils (n = 161) and irrigation water samples (n = 23) collected from southern China regions affected by cyanobacteria blooms, shows their prevalence with total concentrations up to 514 μg/L water, 187 μg/kg soil (dry weight) and 382 μg/kg vegetable (fresh weight). MC-RR was the primary variant in all types of samples, accounting for 51.3–100% of total microcystin concentrations. Significant concentration-dependent correlations (p < 0.05) demonstrated that microcystin-contained irrigation waters were the major source of microcystin accumulation in both vegetables and soils. Meanwhile, intracellular-microcystins in irrigation water was found to play an important role in microcystins bioaccumulation in vegetables for the first time. Most vegetable samples (?60%), particularly celery posed moderate or high human health risk via diet based on toxicity equivalents of the microcystins and reference dose for MC-LR (0.04 μg/kg/d), showing high food safety hidden dangers. Soil microcystins, especially MC-RR in 46.4–88.3% of soils could pose high ecological risks. This study highlights the potential high ecological and human health risks of microcystins in the real soil-vegetable systems of areas affected by cyanobacteria blooms, implying the profound significance and urgent need of investigation on microcystins in terrestrial ecosystems. ? 2019 The Authors","Aquatic ecosystems; Biochemistry; Crops; Food safety; Health; Health risks; Irrigation; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Soils; Vegetables; Water; Agricultural soils; Concentration-dependent; Cyanobacteria blooms; Cyanobacterial blooms; Irrigation waters; Microcystin accumulation; Microcystins; Terrestrial ecosystems; Soil pollution; microcystin; microcystin LR; microcystin RR; microcystin YR; unclassified drug; microcystin; water; agricultural soil; algal bloom; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; food safety; health risk; irrigation; risk assessment; toxin; adult; Article; bioaccumulation; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cyanobacterium; food safety; health hazard; human; irrigation (agriculture); limit of detection; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; soil; vegetable; water sampling; chemistry; metabolism; soil pollutant; toxicity; China; Apium graveolens var. dulce; Cyanobacteria; China; Cyanobacteria; Humans; Microcystins; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Vegetables; Water"
"Expression and activity of TRPA1 and TRPV1 in the intervertebral disc: Association with inflammation and matrix remodeling",2019,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have emerged as potential sensors and transducers of inflammatory pain. The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the expression of TRP channels in intervertebral disc (IVD) cells in normal and inflammatory conditions and (2) the function of Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in IVD inflammation and matrix homeostasis. RT-qPCR was used to analyze human fetal, healthy, and degenerated IVD tissues for the gene expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1. The primary IVD cell cultures were stimulated with either interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) alone or in combination with TRPA1/V1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, 3 and 10 ?M), followed by analysis of calcium flux and the expression of inflammation mediators (RT-qPCR/ELISA) and matrix constituents (RT-qPCR). The matrix structure and composition in caudal motion segments from TRPA1 and TRPV1 wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice was visualized by FAST staining. Gene expression of other TRP channels (A1, C1, C3, C6, V1, V2, V4, V6, M2, M7, M8) was also tested in cytokine-treated cells. TRPA1 was expressed in fetal IVD cells, 20% of degenerated IVDs, but not in healthy mature IVDs. TRPA1 expression was not detectable in untreated cells and it increased upon cytokine treatment, while TRPV1 was expressed and concomitantly reduced. In inflamed IVD cells, 10 ?M AITC activated calcium flux, induced gene expression of IL-8, and reduced disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) and collagen 1A1, possibly via upregulated TRPA1. TRPA1 KO in mice was associated with signs of degeneration in the nucleus pulposus and the vertebral growth plate, whereas TRPV1 KO did not show profound changes. Cytokine treatment also affected the gene expression of TRPV2 (increase), TRPV4 (increase), and TRPC6 (decrease). TRPA1 might be expressed in developing IVD, downregulated during its maturation, and upregulated again in degenerative disc disease, participating in matrix homeostasis. However, follow-up studies with larger sample sizes are needed to fully elucidate the role of TRPA1 and other TRP channels in degenerative disc disease. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Bacteria-responsive nanoliposomes as smart sonotheranostics for multidrug resistant bacterial infections",2019,"Rapid emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) ""superbugs"" poses a severe threat to global health. Notably, undeveloped diagnosis and concomitant treatment failure remain highly challenging. Herein, we report a sonotheranostic strategy to achieve bacteria-specific labeling and visualized sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Using maltohexaose-decorated cholesterol and bacteria-responsive lipid compositions, a smart nanoliposomes platform (MLP18) was developed for precise delivery of purpurin 18, a potent sonosensitizer proved in this study. Taking advantage of the bacteria-specific maltodextrin transport pathway, the prepared MLP18 can specifically target the bacterial infection site and accurately distinguish the foci from sterile inflammation or cancer with a highly selective fluorescence/photoacoustic signal on the bacteria-infected site of mice. Moreover, the bacteria-responsive feature of MLP18 activated an efficient release and internalization of high concentration sonosensitizer into bacterial cells, resulting in effective sonodynamic elimination of MDR bacteria. In situ MRI monitoring visualized such potent sonodynamic activity and indicated that MLP18-mediated SDT could successfully eradicate inflammation and abscess from mice with bacterial myositis. In view of the above advantages, the developed nanoliposomes may serve as a promising sonotheranostic platform against MDR bacteria in the areas of healthcare. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Health risks; Mammals; Pathology; Bacterial infections; Multidrug resistants; Optical imaging; Sonodynamic therapy; theranostic; Bacteria"
"Luminescent ruffled iridium(iii) porphyrin complexes containing N-heterocyclic carbene ligands: structures, spectroscopies and potent antitumor activities under dark and light irradiation conditions",2019,"A panel of iridium(iii) porphyrin complexes containing axial N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand(s) were synthesized and characterized. X-ray crystal structures of the bis-NHC complexes [IrIII(ttp)(IMe)2]+ (2a), [IrIII(oep)(BIMe)2]+ (2d), [IrIII(oep)(IiPr)2]+ (2e) and [IrIII(F20tpp)(IMe)2]+ (2f) display ruffled porphyrin rings with mesocarbon displacements of 0.483-0.594 ? and long Ir-CNHC bonds of 2.100-2.152 ?. Variable-temperature 1H NMR analysis of 2a reveals that the macrocycle porphyrin ring inversion takes place in solution with an activation barrier of 40 ± 1 kJ mol?1. The UV-vis absorption spectra of IrIII(por)-NHC complexes display split Soret bands. TD-DFT calculations and resonance Raman experiments show that the higher-energy Soret band is derived from the 1MLCT dπ(Ir) → π*(por) transition. The near-infrared phosphorescence of IrIII(por)-NHC complexes from the porphyrin-based 3(π, π*) state features broad emission bands at 701-754 nm with low emission quantum yields and short lifetimes (Φem &lt; 0.01; τ &lt; 4 μs). [IrIII(por)(IMe)2]+ complexes (por = ttp and oep) are efficient photosensitizers for 1O2 generation (Φso = 0.64 and 0.88) and are catalytically active in the light-induced aerobic oxidation of secondary amines and arylboronic acid. The bis-NHC complexes exhibit potent dark cytotoxicity towards a panel of cancer cells with IC50 values at submicromolar levels. The cytotoxicity of these complexes could be further enhanced upon light irradiation with IC50 values as low as nanomolar levels in association with the light-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Bioimaging of [IrIII(oep)(IMe)2]+ (2c) treated cells indicates that this Ir complex mainly targets the endoplasmic reticulum. [IrIII(oep)(IMe)2]+ catalyzes the photoinduced generation of singlet oxygen and triggers protein oxidation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and the inhibition of angiogenesis. It also causes pronounced photoinduced inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model of human cancer. ?

"Advances in Epidemiological Methods and Utilisation of Large Databases: A Methodological Review of Observational Studies on Central Nervous System Drug Use in Pregnancy and Central Nervous System Outcomes in Children",2019,"Introduction: Studies have used various epidemiological approaches to study associations between central nervous system (CNS) drug use in pregnancy and CNS outcomes in children. Studies have generally focused on clinical adverse effects, whereas variations in methodologies have not received sufficient attention. Objective: Our objective was to review the methodological characteristics of existing studies to identify any limitations and recommend further research. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on observational studies listed in PubMed from 1 January 1946 to 21 September 2017. Following independent screening and data extraction, we conducted a review addressing the trends of relevant studies, differences between various data sources, and methods used to address bias and confounders; we also conducted statistical analyses. Results: In total, 111 observational studies, 25 case–control studies, and 86 cohort studies were included in the review. Publications dating from 1978 to 2006 mainly focused on antiepileptic drugs, but research on antidepressants increased from 2007 onwards. Only one study focused on antipsychotic use during pregnancy. A total of 46 studies obtained data from an administrative database/registry, 20 from ad hoc disease registries, and 41 from ad hoc clinical samples. Most studies (58%) adjusted the confounding factors using general adjustment, whereas only a few studies used advanced methods such as sibling-matched models and propensity score methods; 42 articles used univariate analyses and 69 conducted multivariable regression analyses. Conclusion: Multiple factors, including different study designs and data sources, have led to inconsistent findings in associations between CNS drug use in pregnancy and CNS outcomes in children. Researchers should allow for study designs with clearly defined exposure periods, at the very least in trimesters, and use advanced confounding adjustment methodology to increase the accuracy of the findings. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; neuroleptic agent; central nervous system agents; central nervous system; confounding variable; data base; data extraction; disease registry; drug use; epidemiological data; human; methodology; multivariate logistic regression analysis; pregnancy; priority journal; propensity score; Review; statistical analysis; systematic review; trend study; univariate analysis; case control study; central nervous system; child; cohort analysis; drug effect; epidemiology; factual database; female; methodology; observational study; pregnancy; Case-Control Studies; Central Nervous System; Central Nervous System Agents; Child; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Pregnancy; Research Design"
"Prevalence of burnout in medical and surgical residents: A meta-analysis",2019,"The burnout syndrome is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal achievement. Uncertainty exists about the prevalence of burnout among medical and surgical residents. Associations between burnout and gender, age, specialty, and geographical location of training are unclear. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to quantitatively summarize the global prevalence rates of burnout among residents, by specialty and its contributing factors. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies that examined the prevalence of burnout among residents from various specialties and countries. The primary outcome assessed was the aggregate prevalence of burnout among all residents. The random effects model was used to calculate the aggregate prevalence, and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistic and Cochran’s Q statistic. We also performed meta-regression and subgroup analysis. The aggregate prevalence of burnout was 51.0% (95% CI: 45.0–57.0%, I2 = 97%) in 22,778 residents.

Subgroup analysis by specialty showed that radiology (77.16%, 95% CI: 5.99–99.45), neurology (71.93%, 95% CI: 65.78–77.39), and general surgery (58.39%, 95% CI: 45.72–70.04) were the top three specialties with the highest prevalence of burnout. In contrast, psychiatry (42.05%, 95% CI: 33.09–51.58), oncology (38.36%, 95% CI: 32.69–44.37), and family medicine (35.97%, 95% CI: 13.89–66.18) had the lowest prevalence of burnout. Subgroup analysis also found that the prevalence of burnout in several Asian countries was 57.18% (95% CI: 45.8–67.85); in several European countries it was 27.72% (95% CI: 17.4–41.11) and in North America it was 51.64% (46.96–56.28). Our findings suggest a high prevalence of burnout among medical and surgical residents. Older and male residents suffered more than their respective counterparts. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 promotes stemness and poor differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma by directly activating the NOTCH pathway",2019,"The poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are usually characterized by immature hepatic progenitor cell-like properties, such as enhanced self-renewal ability, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, and a loss of mature hepatocyte proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms governing this process still remain unclear. In this study, we found the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF1), a transcriptional factor, was frequently overexpressed in HCCs, which was significantly associated with poor prognosis and tumor cell differentiation. Functional studies have found that LEF1 enhanced cell growth, foci formation, colony formation in soft agar, and tumor formation in nude mice. Different from its canonical roles in the WNT signaling pathway, we found that LEF1 could activate the critical members (e.g., NOTCH1 and NOTCH2) of the NOTCH signaling pathway through directly binding to their promoter regions. Further studies have found that LEF1 could enhance the self-renewal ability, drug resistance, dedifferentiation, and invasion of HCC cells. The oncogenic functions and the effects of LEF1 on cancer stemness could be effectively inhibited by NOTCH inhibitor. Further characterization of LEF1 may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","lymphoid enhancer factor 1; Notch1 receptor; Notch2 receptor; LEF1 protein, human; lymphoid enhancer factor 1; Notch receptor; transcription factor; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; cancer stemness; cell dedifferentiation; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell invasion; cell self-renewal; colony formation; controlled study; female; gene overexpression; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; LEF1 gene; liver cell carcinoma; male; middle aged; nonhuman; Notch signaling; priority journal; promoter region; protein analysis; receptor binding; tumor cell; Wnt signaling; animal; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; Hep-G2 cell line; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; prognosis; tumor cell line; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1; Mice; Mice, Nude; Prognosis; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Receptors, Notch; Transcription Factors; Wnt Signaling Pathway"
"Breast Cancer Perceptions and Screening Behaviours Among Korean Women in Australia",2020,"Little is known about breast cancer screening behaviours among immigrant-Korean women in Australia. This study reported breast cancer screening status and whether demographic factors and cultural beliefs associated with their screening behaviours. A convenience sample of 258 Korean-Australian women completed the Korean version of the Breast Cancer Screening Beliefs Questionnaire. Only 16.9% paid special attention to their breasts monthly whereas 31.4% and 54.5% attended annual clinical breast examination and biannual mammograms respectively. Employment status and the length of stay in Australia are significant factors that affect women’s breast cancer screening behaviour. Women who engaged in regular breast awareness and clinical breast examination had significantly higher scores on Knowledge of breast cancer subscale, whereas, those who attended mammography has significantly higher scores on Attitudes toward health check-ups. The research highlights that certain cultural and attitudinal issues are detrimental factors for breast cancer screening behaviour among Korean-Australian women. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Egg consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study and meta-analyses",2019,"Purpose: Eggs are highly nutritious but concerns over their cholesterol content have led to dietary avoidance among many. There are also important international differences in relevant dietary guidance. We conducted the first prospective study in China investigating the association of egg consumption, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and a meta-analysis. Methods: We included 28,024 participants without CVD at baseline (2003-8) in Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. All-cause and CVD mortality were identified through record linkage. We used Cox proportional hazards regression. We followed the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines. Results: During 275,343 person-years follow-up (average 9.8?years), we found 2685 all-cause and 873 CVD deaths. We found no significant difference in all-cause mortality between higher (7+ eggs/week) and low consumption (< 1 egg/week) [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.24], and mortality from CVD (0.99, 95% CI 0.76–1.27), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (0.92, 95% CI 0.63–1.36), or stroke (0.88, 95% CI 0.57–1.35). The updated meta-analyses including our results showed that 7+ eggs/week was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.997–1.200) or IHD (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90–1.05), but associated with a small reduction in stroke (HR 0.91. 95% CI 0.85–0.98). Conclusions: Eating one egg daily is not associated with increase in CVD or all-cause mortality. The small observed reduction in stroke risk needs to be confirmed. Our findings support current guidelines recommending eggs as part of a healthy diet, and should be considered in other dietary recommendations. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; monounsaturated fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; triacylglycerol; adult; age; aged; all cause mortality; Article; biobank; body mass; brain ischemia; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; cholesterol intake; chronic disease; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; drinking behavior; dyslipidemia; educational status; egg; family income; fat intake; follow up; food intake; fruit; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; meta analysis; middle aged; milk; nut; observational study; occupation; patient-reported outcome; physical activity; prospective study; protein intake; sensitivity analysis; sex; smoking; vegetable; waist circumference; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; China; death; diet; egg; female; male; mortality; procedures; proportional hazards model; questionnaire; risk factor; Cardiovascular Diseases; China; Cohort Studies; Death; Diet; Eggs; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stroke; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Improving support to siblings of children with cancer through a community-academic partnership",2019,"Objective: Siblings of children with cancer are a psychosocially at-risk group and have unmet needs that are typically not addressed within traditional hospital settings. The current study implemented a community-academic partnership model with SuperSibs-a nationwide, community-based, no-cost program for siblings of children with cancer, powered by Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation-to evaluate and improve their sibling resources. Method: Researchers and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation staff partnered to plan and conduct research with siblings regarding desired support resources, with attention to the acceptability and feasibility of implementation. Siblings (N = 23) provided qualitative data regarding suggestions for new resources and feedback on existing and proposed SuperSibs programs. Qualitative data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. Results: Siblings emphasize the importance of support that is meaningful, age-appropriate, consistently delivered and that offers autonomy. Siblings recommended revised SuperSibs program initiatives, such as yoga instruction, education for parents and teachers, and game-based interventions. Collaboration throughout the course of the research between researchers and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation staff yielded improvements to SuperSibs programming. Conclusion: Community-academic partnerships are useful in conducting impactful research that is directly translatable into community-based support. Recommendations continue to inform resource development and evaluation goals. ? 2019 American Psychological Association.",""
"The association of air pollution with body mass index: evidence from Hong Kong’s “Children of 1997” birth cohort",2019,"Background: Child overweight and obesity have increased substantially in many countries. Physical and psychological effects of childhood obesity endure throughout adulthood. Much attention has been paid to energy intake and expenditure in childhood adiposity, but less to environmental factors, such as outdoor air quality. Here we assessed prospectively the association of exposure to air pollution with body mass index (BMI) in late childhood and early adolescence. Methods: We assessed the association of air pollutants (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 ?m or less (PM 10 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 )) at different growth phases (in utero, in infancy, and in childhood) with BMI at ~9, ~11, ~13, and ~15 years in a population-representative birth cohort from Hong Kong, “Children of 1997.” We used partial least square regression to account for colinearity between pollutants and exposure periods. We also assessed whether associations varied by sex from model fit. Results: Associations were sex-specific based on better model fit when including sex interaction terms. Among boys, higher SO 2 in utero was associated with lower BMI at ~13 and ~15 years, higher SO 2 in childhood with lower BMI at ~15 years, and higher NO 2 in childhood with higher BMI at ~9, ~13, and ~15 years using a multi-pollutant model. Conclusions: These findings of air pollutant- and sex-specific associations with adiposity should give impetus to the investigation of their physiological effects, possibly operating as endocrine disruptors or via mitochondria, so as to protect the next generation of boys. ? 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.","nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; adolescent; adolescent obesity; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; body mass; caloric intake; child; childhood obesity; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; female; Hong Kong; household income; human; major clinical study; male; partial least squares regression; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; prospective study; school child; sex difference; adult; adverse event; air pollution; environmental exposure; epidemiology; maternal exposure; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Body Mass Index; Child; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Maternal Exposure; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Sulfur Dioxide"

"Explosible nanocapsules excited by pulsed microwaves for efficient thermoacoustic-chemo combination therapy",2019,"Microwave irradiation is a powerful non-invasive approach for treating deep-seated diseases in a clinical setting. Pulsed microwave-induced thermoacoustic cavitation allows precise cancer treatment with microwave-absorbing materials. This differs from the traditional continuous microwave-induced thermotherapy which may be harmful to off-target tissues. Here we first report the integration of thermocavitation and cytoplasmic drug release into highly explosible cell-penetrating nanocapsules for effective tumor inhibition under pulsed microwave irradiation. The nanocapsules were formulated from arginine-tethered reduction-responsive copolymers, P(ArgMA-co-DMA)-b-PPOPMA, microwave-absorbing AB and chemotherapeutic DOX using a double-emulsion method. The nanocapsules were internalized by cancer cells rapidly via major energy-independent pathways. Upon pulsed microwave irradiation, AB absorbed energy to generate a giant thermoacoustic shockwave, simultaneously decomposing into carbon dioxide and ammonia which enforced the cavitation damage effect. The thermoacoustic shockwave and gas burst also mechanically disrupted the intracellular organelles resulting in high-ratio cell necrosis and promoted the cytosolic release of DOX into the nucleus to initiate cell death. Importantly, in vivo results demonstrated significantly suppressed tumor growth by the pulsed microwave-triggered thermocavitation and drug release, and minimal systemic toxicity from the microwave treatment. Therefore, our study provides a new strategy for effectively engineering pulsed microwave-responsive nanomaterials for smart cancer therapy. ?

"Promises and pitfalls of integrating home-based health services into Shanghai's elder-care system",2020,"Faced with the dramatic pace of population ageing, the Shanghai municipal government launched a pilot programme in 2013 designed to address this and to strengthen ageing-in-place arrangements by providing basic in-home medical services for residents above the age of 80. Yet after a two-year trial run, the 'Home-Based Medical Care Scheme for the Oldest-Old' (HBMCSOO) policy remained significantly under-utilised despite the increasing demand for medical services. Our multi-disciplinary research team of social workers and anthropologists identified two key factors impeding the implementation of home-based medical care services: (a) the distortion of policy implementation and (b) the inadequate professionalisation of community-based elder-care workers. Based on our evaluation of the pilot programme, the Shanghai municipal government made several practical adjustments to improve the subsequent city-wide policy implemented in 2016. While these changes mostly focused on minor adjustments to improve in-home medical services for the oldest-old, they represent an encouraging first step towards our call for a holistic integrated care system whose design and delivery takes into account local political and social contexts, including existing institutional infrastructure and cultural expectations about care-giving responsibilities. The challenges of implementing Shanghai's HBMCSOO policy ultimately provide instructive lessons on best practices for integrating medical and social services in order to improve ageing-in-place measures in diverse local settings around the world. ?

"The comparison of short-term prognostic value of T1 mapping with feature tracking by cardiovascular magnetic resonance in patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy",2019,"To evaluate and compare the prognostic value of T1 mapping with feature tracking cardiovascular magnetic resonance (FT-CMR) imaging in patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) during short-term follow-up. A total of 46 patients with severe DCM (LVEF < 35%) underwent 3.0-T CMR with T1 mapping and FT-CMR analysis. The study end-point was defined as a combination of cardiac death, heart transplantation, and hospitalization due to cardiovascular events. The significance of the risk factors was mainly evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox model analyses. During the median follow-up of 13?months (interquartile range 7–17?months), two patients died of heart failure, one received a heart transplantation, and six were hospitalized for heart failure. In the univariate analysis, extracellular volume fraction (ECV) showed significant predictive association with cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–1.62; P = 0.001). No strain parameters in FT-CMR differed significantly between patients with or without events (all P > 0.05). In the multivariate analyses, ECV was the sole independent predictor of cardiovascular events (HR, 1.48; 95% CI 1.13–1.94; P = 0.005). The area under the curve of the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic in leave-one-out cross-validation (all > 0.70) further confirmed the predictive significance of ECV. In patients with severe DCM, ECV was not only a strong independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events but also provided prognostic value prior to strain parameters of the FT-CMR in the short term. ? 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","adult; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; clinical indicator; cohort analysis; congestive cardiomyopathy; controlled study; disease severity; female; follow up; heart death; heart failure; heart transplantation; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; prognostic assessment; risk factor; cause of death; cine magnetic resonance imaging; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; congestive cardiomyopathy; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; evaluation study; hospital admission; mortality; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; prognosis; severity of illness index; time factor; Adult; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Cause of Death; Disease Progression; Female; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Admission; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors"
"Trends and patterns of disparities in burden of lung cancer in the United States, 1974-2015",2019,"Background: Although lung cancer incidence and mortality have been declining since the 1990s, the extent to which such progress has been made is unequal across population segments. Updated epidemiologic data on trends and patterns of disparities are lacking. Methods: Data on lung cancer cases and deaths during 1974 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Age-standardized lung cancer incidence and mortality and their annual percent changes were calculated by histologic types, demographic variables, and tumor characteristics. Results: Lung cancer incidence decreased since 1990 (1990 to 2007: Annual percent change, -0.9 [95% CI, -1.0%, -0.8%]; 2007 to 2015: -2.6 [-2.9%, -2.2%]). Among adults aged between 20 and 39 years, a higher incidence was observed among females during 1995 to 2011, after which a faster decline in female lung cancer incidence (males: -2.5% [-2.8%, -2.2%]; females: -3.1% [-4.7%, -1.5%]) resulted in a lower incidence among females. The white population had a higher incidence than the Black population for small cell carcinoma since 1987. Black females were the only group whose adenocarcinoma incidence plateaued since 2012 (-5.0% [-13.0%, 3.7%]). A higher incidence for squamous cell carcinoma was observed among Black males and females than among white males and females during 1974 to 2015. After circa 2005, octogenarians and older patients constituted the group with the highest lung cancer incidence. Incidence for localized and AJCC/TNM stage I lung cancer among octogenarians and older patients plateaued since 2009, while mortality continued to rise (localized: 1.4% [0.6%, 2.1%]; stage I: 6.7% [4.5%, 9.0%]). Conclusions: Lung cancer disparities prevail across population segments.

"Serum metabolomics model and its metabolic characteristics in patients with different syndromes of dyslipidemia based on nuclear magnetic resonance",2019,"Dyslipidemia is known as a common clinical disease that affects the health of millions of people around the world. The treatment of dyslipidemia with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is generally based on the accurate identification of disease syndromes. TCM syndromes are judged by traditional four-diagnosis method, which is subjective and fuzzy. Additionally, the judgment of TCM syndromes highly depend on doctors’ own clinical experience. In this present study, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based serum metabolomics patterns to figure out the metabolic characteristics of different syndromes in patients with dyslipidemia. In total, we enrolled 60 patients with dyslipidemia (30 cases with Spleen and Kidney Yang Deficiency syndrome (SKYD) and 30 cases with Phlegm-Dampness Retention syndrome (PDR)) and 20 healthy controls. Based on NMR technique, the serum metabolomics patterns of patients with different syndromes and healthy controls were analyzed, in the hope of screening the different metabolites among different syndromes and the differential metabolic pathway, as well as exploring the changes of metabolic network among different syndromes of dyslipidemia. The results suggested that the serum metabolomics patterns based on NMR was used to identify serum metabolites in patients with dyslipidemia of SKYD and PDR as well as healthy controls. Besides, it was found that the metabolic patterns of these three groups can be distinguished well and the different metabolites between different syndromes can be screened. From the point of view of metabolites, the metabolic characteristics of the patients with PDR were mainly the accumulation of noxious metabolites, while the metabolic characteristics of the patients with SKYD were mainly the lack of metabolites with protective function. From the point of view of metabolic mode, there were different metabolic patterns in patients with different syndromes of dyslipidemia in liver metabolism, oxidation, inflammatory reaction as well as energy metabolism, which reflects the difference of syndromes from different angles. The differences in metabolic outcomes among patients with different syndromes of dyslipidemia had a close association with to the effects of multiple signaling pathways. This study identified the characteristics of serum metabolic model of patients with different syndromes of dyslipidemia and the potential differential metabolites and characteristic metabolic characteristics of syndromes in order to understand the biological characteristics of patients with dyslipidemia of SKYD and PDR. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","alanine; betaine; creatinine; glucose; glutamic acid; glutamine; glycine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; isoleucine; lactic acid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; polyunsaturated fatty acid; serine; triacylglycerol; valine; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; Article; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; demography; dyslipidemia; energy metabolism; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; inflammation; liver metabolism; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; major clinical study; metabolomics; middle aged; oxidation; pathogenesis; pattern recognition; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; signal transduction; triacylglycerol blood level; blood; case control study; cross-sectional study; dyslipidemia; female; male; metabolism; metabolomics; nuclear magnetic resonance; procedures; syndrome; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dyslipidemias; Female; Humans; Male; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Syndrome; Triglycerides"

"Extended dual antiplatelet therapy for Asian patients with acute coronary syndrome: expert recommendations",2019,"Background: Recently, new evidence from large scale trials and updated guidelines have emerged on the risks and benefits of extended dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Aims: To discuss, clarify and advise on the application of the evidences and guidelines on individual patient selection for extended DAPT, with regard to balancing risk factors, particularly in Asian populations. Methods: A total of 14 local cardiologists from Hong Kong with extensive experience in cardiology and cardiac interventions convened in a series of 3 advisory board meetings from October 2016 to September 2017, which included reviews of new evidence in the literature and discussions of the latest clinical trends, using an anonymous, electronic voting system for arriving at consensuses. Results: Recommendations were produced for the following nine risk factors: old age (>65), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), multi-vessel disease (MVD), multiple stents, bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) stent, left main stenting and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Strong ischaemic risk factors include DM, recurrent MI, MVD and/or >3 stents; less-strong ischaemic factors include CKD, left main stenting, BVS stent and PAD. Old age can be an unclear risk factor due to variations in physical fitness even among patients of identical age. Discussion: The strengths and limitations of the results were acknowledged. Conclusion: ACS patients with ischaemic risk factors could be considered for extended DAPT beyond 12 months, while balancing the risk of bleeding. ? 2019 Royal Australasian College of Physicians","antithrombocytic agent; antithrombocytic agent; purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist; acute coronary syndrome; age; Asian; chronic kidney failure; diabetes mellitus; dual antiplatelet therapy; evidence based medicine; heart infarction; human; patient selection; peripheral occlusive artery disease; practice guideline; priority journal; recurrent disease; Review; risk factor; acute coronary syndrome; adverse device effect; advisory committee; bleeding; combination drug therapy; drug administration; drug eluting stent; heart infarction; Hong Kong; practice guideline; thrombosis; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Advisory Committees; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug-Eluting Stents; Hemorrhage; Hong Kong; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists; Risk Factors; Thrombosis"
"De-novo metastatic breast cancers with or without primary tumor resection – A 10-year study",2019,"Background: Treatment of de novo metastatic breast cancer is usually palliative with systemic treatment; surgical excision of the primary tumour is reserved in patients with significant symptoms from the primary tumour. Survival benefit of surgical removal of the primary tumour remains controversial. Methods: All patients treated with de novo metastatic breast cancer (MBC) between 2007 and 2016 were retrieved from a prospectively-maintained database. Demographic and tumour characteristics were compared. Overall survival (OS) was analysed using Kaplan–Meier Method and log rank tests. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the prognosticators of OS in de novo MBC. Results: Median age of diagnosis was 53 years old (Range 24–91 years old). 91 patients received resection of the primary tumour, including 86 mastectomies and 5 breast conserving surgeries (surgical group). 81 patients were never treated surgically (non-surgical group). Baseline demographic data were comparable apart from being younger age in the surgical group. 5-year OS in surgical group was significantly better than non-surgical group (43.9% vs. 33.9%, p = 0.026). Multivariate analysis found that advanced age (Hazard ratio: 1.034, p = 0.005, 95% CI 1.010–1.058) and presence of visceral metastasis (Hazard ratio: 1.672, p = 0.038, 95% CI 1.028–2.719) were significant adverse prognosticators through multivariate analysis; while positive oestrogen receptor (ER) status was the only positive prognosticator in the analysis (Hazard ratio: 0.42, p = 0.001, 95% CI 0.256–0.688).

"Identification of COMMD1 as a novel lamin A binding partner",2019,"Lamin A, which is encoded by the LMNA gene, regulates gene expression and genome stability through interactions with a variety of proteins. Mutations in LMNAlead to a diverse set of inherited human diseases, collectively referred to as laminopathies. To gain insight into the protein interactions of lamin A, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the carboxy-terminus of lamin A. The screen identified copper metabolism MURR1 domain-containing 1 (COMMD1) as a novel lamin A binding partner. Colocalization experiments using fluorescent confocal microscopy revealed that COMMD1 colocalized with lamin A in 293 cells. Furthermore, the COMMD1-lamin A protein interaction was also demon? strated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Collectively, the present study demonstrated a physical interaction between COMMD1 and lamin A, which may aid to elucidate the mechanisms of lamin A in the aging process. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Results: Only 19.0% of the deceased left suicide notes and they were characterized by having no diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, being in debt, having a high education level, having made no previous suicide attempts, and having used suicide methods that required preparation. Wanting to hide their suicide information was not uncommon for these individuals (9.7%). Adolescents were likely to mention a negative interpersonal relationship with someone (27.4%). Illnesses/pain was frequently mentioned by adults (33.4%) and older people (61.5%). Limitations: Many features of suicide notes, e.g., interpersonal features of suicides, were not examined. Conclusion: Education level might be a key factor influencing the likelihood of leaving suicide notes. Most people who left suicide notes showed a negative attitude toward suicidal behavior. The myth of an afterlife should also be addressed. ? 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",""
"Brain connectomic associations with traditional Chinese medicine diagnostic classification of major depressive disorder: A diffusion tensor imaging study",2019,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly heterogeneous in pathogenesis and manifestations. Further classification may help characterize its heterogeneity. We previously have shown differential metabolomic profiles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostic subtypes of MDD. We further determined brain connectomic associations with TCM subtypes of MDD. Methods: In this naturalistic study, 44 medication-free patients with a recurrent depressive episode were classified into liver qi stagnation (LQS, n = 26) and Heart and Spleen Deficiency (HSD, n = 18) subtypes according to TCM diagnosis. Healthy subjects (n = 28) were included as controls. Whole-brain white matter connectivity was analyzed on diffusion tensor imaging. Results: The LQS subtype showed significant differences in multiple network metrics of the angular gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, calcarine sulcus, and Heschl's gyrus compared to the other two groups. The HSD subtype had markedly greater regional connectivity of the insula, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus than the other two groups, and microstructural abnormalities of the frontal medial orbital gyrus and middle temporal pole. The insular betweenness centrality was strongly inversely correlated with the severity of depression and dichotomized the two subtypes at the optimal cutoff value with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: The LQS subtype is mainly characterized by aberrant connectivity of the audiovisual perception-related temporal-occipital network, whereas the HSD subtype is more closely associated with hyperconnectivity and microstructural abnormalities of the limbic-paralimbic network. Insular connectivity may serve a biomarker for TCM-based classification of depression.

"Effectiveness of antimicrobial hospital curtains on reducing bacterial contamination - A multicenter study",2019,"Objective To determine the efficacy of 2 types of antimicrobial privacy curtains in clinical settings and the costs involved in replacing standard curtains with antimicrobial curtains.Design A prospective, open-labeled, multicenter study with a follow-up duration of 6 months.Setting This study included 12 rooms of patients with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (668 patient bed days) and 10 cubicles (8,839 patient bed days) in the medical, surgical, neurosurgical, orthopedics, and rehabilitation units of 10 hospitals.Method Culture samples were collected from curtain surfaces twice a week for 2 weeks, followed by weekly intervals.Results With a median hanging time of 173 days, antimicrobial curtain B (quaternary ammonium chlorides [QAC] plus polyorganosiloxane) was highly effective in reducing the bioburden (colony-forming units/100 cm 2 , 1 vs 57; P &lt;.001) compared with the standard curtain. The percentages of MDRO contamination were also significantly lower on antimicrobial curtain B than the standard curtain: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5% vs 24% (P &lt;.001); carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp, 0.2% vs 22.1% (P &lt;.001); multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp, 0% vs 13.2% (P &lt;.001). Notably, the median time to first contamination by MDROs was 27.6 times longer for antimicrobial curtain B than for the standard curtain (138 days vs 5 days; P =.001).Conclusions Antimicrobial curtain B (QAC plus polyorganosiloxane) but not antimicrobial curtain A (built-in silver) effectively reduced the microbial burden and MDRO contamination compared with the standard curtain, even after extended use in an active clinical setting. The antimicrobial curtain provided an opportunity to avert indirect costs related to curtain changing and laundering in addition to improving patient safety. ? 2018 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

"Tuberculosis infection and lung adenocarcinoma: Mendelian randomization and pathway analysis of genome-wide association study data from never-smoking Asian women",2020,"We investigated whether genetic susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) influences lung adenocarcinoma development among never-smokers using TB genome-wide association study (GWAS) results within the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia. Pathway analysis with the adaptive rank truncated product method was used to assess the association between a TB-related gene-set and lung adenocarcinoma using GWAS data from 5512 lung adenocarcinoma cases and 6277 controls. The gene-set consisted of 31 genes containing known/suggestive associations with genetic variants from previous TB-GWAS. Subsequently, we followed-up with Mendelian Randomization to evaluate the association between TB and lung adenocarcinoma using three genome-wide significant variants from previous TB-GWAS in East Asians. The TB-related gene-set was associated with lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.016). Additionally, the Mendelian Randomization showed an association between TB and lung adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.66, p = 0.027). Our findings support TB as a causal risk factor for lung cancer development among never-smoking Asian women. ? 2019","HLA DQA1 antigen; adult; Article; controlled study; DLG2 gene; East Asian; female; FHAD1 gene; gene; genetic association; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; HLA DQA1 gene; human; LRRC69 gene; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; MEIS2 gene; Mendelian randomization analysis; never smoker; observational study; pathway analysis; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical analysis; tuberculosis; ZFPM2 gene"
"Estimating the Severity Profile of Enterovirus A71 Infections in Children: A Bayesian Synthesis Framework",2019,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is responsible for the majority of severe cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease, but little evidence is available on the severity profile of EV-A71 infections. We formulated a hierarchical Bayesian model that synthesized data on diseases/events associated with EV-A71 and EV-A71 antibody responses to infection among unvaccinated children from large clinical trials of EV-A71 vaccination, which were conducted in Jiangsu and Beijing during 2012 and 2013, to reconstruct the severity profile in a unified framework. On average, 15.1% of the children aged 6-35 months were infected by EV-A71 during 1-year follow-up in a mild epidemic season. We estimated that 9.7%, 2.2%, and 0.6% of children infected with EV-A71 were diagnosed with EV-A71-associated diseases, were hospitalized, and showed severe complications, respectively. We estimated on average 1 death per 10,000 EV-A71 infections for children aged 6-35 months. Approximately 70% of children had ?4-fold rises in antibody titers after infection. Most EV-A71 infections in young children are mild, and overall 2.2% of the infected patients were hospitalized in the 2 trials. There remain several uncertainties about the immune response after infection and the duration of immunity against EV-A71 reinfection. ?

"A Multifunctional Hydrogel Delivers Gold Compound and Inhibits Human Lung Cancer Xenograft",2019,"Purpose: Interpenetrating network system (IPN), consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) –diacrylate (PEGdA) and modified gelatin, is a biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel and has been studied for the local delivery of bioactive molecules and drugs. Gold(III) porphyrin(AuP) is a stable metal compound in the development for anticancer application when administered systemically. The aim of this work is to develop a novel formulation for AuP based on IPN for local delivery. Methods: IPN loaded with AuP hydrogel was optimized and synthesized. Drug release kinetics, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, and antitumor activity in lung cancer bearing nude mice were studied. Results: AuP released from the IPN followed a first order kinetics in vitro. The AuP loaded IPN showed higher cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cell lines compared to IPN only. In mice bearing human lung cancer xenograft, AuP loaded IPN inhibited tumor growth and reduced angiogenesis. No sign of systemic toxicity was observed for all treatment groups. Conclusion: AuP loaded IPN provides an improved formulation over systemic delivery for tumor inhibition to complement surgical intervention. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","antineoplastic agent; cysteine; gelatin; gold derivative; gold porphyrin; macrogol 400; polyethylene glycol diacrylate; polymer; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; biomaterial; gold derivative; macrogol; poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate; polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate hydrogel; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiangiogenic activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; complex formation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; human; human cell; hydrogel; in vitro study; lung fibroblast; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; priority journal; structure activity relation; sustained drug release; tumor xenograft; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; hydrogel; kinetics; lung tumor; neovascularization (pathology); nude mouse; pharmacology; procedures; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biocompatible Materials; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Gelatin; Gold Compounds; Heterografts; Humans; Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate; Hydrogels; Kinetics; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Polyethylene Glycols; Transplantation, Heterologous"
"Protein supplements and their relation with nutrition, microbiota composition and health: Is more protein always better for sportspeople?",2019,"Sports nutrition products are developed and targeted mainly for athletes to improve their nutrient intake, performance, and muscle growth. The fastest growing consumer groups for these products are recreational sportspeople and lifestyle users. Although athletes may have elevated physiological protein requirements and they may benefit from dietary supplements, the evidence regarding the role of dietary protein and supplements in the nutrition of recreational sportspeople and sedentary populations is somewhat complex and contradictory. In high-protein diets, more undigested protein-derived constituents end up in the large intestine compared to moderate or low-protein diets, and hence, more bacterial amino acid metabolism takes place in the colon, having both positive and negative systemic and metabolic effects on the host. The aim of the present review is to summarize the impact of the high-protein products and diets on nutrition and health, in sportspeople and in sedentary consumers. We are opening the debate about the current protein intake recommendations, with an emphasis on evidence-based effects on intestinal microbiota and personalized guidelines regarding protein and amino acid supplementation in sportspeople and lifestyle consumers. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Correlation of serum Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and liver stiffness in chronic hepatitis B infection",2019,"Background and aim: Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) is a novel serum diagnostic marker for liver fibrosis in various liver diseases. We aimed to evaluate its role in assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) with reference to liver stiffness measurement (LSM). Methods: CHB patients with LSM by transient elastography technology and retrievable serum samples were recruited. Ten-year re-assessments of LSM and M2BPGi were repeated in a patient subgroup. Results: 240 CHB patients (M:F = 116:124; median age 47.5?years) were recruited. The median M2BPGi values for F0/F1/F2, F3 and F4 progressively increased with more advanced stages of liver fibrosis: 0.39, 0.46 and 0.82 COI, respectively (p < 0.01). M2BPGi levels correlated well with liver stiffness (r = 0.611), FIB-4 (r = 0.616), and strongly with APRI (r = 0.825) (all p < 0.001). Using cut-off values of 0.605 and 0.615 COI, the AUROCs were 0.754 and 0.799 for ? F3 and F4, respectively. M2BPGi identified one-quarter patients at risk of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis otherwise classified into ‘grey area’ by LSM. In 86 patients with reassessment LSM, 21 (24.4%) showed significant fibrosis regression with corresponding decline in median M2BPGi level (??0.11 COI) compared with the increase of +0.03 COI in patients without significant fibrosis regression (p = 0.011). Male gender, older age, use of potent antiviral therapy and change in serum M2BPGi were independently associated with significant fibrosis regression. Conclusions: Serum M2BPGi can risk-stratify CHB patients whose liver stiffness fell into the ‘grey area’. Significant fibrosis regression occurring in one-quarter patients was reflected by a reduction in M2BPGi levels at 10-year interval. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.","alanine aminotransferase; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; entecavir; hepatitis B(e) antigen; Mac 2 binding protein glycosylation isomer; tenofovir disoproxil; unclassified drug; biological marker; membrane protein; TAA90K protein, human; tumor antigen; adult; age distribution; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; chronic hepatitis B; correlation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; disease course; female; follow up; human; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein analysis; protein blood level; protein function; seroconversion; sex difference; transient elastography; area under the curve; blood; chronic hepatitis B; complication; diagnostic imaging; elastography; glycosylation; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; middle aged; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; virology; Adult; Antigens, Neoplasm; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Glycosylation; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; ROC Curve"
"Trazodone use and risk of dementia: A population-based cohort study",2019,"Background In vitro and animal studies have suggested that trazodone, a licensed antidepressant, may protect against dementia. However, no studies have been conducted to assess the effect of trazodone on dementia in humans. This electronic health records study assessed the association between trazodone use and the risk of developing dementia in clinical practice. Methods and findings The Health Improvement Network (THIN), an archive of anonymised medical and prescribing records from primary care practices in the United Kingdom, contains records of over 15 million patients. We assessed patients from THIN aged ?50 years who received at least two consecutive prescriptions for an antidepressant between January 2000 and January 2017. We compared the risk of dementia among patients who were prescribed trazodone to that of patients with similar baseline characteristics prescribed other antidepressants, using a Cox regression model with 1:5 propensity score matching. Patients prescribed trazodone who met the inclusion criteria (n = 4,716; 59.2% female) were older (mean age 70.9 ± 13.1 versus 65.6 ± 11.4 years) and were more likely than those prescribed other antidepressants (n = 420,280; 59.7% female) to have cerebrovascular disease and use anxiolytic or antipsy-chotic drugs. After propensity score matching, 4,596 users of trazadone and 22,980 users of other antidepressants were analysed. The median time to dementia diagnosis for people prescribed trazodone was 1.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.5–5.0 years). Incidence of dementia among patients taking trazodone was higher than in matched users of other antidepressants (1.8 versus 1.1 per 100 person-years), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56–2.09; p < 0.001). However, our results do not suggest a causal association. When we restricted the control group to users of mirtazapine only in a sensitivity analysis, the findings were very similar to the results of the main analysis. The main limitation of our study is the possibility of indication bias, because people in the prodromal stage of dementia might be preferentially prescribed trazodone. Due to the observational nature of this study, we cannot rule out residual confounding. Conclusions In this study of UK population-based electronic health records, we found no association between trazodone use and a reduced risk of dementia compared with other antidepressants. These results suggest that the clinical use of trazodone is not associated with a reduced risk of dementia. ? 2019 Brauer et al.","antidepressant agent; anxiolytic agent; cardiovascular agent; mirtazapine; neuroleptic agent; trazodone; antidepressant agent; trazodone; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; attention deficit disorder; body mass; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; dementia; diabetes mellitus; drug exposure; drug use; female; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart infarction; human; hypertension; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; personality disorder; population health; prescription; propensity score; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; sleep disorder; smoking; substance abuse; dementia; electronic health record; health survey; middle aged; procedures; United Kingdom; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Electronic Health Records; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Risk Factors; Trazodone; United Kingdom"
"Better survival after stereotactic body radiation therapy following transarterial chemoembolization in nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A propensity score matched analysis",2019,"Background: This study compared outcomes of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) vs. stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) after TACE (TACE + SBRT). Methods: This was a retrospective study of 2 centers in Hong Kong. There were 49 patients who had TACE + SBRT and 202 patients who had TACE alone. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences in patients’ demographics and tumor characteristics between the 2 groups. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment-related toxicity. Results: After matching, 49 patients were in the TACE + SBRT group and 98 patients in the TACE group with similar baseline characteristics. The 1-&3-year OS were better in TACE + SBRT group (67.2 vs. 43.9% and 36.5 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.003). The 1-&3-year PFS was also better in TACE + SBRT group (32.5 vs. 21.4% and 15.1 vs. 5.1%, p = 0.012). Radiological disease control was better in the TACE + SBRT group (98 vs. 56.7%). Risk of severe toxicity was uncommon in both treatment arms. TACE + SBRT was an independent good prognostic factor for OS and PFS in multivariate analysis, whereas AFP>200 ng/ml, large tumor and multiple tumors predicted worse OS. Conclusion: TACE + SBRT is safe and results in better survivals in nonresectable HCC patients. ? 2019","albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; cisplatin; creatinine; doxorubicin; hemoglobin; adult; aged; albumin blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; cancer survival; chemoembolization; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; creatinine blood level; disease control; fatigue; female; fever; hemoglobin blood level; Hong Kong; human; inoperable cancer; leukocyte count; liver cell carcinoma; liver weight; major clinical study; male; organs at risk; outcome assessment; overall survival; platelet count; priority journal; progression free survival; propensity score; radiation dose fractionation; retrospective study; stereotactic body radiation therapy; treatment response; tumor volume; chemoembolization; clinical trial; follow up; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; prognosis; propensity score; radiosurgery; survival rate; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Propensity Score; Radiosurgery; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Young Adult"
"Comparison of early experience of robotic and transanal total mesorectal excision using propensity score matching",2019,"Background: Robotic surgery and transanal minimally invasive surgery are the two recently developed techniques, which can overcome the difficult pelvic dissection in conventional laparoscopy. This study aimed to compare the early cases of robotic and transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) using propensity score matching. Methods: The first 40 cases of taTME and the first 80 sphincter-saving robotic total mesorectal resection for rectal cancer were selected from the prospectively collected database. Using propensity score matching, the outcomes of 40 matched cases of robotic TME were compared with the 40 cases of taTME. Results: Before matching, patients in the taTME group were significantly younger. The tumors were smaller but more distally located. Significantly more patients in the taTME group received preoperative chemoradiation. After matching, the two groups did not show any differences in gender, age, comorbidity, the level of tumors, and incidences of preoperative chemoradiation. The operating time was significantly shorter (254 vs. 170?min, p < 0.05) and the blood loss was less (50 vs. 150?ml, p = 0.002) in the taTME group. Conversion rate was 5% in both groups. There was no difference in the hospital stay, overall morbidity, the anastomotic leakage rate, and the urinary complication rate between the two groups. More patients in the taTME group did not require a separate abdominal incision. The distal margin, the number of lymph nodes examined, and the rate positive circumferential margin (0 vs. 5%, p = 0.494) were also similar between the two groups. Conclusions: Both taTME and robotic surgery can achieve favorable outcomes in the rectal cancer resection. Comparison of the early experience of the two procedures with propensity score matching showed the taTME was associated with a shorter operating time, less blood loss, and a higher rate of transanal extraction of the specimen. Further evaluation by randomized trials is warranted. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; anastomosis leakage; Article; cancer surgery; chemoradiotherapy; comorbidity; comparative study; female; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; morbidity; operation duration; priority journal; propensity score; rectum carcinoma; reoperation; robot assisted surgery; surgical mortality; total mesorectal excision; urinary tract disease"
"Psychometric validation of team experiences questionnaire in preregistration Chinese health and social care students in Hong Kong",2019,"The complexity of patients’ healthcare needs can be addressed more adequately by professionals working as a healthcare team. In view of this, it is important to prepare students for collaborative work when they become professionals through a students’ team training at the preregistration level. As intervention programs are implemented to promote students’ collaboration, instruments like Team Experiences Questionnaire (TEQ)?are needed. In this connection, this study which involved 335 Chinese students enrolled in eight health and social care programs from two universities in Hong Kong investigated the factor structures of the TEQ using construct validation approach. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we examined the fit of three competing models: unidimensional model, first-order correlated model, and second-order hierarchical model. The results demonstrated that the second-order hierarchical model obtained the best fit, with a higher-order construct called total team experiences subsuming the following first order factors: overall satisfaction with team experiences, team impact on quality of learning, satisfaction with team evaluation, team impact on clinical reasoning ability, and professional development. The “total team experience” construct explained from 21.1% to 35.7% of the variance in predicting students’ future perception of team competency and autonomy, perceived need for cooperation, and perception of actual cooperation. Results support the applicability of the TEQ second-order hierarchical model.

"Effect of segmentation from different diffusive metric maps on diffusion tensor imaging analysis of the cervical spinal cord",2019,"Background: Segmentation is a crucial and necessary step in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of the cervical spinal cord. In existing studies, different diffusive metric maps [B0, fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) maps] have been involved in the segmentation of tissues of the cervical spinal cord. The selection of a diffusive metric map for segmentation may affect the accuracy of segmentation and then affect the validity and effectiveness of the extracted diffusive features. However, there are few discussions on this problem. Therefore, this study would like to examine the effect of segmentation based on different diffusive metric maps for DTI analysis of the cervical spinal cord. Methods: Twenty-nine healthy subjects and thirty patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) were finally included in this study. All subjects accepted DTI scanning at cervical levels from C2 to C7/ T1. For healthy subjects, all cervical levels were included for analysis; while, for each patient, only one compressed cervical level was included. After DTI scanning, DTI metrics including B0, FA, AD, radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated. The evaluation was performed to B0, FA and AD maps from two aspects. First, the accuracy of segmentation was evaluated via a comparison between segmentation based on each diffusive metric map and segmentation based on an average image, which was acquired by averaging B0, FA, AD, RD and MD maps. The segmentation was achieved by a semi-automatic segmentation process, and the similarity between two segmentation results was denoted by the intersection of the union (IOU). Second, the diversity of extracted diffusive features was equalized as their performance in the classification of image pixels of different regions of interest (ROIs) and then was evaluated by mutual information (MI) and area under the curve (AUC). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post hoc tests were applied to compare the evaluation results. Results: One-way ANOVA suggested that there were differences (P<0.001) in IOU, MI and AUC values among the three diffusive metric maps for both healthy subjects and patients. The post-hoc tests further indicated that FA performed the best (P<0.001), i.e., the most substantial accuracy of segmentation and the highest diversity in extracted diffusive features. Conclusions: Different evaluation results had been observed for segmentation based on different diffusive metric maps, suggesting the necessity of selection of diffusive metric maps for segmentation in DTI analysis of the cervical spinal cord. Moreover, FA map is suggested for segmentation due to its best performance in the evaluation. ? Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

"Patient factors and their impact on neutropenic events: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Neutropenia is associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation. Strategies, including the prescribing of colony-stimulating growth factors (CSFs), are adopted when a high risk (&gt; 20%) of neutropenic complications are seen in the clinical trial setting. With a diverse treatment population that may differ from the patient groups recruited to studies, appropriate prescribing decisions by clinicians are essential. At present, results are conflicting from studies evaluating the risks of certain patient attributes on neutropenic events; we aimed to aggregate these associations to guide future management. Design: A systematic review with a meta-analysis was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Studies were identified through a literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases from inception to December 1, 2017. Studies were included into a meta-analysis if they adjusted for confounders; analyses were conducted in STATA v 15.1 SE. Results: A total of 4415 articles were retrieved by the search with 37 meeting the inclusion criteria and 12 eligible for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted for increasing age and yielded a pooled odds ratio of 1.39 (1.11, 1.76, I2 = 24.1%), in our subgroup analysis of 4814 patients. Odds ratios for studies were pooled that reported associations for one co-morbidity compared to none and resulted in an overall odds of 1.54 (CI 1.09–2.09, I2?= 13.1%), including 9189 patients in total.

Methods: Using suicide data obtained from the World Health Organization Statistical Information System, 2012, suicide gender ratios were calculated and a world map of the ratios constructed. Forest plots were utilized to assess whether gender inequality (indicated by the Gender Inequality Index [“GII”] and male to female sex ratios at birth) moderated the worldwide patterns of suicide gender ratios. Regression analyses were then performed to estimate the extent to which gender inequality affects suicide gender ratios before and after controlling for human development level (“HDI”). Results: Gradient relationships of suicide gender ratios across 3 tertiles of GII were observed (ratios = 2.03, 2.54, 3.51, respectively for high, moderate and low GII, P = 0.03). High sex ratio at birth was significantly associated with lower suicide gender ratio (ratio = 1.64 vs. 2.75, P = 0.00). Regression analyses showed that highest tertile of GII and high sex ratios at birth were significantly associated with lower suicide gender ratios (P = 0.00 and P = 0.00, respectively). When the level of human development level was controlled, high sex ratio at birth remained to be a significant determinant of suicide gender ratios (P = 0.00), whereas the significance of GII disappeared (P = 0.19). Limitations: The cross-sectional data do not allow for causal inferences. Conclusions: Male to female suicide ratios were higher in countries with more egalitarian gender norms. Strategies to eliminate culturally embedded gender discrimination have the potentials to prevent suicides. ? 2018","Article; Asian; Eastern European; female; gender; human; male; priority journal; sex ratio; sexism; suicide; USSR; cross-sectional study; global health; pregnancy; sex factor; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; suicide; World Health Organization; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Sex Factors; Sex Ratio; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide; World Health Organization"
"The effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on the attentional set-shifting task performance of alcohol-dependent rats",2019,"Objectives: Alcohol dependence causes extensive damage to the central nervous system, resulting in impaired brain structure and behavioral changes. Moreover, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors restrain the activity of HDAC and cause increased histone acetylation, which may be related to alcohol dependence. Methods: Ethanol dependence was modelled in animals by persistent alcohol exposure and tested in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. To induce CPP, the alcohol-treated rats were given orally gradient concentration (3%, 6%, and 9% v/v) alcohol administration for 20 consecutive days. The sodium butyrate (NaB)-treated rats were injected daily. Cognitive flexibility was evaluated using an attentional set-shifting task (ASST) in which the rats performed a series of seven consecutive discriminations after the final CPP paradigm. Results: Ethanol administration induced alcohol dependence behaviors, with more time spent in the ethanol-paired compartment. Compared with the CPP scores of the control group, the scores of the ethanol- and NaB-treated groups were significantly higher. In the ASST, alcohol-treated rats had significantly increased number of trials to reach criteria (TTC) in most phases, higher error rate, and lower cognitive levels compared to the control group. Moreover, the present findings demonstrated that NaB combined with ethanol caused cognitive deficits as the result of an increased number of TTC during the ASST. Conclusions: The attentional/cognitive flexibility of the prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent rats was damaged and the NaB administration procedure itself did not produce cognitive deficits, but instead exacerbated cognitive impairment in alcohol-dependent rats. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","alcohol; butyric acid; alcoholism; animal experiment; Article; attentional set shifting task; behavior change; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; male; nonhuman; olfactory discrimination; place preference; priority journal; rat; task performance; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test"
"Current Treatment Landscape of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma and Potential Trials Evaluating the Value of Immunotherapy",2019,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a type of head and neck cancer with a distinctive regional and racial prevalence. It is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and has a high propensity for regional and distant metastases, while it is very sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. A common feature of Epstein-Barr virus-positive NPC is the dense infiltration of lymphocytes in the tumor stroma and positive programmed death-ligand 1 expression in tumor cells, making it an attractive target for immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors. As new immunotherapeutic agents are being rapidly adopted in many cancers, including head and neck cancer, the National Cancer Institute sponsored a clinical trial planning meeting to identify opportunities for developing phase II and III trials testing immunotherapy in different stages of NPC. The meeting started with the summary of the biology of the disease, current standards of care, and evidence of immunotherapy in this cancer. Three subcommittees were tasked to develop clinical trials: loco regionally advanced, nonmetastatic NPC; widely metastatic NPC; and either local recurrence after initial treatment or presenting with oligometastatic disease. This article summarizes the proceedings of this clinical trial planning meeting and provides a road map for future trials incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors for therapeutic management of NPC. This road map, though specific for NPC, may also be applicable to other virally driven cancers that have similar ability to evade the host's immune system. ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Collagen microsphere based 3D culture system for human osteoarthritis chondrocytes (hOACs)",2019,"The current study aims to evaluate collagen microencapsulation as an in vitro 3D culture platform for human osteoarthritic chondrocytes (hOACs), and to exemplify its feasibility in screening potential disease modifying factors. We first isolated and expanded hOACs from osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage samples harvested from multiple patients during total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. These cells were microencapsulated into collagen microspheres for subsequent 3D cultures. The change in chondrocyte phenotypes and OA phenotype was evaluated over time, using 2D monolayer culture and traditional 3D pellet culture as controls. The hOACs in the 3D collagen microsphere model resumed their in vivo phenotypes when compared to 2D monolayer. When compared with the 3D pellet model, the 3D hOAC-collagen microsphere model better recapitulated the OA phenotypes. We further demonstrated the responsiveness of the microencapsulated hOACs towards a number of external factors altering the chondrogenic phenotype, corroborating with previous studies. The hOAC encapsulated collagen microspheres better maintained the hOAC phenotype than the traditional 2D monolayer and 3D pellet cultures. The feasibility to use this hOAC-collagen microsphere in vitro model as a screening platform for disease-modifying agents has been demonstrated, contributing to future development of OA therapeutics. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The impact of extremely hot weather events on all-cause mortality in a highly urbanized and densely populated subtropical city: A 10-year time-series study (2006–2015)",2019,"Background: The impact of heatwaves on public health has led to an urgent need to describe extremely hot weather events (EHWEs) and evaluate their health impacts. Methods: In Hong Kong, a very hot day (VHD) can be defined when the daily maximum temperature ? 33 °C, and a hot night (HN) can be identified if the daily minimum temperature ? 28 °C. Three lengths of time, nine combinations of VHD and HN, and four categories of occurrence intervals between two EHWEs were considered over 2006–2015. The daily relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality was estimated using Poisson generalized additive regression models, controlling for both short-term and long-term trends in temperature as well as four air pollutants. Lagged effects of the representative EHWEs were further examined for their association with mortality. Subgroup analysis was conducted for different sex and age groups. Results: Significant associations with raised mortality risks were observed for a single HN, while stronger associations with mortality were observed as significant for five or more consecutive VHDs/HNs. More HNs between the consecutive VHDs also significantly amplified the impact on mortality, with the strongest association observed for EHWEs characterized as 2D3N, and the effect significantly lagged for five days. Therefore, with identifiable health impacts, three thresholds (5VHDs, 5HNs, & 2D3N) were determined to be representative of identical types of EHWEs in Hong Kong. Furthermore, by taking 2 (3) consecutive VHDs (HNs) as one daytime (nighttime) EHWE event, those occurring consecutively without non-hot days (nights) in between were found to be significantly associated with excess mortality risks. Moreover, females and older adults were determined to be relatively more vulnerable to all defined EHWEs. Conclusions: Among all the observed significant heat-mortality associations in highly urbanized cities, EHWEs that occurred during the nighttime, with extended length, consecutively without any break in between, or in the pattern of 2D3N might require the meteorological administration, healthcare providers, and urban planners to work interactively. ? 2019","Regression analysis; Risk perception; Tropics; Weather information services; Generalized additives; Health care providers; Heat waves; Hot weather; Maximum temperature; Minimum temperatures; Mortality; Urban Heat Island Effects; Health; health impact; heat island; heat wave; high temperature; mortality; public health; subtropical region; temperature effect; time series analysis; urbanization; aged; air pollutant; all cause mortality; article; city; controlled study; female; groups by age; health care personnel; heat; Hong Kong; human; male; night; risk assessment; risk factor; time series analysis; weather; environmental exposure; epidemiology; mortality; statistics and numerical data; trends; urbanization; China; Hong Kong; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hong Kong; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Mortality; Urbanization"
"Phacoemulsification cataract surgery in patients receiving novel oral anticoagulant medications",2019,"Introduction: An increasing number of patients are taking novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) medication, making perioperative management in phacoemulsification surgery an important issue. This study reports the haemorrhagic complications of NOAC in phacoemulsification surgery. Design: Retrospective case study over a 4-year period. Methods: Consecutive cases receiving NOAC during the time of phacoemulsification were reviewed. Patients were either advised to continue medications (continued group) or withhold medications before surgery (withheld group). Main outcome measures: Details including patient demographics, preoperative assessment, postoperative outcome and intraoperative, postoperative and systemic complications were recorded. Results: A total of 20,100 cases of phacoemulsification were performed. Of which, 66 cases were found to be on NOAC (0.33%). This included 66 eyes of 53 patients, with 42 continued and 24 withheld medications before surgery. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in demographics, cataract risk factors, baseline renal function, clotting profile, type of NOAC, incision size, phacoemulsification energy, preoperative and postoperative visual acuity. There was also no significant difference in intraoperative, postoperative and systemic complications (p?=?1.00 and 0.53, Fischer’s exact test). None of the patients in the continued group had postoperative complications; two cases in the withheld group receiving retrobulbar anaesthesia had bruising and subconjunctival haemorrhage after resumption of NOAC (p?=?0.13, Fischer’s exact test). Conclusion: The present study found no difference in haemorrhagic complications between cases continuing and withholding NOAC during phacoemulsification. Nevertheless, the potential risks and benefits to continue or withhold NOAC perioperatively should be carefully considered via a multidisciplinary approach. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","anticoagulant agent; apixaban; cefuroxime; dabigatran; rivaroxaban; anticoagulant agent; activated partial thromboplastin time; aged; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; atrial fibrillation; cataract extraction; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; female; human; injection site contusion; international normalized ratio; intraoperative period; kidney function; major clinical study; male; phacoemulsification; postoperative period; prothrombin time; pupil; retrobulbar anesthesia; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; topical anesthesia; visual acuity; cataract; complication; follow up; Hong Kong; incidence; operative blood loss; oral drug administration; phacoemulsification; postoperative hemorrhage; procedures; statistics and numerical data; thromboembolism; time factor; Administration, Oral; Aged; Anticoagulants; Blood Loss, Surgical; Cataract; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hong Kong; Humans; Incidence; Male; Phacoemulsification; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Thromboembolism; Time Factors"
"Histone chaperone FACT complex mediates oxidative stress response to promote liver cancer progression",2020,"Objective Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) complex is a histone chaperone participating in DNA repair-related and transcription-related chromatin dynamics. In this study, we investigated its oncogenic functions, underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Design We obtained HCC and its corresponding non-tumorous liver samples from 16 patients and identified FACT complex as the most upregulated histone chaperone by RNA-Seq. We further used CRISPR-based gene activation and knockout systems to demonstrate the functions of FACT complex in HCC growth and metastasis. Functional roles and mechanistic insights of FACT complex in oxidative stress response were investigated by ChIP assay, flow cytometry, gene expression assays and 4sU-DRB transcription elongation assay. Therapeutic effect of FACT complex inhibitor, Curaxin, was tested in both in vitro and in vivo models. Results We showed that FACT complex was remarkably upregulated in HCC and contributed to HCC progression. Importantly, we unprecedentedly revealed an indispensable role of FACT complex in NRF2-driven oxidative stress response. Oxidative stress prevented NRF2 and FACT complex from KEAP1-mediated protein ubiquitination and degradation. Stabilised NRF2 and FACT complex form a positive feedback loop; NRF2 transcriptionally activates the FACT complex, while FACT complex promotes the transcription elongation of NRF2 and its downstream antioxidant genes through facilitating rapid nucleosome disassembly for the passage of RNA polymerase. Therapeutically, Curaxin effectively suppressed HCC growth and sensitised HCC cell to sorafenib. Conclusion In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that FACT complex is essential for the expeditious HCC oxidative stress response and is a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment. ? 2020 Author(s).","chaperone; curaxin; facilitates chromatin transcription complex; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; protein inhibitor; RNA polymerase; sorafenib; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; carbazole derivative; CBLC137; cell cycle protein; chaperone; DNA binding protein; high mobility group protein; sorafenib; SSRP1 protein, human; SUPT16H protein, human; transcription elongation factor; transcription factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical article; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; controlled study; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; drug sensitivity; drug sensitization; drug tolerability; embryo; gene activation; gene knockout; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; metastasis; MIHA cell line; monotherapy; mouse; nonhuman; nucleosome; oxidative stress; positive feedback; priority journal; protein degradation; RNA sequence; transcription elongation; transcription initiation; ubiquitination; upregulation; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biosynthesis; cell motion; disease exacerbation; drug screening; experimental liver neoplasm; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; nude mouse; oxidative stress; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Carbazoles; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Disease Progression; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockout Techniques; High Mobility Group Proteins; Histone Chaperones; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Oxidative Stress; Sorafenib; Transcription Factors; Transcriptional Elongation Factors; Up-Regulation; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"

"Uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy: A consensus report from the Uniportal VATS Interest Group (UVIG) of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS)",2019,"Objectives: Our goal was to report the results of the first consensus paper among international experts in uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UniVATS) lobectomy obtained through a Delphi process, the objective of which was to define and standardize the main procedural steps, optimize its indications and perioperative management and identify elements to assist in future training. Methods: The 40 members of the working group were convened and organized on a voluntary basis by the Uniportal VATS Interest Group (UVIG) of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS). An e-consensus finding exercise using the Delphi method was applied to require 75% agreement for reaching consensus on each question. Repeated iterations of anonymous voting continued for 3 rounds. Results: Overall, 31 international experts from 18 countries completed all 3 rounds of questionnaires. Although a technical quorum was not achieved, most of the responders agreed that the maximum size of a UniVATS incision should be ?4 cm. Agreement was reached on many points outlining the currently accepted definition of a UniVATS lobectomy, its indications and contraindications, perioperative clinical management and recommendations for training and future research directions. Conclusions: The UVIG Consensus Report stated that UniVATS offers a valid alternative to standard VATS techniques. Only longer follow-up and randomized controlled studies will predict whether UniVATS represents a valid alternative approach to multiport VATS for major lung resections or whether it should be performed only in selected cases and by selected centres. The next step for the ESTS UVIG is the establishment of a UniVATS section inside the ESTS databases. ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Patent foramen ovale and long-term risk of ischaemic stroke after surgery",2019,"Aims Pre-operatively diagnosed patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke within 30 days after surgery. This study aimed to assess the PFO-attributable ischaemic stroke risk beyond the perioperative period. Methods and results This observational study of adult patients without history of stroke undergoing non-cardiac surgery with general anaesthesia examined the association of PFO with ischaemic stroke 1 and 2 years after surgery using multivariable logistic regression. Of the 144 563 patients included, a total of 1642 (1.1%) and 2376 (1.6%) ischaemic strokes occurred within 1 and 2 years after surgery, 54 (4.7%) and 76 (6.6%) among patients with PFO, and 1588 (1.1%) and 2300 (1.6%) among patients without PFO, respectively. The odds of ischaemic stroke within 1 and 2 years after surgery were increased in patients with PFO: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51-2.69; P < 0.001 and aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.64-2.68; P < 0.001, respectively. Among patients who underwent contrast transoesophageal echocardiography, the frequency of PFO was 27%, and the increased stroke risk in patients with PFO was robust (aOR 3.80, 95% CI 1.76-8.23; P = 0.001 for year 1). The PFO-attributable risk was mitigated by post-operative prescription of combination antithrombotic therapy (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.75; P for interaction = 0.004). Conclusion Patients with PFO are vulnerable to ischaemic stroke for an extended period of time after surgery. Physicians should consider implementing PFO screening protocols in patients scheduled for major non-cardiac surgery. ? 2017 The Author.","anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; adult; anticoagulant therapy; Article; attributable risk; brain ischemia; cohort analysis; contrast transoesophageal echocardiography; controlled study; disease association; dual antiplatelet therapy; female; general anesthesia; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; mortality; multivariate logistic regression analysis; observational study; patent foramen ovale; perioperative period; prescription; priority journal; propensity score; transesophageal echocardiography; transient ischemic attack"
"The effect of birth weight on body composition: Evidence from a birth cohort and a Mendelian randomization study",2019,"Background Lower birth weight is associated with diabetes although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Muscle mass could be a modifiable link and hence a target of intervention. We assessed the associations of birth weight with muscle and fat mass observationally in a population with little socio-economic patterning of birth weight and using Mendelian randomization (MR) for validation. Methods In the population-representative ""Children of 1997"" birth cohort (n = 8,327), we used multivariable linear regression to assess the adjusted associations of birth weight (kg) with muscle mass (kg) and body fat (%) at ?17.5 years. Genetically predicted birth weight (effect size) was applied to summary genetic associations with fat-free mass and fat mass (kg) from the UK Biobank (n = ?331,000) to obtain unconfounded estimates using inverse-variance weighting. Results Observationally, birth weight was positively associated with muscle mass (3.29 kg per kg birth weight, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.83 to 3.75) and body fat (1.09% per kg birth weight, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.65). Stronger associations with muscle mass were observed in boys than in girls (p for interaction 0.004). Using MR, birth weight was positively associated with fat-free mass (0.77 kg per birth weight z-score, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.33) and fat mass (0.58, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.15). No difference by sex was evident. Conclusion Higher birth weight increasing muscle mass may be relevant to lower birth weight increasing the risk of diabetes and suggests post-natal muscle mass as a potential target of intervention. ? 2019 Liu et al.","Article; birth weight; body composition; body patterning; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; effect size; fat mass; genetic association; human; Mendelian randomization analysis; muscle mass; observational study; risk assessment; socioeconomics; statistical significance; United Kingdom"

"‘From my point of view, my wife has recovered’: A qualitative investigation of caregivers’ perceptions of recovery and peer support services for people with bipolar disorder in a Chinese community",2019,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mental disorder, and family members play a key role in taking care of the affected individuals. The recovery movement has gradually transformed mental health services, for example, through the introduction of peer support services (sharing of expert-by-experience knowledge), and it has challenged the prevailing view that people with mental illness cannot recover. Aims: Through this study, the researchers explored how family caregivers in a Chinese context conceptualise recovery, how caregivers interact with peer support workers (PSWs) and how they perceive peer support services. Methods: Fourteen family caregivers from community settings participated in individual semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed through thematic analysis. Results: Family caregivers had multifaceted definitions of recovery and had various degrees of contact with PSWs. The views and experiences shared by PSWs were hope-instilling for caregivers and changed their perception of BD and their loved ones. Some limitations of PSWs were also identified. Conclusion: Social connectedness and functional outcomes were important indicators of recovery among Chinese family caregivers. Caregivers began to understand the benefits of PSWs after experiencing their services. Peer-led services could be a helpful support for both service users and family caregivers. ?

"All-cause and cause-specific mortality from restrictive and obstructive spirometric patterns in Chinese adults with and without dyspnea: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study",2019,"Objective: To study whether abnormal spirometric patterns were associated with differential mortality in Chinese adults with and without dyspnea. Methods: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS) participants were classified by spirometric patterns and presence of dyspnea into 6 groups: normal spirometry (NS), restriction on spirometry (ROS) and airflow obstruction (AO), each with and without dyspnea. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated for mortality using Cox models. Results: Among 16777 subjects, 1595 (9.5%) had ROS, 1036 (6.2%) had AO and 1009 (6.0%) had dyspnea. A total of 1993 deaths (11.9%) occurred during 11-year follow-up. Using NS without dyspnea as reference, NS with dyspnea was significantly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality risk (aHRs 1.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18–2.19); ROS with and without dyspnea were associated with increased risks of all-cause (aHRs 1.46 (95% CI 1.28–1.66) and 1.81 (95% CI 1.33–2.47)) and cardiovascular mortality (aHRs 1.89 (95% CI 1.55–2.31) and 1.85 (95% CI 1.12–3.03)), but not of lung cancer mortality (aHRs 1.33 (95% CI 0.91–1.94) and 1.35 (95% CI 0.49–3.70)); AO with and without dyspnea were associated with increased risks of all-cause (aHRs 1.59 (95% CI 1.36–1.86) and 2.36 (95% CI 1.77–3.15)), cardiovascular (aHRs 1.43 (95% CI 1.08–1.90) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.91–2.82)) and lung cancer mortality (aHRs 1.91 (95% CI 1.29–2.84) and 3.01 (95% CI 1.46–6.23)). These associations did not vary by sex or smoking status (all P-values for interaction >0.05). Conclusion: Both ROS and AO, with and without dyspnea, were associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. The increased risk of all-cause was greater and that of cardiovascular mortality was lower for AO than ROS. AO showed significantly increased risk of lung cancer but ROS did not.

"Five-year lung cancer mortality risk analysis and topography in Xuan Wei: A spatiotemporal correlation analysis",2019,"Background: In Xuan Wei, China, the lung cancer mortality rate is rising significantly more than that of the nation overall. However, it remains unclear 1) if improved diagnosis can just partially explain this observation and how other local risk factors may be correlated with the lung cancer mortality rate and 2) how the lung cancer mortality rates differ within Xuan Wei and how these spatiotemporal patterns are linked with local risk factors. To increase etiological knowledge, this study evaluated the spatial and temporal distributions of the health effects (the lung cancer mortality rates) from 2011 to 2015. Methods: Four steps of spatial analysis were applied, as follows: 1) hotspot analysis to determine the geographical patterns of lung cancer mortality, 2) spatially-weighted sum to identify areas with higher health risks, 3) bivariate statistical analysis to assess the overall correlation between coal mines and lung cancer mortality, and 4) geographically-weighted regression to test for correlations among different towns within Xuan Wei. Results: Women had higher lung cancer mortality rates than those in men, with an increasing trend in both sexes over time. The incidence rates in Laibin Town were the highest in Xuan Wei every year. Over the 5-year study period, the lung cancer mortality was increasingly concentrated in Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang, where the smoky coal mines are most concentrated. The population-level health risks from the coal mine in Xuan Wei were mapped and divided into five types of risk areas (Type I - Type IV). Correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant correlation between lung cancer mortality as a whole and coal mine distribution during the 5-year study period. However, the geographically-weighted regression revealed a stronger correlation in medium (Type III) and second-lowest (Type IV) health risks. Conclusions: Xuan Wei lung cancer mortality has increased continuously since the third national retrospective surveys on the causes of death by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (2004-2005), especially for local women and residents over 35 years of age. Geographically, lung cancer in Xuan Wei showed unique spatiotemporal clustering. The local lung cancer mortality was significantly correlated with the smoky coal mine geographically. Some specific towns (Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang) within Xuan Wei manifested high correlations between lung cancer mortality and coal mines. The effects of coal mines on lung cancer mortality rates also spread geographically outward from these areas. Public health concern regarding lung cancer in Xuan Wei should prioritize higher-risk towns surrounded by smoking coal mines. Intervention strategies for particular toxic coal types require further studies on their chemical characteristics and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Additional studies are also warranted to systematically examine the local environmental health risks related to coal industries and combustion air pollution and eventually to conduct early screening of lung cancer for local people who are more exposed to smoky coal in high-risk areas. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aged; China; epidemiology; female; human; lung tumor; male; middle aged; mortality; retrospective study; risk factor; spatiotemporal analysis; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Spatio-Temporal Analysis"
"A qualitative and quantitative investigation of effects of indoor built environment for people with dementia in care and attention homes",2019,"The demented elderly have physical, emotional and behavioral patterns that differ from those of the normal elderly, and those patterns differentiate their needs in terms of the indoor built environment (IBE). Therefore, it is essential to investigate the effects of the IBE on the quality of life (QoL)of the demented elderly. To ensure the study's reliability and validity, multiple research methods were applied, including qualitative methods (i.e., an interview)and quantitative ones (i.e., a questionnaire survey). In total, 96 demented elderly residents and 18 caregivers from eight care and attention (C&A)homes were involved in the current study. Based on the data collection, an IBE-QoL model was developed using a reliability test, correlation analysis and regression analysis. The model confirmed the following: 1)building services factors – lighting, temperature, lifts and water supply – predict demented elderly residents' physical health, psychological health, independence, activities of daily living and social relationships; and 2)supporting facilities factors – signage, finishes and furniture – also exert a positive impact on the residents' physical health, activities of daily living, social relationships and cognitive functioning. Practical recommendations are made, including that C&A homes provide access to a sky garden on each floor, label water taps with hot/cold signs, provide signage with iconic information at different strategic locations, employ color contrasting finishes in different rooms, use historical furniture, and so on. This study's results provide valuable insight into improving C&A homes' IBE in order to enhance the QoL of the demented elderly. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Neurodegenerative diseases; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Social aspects; Water supply; Built environment; Care and attention homes; Dementia; Elderly; Quality of life; Surveys; correlation; elderly care; housing conditions; mental health; qualitative analysis; quality of life; regression analysis"
"Distribution of lymph node metastases in esophageal carcinoma [TIGER study]: Study protocol of a multinational observational study",2019,"Background: An important parameter for survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma is lymph node status. The distribution of lymph node metastases depends on tumor characteristics such as tumor location, histology, invasion depth, and on neoadjuvant treatment. The exact distribution is unknown. Neoadjuvant treatment and surgical strategy depends on the distribution pattern of nodal metastases but consensus on the extent of lymphadenectomy has not been reached. The aim of this study is to determine the distribution of lymph node metastases in patients with resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction carcinoma in whom a transthoracic esophagectomy with a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy is performed. This can be the foundation for a uniform worldwide staging system and establishment of the optimal surgical strategy for esophageal cancer patients. Methods: The TIGER study is an international observational cohort study with 50 participating centers. Patients with a resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction carcinoma in whom a transthoracic esophagectomy with a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy is performed in participating centers will be included. All lymph node stations will be excised and separately individually analyzed by pathological examination. The aim is to include 5000 patients. The primary endpoint is the distribution of lymph node metastases in esophageal and esophago-gastric junction carcinoma specimens following transthoracic esophagectomy with at least 2-field lymphadenectomy in relation to tumor histology, tumor location, invasion depth, number of lymph nodes and lymph node metastases, pre-operative diagnostics, neo-adjuvant therapy and (disease free) survival. Discussion: The TIGER study will provide a roadmap of the location of lymph node metastases in relation to tumor histology, tumor location, invasion depth, number of lymph nodes and lymph node metastases, pre-operative diagnostics, neo-adjuvant therapy and survival. Patient-tailored treatment can be developed based on these results, such as the optimal radiation field and extent of lymphadenectomy based on the primary tumor characteristics.

"Developing an early warning system of suicide using Google Trends and media reporting",2019,"Background: Conventional surveillance systems for suicides typically suffer from a substantial time lag of six months to two years. This study aims to develop an early warning system of possible suicide outbreaks in Hong Kong using Google Trends and suicide-related media reporting. Methods: Data on 3,534 suicides from 2011 to 2015 were obtained from Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, and the Coroner's Court. Using data from Google Trends and features extracted from media reporting on suicide news, we fitted Poisson regression models to predict the number and estimate the intensity of suicides on a weekly basis, for six subgroups, defined by gender and age. We adopted the cumulative sum (CUSUM)control chart-based method to identify outbreaks of suicide. Results: The proposed model was able to predict the number of suicides with reasonably low normalized root mean squared errors, ranging from 15.6% for young females to 24.16% for old females. The suicide intensity curves were well captured by the proposed models for young males and females, but not for other groups. The Sensitivity, Precision and F1 Score of the CUSUM-based method were 50%, 100% and 67% for young females, and 93%, 54% and 68% for young males. Limitations: This study focused only on predicting the number of suicides in the current week, not in the future weeks. The model did not include social media, socioeconomic and climate data. Conclusions: Our results indicate that Google Trends search terms and media reporting data may be valuable data sources for predicting possible outbreak of suicides in Hong Kong. The proposed system could support effective and targeted interventions. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",""
"Walking is more effective than yoga at reducing sleep disturbance in cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2019,"This review aimed to determine whether walking is more effective than yoga at improving sleep disturbance in cancer patients. A systematic search of randomized controlled trials was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Airiti Library, and other health-related databases. Twenty-five studies were identified with a total of 1918 participants. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index was the most commonly used outcome measurement tool, and moderate-intensity walking was the most frequently used intervention. The majority of the included subjects were breast cancer patients. Overall, walking significantly improved sleep disturbance compared to yoga (p = 0.01). Statistically significant moderators included adherence rate for walking (p < 0.001) and allocation concealment and outcome measurement tool for yoga (p = 0.04; p = 0.03). We concluded that walking is more effective than yoga in improving sleep disturbance in cancer patients. Thus, moderate-intensity walking is recommended for cancer patients with sleep disturbance. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","breast cancer; cancer patient; exercise intensity; human; malignant neoplasm; meta analysis; outcome assessment; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Review; sleep disorder; systematic review; walking; yoga"
"Next-generation sequencing with a 54-gene panel identified unique mutational profile and prognostic markers in Chinese patients with myelofibrosis",2019,"Current prognostication in myelofibrosis (MF) is based on clinicopathological features and mutations in a limited number of driver genes. The impact of other genetic mutations remains unclear. We evaluated for mutations in a myeloid panel of 54 genes using next-generation sequencing. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS), based on mutations of these genes and relevant clinical and haematological features. One hundred and one patients (primary MF, N = 70; secondary MF, N = 31) with a median follow-up of 49 (1–256) months were studied. For the entire cohort, inferior OS was associated with male gender (P = 0.04), age &gt; 65?years (P = 0.04), haemoglobin &lt; 10?g/dL (P = 0.001), CUX1 mutation (P = 0.003) and TP53 mutation (P = 0.049); and inferior LFS was associated with male gender (P = 0.03), haemoglobin &lt; 10?g/dL (P = 0.04) and SRSF2 mutations (P = 0.008). In primary MF, inferior OS was associated with male gender (P = 0.03), haemoglobin &lt; 10?g/dL (P = 0.002), platelet count &lt; 100 × 10 9 /L (P = 0.02), TET2 mutation (P = 0.01) and CUX1 mutation (P = 0.01); and inferior LFS was associated with haemoglobin &lt; 10?g/dL (P = 0.02), platelet count &lt; 100 × 10 9 /L (P = 0.02), TET2 mutations (P = 0.01) and CUX1 mutations (P = 0.04).

"Urban climate modified short-term association of air pollution with pneumonia mortality in Hong Kong",2019,"Background: City is becoming warmer, especially in the process of urbanization and climate change. However, it is largely unknown whether this warming urban climate may modify the short-term effects of air pollution. Objectives: To test whether warmer urban climates intensify the acute mortality effects of air pollution on pneumonia in Hong Kong. Methods: Participants who died of pneumonia from a prospective Chinese elderly cohort between 1998 and 2011 were selected as cases. Urban climatic (UC) classes of cases were determined by an established Urban Climatic Map according to their residential addresses. UC classes were first dichotomized into cool and warm climates and case-crossover analysis was used to estimate the short-term association of pneumonia mortality with air pollution. We further classified UC classes into climate quartiles and used case-only analysis to test the trend of urban climate modification on the short-term association of pneumonia mortality with air pollution. Results: Among 66,820 elders (?65 years), 2208 pneumonia deaths (cases) were identified during the 11–14 years of follow-up. The effects of air pollution for cases residing in the warm climate were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) higher than those living in the cool climate. There was an increasing linear trend of urban climate modification on the association of pneumonia mortality with NO 2 (nitrogen dioxide) (p for trend = 0.035). Compared to climate Quartile 1 (the lowest), deaths resided in climate Quartile 2, 3, and 4 (the highest) were associated with an additional percent change of 9.07% (0.52%, 17.62%), 12.89% (4.34%, 21.43%), and 8.45% (?0.10%, 17.00%), respectively. Conclusions: Warmer urban climate worsened the acute mortality effects of pneumonia associated with air pollutants in Hong Kong. Our findings suggest that warmer urban climate introduced by climate change and urbanization may increase the risks of air pollution-related pneumonia. ? 2018","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Nitrogen oxides; Air pollutants; Case crossovers; Case-control study; Nitrogen dioxides; Pneumonia; Short-term effects; Urban climates; Warm climates; Climate change; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; climate change; health risk; map; mortality; pneumonia; urban climate; urbanization; aged; air pollution; Article; climate change; environmental temperature; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; mortality; pneumonia; priority journal; seasonal variation; urbanization; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; environmental exposure; epidemiology; pneumonia; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; China; Hong Kong; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Hong Kong; Humans; Mortality; Pneumonia; Prospective Studies"
"Association between the ratio of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in Th17 cells to AhR in Treg cells and SLE skin lesions",2019,"Skin lesions are typical clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the biomarker for predicting SLE skin injury is not clear. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study with aim to explore the predictive value of the ratio of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in T helper 17 (Th17) cells to AhR in regulatory T (Treg) cells (AhR ratio) in SLE skin lesions. The clinical and laboratory data were obtained from their medical records, and the AhR relative expression levels were evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Flow cytometry was applied to determine the proportion of AhR-overexpressing cells in Th17 and Treg cells. Pearson's correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between AhR ratio risk of skin lesions. Results showed that the expression level of AhR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was increased >3-fold in patients with SLE compared with that in healthy controls. Compared with control group, the percentage of AhR-overexpressing cells to Th17 cells was statistically higher in patients with SLE, whereas no significant difference was observed in the percentage of AhR-overexpressing cells to Treg cells between patients with SLE and control group. AhR ratio was also higher in SLE, and it was negatively correlated with complement 3 while positively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, compared with the low-AhR ratio group, more younger SLE patients with skin lesions, ultraviolet allergies and lower C3 levels were observed in the high-AhR ratio group, implicating that AhR ratio may be a potential biomarker for predicting SLE skin injury. ? 2019","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; complement component C3; prednisone; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; complement component C3; adult; Article; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; gene overexpression; human; human cell; male; middle aged; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; quantitative analysis; regulatory T lymphocyte; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; skin injury; systemic lupus erythematosus; Th17 cell; metabolism; pathology; predictive value; prognosis; regulatory T lymphocyte; skin; systemic lupus erythematosus; Th17 cell; young adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Complement C3; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Skin; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Th17 Cells; Young Adult"
"Narrow-Band Imaging for Detection of Neoplasia at Colonoscopy: A Meta-analysis of Data From Individual Patients in Randomized Controlled Trials",2019,"Background & Aims: Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is an important quality assurance measure for colonoscopy. Some studies suggest that narrow-band imaging (NBI) may be more effective at detecting adenomas than white-light endoscopy (WLE) when bowel preparation is optimal. We conducted a meta-analysis of data from individual patients in randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of NBI to WLE in detection of adenomas. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through April 2017 for randomized controlled trials that assessed detection of colon polyps by high-definition WLE vs NBI and from which data on individual patients were available. The primary outcome measure was ADR adjusted for bowel preparation quality. Multilevel regression models were used with patients nested within trials, and trial included as a random effect. Results: We collected data from 11 trials, comprising 4491 patients and 6636 polyps detected. Adenomas were detected in 952 of 2251 (42.3%) participants examined by WLE vs 1011 of 2239 (45.2%) participants examined by NBI (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] for detection of adenoma by WLE vs NBI, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01–1.29; P = .04). NBI outperformed WLE only when bowel preparation was best: adequate preparation OR, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.92–1.24; P = .38) vs best preparation OR, 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04–1.62; P = .02). Second-generation bright NBI had a better ADR than WLE (second-generation NBI OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05–1.56; P = .02), whereas first-generation NBI did not. NBI detected more non-adenomatous polyps than WLE (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06–1.44; P = .008) and flat polyps than WLE (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02–1.51; P = .03). Conclusions: In a meta-analysis of data from individual patients in randomized controlled trials, we found NBI to have a higher ADR than WLE, and that this effect is greater when bowel preparation is optimal. ? 2019 AGA Institute","adenoma; Article; cancer diagnosis; colonoscopy; comparative effectiveness; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; intestine preparation; meta analysis; multilevel analysis; narrow band imaging; outcome assessment; polyp; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; white light endoscopy; adenoma; colonoscopy; colorectal tumor; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; health care quality; narrow band imaging; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistics and numerical data; laxative; Adenoma; Cathartics; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Narrow Band Imaging; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"

"Evaluation of jawbone morphology and bone density indices in panoramic radiographs of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor users: A preliminary study",2019,"Objectives: To assess the influence of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use on jawbone and bone mineral density by retrospective analysis of panoramic radiographs. Methods: Radiographic and clinical records were sourced from the Division of Orthodontics and TMJD, Eastman Institute for Oral Health, University of Rochester. Randomly selected adults (20–65 years) were categorized into: “Active” (with history of SSRI use of &gt;6 months) and a “Control” group. Panoramic indices: Klemetti index (KI), panoramic mandibular index, antegonial notching index, condylar pathology, mandibular cortical width (MCW) and mean ramus height were recorded. Frequency-weighted Χ 2 tests and multinomial regression controlling for age and gender were applied to categorical indices (KI, condylar pathology, antegonial notching index). Multivariate generalized linear modeling was applied to mean ramus height, MCW and panoramic mandibular index. Multiple regression analyses determined: (a) panoramic indices that best predicted SSRI use, and (b) independent predictors of KI category. Results: 64 SSRI users and 48 Controls were assessed. SSRI users had significantly higher odds of having worse KI status than normal [mildly to moderately eroded cortex: odds ratio (OR) = 2.926, 95% CI (1.07–8.04) and severely eroded cortex: OR = 19.86, 95% CI (3.91–100.69)], more frequent flat condylar anatomy (right side: p = 0.009, left side: p &lt; 0.001) but greater ramus height (p = 0.001) and mandibular cortical width (p = 0.032). Age, gender, SSRI use each significantly impacted KI. Only SSRI use significantly impacted condylar pathology, ramus height and MCW. KI category (OR = 1.3) was the best panoramic predictor of SSRI use. Conversely, KI category C3 was significantly predicted by SSRI use (OR = 31.2, p = 0.002), female gender (17.5, p = 0.006), and severe antegonial notching (OR = 1289, p &lt; 0.001). conclusions: SRRI use was significantly associated with worse panoramic morphometric indices: KI, condylar pathology, ramus height, and MCW, where KI was its strongest predictor.

"A survey of recent adenoviral respiratory pathogens in Hong Kong reveals emergent and recombinant human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-E4) circulating in civilian populations",2019,"Human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-E4), which is intriguingly limited to military populations, causes acute respiratory disease with demonstrated morbidity and mortality implications. This respiratory pathogen contains genome identity with chimpanzee adenoviruses, indicating zoonotic origins. A signature of these “old” HAdV-E4 is the absence of a critical replication motif, NF-I, which is found in all HAdV respiratory pathogens and most HAdVs. However, our recent survey of flu-like disease in children in Hong Kong reveals that the emergent HAdV-E4 pathogens circulating in civilian populations contain NF-I, indicating recombination and reflecting host-adaptation that enables the “new” HAdV-E4 to replicate more efficiently in human cells and foretells more potential HAdV-E4 outbreaks in immune-na?ve civilian populations. Special attention should be paid by clinicians to this emergent and recombinant HAdV-E4 circulating in civilian populations. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Applying Mindfulness to Benefit Economically Disadvantaged Families: A Randomized Controlled Trial",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the effects of family-based mindfulness intervention (FBMI) to promote the stress management and early development of economically disadvantaged families. Method: Families receiving social security allowance and full textbook allowance and with children aged 5–7 were recruited. Participants were randomized to an FBMI with parallel programs for parents and children (n = 51) and to a wait-list control condition (n = 51). Results: Intent-to-treat analyses showed more significant improvements in child attention, self-regulation, and in parenting stress, in the intervention group than in the control group. At-risk group analyses showed that the high stress group benefited in small to moderate effect sizes in parenting stress and depression, and in moderate to large effect sizes in child behavioral problem and self-regulation. Conclusions: The results provide preliminary support that FBMI can alleviate the impact of economic disadvantage. FBMI should be applied in social work practice to support disadvantaged families. ?

"Molecular subtyping of cancer: Current status and moving toward clinical applications",2019,"Cancer is a collection of genetic diseases, with large phenotypic differences and genetic heterogeneity between different types of cancers and even within the same cancer type. Recent advances in genome-wide profiling provide an opportunity to investigate global molecular changes during the development and progression of cancer. Meanwhile, numerous statistical and machine learning algorithms have been designed for the processing and interpretation of high-throughput molecular data. Molecular subtyping studies have allowed the allocation of cancer into homogeneous groups that are considered to harbor similar molecular and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, this has helped researchers to identify both actionable targets for drug design as well as biomarkers for response prediction. In this review, we introduce five frequently applied techniques for generating molecular data, which are microarray, RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, NanoString and tissue microarray. Commonly used molecular data for cancer subtyping and clinical applications are discussed. Next, we summarize a workflow for molecular subtyping of cancer, including data preprocessing, cluster analysis, supervised classification and subtype characterizations. Finally, we identify and describe four major challenges in the molecular subtyping of cancer that may preclude clinical implementation. We suggest that standardized methods should be established to help identify intrinsic subgroup signatures and build robust classifiers that pave the way toward stratified treatment of cancer patients. ? 2018 The Author(s).",""
"OMICs approaches-assisted identification of macrophages-derived MIP-1γas the therapeutic target of botanical products TNTL in diabetic retinopathy",2019,"Background: Inflammatory reaction in the dysfunction of retinal endotheliocytes has been considered to play a vital role in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Anti-inflammatory therapy so far gains poor outcome as DR treatment. This study aims to identify a novel therapeutic target of DR from the OMICs studies of a traditional anti-DR botanical products TNTL. Methods: Hyperglycemic mice were treated with TNTL. The anti-hyperglycemic effect of TNTL was validated to confirm the biological consistency of the herbal products from batches. Improvement of DR by TNTL was examined by various assays on the retina. Next-generation transcriptome sequencing and cytokine array was used to identify the therapeutic targets. In vitro study was performed to validate the target. Results: We observed that TNTL at its high doses possessed anti-hyperglycemic effect in murine type I diabetic model, while at its doses without reducing blood glucose, it suppressed DR incidence. TNTL restored the blood-retina barrier integrity, suppressed retinal neovascularization, and attenuated the retinal ganglion cell degeneration. Transcriptomic analysis on the retina tissue of hyperglycemic mice with or without TNTL revealed that the inflammatory retina microenvironment was significantly repressed. TNTL treatment suppressed pro-inflammatory macrophages in the retina, which resulted in the inactivation of endothelial cell migration, restoration of endothelial cell monolayer integrity, and prevention of leakage. Cytokine array analysis suggested that TNTL could significantly inhibit the secretion of MIP1γfrom pro-inflammatory macrophages. Prevention of endothelial dysfunction by TNTL may be mediated by the inhibition of MIP1γ/CCR1 axis. More specifically, TNTL suppressed MIP1γrelease from pro-inflammatory macrophages, which in turn inhibited the activation of CCR1-associated signaling pathways in endothelial cells. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that TNTL might be an alternative treatment to DR, and the primary source of potential drug candidates against DR targeting MIP1γ/CCR1 axis in the retinal microenvironment. ? 2019 The Author(s).","chemokine receptor CCR1; herbaceous agent; macrophage inflammatory protein 1; macrophage inflammatory protein 1 gamma; tang ning tong luo; unclassified drug; analysis of variance; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; antiinflammatory activity; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; diabetic retinopathy; glycemic control; immunoblotting; in vitro study; in vivo study; incidence; microenvironment; neovascularization (pathology); nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; proteomics; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; retina ganglion cell; signal transduction; transcriptomics"

We employed a heart rate variability (HRV) Calligraphy–Guqin biofeedback intervention that was implemented with a Zephyr HxM Bluetooth chest heart rate monitoring device and an Android smartphone. A web-based HRV big database app stored the data from three consecutive sessions: (1) 5 min of Guqin music listening; (2) 5 min of CCH finger writing of calligraphy; and (3) again 5 min of Guqin music listening. The second session was designed to explore additive effects of the finger-writing task. One subject participated with the index finger employed for the writing task. Results. The results showed that the first and third Guqin sessions elicited 55% and 68% HRV coherences, respectively, while the CCH finger writing in the second session elicited 31% of high HRV coherence. The increase in HRV coherence between the two Guqin sessions was attributed to the calligraphy finger writing training effect. The practice of finger writing contributed to increased HRV regulation through heightened attention and concentration. ? 2019.

"Comparative immunogenicity of enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines in older adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",2019,"Background: A number of enhanced influenza vaccines have been developed for use in older adults, including high-dose, MF59-adjuvanted, and intradermal vaccines. Methods: We conducted a systematic review examining the improvements in antibody responses measured by the hemagglutination inhibition assay associated with these enhanced vaccines, compared with each other and with the standard-dose (SD) vaccine using random effects models. Results: Thirty-nine trials were included. Compared with adults aged 60 years receiving SD vaccines, those receiving enhanced vaccines had significantly higher postvaccination titers (for all vaccine strains) and higher proportions with elevated titers 40 (for most vaccine strains). High-dose vaccine elicited 82% higher postvaccination titer to A(H3N2) compared with SD vaccine; this was significantly higher than the 52% estimated for MF59-adjuvanted versus SD vaccines (P = .04), which was higher than the 32% estimated for intradermal versus SD vaccines (P < .01). Conclusions: Overall, by summarizing current evidence, we found that enhanced vaccines had greater antibody responses than the SD vaccine. Indications of differences among enhanced vaccines highlight the fact that further research is needed to compare new vaccine options, especially during seasons with mismatched circulating strains and for immune outcomes other than hemagglutination inhibition titers as well as vaccine efficacy. ?

"A comparison of psychosocial care preferences of breast cancer women in Mainland China and Hong Kong",2019,"Purpose: Despite shared cultural values, Mainland China's health care system differs from that of Hong Kong. We compared preferences for psychosocial care in Mainland breast cancer women with their Hong Kong counterparts to determine core preferences for, and correlates of, clinical psychosocial care implementation. Methods: Two hundred eighty breast cancer patients from 23 hospitals located in 15 provinces across Mainland China were recruited to complete the 55-item Chinese version of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's National Breast Cancer Centre assessment. Items ranked by proportions of women endorsing them as “essential” for care were compared with similar rankings by Hong Kong Chinese women with breast cancer. Results: Valid response rate was 83% (231/280). Among 231 breast cancer patients, greater than 40% endorsed 15/55 items as essential for effective psychosocial care. Of the top 10 ranked “repeatable” items, seven items were common to both Chinese and Hong Kong breast cancer women, while of the top 10 ranked “once-only” items, nine were common. Mainland breast cancer women ranked help with anxiety and social roles higher than did their Hong Kong counterparts. Demographic factors significantly associated with psychosocial care needs included ethnicity, age, income source and level, religious beliefs, education level, marital status, residential status, and current therapies. Conclusions: Chinese breast cancer patients prioritize both disease and treatment information and psychosocially sensitive care, making these core items in comprehensive psychosocial care implementation by clinicians and nurses. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; age; anxiety; Article; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council National Breast Cancer Centre assessment; breast cancer; cancer patient; China; Chinese; clinical assessment; controlled study; demography; education; ethnicity; family income; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; marriage; patient preference; psychosocial care; religion; social aspect; aged; breast tumor; comparative study; middle aged; patient attitude; psychology; psychotherapy; therapy; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; China; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Preference; Psychotherapy"
"Targeting SUMO modification of the non-structural protein 5 of zika virus as a host-targeting antiviral strategy",2019,"Post-translational modifications of host or viral proteins are key strategies exploited by viruses to support virus replication and counteract host immune response. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification process mediated by a family of ubiquitin-like proteins called small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins. Multiple sequence alignment of 78 representative flaviviruses showed that most (72/78, 92.3%) have a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) at their non-structural 5 (NS5) protein’s N-terminal domain. The putative SIM was highly conserved among 414 pre-epidemic and epidemic Zika virus (ZIKV) strains, with all of them having a putative SIM core amino acid sequence of VIDL (327/414, 79.0%) or VVDL (87/414, 21.0%). Molecular docking predicted that the hydrophobic SIM core residues bind to the β2 strand of the SUMO-1 protein, and the acidic residues flanking the core strengthen the binding through interactions with the basic surface of the SUMO protein. The SUMO inhibitor 2-D08 significantly reduced replication of flaviviruses and protected cells against ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects in vitro. A SIM-mutated ZIKV NS5 failed to efficiently suppress type I interferon signaling. Overall, these findings may suggest SUMO modification of the viral NS5 protein to be an evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification process among flaviviruses to enhance virus replication and suppress host antiviral response. ? 2019 by the authors.

"A novel perimeter-based index for evaluating the similarity of structure contours",2019,"Introduction The authors proposed a novel perimeter-based index (PBI) that was capable of evaluating the accuracy in the appraisal of auto-segmentation software. A quantitative value, that is time saved in editing the auto-segmented contours, was used to compare the effectiveness of two other commonly used indices in this study.Methods The relationship between the proposed index and the amount of the contouring time that could be saved was studied. The performances of two other commonly used similarity indices, namely Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the modified normalised average Hausdorff distance (MNAHD), were also evaluated. Ten nasopharyngeal cases and ten prostate cases that were previously treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique were recruited as the validation cases in this study. Three observers were invited to contour four structures (bladder, rectum, brain stem and parotid gland) on computed tomography images of the validation cases without any aids. The time taken for contouring was recorded as the manual contouring time. By using an atlas-based auto-segmentation software, three sets of contours were generated for each validation case with different library sizes to produce different degrees of similarity level. The values of the three similarity indices of the auto-segmented contours were calculated. The observers were asked to edit the auto-segmented contours and the editing time was recorded. The correlation between the editing time and the similarity indices was studied. The amount of time saved was calculated by subtracting the editing time from the manual contouring time. The performances of PBI, DSC and MNAHD were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficient and receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.Results The PBI showed a positive linear relationship with the amount of contouring time saved. Pearson correlation coefficient ranged from 0·73 to 0·86 for the four structures. The PBI had a stronger correlation than the DSC in bladder and parotid gland, while there was no significant difference between the two indices in rectum and brain stem. The MNAHD had an inferior correlation than the proposed index. For the ROC analysis, the cut-off values for the PBI were 0·549, 0·401 and 0·301 for the three levels of contouring time saved, namely 50, 25 and 0%, respectively. The accuracy of PBI was over 77% and the Youden index was >0·6 for all three levels.Conclusions The proposed index showed a stronger relationship to the amount of contouring time saved. It was a simple tool that could be used to evaluate the performance of different segmentation algorithms. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.","female; human; psychosocial disorder; quality of life; Review; sexuality; social isolation; social stigma; systematic review; vulva cancer"
"Functional 3D Human Liver Bud Assembled from MSC-Derived Multiple Liver Cell Lineages",2019,"The severe shortage of donor liver organs requires the development of alternative methods to provide transplantable liver tissues such as stem cell-derived organoids. Despite several studies describing the generation of vascularized and functional liver tissues, none have succeeded in assembling human liver buds containing hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report a reproducible, easy-to-follow, and comprehensive self-assembly protocol to generate three-dimensional (3D) human liver buds from na?ve mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), MSC-derived hepatocytes, and HSC- and LSEC-like cells. By optimizing the ratio between these different cell lineages, the cell mixture self-assembled into 3D human liver buds within 72 h in vitro, and exhibited similar characteristics with early-stage murine liver buds. In a murine model of acute liver failure, the mesenteric transplantation of self-assembled human liver buds effectively rescued animal death, and triggered hepatic ameliorative effects that were better than the ones observed after splenic transplantation of human hepatocytes or na?ve MSCs. In addition, transplanted human liver buds underwent maturation during injury alleviation, after which they exhibited a gene expression profile signature similar to the one of adult human livers. Collectively, our protocol provides a promising new approach for the in vitro construction of functional 3D human liver buds from multiple human MSC-derived hepatic cell lineages; this new technique would be useful for clinical transplantation and regenerative medicine research. ?

"Fifty-Five Years Follow-Up of 111 Adult Survivors After Biventricular Repair of PAIVS and PS",2019,"There is paucity of long-term data on adult survivors after biventricular repair of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) and pulmonary stenosis (PS). This study aimed to determine the cardiac and non-cardiac outcomes of adult survivors after biventricular repair of PAIVS and PS. The cardiac, neurodevelopmental and liver problems of 111 adults, 40 with PAIVS and 71 with PS, were reviewed. The median follow-up duration of our patients was 26.5?years (range 14.8–55?years). The freedom from reintervention at 30?years was 17.4% and 73.3% for PAIVS and PS patients (p < 0.001), respectively. Compared with PS patients, PAIVS patients had significantly greater prevalence of right atrial and right ventricular (RV) dilatation, and moderate to severe tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation (all p < 0.05), and cardiac arrhythmias (22.5% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.047). The freedom from development of cardiac arrhythmias at 30?years of 68.4% and 91.6%, respectively, in PAIVS and PS patients (p = 0.03). Cox proportional hazards model identified PAIVS as an independent risk factor for reintervention (HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.1–7.6, p < 0.001) and development of arrhythmias (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1–14.4, p = 0.03). Neurodevelopmental problems were found in 17.5% of PAIVS patients and 7.0% of PS patients (p = 0.11). Liver problems occurred in 2 (5%) PAIVS patients, both of whom required conversion to 1.5 ventricular repair. In conclusion, long-term problems, including the need for reinterventions, cardiac arrhythmias, RV dilation, pulmonary regurgitation, and neurodevelopmental and liver issues are more prevalent in adult PAIVS than PS survivors. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; Article; biventricular repair; controlled study; disease severity; female; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium enlargement; heart dilatation; heart right atrium; heart right ventricle dilatation; heart right ventricle outflow tract obstruction; heart surgery; high risk population; human; liver disease; major clinical study; male; mental disease; prevalence; pulmonary valve atresia; pulmonary valve atresia with intact ventricular septum; pulmonary valve insufficiency; pulmonary valve stenosis; retreatment; risk factor; survivor; tricuspid valve regurgitation; complication; congenital heart malformation; echocardiography; heart arrhythmia; heart surgery; heart ventricle; procedures; pulmonary valve atresia; pulmonary valve stenosis; reoperation; statistics and numerical data; survivor; treatment outcome; Adult; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Echocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Defects, Congenital; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Pulmonary Atresia; Pulmonary Valve Stenosis; Reoperation; Risk Factors; Survivors; Treatment Outcome"

"Concurrent validity of the Fitbit for assessing sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity",2019,"Background: Recent advances in sensor technologies have promoted the use of consumer-based accelerometers such as Fitbit Flex in epidemiological and clinical research; however, the validity of the Fitbit Flex in measuring sedentary behavior (SED) and physical activity (PA) has not been fully determined against previously validated research-grade accelerometers such as ActiGraph GT3X+. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the concurrent validity of the Fitbit Flex against ActiGraph GT3X+ in a free-living condition. Methods: A total of 65 participants (age: M = 42, SD = 14 years, female: 72%) each wore a Fitbit Flex and GT3X+ for seven consecutive days. After excluding sleep and non-wear time, time spent (min/day) in SED and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) were estimated using various cut-points for GT3X+ and brand-specific algorithms for Fitbit, respectively. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA and mean absolute percent errors (MAPE) served to examine differences and measurement errors in SED and MVPA estimates between Fitbit Flex and GT3X+, respectively. Pearson and Spearman correlations and Bland-Altman (BA) plots were used to evaluate the association and potential systematic bias between Fitbit Flex and GT3X+. PROC MIXED procedure in SAS was used to examine the equivalence (i.e., the 90% confidence interval with ±10% equivalence zone) between the devices. Results: Fitbit Flex produced similar SED and low MAPE (mean difference [MD] = 37 min/day, P =.21, MAPE = 6.8%), but significantly higher MVPA and relatively large MAPE (MD = 59-77 min/day, P <.0001, MAPE = 56.6-74.3%) compared with the estimates from GT3X+ using three different cut-points. The correlations between Fitbit Flex and GT3X+ were consistently higher for SED (r = 0.90, ρ = 0.86, P <.01), but weaker for MVPA (r = 0.65-0.76, ρ = 0.69-0.79, P <.01). BA plots revealed that there is no apparent bias in estimating SED. Conclusion: In comparison with the GT3X+ accelerometer, the Fitbit Flex provided comparatively accurate estimates of SED, but the Fitbit Flex overestimated MVPA under free-living conditions. Future investigations using the Fitbit Flex should be aware of present findings. ? 2019 The Author(s).","accelerometry; adult; ambulatory monitoring; devices; exercise; female; human; male; middle aged; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sleep; young adult; Accelerometry; Adult; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Reproducibility of Results; Sedentary Behavior; Sleep; Young Adult"
"Deregulated Gab2 phosphorylation mediates aberrant AKT and STAT3 signaling upon PIK3R1 loss in ovarian cancer",2019,"Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. ? 2019, The Author(s).","5 chloro n2 [1 (5 fluoro 2 pyrimidinyl)ethyl] n4 (5 methyl 1h pyrazol 3 yl) 2,4 pyrimidinediamine; 8 [4 (1 aminocyclobutyl)phenyl] 9 phenyl 1,2,4 triazolo[3,4 f][1,6]naphthyridin 3(2h) one; docking protein; Grb2 associated binder 2 protein; Janus kinase 2; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phosphotransferase; protein kinase B; protein p110; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; GAB2 protein, human; JAK2 protein, human; Janus kinase 2; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; PIK3CA protein, human; PIK3R1 protein, human; protein kinase B; PTEN protein, human; signal transducing adaptor protein; STAT3 protein; STAT3 protein, human; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; female; gene knockdown; mouse; nonhuman; ovary cancer; protein assembly; protein depletion; protein phosphorylation; apoptosis; cell cycle; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; deficiency; enzymology; human; metabolism; ovary tumor; pathology; phosphorylation; physiology; signal transduction; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Female; Humans; Janus Kinase 2; Ovarian Neoplasms; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor"
"A framework for identifying dysregulated chromatin regulators as master regulators in human cancer",2019,"Motivation: Chromatin regulators (CRs) are frequently dysregulated to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of the cancer genome. However, the underpinnings of the dysregulation of CRs and their downstream effectors remain to be elucidated. Results: Here, we designed an integrated framework based on multi-omics data to identify candidate master regulatory CRs affected by genomic alterations across eight cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Most of them showed consistent activated or repressed (i.e. oncogenic or tumor-suppressive) roles in cancer initiation and progression. In order to further explore the insight mechanism of the dysregulated CRs, we developed an R package ModReg based on differential connectivity to identify CRs as modulators of transcription factors (TFs) involved in tumorigenesis. Our analysis revealed that the connectivity between TFs and their target genes (TGs) tended to be disrupted in the patients who had a high expression of oncogenic CRs or low-expression of tumor-suppressive CRs. As a proof-of-principle study, 14 (82.4%) of the top-ranked 17 driver CRs in liver cancer were able to be validated by literature mining or experiments including shRNA knockdown and dCas9-based epigenetic editing. Moreover, we confirmed that CR SIRT7 physically interacted with TF NFE2L2, and positively modulated the transcriptional program of NFE2L2 by affecting ?64% of its TGs.

"Land-Use Change Alters Host and Vector Communities and May Elevate Disease Risk",2019,"Land-use change has transformed most of the planet. Concurrently, recent outbreaks of various emerging infectious diseases have raised great attention to the health consequences of anthropogenic environmental degradation. Here, we assessed the global impacts of habitat conversion and other land-use changes on community structures of infectious disease hosts and vectors, using a meta-analysis of 37 studies. From 331 pairwise comparisons of disease hosts/vectors in pristine (undisturbed) and disturbed areas, we found a decrease in species diversity but an increase in body size associated with land-use changes, potentially suggesting higher risk of infectious disease transmission in disturbed habitats. Neither host nor vector abundance, however, changed significantly following disturbance. When grouped by subcategories like disturbance type, taxonomic group, pathogen type and region, changes in host/vector community composition varied considerably. Fragmentation and agriculture in particular benefit host and vector communities and therefore might elevate disease risk. Our results indicate that while habitat disturbance could alter disease host/vector communities in ways that exacerbate pathogen prevalence, the relationship is highly context-dependent and influenced by multiple factors. ? 2018, EcoHealth Alliance.",""

"Air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China: Who are faced with a greater effect?",2019,"Background: Whether socioeconomic indicators modify the relationship between air pollution exposure and health outcomes remains uncertain, especially in developing countries. Objective: This work aims to examine modification effects of socioeconomic indicators on the association between PM2.5 and annual incidence rate of lung cancer for males in China. Methods: We performed a nationwide analysis in 295 counties (districts) from 2006 to 2014. Using multivariable linear regression models controlling for weather conditions and socioeconomic indicators, we examined modification effects in the stratified and combined datasets according to the tertile and binary divisions of socioeconomic indicators. We also extensively investigated whether the roles of socioeconomic modifications were sensitive to the further adjustment of demographic factors, health and behaviour covariates, household solid fuel consumption, the different operationalization of socioeconomic indicators and PM2.5 exposure with single and moving average lags. Results: We found a stronger relationship between PM2.5 and incidence rate of male lung cancer in urban areas, in the lower economic or lower education counties (districts). If PM2.5 changes by 10 μg/m3, then the shift in incidence rate relative to its mean was significantly higher by 3.97% (95% CI: 2.18%, 4.96%, p = 0.000) in urban than in rural areas. With regard to economic status, if PM2.5 changes by 10 μg/m3, then the change in incidence rate relative to its mean was significantly lower by 0.99% (95% CI: ?2.18%, 0.20%, p = 0.071) and 1.39% (95% CI: ?2.78%, 0.00%, p = 0.037) in the middle and high economic groups than in the low economic group, respectively. The change in incidence rate relative to its mean was significantly lower by 1.98% (95% CI: ?3.18%, ?0.79%, p = 0.001) and 2.78% (95% CI: ?4.17%, ?1.39%, p = 0.000) in the middle and high education groups compared with the low education group, respectively, if PM2.5 changes by 10 μg/m3. We found no robust modification effects of employment rate and urbanisation growth rate. Conclusion: Male residents in urban areas, in the lower economic or lower education counties are faced with a greater effect of PM2.5 on the incidence rate of lung cancer in China. The findings emphasize the need for public health intervention and urban planning initiatives targeting the urban–rural, educational or economic disparities in health associated with air pollution exposure. Future prediction on air pollution-induced health effects should consider such socioeconomic disparities, especially for the dominant urban–rural disparity in China. ? 2019 The Authors","Air pollution; Biological organs; Developing countries; Diseases; Fuels; Regression analysis; Urban planning; Weather modification; Air pollution exposures; China; Demographic factors; Health interventions; Lung Cancer; Modification effect; Multi-variable linear regression; Socio-economic indicators; Population statistics; fuel; atmospheric pollution; cancer; concentration (composition); health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; socioeconomic indicator; air pollution; Article; behavior; cancer incidence; China; educational status; environmental exposure; health; household; human; lung cancer; male; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; socioeconomics; urban area; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; China; incidence; lung tumor; register; rural population; statistical model; urban population; weather; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Humans; Incidence; Linear Models; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Particulate Matter; Registries; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population; Weather"
"BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic sequence variants in women of African origin or ancestry",2019,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) pathogenic sequence variants (PSVs) confer elevated risks of multiple cancers. However, most BRCA1/2 PSVs reports focus on European ancestry individuals. Knowledge of the PSV distribution in African descent individuals is poorly understood. We undertook a systematic review of the published literature and publicly available databases reporting BRCA1/2 PSVs also accessed the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) database to identify African or African descent individuals. Using these data, we inferred which of the BRCA PSVs were likely to be of African continental origin. Of the 43,817 BRCA1/2 PSV carriers in the CIMBA database, 469 (1%) were of African descent. Additional African descent individuals were identified in public databases (n = 291) and the literature (n = 601). We identified 164 unique BRCA1 and 173 unique BRCA2 PSVs in individuals of African ancestry. Of these, 83 BRCA1 and 91 BRCA2 PSVs are of likely or possible African origin. We observed numerous differences in the distribution of PSV type and function in African origin versus non-African origin PSVs. Research in populations of African ancestry with BRCA1/2 PSVs is needed to provide the information needed for clinical management and decision-making in African descent individuals worldwide. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; African; Article; cancer risk; female; genetic database; genetic risk; genetic screening; genetic variability; human; multiple cancer; pathogenic sequence variant; priority journal; systematic review"

To clarify, we assessed the associations of G6PD deficiency with serum metabolite profiles in late adolescence. Methods: In a nested case-control study of 50 G6PD-deficient late adolescents (~17.5 years) and 150 sex-matched non-G6PD-deficient controls from a Chinese birth cohort: “Children of 1997”, we compared 80 serum metabolites analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry using adjusted linear regression with Bonferroni correction for testing 12 traits (p < 0.0042). Results: G6PD-deficiency was inversely associated with serum levels of total cholesterol (?0.27 mmol, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.46, ?0.09, p = 0.004), free cholesterol (?0.08 mmol, 95% CI ?0.13, ?0.03, p = 0.003) and creatinine (?0.004 mmol, 95% CI ?0.007, ?0.001, p = 0.003), adjusted for sex and parental education. G6PD deficiency was not associated with fatty acids, amino acids, glucose or related metabolites, ketone bodies or glycoprotein. Conclusions: G6PD deficiency is associated with lower serum levels of cholesterol and creatinine, but not other serum metabolites. Whether such differences are transient or become more evident in adulthood warrant further investigations. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","amino acid; cholesterol; creatinine; fatty acid; glucose; glycoprotein; ketone body; adolescent; Article; case control study; Chinese; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; education; female; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Hong Kong; human; linear regression analysis; male; metabolite; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; sex; China; cohort analysis; follow up; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; metabolism; metabolome; physiology; randomization; Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; China; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Humans; Male; Metabolome; Random Allocation"
"A comprehensive service delivery model for preschoolers with special educational needs: Its characteristics and effectiveness",2019,"Background: The compartmentalization between early intervention services and early childhood special education programs is a worldwide phenomenon, which results in the fragmentation of services for preschoolers with special educational needs (SEN). Aims: To address this fragmentation of services, an intervention program in Hong Kong adopted a comprehensive service delivery model with six characteristics: 1) multidisciplinary approach, 2) integration of services across different contexts, 3) multimodal intervention with direct and indirect services, 4) capacity building for systems, 5) inclusive environment, and 6) high program intensity. Methods: The program evaluation was a quasi-experiment with a control group (n = 60) matched to the experimental group (n = 60). Results: At the end of the school year, the experimental group made significant improvement in most measures including cognitive skills, receptive language skills, expressive language skills, gross-motor skills, fine-motor skills, and self-direction skills. School heads in the experimental group also agreed that the program had empowered their teachers and reinforced their school systems. Conclusion: Despite its exploratory nature, the study has shed light on the future directions of services for preschoolers with SEN. The comprehensive service delivery model offers a response to the fragmentation of services and reveals the importance of integration of services across different contexts with multidisciplinary approach. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","article; capacity building; exploratory research; head; health care delivery; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; infant; language; major clinical study; motor performance; program evaluation; teacher; attention deficit disorder; autism; case control study; cognition; developmental disorder; developmental language disorder; early childhood intervention; education; female; language development; male; motor performance; organization and management; preschool child; school; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Developmental Disabilities; Early Intervention (Education); Education, Special; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Language Development; Language Development Disorders; Male; Motor Skills; Program Evaluation; Schools"
"Comparison of influenza disease burden in older populations of Hong Kong and Brisbane: The impact of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination",2019,"Background: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake in the older population aged 65 years or over of Hong Kong dramatically increased since the 2003 SARS outbreak. This study is aimed to evaluate the impact of increased coverage of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines by comparing the change of disease burden in the older population of Hong Kong, with the burden in the older population of Brisbane with relatively high vaccine coverage in the past fifteen years. Methods: Time series segmented regression models were applied to weekly numbers of cause-specific mortality or hospitalization of Hong Kong and Brisbane. Annual excess rates of mortality or hospitalization associated with influenza in the older population were estimated for the pre-SARS (reference period), post-SARS and post-pandemic period, respectively. The rate ratios (RRs) between these periods were also calculated to assess the relative change of disease burden. Results: Compared to the pre-SARS period, excess rates of mortality associated with influenza during the post-SARS period in Hong Kong decreased for cardiorespiratory diseases (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.80, 1.01), stroke (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.50, 1.09), and ischemic heart diseases (RR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.34, 0.58). The corresponding RRs in Brisbane were 0.79 (95% CI 0.54, 1.15), 0.33 (0.13, 0.80), and 1.09 (0.62, 1.90), respectively. Only the mortality of ischemic heart diseases showed a greater reduction in Hong Kong than in Brisbane. During the post-pandemic period, excess rates of all-cause mortality increased in Hong Kong, but to a lesser extent than in Brisbane (RR = 1.41 vs 2.39). Conclusion: A relative decrease (or less of an increase) of influenza disease burden was observed in the older population of Hong Kong after increased coverage of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in this population, as compared to those of Brisbane where vaccination rates remained stable. The lack of significant findings in some disease categories highlights the challenges of evaluating the benefits of vaccination at the population level. ? 2019 The Author(s).","influenza vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; aged; all cause mortality; Article; Australia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical evaluation; controlled study; disease association; disease burden; health impact assessment; Hong Kong; hospital mortality; human; infection risk; influenza; influenza vaccination; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; mortality rate; pandemic; severe acute respiratory syndrome; vaccination coverage; age; comparative study; female; hospitalization; influenza; male; mortality; pandemic; statistics and numerical data; vaccination; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Female; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Male; Pandemics; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Vaccination"

"Periprocedural safety and technical outcomes of the new Silk Vista Baby flow diverter for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms: Results from a multicenter experience",2019,"Purpose The aim of our study was to assess the technical success and the safety of this new low-profile flow diverter Silk Vista Baby (SVB) by evaluating the intraprocedural and periprocedural complication rate. Material/methods Clinical, procedural, and angiographic data were analyzed. Results: 41 consecutive patients (28 women; age average 50.5 years) with 43 aneurysms were treated with SVB. Aneurysm sizes were classified by their maximum diameter, with an average size of 9.5 mm (range 2-30 mm). Thirty-four cases were unruptured. five aneurysms previously ruptured, had recurrence after the initial coiling. There were two ruptured cases. Aneurysms' locations were: M1 segment (five cases), M2 segment (three cases), M3 segment (one case), middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation (six cases), carotid-T (two cases), anterior communicating artery/A1/A2 (11 cases), pericallosal artery (four cases), supraclinoid ICA (two cases), PCom (one case), V4 segment (three cases), PCA (three cases), SCA (one case), and PICA (one case). We had five intraprocedural complications which resolved without clinical consequences and three events postprocedural events. Initial occlusion rates were: eight aneurysms (18.6%) were completely occluded, five aneurysms (11.6%) showed near-complete occlusion, four cases (9.3%) showed incomplete filling, and 26 cases (60.4%) showed persisting filling. The mRS score at discharge from the hospital did not change from the admission mRS score. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the use of the new low-profile flow diverter, SVB device, for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms is feasible and technically safe. ? 2019 Author(s).","acetylsalicylic acid; antibiotic agent; clopidogrel; eptifibatide; milrinone; nimodipine; steroid; ticagrelor; adult; aneurysm rupture; anterior communicating artery aneurysm; artery occlusion; artery perforation; Article; brain angiography; brain artery aneurysm; brain vasospasm; carotid artery aneurysm; carotid artery bifurcation; catheter infection; clinical article; clinical outcome; coil embolization; controlled study; data analysis; Europe; feasibility study; female; headache; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; internal carotid artery; intracranial aneurysm; male; medical device complication; middle aged; multicenter study (topic); patient safety; pericallosal artery aneurysm; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; postoperative complication; priority journal; proximal end stent clotting; Rankin scale; recurrent disease; retrospective study; thromboembolism; adverse device effect; aged; angiography; anterior cerebral artery; artificial embolization; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; endovascular surgery; intracranial aneurysm; middle cerebral artery; multicenter study; perioperative period; procedures; self expandable metallic stent; treatment outcome; trends; Adult; Aged; Angiography; Anterior Cerebral Artery; Embolization, Therapeutic; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Cerebral Artery; Perioperative Care; Retrospective Studies; Self Expandable Metallic Stents; Treatment Outcome"
"Health-related quality of life and health utility of Chinese patients undergoing nocturnal home haemodialysis in comparison with other modes of dialysis",2019,"Background: To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health utility of Chinese patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing nocturnal home haemodialysis (Home HD) against those patients undergoing other modes of dialysis. Methods: Chinese ESRD patients undergoing Home HD were recruited in renal specialist outpatient clinics at three public hospitals in Hong Kong. SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12) was used to measure HRQOL and generate the SF-6D heath utility score. Mean scores of SF-12 domains, physical and mental component summary and SF-6D health utility of 41 patients undergoing Home HD were compared with available scores of patients receiving other forms of dialysis, namely, peritoneal dialysis (PD) (n = 103), hospital in-centre HD (n = 135) or community in-centre HD (n = 118). Adjusted linear regression models were used to examine the impact of mode of dialysis on the HRQOL and health utility scores, accounting for the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Results: ESRD patients undergoing PD and community in-centre HD had better health utility, physical and mental component summary scores than the hospital in-centre HD. Adjusted analysis showed that hospital in-centre HD reported worse physical component summary and health utility scores when compared with PD and community in-centre HD. Conclusion: HRQOL and health utility scores of patients undergoing Home HD were similar to those undergoing PD and community in-centre HD. Better physical aspects of HRQOL and health utility was observed in PD and community-based HD than hospital in-centre HD, providing evidence for the increase in capacity of non-hospital-based HD, which provided flexibility as well as patient centredness and empowerment in Hong Kong. ? 2018 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology","adult; Article; Chinese; clinical article; cohort analysis; community care; controlled study; cross-sectional study; end stage renal disease; female; health care utilization; home dialysis; Hong Kong; hospital care; human; intermethod comparison; male; middle aged; peritoneal dialysis; priority journal; quality of life; Short Form 12; adverse event; aged; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; health status; mental health; pathophysiology; patient-reported outcome; peritoneal dialysis; psychology; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Hemodialysis, Home; Hong Kong; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Peritoneal Dialysis; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome"
"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA):Phenotype, diagnosis, and therapeutic challenges around the world",2019,"Background: X-linked agammaglobulinemia is an inherited immunodeficiency recognized since 1952. In spite of seven decades of experience, there is still a limited understanding of regional differences in presentation and complications. This study was designed by the Primary Immunodeficiencies Committee of the World Allergy Organization to better understand regional needs, challenges and unique patient features. Methods: A survey instrument was designed by the Primary Immunodeficiencies Committee of the World Allergy Organization to collect both structured and semi-structured data on X-linked agammaglobulinemia. The survey was sent to 54 centers around the world chosen on the basis of World Allergy Organization participation and/or registration in the European Society for Immunodeficiencies. There were 40 centers that responded, comprising 32 countries. Results: This study reports on 783 patients from 40 centers around the world. Problems with diagnosis are highlighted by the reported delays in diagnosis>24 months in 34% of patients and the lack of genetic studies in 39% of centers Two infections exhibited regional variation. Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis was seen only in countries with live polio vaccination and two centers reported mycobacteria. High rates of morbidity were reported. Acute and chronic lung diseases accounted for 41% of the deaths. Unusual complications such as inflammatory bowel disease and large granular lymphocyte disease, among others were specifically enumerated, and while individually uncommon, they were collectively seen in 20.3% of patients. These data suggest that a broad range of both inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune conditions can occur in patients. The breadth of complications and lack of data on management subsequently appeared as a significant challenge reported by centers. Survival above 20 years of age was lowest in Africa (22%) and reached above 70% in Australia, Europe and the Americas. Centers were asked to report their challenges and responses (n = 116) emphasized the difficulties in access to immunoglobulin products (16%) and reflected the ongoing need for education of both patients and referring physicians. Conclusions: This is the largest study of patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia and emphasizes the continued morbidity and mortality of XLA despite progress in diagnosis and treatment. It presents a world view of the successes and challenges for patients and physicians alike. A pivotal finding is the need for education of physicians regarding typical symptoms suggesting a possible diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia and sharing of best practices for the less common complications. ? 2019 The Authors",""
"mTORC2-mediated PDHE1α nuclear translocation links EBV-LMP1 reprogrammed glucose metabolism to cancer metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma",2019,"EBV infection of preinvasive nasopharyngeal epithelium is believed to be an initiation step during pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report a novel mechanism driving NPC metastasis through the EBV-encoded LMP1-mediated metabolic reprogramming, via activation of IGF1-mTORC2 signaling and nuclear acetylation of the Snail promoter by the PDHE1α, an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, EBV-LMP1 increases the cellular secretion of IGF1 which promotes phosphorylation of IGF1R to activate mTORC2/AKT signaling linking glucose metabolism to cell motility. LMP1 expression facilitates translocation of mitochondrial PDHE1α into the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner at Ser293 residue. Functionally, nuclear PDHE1α promotes H3K9 acetylation on the Snail promoter to enhance cell motility, thereby driving cancer metastasis. Importantly, the IGF1/mTORC2/PDHE1α/Snail axis correlates significantly with disease progression and poor prognosis in NPC patients. This study highlights the functional importance of IGF1-mTORC2-PDHE1α signaling mediated by EBV-LMP1 in NPC pathogenesis. ? 2019, The Author(s).","glycolytic enzyme; latent membrane protein 1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; protein kinase B; protein PDHE1alpha; somatomedin C; transcription factor Snail; unclassified drug; EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus; glucose; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; matrix protein; pyruvate dehydrogenase; pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit; adult; Akt signaling; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cell motility; cellular secretion; cohort analysis; controlled study; enzyme activation; Epstein Barr virus; female; glucose metabolism; histone acetylation; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; male; metabolic regulation; metastasis; middle aged; mouse; nasopharynx carcinoma; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; Snail gene; animal; cell culture; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; complication; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; metastasis; nasopharynx carcinoma; nasopharynx tumor; nonobese diabetic mouse; nucleocytoplasmic transport; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; protein transport; SCID mouse; virology; virus cell transformation; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Animals; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Viral; Cells, Cultured; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Glucose; Glycolysis; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Male; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, Nude; Mice, SCID; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis; Protein Transport; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide); Signal Transduction; Viral Matrix Proteins"
"The Neuroscience of Nonpharmacological Traditional Chinese Therapy (NTCT) for Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background. Depression is a common disease affecting a large number of people across the world. Many researchers have focused on treatment for depression based on Western scientific approaches, but research based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions, studying its clinical effectiveness and the underlying mechanisms involved, has been limited. The aim of this review is to conduct a pioneering systematic review with meta-analysis of existing studies that investigate the neuroscience basis of nonpharmacological traditional Chinese therapy (NTCT). Methods. Both English (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO) and Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)) databases were searched from inception to October 2018. The effects of NTCT on major depressive disorder, brain activity, and neurophysiological biomarker related outcomes were extracted. Study quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The effect size of each study was reported by the mean difference of change scores. Results. Six of twelve eligible studies showed that there was a significant improvement in favor of acupuncture in depressive symptoms (SMD -0.69, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.28, p=0.002, I2 = 73%, p< 0.0008). Based on the available evidence, NTCT including acupuncture, Qigong, and Tai Chi was found to possibly improve brain metabolites, brain activity, and immune and endocrine systems in patients with major depressive disorder. Conclusions. Acupuncture could effectively relieve depressive syndromes. The clinical effects of acupuncture might be attributable to their influence on three proposed pathways, namely, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the locus coeruleus (LC)-immunity pathway, and the negative feedback loop of the hippocampus. Nevertheless, conclusions are limited due to the small number of studies included and the low-quality of the study designs. In the future, a cross-sectional study is needed to test the proposed plausible pathways. PROSPERO registration number is CRD42017080937. ? 2019 Jiajia Ye et al.","C reactive protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; acupuncture; Chinese medicine; electroencephalogram; endocrine system; functional connectivity; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; immunity; major depression; meta analysis; neurophysiology; neuroscience; qigong; Review; Self-rating Depression Scale; systematic review; Tai Chi"
"Diagnostic consequences of a new category of anxious depression and a reduced duration requirement for anxiety symptoms in the ICD-11 PHC",2019,"Background: A new diagnosis of anxious depression (AD), characterized by both depressive and anxious symptoms at case level, has been proposed for the classification of mental disorders for primary care for ICD-11 (ICD-11 PHC). The ICD-11 PHC proposes a duration requirement for anxiety symptoms of 2 weeks, in line with the requirement for depressive symptoms. This study examined diagnostic assignment under ICD-11 PHC as compared to the previous classification, the ICD-10 PHC, and the relationship of anxiety duration to disability and suicidal ideation. Methods: Primary care physicians in five countries referred patients based on either perceived psychological distress or distressing somatic symptoms to a research assistant who administered a computer-guided diagnostic interview. Complete data were obtained for 2279 participants. Results: Under ICD-11 PHC 47.7% participants received a diagnosis of AD and had greater disability than other diagnostic groups. Under ICD-10 PHC, in addition to meeting requirements for depressive episode, most of these patients met requirements for either generalized anxiety disorder (41.5%) or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (45.4%). One third of individuals diagnosed with AD had anxiety durations between 2 weeks and 3 months and presented as much disability and suicidal ideation as individuals with longer anxiety durations. Limitations: The study was not designed to establish prevalence of these conditions. Conclusion: The proposed ICD-11 PHC encourages early identification and management of significant anxiety symptoms in primary care, particularly when these co-occur with depression. This study provides support for the clinical relevance of these symptoms and the importance of early identification. ? 2018","adult; anxiety; Article; Brazil; China; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; depression; disability; disease duration; distress syndrome; employment status; female; field study; generalized anxiety disorder; human; ICD-10; ICD-11; major clinical study; male; Mexico; mixed anxiety and depression; Pakistan; primary medical care; priority journal; psychiatric diagnosis; suicidal ideation; anxiety disorder; depression; general practitioner; International Classification of Diseases; medically unexplained symptom; middle aged; psychology; young adult; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Male; Medically Unexplained Symptoms; Middle Aged; Physicians, Primary Care; Suicidal Ideation; Young Adult"
"Nosocomial transmission of chickenpox and varicella zoster virus seroprevalence rate amongst healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in China",2019,"Background: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious herpesvirus with potential for nosocomial transmission. However, the importance of nosocomial chickenpox outbreak in China has often been ignored. With the increasing immunocompromised population in China, a thorough review of issues related to nosocomial transmission and the seroprevalence rate of VZV among healthcare workers is necessary. Methods: Retrospective case finding for nosocomial transmission of chickenpox was conducted between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017. Cases were identified based on clinical features compatible with chickenpox. A cross-sectional study on the seroprevalence rate of VZV among healthcare workers (HCWs) was conducted between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2017. The serum VZV antibodies of 1804 HCWs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The seroprevalence rate of VZV antibodies, the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of self-reported history of varicella were analyzed. The economic impact associated with nosocomial transmission of VZV was also assessed. Results: A total of 8 cases of chickenpox were identified in three nosocomial transmissions, including 4 HCWs who were infected nosocomially. The overall seroprevalence rate of VZV was 88.4%, which significantly increased with age (P < 0.01). The seroprevalence rates of HCWs with different genders and occupations showed no statistically significant differences. The positive and negative predictive values of a self-reported history of varicella were 80.8 and 10.6% respectively. An estimation of 163.3 person-days of work were lost in each nosocomial transmission and 86.7 infection control unit person-hours were required for each outbreak investigation. The cost of VZV IgG ELISA screening was estimated to be 83 USD per nosocomial transmission. Conclusions: Nosocomial transmission of VZV occurred repeatedly in the hospital setting. An alarming 11.6% of HCWs were seronegative for VZV, which might increase the risk of nosocomial infection and outbreak for other susceptible co-workers and patients. This is especially important in the setting of a teaching hospital where many immunocompromised patients were managed. Furthermore, the positive predictive value of self-reported varicella on seroprevalence rate in our study was lower than those reported in other countries, therefore serological testing of VZV antibodies with subsequent vaccination for all non-immune HCWs should be considered. ? 2019 The Author(s).","virus antibody; virus antibody; adult; Article; chickenpox; China; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test accuracy study; economic aspect; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gold standard; health care cost; health care personnel; hospital infection; human; immunocompromised patient; infection risk; male; predictive value; retrospective study; screening; sensitivity and specificity; seroprevalence; sex difference; teaching hospital; tertiary care center; Varicella zoster virus; virus transmission; adolescent; blood; chickenpox; cross infection; disease predisposition; epidemic; health care personnel; herpes zoster; immunology; infection control; medical student; middle aged; seroepidemiology; Varicella zoster virus; Adolescent; Adult; Antibodies, Viral; Chickenpox; China; Cross Infection; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Susceptibility; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Health Personnel; Herpesvirus 3, Human; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Students, Medical; Varicella Zoster Virus Infection"
"Global Vascular Guidelines on the Management of Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia",2019,"Guideline Summary: Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is associated with mortality, amputation, and impaired quality of life. These Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are focused on definition, evaluation, and management of CLTI with the goals of improving evidence-based care and highlighting critical research needs. The term CLTI is preferred over critical limb ischemia, as the latter implies threshold values of impaired perfusion rather than a continuum. CLTI is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration >2 weeks duration. Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric oxygen) has not been established. Regenerative medicine approaches (eg, cell, gene therapies) for CLTI should be restricted to rigorously conducted randomizsed clinical trials. The GVG promotes standardization of study designs and end points for clinical trials in CLTI. The importance of multidisciplinary teams and centers of excellence for amputation prevention is stressed as a key health system initiative. ? 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery","carbon dioxide; angiography; ankle brachial index; ankle pressure; anticoagulant therapy; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic limb threatening ischemia; conflict of interest; diet; disease classification; disease severity; exercise; gangrene; human; hypertension; incidence; infection; interpersonal communication; ischemia; leadership; leg amputation; limb amputation; limb ischemia; methodology; mortality risk; organizational policy; physical examination; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; systolic blood pressure; ulcer; ultrasound"
"Effects of ambient benzene and toluene on emergency COPD hospitalizations: A time series study in Hong Kong",2019,"Background: Although numerous studies have demonstrated that the criteria air pollutants increased the risk of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), few have explored the effects of ambient benzene and toluene on COPD. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of ambient benzene and toluene on emergency COPD (eCOPD) hospitalizations. Methods: We obtained daily mean and maximum concentrations of benzene and toluene during April 1, 2011 - December 31, 2014 from the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department, and daily counts of eCOPD hospitalizations from the Hospital Authority. Generalized additive distributed lag models were used to estimate the percentage excess risk (ER%) of eCOPD hospitalizations per interquartile range (IQR) increase in ambient benzene and toluene. Results: The ER% estimates of eCOPD hospitalizations post cumulative exposure of up to two days were 2.62% (95%CI: 0.17% to 5.13%) and 1.42% (0.16% to 2.69%), for per IQR increase of daily mean benzene (1.4 μg/m3) and toluene (4.6 μg/m3), respectively. People below the age of 65 had a significantly higher risk of eCOPD hospitalizations associated with daily maximum toluene than the elderly. Conclusions: Ambient benzene and toluene might be environmental stressors for acute exacerbations of COPD in the Hong Kong population. ? 2018","Benzene; Hospitals; Risk perception; Time series; Toluene; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COPD; Criteria air pollutants; Distributed lag models; Emergency hospitalization; Environmental protection departments; Environmental stressors; Maximum concentrations; Pulmonary diseases; benzene; toluene; benzene; toluene; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; benzene; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; health risk; hospital sector; pollution effect; time series analysis; toluene; age; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; disease exacerbation; emergency care; environmental exposure; female; high risk population; Hong Kong; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; time series analysis; weather; chronic obstructive lung disease; hospitalization; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; China; Hong Kong; Aged; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Toluene"
"Knowledge management, organizational commitment and knowledge-worker performance: The neglected role of knowledge management in the public sector",2019,"Purpose: Knowledge management in the public sector is relatively an ignored avenue of research and practice that has recently been given attention. Knowledge management initiatives in the public sector are now not limited to the developed countries anymore. The public sectors of various developing countries including Pakistan have developed knowledge management functions to address the problems of low organizational commitment (higher turnover rates) and knowledge-workers’ performance. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to examine the mediation role of organizational commitment in the relationship between knowledge management practices and knowledge-worker performance. Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from 341 knowledge workers of the public sector health department of Punjab Province, Pakistan, where knowledge management unit initiative has been taken. It was then analyzed using the structural equation modeling. Findings: Organizational commitment partially mediates the relationship between knowledge management practices and knowledge-work performance. Practical implications: The public sector policy makers are strongly advised to implement knowledge management units and practices in order to enhance knowledge-work performance as well as organizational commitment. Originality/value: First, the model on the mediating role of organizational commitment has never been examined before. Second, the data collection from the public Health Department of Pakistan, a developing country, is relatively rare because the public sector knowledge management studies have mostly been conducted in developed countries. Finally, this study extends the literature on knowledge management in the public sector that is the developing theme in knowledge management discipline while adding knowledge management as a toolkit to enhance knowledge-workers’, organizational commitment and knowledge-work performance. ? 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",""

Serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline and its association with incident diabetes was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional-hazard regression.Participants:Individuals (n 4342) aged 20 years or above (1395 men, 2947 women; mean age 54·3 (sd 16·5) years) from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study, who were free of diabetes at baseline, were included.Results:During 40 124·7 person-years of follow-up (a median of 9·2 years), 443 participants developed diabetes. Mean 25(OH)D was 63·34 (sd 13·07) nmol/l. Age-, sex- and BMI-adjusted Cox proportional-hazard regression showed no significant difference in the risk of incident diabetes between the lowest and the highest quintiles of 25(OH)D. In the analysis of the interaction effect between 25(OH)D and serum Ca, the interaction term did not affect the risk of incident diabetes significantly (P = 0·694). Similarly, there was no significant interaction of different subgroups (age, sex, BMI, femoral-neck T-score, serum Ca levels) with serum 25(OH)D.Conclusions:The present study finds that serum vitamin D level is not associated with the risk of incident diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese and this relationship is not modified by serum Ca level. ?

"Pre-treatment quality of life as a predictor of distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival in patients with head and neck cancer who underwent free flap reconstruction",2019,"Purpose: This study examined the prognostic associations of pre-treatment quality of life (QoL) with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DFMS) among patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) who underwent free flap reconstruction. Methods: A cohort of 127 HNC patients who received free flap reconstruction between November 2010 and June 2014 at a hospital were recruited. Pre-treatment QoL was measured by the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire, which contains six physical domains, including speech, swallowing, appearance, saliva, taste and chewing, as well as the six social-emotional domains of pain, activity, recreation, shoulder, mood, and anxiety. Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: Results showed that pre-treatment QoL was predictive of OS and DMFS. Of the domains, swallowing, chewing, speech, taste, saliva, pain and shoulder were demonstrated to be significant predictors of OS. Additionally, swallowing, chewing, speech, pain and activity were demonstrated making significant contributions to DMFS. Conclusion: Our data supported that physical domains of pre-treatment QoL were predictors for OS and DFMS in HNC patients with free-flap reconstruction. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the prognostic abilities of social-emotional domains. Information on pre-treatment QoL should be taken into account to individualize care plan for these patients, and hence prolong their survival. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; aged; cohort analysis; female; free tissue graft; head and neck tumor; human; male; metastasis; middle aged; preoperative care; prognosis; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reconstructive surgery; survival; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Free Tissue Flaps; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Preoperative Care; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survival"

"Large-eddy simulation of reactive plume dispersion over hypothetical urban areas",2019,"Air pollution poses major threat to premature mortality (Lelieveld, Evans, Fnais, Giannadaki, Pozzer, Nature, 525:367–371, (2015), [8]) but its levels over 80% of cities are unhealthy (WHO: WHOs urban ambient air pollution database - update 2016.

"Suppressor gene GRHL1 is associated with prognosis in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma",2019,"Grainyhead like transcription factor 1 (GRHL1) is among the key family genes encoding transcription factors that serve important roles in inhibiting tumor cell clone growth, proliferation and the progression of embedded tumor cells. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and prognostic value of GRHL1 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). GRHL1 mRNA and protein levels were detected in ESCC cell lines and clinical ESCC tissues. The expression of GRHL1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 266 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ESCC samples with the help of Pearson’s?2 test, and Cox regression analysis was employed in order to distinguish independent prognostic factors. The functional role of GRHL1 in ESCC cell lines was assessed by a lentiviral construct containing overexpressed GRHL1, which was then examined by cell growth and foci formation assays. The expression of GRHL1 was downregulated in the majority of examined ESCC cell lines and clinical tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the low expression of GRHL1 was fundamentally associated with a reduced overall survival rate (log-rank test, P<0.001, hazard ratio, 2.073; 95% confidence interval, 1.491-2.881). Additionally, Cox regression analysis revealed that the low expression of GRHL1, together with poor differentiation, constituted independent prognostic factors for the poor survival of patients with ESCC (P<0.05). The results indicated that the GRHL1-overexpressing cells attenuated the invasive capacity of the ESCC cells in vitro. Accordingly, the low expression of GRHL1 is associated with a reduced OS in ESCC, and the overexpression of GRHL1 inhibited cell invasion in ESCC cells. The results of the present study indicated that GRHL1 may serve as a prognostic marker, in addition to being a novel potential target gene for ESCC. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Increase in incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by serotype 3 in children eight years after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Hong Kong",2019,"This study used several datasets of reported and serotyped invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases to estimate vaccine and non-vaccine type incidence in Hong Kong children. Incidence was analyzed by four time periods to indicate pre-PCV (period 1, 1995–2004), private market only (period 2, 2006–2009), and following early (period 3, 2010–2014, mixed use of 7-, 10- and 13-valent vaccines) and more than five years (period 4, 2015–2017, 13-valent vaccine only) of routine implementation (since September 2009). IPD incidence decreased by 85% and 35% in aged <?2?years and aged 2 to <?5?years, respectively, from period 1 to period 4. This was due to a 97% reduction in the serotypes covered by 7-valent vaccine. In period 4, 59% of the disease was caused by serotype 3 and was largely attributed to an ermB positive, novel ST6011 clone. The finding corroborates an increasing body of evidence that the efficacy of the 13-valent vaccine against infection by this serotype is low. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","erythromycin; immunoglobulin G; penicillin derivative; Pneumococcus vaccine; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; Pneumococcus vaccine; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterium isolate; child; disk diffusion; empyema; erythromycin resistance; human; infant; lung parenchyma; macrolide resistance; meningitis; minimum inhibitory concentration; multilocus sequence typing; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; necrotizing pneumonia; penicillin resistance; pneumococcal infection; serotype; Streptococcus pneumoniae; vaccination; antibiotic resistance; female; genetics; Hong Kong; incidence; male; pneumococcal infection; preschool child; serotype; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Child, Preschool; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Pneumococcal Infections; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Serogroup; Streptococcus pneumoniae"
"Evidence of equine influenza A (H3N8) activity in horses from Eastern and Central Saudi Arabia: 2013–2015",2019,"Background: Equine influenza virus (EIV) is one of the main causes of viral respiratory affections in horses. Little is known about the prevalence of EIV in Saudi Arabia especially the H3N8 serotype. Objectives: To assess prevalence of equine influenza in horse populations in Eastern and Central Saudi Arabia. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We collected 145 sera, 323 nasal and 323 rectal swabs from horses from six major cities in Eastern and Central regions. None of the horses were vaccinated against EIV. Sera were tested in ELISA assays for influenza A type-specific antibodies and by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using equine H3N8. The swabs were tested by RT-qPCR assay targeting a conserved region of the influenza A matrix gene that detects influenza A viruses of all subtypes. Results: None of the swabs had detectable influenza A virus RNA. Of the 145 serasamples tested by ELISA, 81 (55.9%) were positive and 98 (67.6%) of 145 sera tested by HI tests were positive for equine H3. Main limitations: Our failure to detect and sequence any EIV prevents identification of the lineage of virus that circulates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: These results confirm that EIV H3N8 is circulating in Saudi Arabia and should be considered as a possible cause when investigating horses with respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia. ? 2018 EVJ Ltd","animal experiment; Article; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; equine influenza (H3N8); hemagglutination inhibition test; horse; Influenza A virus (H3N8); nonhuman; nose smear; prevalence; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Saudi Arabia; animal; blood; horse disease; Influenza A virus (H3N8); orthomyxovirus infection; seroepidemiology; veterinary medicine; virology; virus antibody; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Horse Diseases; Horses; Influenza A Virus, H3N8 Subtype; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Saudi Arabia; Seroepidemiologic Studies"
"Angiotensin II promotes ovarian cancer spheroid formation and metastasis by upregulation of lipid desaturation and suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress",2019,"Background: Angiotensin II (ANGII) and its receptor (AGTR1) have been proposed as significant contributors to metastasis in multiple cancers. Further, high AGTR1 levels are associated with poor epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) outcomes. However, the mechanistic basis for these effects is unknown. Recent studies have suggested that ovarian cancer metastasis is highly dependent on the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS). To understand the associations between the ANGII/AGTR1 pathway and cancer outcomes, we evaluated the effects of ANGII on MCS formation by ovarian cancer cells and used a proteomic approach to analyze the mechanistic basis. Methods: We used the data from the GENT database and immunohistochemistry staining to assess the AGTR1 expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and to assess its role in cancer progression. Colony formation assay, 3D culture assay, and transwell assays were used to analyze the effect of ANGII on the MCS formation and cell migration. The signaling pathways of AGTR1 and transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation were investigated by the western blotting analysis. Xenograft models were used to determine the role of AGTR1 in ovarian cancer metastasis. ANGII release from ovarian cancer cells and ANGII levels in the EOC ascites fluid were measured by immunoassay. A shotgun proteomic approach was used to explore the detail molecular mechanism. Modulation of lipid desaturation and endoplasmic reticulum stress were verified by the in vitro and in vivo functional assays. Results: AGTR1 expression was negatively correlated with EOC prognosis. AGTR1activation significantly enhanced the MCS formation and cell migration. ANGII triggered both of the classical AGTR1 pathway and the EGFR transactivation. ANGII administration increased peritoneal metastasis. In addition, ovarian cancer cells secreted ANGII and enhanced cancer metastasis in a positive feedback manner. Based on the proteomic data, lipid desaturation was activated by induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which suggests that inhibition of SCD1 may significantly reduce MCS formation by increasing endoplasmic reticulum stress. Conclusions: ANGII promotes MCS formation and peritoneal metastasis of EOC cells. AGTR1 activation increases the lipid desaturation via SCD1 upregulation, which ultimately reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress in MCS. This mechanism explained the association between high levels of AGTR1 and poor clinical outcomes in EOC patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).","angiotensin II; epidermal growth factor receptor; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; AGTR1 protein, human; angiotensin 1 receptor; angiotensin II; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; lipid; SCD1 protein, human; AGTR1 gene; animal experiment; animal model; Article; ascites fluid; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cell migration; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fatty acid desaturation; female; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; oncogene; ovarian cancer cell line; ovary carcinoma; peritoneum metastasis; priority journal; proteomics; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; cell motion; drug screening; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; metastasis; mouse; multicellular spheroid; pathology; peritoneum tumor; prognosis; secondary; Angiotensin II; Animals; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Cell Movement; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; ErbB Receptors; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Prognosis; Proteomics; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1; Spheroids, Cellular; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Development of an oncogenic dedifferentiation SOX signature with prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Background: Gradual loss of terminal differentiation markers and gain of stem cell-like properties is a major hall mark of cancer malignant progression. The stem cell pluripotent transcriptional factor SOX family play critical roles in governing tumor plasticity and lineage specification. This study aims to establish a novel SOX signature to monitor the extent of tumor dedifferentiation and predict prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LIHC project were chronologically divided into the training (n = 188) and testing cohort (n = 189). LIRI-JP project from International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal was used as an independent validation cohort (n = 232). Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox analyses were used to examine the clinical significance and prognostic value of the signature genes. Results: The SOX gene family members were found to be aberrantly expressed in clinical HCC patients. A five-gene SOX signature with prognostic value was established in the training cohort. The SOX signature genes were found to be closely associated with tumor grade and tumor stage. Liver cancer dedifferentiation markers (AFP, CD133, EPCAM, and KRT19) were found to be progressively increased while hepatocyte terminal differentiation markers (ALB, G6PC, CYP3A4, and HNF4A) were progressively decreased from HCC patients with low SOX signature scores to patients with high SOX signature scores. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis further indicated that the newly established SOX signature could robustly predict patient overall survival in both training, testing, and independent validation cohort. Conclusions: An oncogenic dedifferentiation SOX signature presents a great potential in predicting prognostic significance in HCC, and might provide novel biomarkers for precision oncology further in the clinic. ? 2019 The Author(s).","ALB protein; CD133 antigen; cytochrome P450 3A4; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; G6PC protein; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha; KRT19 protein; transcription factor Sox; tumor marker; unclassified drug; transcription factor Sox; tumor marker; Article; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; gene expression; high risk patient; human; human tissue; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; oncological parameters; overall survival; personalized medicine; prediction; process development; risk assessment; RNA sequence; SOX gene; survival analysis; tumor dedifferentiation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; pathology; procedures; prognosis; sequence analysis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Precision Medicine; Prognosis; Sequence Analysis, RNA; SOX Transcription Factors; Survival Analysis"

"Vertical profile of soil/sediment pollution and microbial community change by e-waste recycling operation",2019,"The present study aims to assess the effect of electronic waste (e-waste) recycling on microbial community and the underlying modulation mechanism. Core soil/sediment samples were collected from an abandoned e-waste burning site and neighboring farmland/stream sites in Guiyu, China. High concentrations and health risks of toxic heavy metals, particularly, Sb and Sn, and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), including decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) were mostly retained at the top surface layers of soils/sediments (0–30 cm) after more than one year of natural vertical diffusion and microbe-facilitated biodegradation. Heavy metals, such as Ag, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, and Sn, played a critical role for the reduction of microbial diversity. This is the first study reporting the open burning of e-waste caused an obvious heat effect and enriched thermophilic/mesophilic microbes in local area. The acid washing during e-waste recycling process may result in the enrichment of acidophilic microbes. This investigation showed that e-waste processing operation resulted in not only severe pollution of the soils/sediments by various pollutants, but also reduction of microbial diversity that was difficult to self-store by the local ecosystem. ? 2019","Bacteria; Biodegradation; Electronic equipment; Flame retardants; Halogenation; Health risks; Heavy metals; Incineration; Recycling; Soil pollution; Soils; Wastes; Decabromodiphenyl ethane; Decabromodiphenyl ethers (BDE209); Electronic waste (e waste); Halogenated flame retardant; Microbial communities; Microbial diversity; Toxic heavy metals; Waste-processing operations; Electronic Waste; antimony; cadmium; copper; decabromodiphenyl ethane; decabromodiphenyl ether; flame retardant; halide; heavy metal; lead; polybrominated biphenyl; silver; tin; unclassified drug; bacterial RNA; RNA 16S; concentration (composition); electronic waste; flame retardant; heavy metal; microbial community; recycling; sediment pollution; soil pollution; vertical profile; agricultural land; Article; biodegradation; chemical composition; China; concentration (parameter); content analysis; controlled study; diffusion; e-waste; ecosystem; environmental impact; halogenation; health hazard; heavy metal poisoning; mesophilic bacterium; microbial community; microbial diversity; modulation; nonhuman; physical chemistry; priority journal; recycling; reduction (chemistry); sediment; soil analysis; soil pollution; stream (river); thermophilic bacterium; analysis; drug effect; environmental monitoring; microflora; procedures; recycling; sediment; sequence analysis; soil pollutant; water pollutant; China; Guangdong; Guiyu; China; Electronic Waste; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Microbiota; Recycling; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"Long non-coding RNA NEAT1 confers oncogenic role in triple-negative breast cancer through modulating chemoresistance and cancer stemness",2019,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a malignant subtype of breast cancer with the absence of targeted therapy, resulting in poor prognosis in patients. Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for TNBC; however, development of drug resistance is the main obstacle for successful treatments. In recent years, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in multiple biological functions in various diseases, particularly cancers. Accumulating evidence suggested that lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) expression is dysregulated in many human cancers and thus is a useful prognostic marker for cancer patients. Nevertheless, the mechanism of how NEAT1 confers drug resistance in TNBC is still largely unknown. We performed lncRNA profiling by the LncRNA Profiler qPCR Array Kit in normal control (NC) and breast cancers (BC) blood samples and further validated in a larger cohort of samples by qRT-PCR. Gene expression level and localization were investigated by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Flow cytometric analysis was carried out to detect cancer stem cells. Functional studies were performed both in vitro and in vivo xenograft model. Among 90 lncRNAs, NEAT1 was highly expressed in the blood samples of breast cancer patients than in NC. In particular, the expression of NEAT1 was higher in TNBC tissues than other subgroups. Functional studies revealed that NEAT1 conferred oncogenic role by regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression in TNBC cells. We identified that knockdown of NEAT1 sensitized cells to chemotherapy, indicating the involvement in chemoresistance. Importantly, shNEAT1 reduced stem cell populations such as CD44+/CD24?, ALDH+, and SOX2+, implicating that NEAT1 was closely related to cancer stemness in TNBC. Our data highlighted the roles of NEAT1 chemoresistance and cancer stemness, suggesting that it could be used as a new clinical therapeutic target for treating TNBC patients especially those with drug resistance. ? 2019, The Author(s).","aldehyde dehydrogenase; cisplatin; Hermes antigen; long untranslated RNA; long untranslated RNA NEAT1; paclitaxel; transcription factor Sox2; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer growth; cancer resistance; cancer stem cell; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle progression; cell population; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; female; flow cytometry; gene expression level; human; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; intraductal carcinoma; mammary gland fat; middle aged; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; triple negative breast cancer; Western blotting"
"Hexokinase 2 regulates ovarian cancer cell migration, invasion and stemness via FAK/ERK1/2/MMP9/NANOG/SOX9 signaling cascades",2019,"Metabolic reprogramming is a common phenomenon in cancers. Thus, glycolytic enzymes could be exploited to selectively target cancer cells in cancer therapy. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the first committed step in glucose metabolism. Here, we demonstrated that HK2 was overexpressed in ovarian cancer and displayed significantly higher expression in ascites and metastatic foci. HK2 expression was significantly associated with advanced stage and high-grade cancers, and was an independent prognostic factor. Functionally, knockdown of HK2 in ovarian cancer cell lines and ascites-derived tumor cells hindered lactate production, cell migration and invasion, and cell stemness properties, along with reduced FAK/ERK1/2 activation and metastasis-and stemness-related genes. 2-DG, a glycolysis inhibitor, retarded cell migration and invasion and reduced stemness properties. Inversely, overexpression of HK2 promoted cell migration and invasion through the FAK/ERK1/2/MMP9 pathway, and enhanced stemness properties via the FAK/ERK1/2/NANOG/SOX9 cascade. HK2 abrogation impeded in vivo tumor growth and dissemination. Notably, ovarian cancer-associated fibroblast-derived IL-6 contributed to its up-regulation. In conclusion, HK2, which is regulated by the tumor microenvironment, controls lactate production and contributes to ovarian cancer metastasis and stemness regulation via FAK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway-mediated MMP9/NANOG/SOX9 expression. HK2 could be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

"Sleep duration and risk of diabetes: Observational and Mendelian randomization studies",2019,"Inadequate sleep could contribute to type 2 diabetes, but observational studies are inconsistent and open to biases, particularly from confounding. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to obtain an unconfounded estimate of the effect of sleep duration on diabetes, fasting glucose (FG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and an observation study to assess differences by sex. Using MR, we assessed the effects of genetically instrumented sleep on diabetes, based on 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), applied to the DIAbetes Genetics Replication and meta-analysis case (n = 26,676)-control (n = 132,532) study and on FG and HbA1c, based on 55 SNPs, applied to the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) study of FG (n = 122,743) and HbA1c (n = 123,665). In the population-representative Hong Kong Chinese “Children of 1997” birth cohort we assessed whether associations of sleep duration at ~17.5 years with FG and HbA1c differed by sex. Using inverse variance weighting with multiplicative random effects, sleep duration was not associated with diabetes (odds ratio (OR) 0.85 per hour of sleep, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.13), FG (?0.032 mmol/l per hour of sleep, 95% CI ?0.126 to 0.063) or HbA1c (?0.022% per hour of sleep, 95% CI ?0.069 to 0.024). In “Children of 1997”, the associations of sleep duration with FG differed by sex (p for interaction 0.05) but not with HbA1c. Overall sleep duration does not appear to be related to diabetes, FG or HbA1c, but the possibility of sex differences merits investigation. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","glucose; hemoglobin A1c; Article; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease predisposition; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; Mendelian randomization analysis; observational study; priority journal; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; sleep time"
"Understanding the increase in life expectancy in Hong Kong: Contributions of changes in age- and cause-specific mortality",2019,"To assess the mechanism responsible for the improvement in life expectancy in Hong Kong over the past several decades, Arriaga’s decomposition method was applied to quantify the influence of the age structure and the leading causes of death on the increase in life expectancy in Hong Kong from 1986 to 2015. Our results showed that, during the observed period, the major contribution to the improvement in life expectancy in Hong Kong was attributable to the older population for both males and females. Contributions of malignant neoplasms in the period of 1986– 1995, 1996–2005 and 2006–2015 were 0.613, 0.279 and 0.887 years in males and 0.391, 0.312 and 0.226 years in females, respectively. For circulatory diseases, the corresponding figures were 1.452, 0.202 and 0.832 years in males and 0.675, 0.192 and 1.069 years in females, with the largest contribution also shifting to older ages. However, these positive contributions were partly offset by the negative contribution of pneumonia, especially among those at advanced ages. Furthermore, although the impact was limited, attention should also be paid to the prevalence of some chronic diseases among the younger age groups in recent years. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Air quality impacts of open-plan cooking in tiny substandard homes in Hong Kong",2019,"This study investigated the air quality impacts of open-plan cooking in subdivided units (SDUs), which is a type of substandard housing in Hong Kong. About 210,000 persons (2.9% of the population) currently live in such tiny and poorly ventilated dwellings. With a median floor area of merely 9.3?m2 (100?ft2), most SDUs do not have space for a partitioned kitchen to contain the air pollutants generated by cooking, posing a serious indoor air quality issue that affects all members living in the SDU. The CO, CO2, PM10, PM2.5 and VOC concentrations in seven SDUs were monitored for 72?h to capture the emissions from their routine cooking activities. All SDUs used induction or electric cookers and 32 cooking events were recorded. Under natural ventilation, the mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations during cooking were 36 and 20?μg/m3, which were 136% and 82% higher than the pre-cooking levels respectively. Their mean maximum concentrations reached 1644 and 749?μg/m3 respectively. The mean PM10 concentration exceeded the local guideline (excellent class) by 1.82 times. However, cooking activities did not contribute to substantial changes in CO, CO2 and VOC concentrations. When the air conditioner was turned on to relieve the heat from cooking, it took 90?min for air pollution to return to pre-cooking levels after a cooking event because of poor ventilation, which significantly increased the occupants’ exposure to the cloistered air pollutants. Lacking a partitioned kitchen and effective ventilation in SDUs may pose chronic health threats to their occupants, particularly children. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; cooking appliance; guideline; particulate matter; pollution incidence; public health; ventilation; volatile organic compound"
"Gastrointestinal infection-related disseminated intravascular coagulation mimicking Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome - implications of classical clinical indexes in making the diagnosis: A case report and literature review",2019,"BACKGROUND Thrombocytopenia associated with acute kidney injury is a challenging disorder. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a potentially life- or organ-threatening syndrome that can be induced by several disorders or medical interventions. There is overlap between the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and to a lesser extent, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We describe a case to illustrate the potential diagnostic difficulty, especially at initial presentation. CASE SUMMARY We reported a case of a 44-year-old woman that presented with diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and acute kidney injury. While the clinical presentation resembled that of Shiga toxin-induced HUS, the disease course was more consistent with gastrointestinal infection-related DIC. To aid in the accurate diagnosis of TMA and other associated disorders, we have undertaken a review and provided a clear interpretation of some typical biomarkers including schistocytes, LDH and platelet count, coagulation profile and more specific indexes of ADAMTS13, complement profile, and the isolation of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli CONCLUSION The use and correct interpretation of classical indexes of schistocyte, LDH, and platelet count is vital in diagnosing TMA and associated disorders. Understanding the characteristics of these biomarkers in the context of thrombocytopenia purpura, HUS and DIC will facilitate the accurate diagnosis and early initiation of appropriate treatment. ?

"SMRT sequencing revealed the diversity and characteristics of defective interfering RNAs in influenza A (H7N9) virus infection",2019,"Influenza defective interfering (DI) particles are replication-incompetent viruses carrying large internal deletion in the genome. The loss of essential genetic information causes abortive viral replication, which can be rescued by co-infection with a helper virus that possesses an intact genome. Despite reports of DI particles present in seasonal influenza A H1N1 infections, their existence in human infections by the avian influenza A viruses, such as H7N9, has not been studied. Here we report the ubiquitous presence of DI-RNAs in nasopharyngeal aspirates of H7N9-infected patients. Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing was first applied and long-read sequencing analysis showed that a variety of H7N9 DI-RNA species were present in the patient samples and human bronchial epithelial cells. In several abundantly expressed DI-RNA species, long overlapping sequences have been identified around at the breakpoint region and the other side of deleted region. Influenza DI-RNA is known as a defective viral RNA with single large internal deletion. Beneficial to the long-read property of SMRT sequencing, double and triple internal deletions were identified in half of the DI-RNA species. In addition, we examined the expression of DI-RNAs in mice infected with sublethal dose of H7N9 virus at different time points. Interestingly, DI-RNAs were abundantly expressed as early as day 2 post-infection. Taken together, we reveal the diversity and characteristics of DI-RNAs found in H7N9-infected patients, cells and animals. Further investigations on this overwhelming generation of DI-RNA may provide important insights into the understanding of H7N9 viral replication and pathogenesis. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Pancreatic fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against type 2 diabetes in mice by promoting insulin expression and secretion in a PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent manner",2019,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is important in glucose, lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, it remains unknown whether FGF21 is involved in insulin expression and secretion that are dysregulated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we found that FGF21 was down-regulated in pancreatic islets of db/db mice, a mouse model of T2DM, along with decreased insulin expression, suggesting the possible involvement of FGF21 in maintaining insulin homeostasis and islet β-cell function. Importantly, FGF21 knockout exacerbated palmitate-induced islet β-cell failure and suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Pancreatic FGF21 overexpression significantly increased insulin expression, enhanced GSIS, improved islet morphology and reduced β-cell apoptosis in db/db mice. Mechanistically, FGF21 promoted expression of insulin gene transcription factors and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, the major regulators of insulin secretion, as well as activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in islets of db/db mice. In addition, pharmaceutical inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling effectively suppressed FGF21-induced expression of insulin gene transcription factors and SNARE proteins, suggesting an essential role of PI3K/Akt signaling in FGF21-induced insulin expression and secretion. Taken together, our results demonstrate a protective role of pancreatic FGF21 in T2DM mice through inducing PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent insulin expression and secretion. ? 2018 The Authors.

"microRNA-23a in human cancer: Its roles, mechanisms and therapeutic relevance",2019,"microRNA-23a (miR-23a) is one of the most extensively studied miRNAs in different types of human cancer, and plays various roles in the initiation, progression, and treatment of tumors. Here, we comprehensively summarize and discuss the recent findings about the role of miR-23a in cancer. The differential expression of tissue miR-23a was reported, potentially indicating cancer stages, angiogenesis, and metastasis. miR-23a in human biofluid, such as plasma and salivary fluid, may be a sensitive and specific marker for early diagnosis of cancer. Tissue and circulating miR-23a serves as a prognostic factor for cancer patient survival, as well as a predictive factor for response to anti-tumor treatment. The direct and indirect regulation of miR-23a on multiple gene expression and signaling transduction mediates carcinogenesis, tumor proliferation, survival, cell migration and invasion, as well as the response to anti-tumor treatment. Tumor cell-derived miR-23a regulates the microenvironment of human cancer through manipulating both immune function and tumor vascular development. Several transcriptional and epigenetic factors may contribute to the dysregulation of miR-23a in cancer. This evidence highlights the essential role of miR-23a in the application of cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. ? 2018 by the authors.

"Induction of Oxidative Stress Through Inhibition of Thioredoxin Reductase 1 Is an Effective Therapeutic Approach for Hepatocellular Carcinoma",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent and lethal cancers worldwide which lacks effective treatment. Cancer cells experience high levels of oxidative stress due to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased antioxidant-producing capacity is therefore found in cancer cells to counteract oxidative stress. The thioredoxin system is a ubiquitous mammalian antioxidant system which scavenges ROS, and we demonstrate that it is vital for HCC growth as it maintains intracellular reduction-oxidation (redox) homeostasis. Transcriptome sequencing in human HCC samples revealed significant overexpression of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), the cytosolic subunit and key enzyme of the thioredoxin system, with significant correlations to poorer clinicopathological features and patient survival. Driven by the transcriptional activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)–like 2, the master protector against oxidative stress, TXNRD1 counteracts intracellular ROS produced in human HCC. Inhibition of TXNRD1 through genetic inhibition hindered the proliferation of HCC cells and induced apoptosis in vitro. Administration of the pharmacological TXNRD1 inhibitor auranofin (AUR) effectively suppressed the growth of HCC tumors induced using the hydrodynamic tail vein injection and orthotopic implantation models in vivo. Furthermore, AUR sensitized HCC cells toward the conventional therapeutic sorafenib. Conclusion: Our study highlights the reliance of HCC cells on antioxidants for redox homeostasis and growth advantage; targeting TXNRD1 resulted in dramatic accumulation of ROS, which was found to be an effective approach for the suppression of HCC tumor growth. ? 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","auranofin; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; nuclear factor; reactive oxygen metabolite; sorafenib; thioredoxin reductase 1; transcriptome; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; human; human cell; hydrodynamics; implantation; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; transcription initiation; tumor growth"
"Design, synthesis and antitumour and anti-angiogenesis evaluation of 22 moscatilin derivatives",2019,"Two series of moscatilin derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis agents. Most of these compounds showed moderate-to-obvious cytotoxicity against five cancer cell lines (A549, HepG2, MDA-MB-231, MKN-45, HCT116). Among these cell lines, compounds had obvious effects on HCT116. Especially for 8Ae, the IC50 was low to 0.25 μM. 8Ae can inhibit the viability and induce the apoptosis of HCT116 cells but exhibit no cytotoxic activity in noncancerous NCM460 colon cells. 8Ae can also arrest the G2/M cell cycle in HCT116 cells by inhibiting the α-tubulin expression. Zebrafish bioassay-guided screen showed the 22 moscatilin derivatives had potent anti-angiogenic activities and compound 8Ae had better activities than positive compound. Molecular docking indicated 8Ae interacted with tubulin at the affinity of ?7.2 Kcal/mol. In conclusion, compound 8Ae was a potential antitumor and anti-angiogenesis candidate for further development. ? 2019","1,2 dimethoxy 4 (4 nitrophenethyl)benzene; 1,2 dimethoxy 4 phenethylbenzene; 2 (3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl)pyridine; 2, 6 dimethoxy 4 [2 (pyridin 2 yl)ethyl]phenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 (2 methoxyphenethyl)phenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 (4 nitrophenethyl)phenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 phenethylphenol; 2,6 dimethoxy 4 [2 (pyridin 4 yl)ethyl]phenol; 4 (2 chlorophenethyl) 1,2 dimethoxybenzene; 4 (2 chlorophenethyl) 2, 6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2 chlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2 fluorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2,3 dichlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (2,4 dichlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (3 fluorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (3,4 dichlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl) 2 methoxyphenol; 4 (4 bromophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (4 chlorophenethyl) 1,2 dimethoxybenzene; 4 (4 chlorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (4 fluorophenethyl) 1,2 dimethoxybenzene; 4 (4 fluorophenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 4 (4 hydroxy 3 methoxyphenethyl) 2,6 dimethoxyphenol; 5 (3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl) 2 methoxyphenol; alpha tubulin; angiogenesis inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; moscatilin derivative; semaxanib; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; antiangiogenic activity; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; binding affinity; cancer inhibition; cell viability; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug design; drug potency; drug protein binding; drug screening; drug synthesis; effective dose (pharmacology); G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; HCT 116 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; MDA-MB-231 cell line; MKN45 cell line; molecular docking; NCM460 cell line; protein expression"
"Presentation and outcomes of patients with thoracic and lumbosacral spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background and purpose Thoracolumbar and sacral spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas (SEDAVFs) are an increasingly recognized form of spinal vascular malformation. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the demographics, clinical presentation and treatment results of thoracolumbar SEDAVFs. Materials and methods Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched from January 2000 to January 2018 for articles on treatment of SEDAVFs. Pooled data of individual patients were analyzed for demographic and clinical features of SEDAVFs as well as treatment outcomes. Results There were 125 patients from 11 studies included. Mean age was 63.5 years. There was a male sex predilection (69.6%). Sensory symptoms including pain or numbness were the most frequently presenting symptoms. Fistula location was the lumbosacral spine in 79.2% and the thoracic spine in 20.8%. Involvement of intradural venous drainage was more common than extradural venous drainage only (89.6% vs 10.4%). Of the 123 treated patients, endovascular therapy was performed in 67.5% of patients, microsurgery in 23.6%, and combined treatment in 8.9%. The overall complete obliteration rate was 83.5% and did not differ between groups. Clinical symptoms improved in 70.7% of patients, were stable in 25%, and worsened in 1.7% with no difference between treatment modalities. Conclusions Thoracic and lumbosacral SEDAVFs often present with symptoms secondary to congestive myelopathy or compressive symptoms. Both endovascular and microsurgical treatments were associated with high obliteration rates and good clinical outcomes. ? ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

"All-cause pneumonia in children after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines in the United Kingdom: A population-based study",2019,"Purpose: To explore the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in preventing childhood pneumonia in the United Kingdom. Methods: We carried out a population-based study to assess the trend of all-cause pneumonia in children aged under 10?years between 2002 and 2012. Data were obtained from the IMS Disease Analyser, a primary care database in the United Kingdom. Three time periods were defined to estimate monthly incidence: pre-PCV7 (January 2002 to August 2006), post-PCV7 (September 2006 to March 2010), and post-PCV13 (April 2010 to December 2012). Interrupted time series analysis (ITS) was performed to assess any immediate change or gradual change in the monthly incidence of pneumonia between prevaccination and postvaccination introduction. Results: A total of 4228 children with at least one all-cause pneumonia episode were identified. The overall annual incidence rate of all-cause pneumonia declined by 37% from 3.8 episodes/1000 person-years in 2002 to 2.4 episodes/1000 person-years in 2012. Results of ITS analyses indicated that the incidence did not decline immediately after the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13. The incidence declined gradually in children aged under 2?years (IRR?=?0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99) post PCV7 and levelled off during post PCV13 (IRR?=?1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02). No significant changes in incidence trend was observed in children aged 2 to 4?years (IRR?=?0.86; 95% CI, 0.68-1.07) and 5 to 9?years (IRR?=?0.92; 95% CI, 0.73-1.15) after PCV13 introduction. Conclusions: In the United Kingdom, the incidence of all-cause pneumonia in children under 2?years declined after the introduction of PCV7 and levelled off in the first 2?years of introduction of PCV13. Continual monitoring is warranted to assess the population impact of PCV13 in preventing childhood pneumonia in the long term. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",""
"Superimposed surface plasma resonance effect enhanced the near-infrared photocatalytic activity of Au@Bi2WO6 coating for rapid bacterial killing",2019,"Bacterial infection has become a serious public health challenge because the misuse of antibiotics worldwide has induced bacterial resistance and superbug occurrences, that is, no suitable antibiotics are available. Herein, we design a new infrared photocatalytic system on titanium (Ti) substrates, and it consists of gold (Au) nanorod-decorated bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) nanosheets (Au@Bi2WO6). The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect induced by near infrared (NIR) facilitates partial photo-induced electron transfer between Au and Bi2WO6, resulting in accelerated charge transmission and consequently hindering electron–hole recombination, which imparts high photocatalytic property to the coating. In addition, the superimposed SPR from both Au and Bi2WO6 can improve the photothermal effect of Au@Bi2WO6. As a result, when irradiated with 808 nm NIR for 15 min, this hybrid coating exhibits a superior antibacterial efficiency of 99.96% and 99.62% against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, due to the synergistic effects of high yield of radical oxygen species and hyperthermia; this efficiency cannot be achieved by either Au-Ti or Bi2WO6-Ti alone. This platform exhibits a great potential for noninvasive disinfection without using antibiotics. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antibiotics; Binary alloys; Coatings; Efficiency; Electron resonance; Escherichia coli; Free radical reactions; Gold; Infrared devices; Nanorods; Photocatalytic activity; Plasmons; Titanium alloys; Tungsten compounds; Antibacterial; Photo-catalytic; Photo-induced electron transfer; Photocatalytic property; Photocatalytic systems; Radical oxygen species; Surface plasma resonances; Two-dimensional materials; Surface plasmon resonance; bismuth; gold nanorod; nanosheet; reactive oxygen metabolite; titanium; antibiotics; antimicrobial activity; bacterium; catalysis; catalyst; inorganic compound; microbial activity; near infrared; plasma; two-dimensional modeling; Article; bactericidal activity; electron transport; Escherichia coli; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; photocatalysis; Staphylococcus aureus; surface plasmon resonance; synergistic effect; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus aureus"
"Anti-spike IgG causes severe acute lung injury by skewing macrophage responses during acute SARS-CoV infection",2019,"Newly emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoVs (MERS-CoV), and H7N9, cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through mechanisms that remain elusive. In SARS-CoV/macaque models, we determined that anti-spike IgG (S-IgG), in productively infected lungs, causes severe ALI by skewing inflammation-resolving response. Alveolar macrophages underwent functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. The presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, however, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. Critically, patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses. Their sera enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of FcγR reduced such effects. Our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI, define a pathological consequence of viral specific antibody response, and provide a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV or other virus-mediated lung injury.",""
"Outcomes of long-term follow-up of asymptomatic renal stones and prediction of stone-related events",2019,"Objectives: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing observation of asymptomatic renal calculi and identify factors associated with stone-related events. Patients and Methods: Patients with asymptomatic renal calculi electing active surveillance of their stones were retrospectively reviewed. Patients underwent annual ultrasonography and clinical visits with standardised questions regarding the development of symptoms or complications from calculi. Spontaneous stone passage, stone growth, development of stone-related symptoms, and requirement for intervention during follow-up were deemed as stone-related events. Results: Between 2007 and 2017, 293 patients were reviewed to evaluate the natural history of asymptomatic renal calculi. The mean follow-up was 4.2 years. Overall incidences of spontaneous passage, stone growth, development of stone-related symptoms, and requirement of intervention were 32.1%, 16.7%, 28.3% and 12.3%, respectively. Stones >5 mm and lower pole stones were significantly less likely to pass spontaneously. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperuricaemia or non-lower calyceal stone were more likely to experience stone growth. Stones >5 mm or non-lower pole stones were more likely to become symptomatic. Significant predictors of surgical intervention were stone size (>5 mm) and patients' age (>60 years). Primary therapy was extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in 33 patients and flexible ureteroscopy in three. Conclusion: The natural history of asymptomatic renal stones rarely requires intervention, although they do have a slightly higher rate of symptomatic events and growth over the intermediate term. In particular, patients with stones >5 mm, DM, hyperuricaemia, or non-lower calyceal stones are at higher risk of developing stone-related events, and should therefore be recommended for regular follow-up. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International ? 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; age; Article; asymptomatic disease; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; echography; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; female; follow up; human; hyperuricemia; incidence; major clinical study; male; nephrolithiasis; observational study; outcome assessment; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; ureteroscopy; urologic surgery; asymptomatic disease; diagnostic imaging; echography; follow up; lithotripsy; middle aged; nephrolithiasis; pathophysiology; prognosis; time factor; watchful waiting; Adult; Asymptomatic Diseases; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Lithotripsy; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Ultrasonography; Watchful Waiting"

"The Paradox for Chem-Fun and Gay Men: A Neoliberal Analysis of Drugs and HIV/AIDS Policies in Hong Kong",2019,"Globally, there has been increasing public health and scholarly interest in chemsex, where the consumption of drugs is related to enhancing sexual pleasure, often in a group context, particularly among gay men or men who have sex with other men (MSM). Since the early 2000s, Hong Kong has witnessed the growth of a chemsex scene. In recent years, HIV/AIDs surveillance reports indicate that chemsex goers have contributed to the rise of HIV infections among MSM, and with increasing pressure from frontline workers, the government has recently acknowledged that this is an emerging issue. Drawing on neoliberalism as a policy framework, ideology, and mode of government, this article traces the adoption of neoliberal discourses of harm reduction in HIV/AIDS and drug policies in Hong Kong. We argue that this emergent issue is the result of two divergent policy orientations, thereby leading to a critical health service gap. This article examines the intersection between HIV/AIDS and drug policies in a particular cultural context to underscore health policy gaps and extend our understanding of the construction of neoliberal subjects in health policies beyond the West. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",""

"A Systematic Review of Potential Therapeutic Use of Lycium Barbarum Polysaccharides in Disease",2019,"Objective. To evaluate the effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases of different etiologies and systems. Methods. We performed an Entrez PubMed literature search using keywords ""lycium"", ""barbarum"", ""polysaccharides"", ""anti-fibrotic"", ""anti-apoptotic"", ""anti-oxidizing"", ""anti-aging"", ""neuroprotection"", ""metabolism"", ""diabetes"", ""hyperlipidemia"", ""neuroprotection"", and ""immunomodulation"" on the 14th of August 2018, resulting in 207 papers, of which 20 were chosen after filtering for 'English language' and 'published within 10 years' as well as curation for relevance by the authors. Results. The 20 selected papers included 2 randomized control trials (1 double-blinded RCT and 1 double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT), 11 in vivo studies, 5 in vitro studies, 1 study with both in vivo and in vitro results, and 1 chemical study. There is good evidence from existing studies on the antifibrotic, antioxidizing, neuroprotective, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides. However, there is a need for further studies in the form of large-scale clinical trials to support its use in humans. There is also significant potential for LBP as a safe and effective topical treatment in ocular surface diseases, owing to promising in vitro results and a lack of demonstrated toxic effects to corneal epithelial cells. Conclusion. Results from existing studies suggest that LBP is a promising therapeutic agent, particularly in the management of liver disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. One major limitation of current research is a lack of standardization and quality control for the LBP used. The availability of research-grade LBP will inevitably promote future research in this field worldwide. ? 2019 Sum Sum Kwok et al.","placebo; polysaccharide; antineoplastic agent; herbaceous agent; lycium barbarum polysaccharide; neuroprotective agent; antiaging activity; antifibrotic activity; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; breast cancer; colon cancer; cornea; diabetes mellitus; drug effect; drug potency; drug safety; human; hyperlipidemia; immunomodulation; in vitro study; in vivo study; Lycium barbarum; Medline; metabolism; neuroprotection; nonhuman; ocular surface disease; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; topical treatment; uterine cervix cancer; animal; diseases; translational research; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Disease; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Neuroprotective Agents; Translational Medical Research"
"Development and Validation of a Filial Piety Scale for Chinese Elders in Contemporary China",2020,"This study was designed to validate the newly developed Filial Piety Scale for Chinese Elders (FPSCE) in measuring elders’ filial norms in contemporary China by administering questionnaire survey with 521 elders aged 70 years and older in Beijing, China. Validity and reliability tests were applied. Through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, a conceptually meaningful three-factor model with 12 items was obtained, consisting of “caring for parents,” “familial entirety,” and “familial aspiration.” The FPSCE showed good internal consistency, satisfactory discriminant validity, criterion-related validity, and significant correlations for some variables related to demographic characteristics, health status, and financial condition. The construction of the FPSCE indicates that elders’ understanding of filial piety and their expectation of their children may have changed. The FPSCE shows that contemporary elders in China hold less authoritative but more reciprocal stances toward filial piety. The FPSCE can be used to advance the contextualized understanding of filial piety in contemporary Chinese societies, to help facilitate the development of family-friendly policies in aging societies, and to meet the challenges associated with an accelerating aging population. ?

In this study, flow cytometry analysis revealed an abundant CD71+ subpopulation in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cervical cancer cells, while limited CD71+ cells were detected in HPV-negative cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the HPV-E6 protein in HPV-negative C33A cells enriched the CD71+subpopulation. The CD71+ subpopulation isolated from the C33A cell line and an HPV-E6-overexpressing clone exhibited enhanced transforming ability, proliferation, and resistance to irradiation. In contrast, suppression of CD71 in HPV-positive SiHa cells and the HPV-E6-overexpressing stable clone inhibited spheroid formation and in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity and sensitized cells to irradiation treatment. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of CD71 in SiHa cells also produced similar inhibitory effects on tumorigenicity. Double knockout of CD71 and CD55 reversed the oncogenic properties of the HPV-E6-overexpressing clone. These findings suggest that the HPV-E6 protein enriches the subpopulation of CD71+cells in cervical cancer, which exhibit cancer stem-like cell properties and are resistant to irradiation treatment. Targeting the CD71+ subpopulation in cervical cancer cells with siRNAs or CRISPR/ Cas9 may provide new insights for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for treating cervical cancer. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","CD133 antigen; CD71 antigen; decay accelerating factor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; Hermes antigen; hpv e6 protein; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; stem cell factor receptor; unclassified drug; viral protein; animal experiment; animal model; Article; C-33 A cell line; cancer cell; cancer tissue; carcinogenicity; cell proliferation; cell self-renewal; controlled study; ectopic expression; female; flow cytometry; gene knockdown; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; population size; priority journal; protein expression; radiosensitivity; SiHa cell line; staining; uterine cervix cancer; Western blotting"
"Evidence for Cerebral Embolic Prevention in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair",2019,"Background: Embolic stroke is a formidable complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Mechanical strategies to reduce the risk of ischemic embolic lesions include embolic protection devices (EPDs) and carbon dioxide flushing (CDF). This study aims to assess the efficacy for EPD and CDF uses in TAVI and TEVAR. Methods: A literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis. All searches were performed via PubMed, OvidSP, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library. Conference abstracts and proceedings were included. Those that were out of scope of interest and review articles were excluded. Results: Eighteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the 456 articles searched. Regarding EPD use in TAVI, systematic review comparing EPD with no-EPD showed smaller total volume of cerebral lesions and smaller volume per lesion in patients with EPD in all studies. They also performed better in postoperative neurocognitive assessments but could not demonstrate clinical prevention of embolic stroke in all studies. While for EPD use in TEVAR, capture of embolic debris and absence of early postoperative neurocognitive deficit were demonstrated in all cases of 2 prospective pilot studies. Concerning CDF in TEVAR, significant reduction in gaseous emboli released during stent-graft deployment was shown by 1 in vitro study. Successful CDF application in all patients, with only 1 case of postoperative nondisabling stroke, was also demonstrated by 1 cohort study. Conclusions: This systematic review of medical literature has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of EPD use in TAVI. Although improvements in clinical outcomes have yet been demonstrated, there was level I evidence showing reduced embolic lesions in imaging. The use of EPD and CDF in TEVAR was suggested, but evidence remained inadequate to support routine clinical use. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","aortic arch; aortic dissection; brain damage; brain embolism; carbon dioxide flushing; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; cognition assessment; diffusion weighted imaging; embolism prevention; endovascular aneurysm repair; heart infarction; human; lesion volume; medical procedures; middle cerebral artery; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neuroimaging; postoperative period; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; thoracoabdominal aorta aneurysm; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; transient ischemic attack; aortic valve; blood vessel transplantation; brain embolism; devices; diagnostic imaging; embolic protection device; genetics; pathophysiology; risk factor; surgery; thoracic aorta; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; treatment outcome; vascular surgery; Aorta, Thoracic; Aortic Valve; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Embolic Protection Devices; Humans; Intracranial Embolism; Risk Factors; Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Surgical Procedures"
"Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction risk score for secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in a real-world cohort of post-acute myocardial infarction patients",2019,"Background: Patients who survive myocardial infarction (MI) are at risk of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events. This study stratified post-MI patients for risk of recurrent CV events using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS 2°P). Methods and Results: This was an observational study that applied TRS 2°P to a consecutive cohort of post-MI patients. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal ischemic stroke. A total of 1,688 post-MI patients (70.3±13.6 years; male, 63.1%) were enrolled. After a mean follow-up of 41.5±34.4 months, 405 patients (24.0%) had developed a primary outcome (9.3%/year) consisting of 278 CV deaths, 134 non-fatal MI, and 33 non-fatal strokes. TRS 2°P was strongly associated with the primary outcome. The annual incidence of primary composite endpoint for patients with TRS 2°P 0 was 1.0%, and increased progressively to 39.9% for those with TRS 2°P ?6 (HR, 27.6; 95% CI: 9.87-77.39, P<0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity of TRS 2°P for the primary composite endpoint was 76.3% (95% CI: 72.1-80.5%). Similar associations were also observed between TRS 2°P and CV death and non-fatal MI, but not non-fatal ischemic stroke. Conclusions: TRS 2°P reliably stratified post-MI patients for risk of future CV events. ? 2019, Japanese Circulation Society.

"Indirect effects of body mass index growth on glucose dysregulation via inflammation: Causal moderated mediation analysis",2019,"Objective: No existing studies have examined the mediating role of chronic inflammation between obesity and dysregulated glucose homeostasis in adolescent samples. This study evaluated whether C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation biomarker, mediated the effects of growth (annual increase) in body mass index (BMI) on glycated hemoglobin (HbA). Methods: BMI and biomarker data were used from wave I to wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health study; 4,545 adolescents; mean age = 14.9 years; 55.7% female) with valid CRP data. A causal moderated mediation analysis evaluated the direct and indirect effects of BMI slope on HbA via CRP across gender, with demographic and clinical characteristics as model covariates. Results: The participants displayed a linear BMI growth of 0.53-0.58 kg/m2/year throughout adolescence, with substantial interindividual variation. The BMI slope showed positive direct and indirect effects on HbA via CRP across gender, and there was a significant exposure-mediator interaction effect. A standardized increase in the BMI slope raised the probability of an abnormal HbA value by 6.0-8.5% in participants with various profiles. The total natural indirect effect accounted for 13.3-15.9% of the total effect in males and 21.2-22.7% in females. Conclusions: The findings provide support for the inflammation mechanism in the effects of adiposity on glucose homeostasis. In adolescents, excess BMI growth was linked with a higher risk of glucose dysregulation either directly or indirectly via chronic inflammation. ? 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

"Characterizing spatiotemporal dynamics of anthropogenic heat fluxes: A 20-year case study in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region in China",2019,"Rapid urbanization, which is closely related to economic growth, human health, and micro-climate, has resulted in a considerable amount of anthropogenic heat emissions. The lack of estimation data on long-term anthropogenic heat emissions is a great concern in climate and urban flux research. This study estimated the annual average anthropogenic heat fluxes (AHFs) in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region in China between 1995 and 2015 on the basis of multisource remote sensing images and ancillary data. Anthropogenic heat emissions from different sources (e.g., industries, buildings, transportation, and human metabolism) were also estimated to analyze the composition of AHFs. The spatiotemporal dynamics of long-term AHFs with high spatial resolution (500 m) were estimated by using a refined AHF model and then analyzed using trend and standard deviation ellipse analyses. Results showed that values in the region increased significantly from 0.15 W· m?2 in 1995 to 1.46 W· m?2 in 2015. Heat emissions from industries, transportation, buildings, and human metabolism accounted for 64.1%, 17.0%, 15.5%, and 3.4% of the total anthropogenic heat emissions, respectively. Industrial energy consumption was the dominant contributor to the anthropogenic heat emissions in the region. During this period, industrial heat emissions presented an unstable variation but showed a growing trend overall. Heat emissions from buildings increased steadily. Spatial distribution was extended with an increasing tendency of the difference between the maximum and the minimum and was generally dominated by the northeast–southwest directional pattern. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns and trends of AHFs could provide vital support on management decision in city planning and environmental monitoring. ? 2019 Elsevier LtdThe characteristics of spatiotemporal dynamics of anthropogenic heat flux are conducive for providing holistic information related to urban heat island study and vital support on management decision in city planning and environmental monitoring for policy makers. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decision making; Dynamics; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Industrial emissions; Metabolism; Planning; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Anthropogenic heat; Human activities; Mitigation; Night-time lights; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Thermal environment monitoring; Heat flux; anthropogenic effect; energy use; environmental monitoring; heat flux; heat island; human activity; remote sensing; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; article; China; city planning; controlled study; energy consumption; environmental monitoring; heat; human; remote sensing; China; city; environmental monitoring; human activities; industry; procedures; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Human Activities; Humans; Industry; Remote Sensing Technology; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Urbanization"
"Direct Detection of Pyrazinamide Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Use of pncA PCR Sequencing",2019,"An in-house-developed pncA sequencing assay for analysis of pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance was evaluated using 162 archived Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates with phenotypic PZA susceptibility profiles that were well defined by analysis of Bactec MGIT 960 PZA kit and PZase activity data. Preliminary results showed 100% concordance between pncA sequencing and phenotypic PZA drug susceptibility test (DST) results among archived isolates. Also, 637 respiratory specimens were prospectively collected, and 158 were reported as MTBC positive by the Abbott Realtime MTB assay (96.3% sensitivity [95% confidence interval {CI}: 92.2% to 98.7%]; 100% specificity [95% CI: 99.2% to 100.0%]). Genotypic and phenotypic PZA resistance profiles of these 158 MTBC-positive specimens were analyzed by pncA sequencing and Bactec MGIT 960 PZA kit, respectively. For analysis of PZA resistance, pncA sequencing detected pncA mutations in 5/5 (100%) phenotypic PZA-resistant respiratory specimens within 4 working days. No pncA mutations were detected among PZA-susceptible specimens. Combining archived isolates with prospective specimens, 27 were identified as phenotypic PZA resistant with pncA mutation. Among these 27 samples, 6/27 (22.2%) phenotypic PZA-resistant strains carried novel pncA mutations without rpsA and panD mutations. These included 5 with mutations (a deletion [Del] at 383T [Del383T], Del 380 to 390, insertion of A [A Ins] at position 127, A Ins at position 407, and G Ins at position 508) in pncA structural genes and 1 with a mutation (T-12C) at the pncA promoter region. All six of these strains had no or reduced PZase activities, indicating that the novel mutations might confer PZA resistance. Additionally, 25/27 phenotypic PZA-resistant strains were confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains. As PZA is commonly used in MDR-TB treatment regimens, direct pncA sequencing will rapidly detect PZA resistance and facilitate judicious use of PZA in treating PZA-susceptible MDR-TB.

"Objectively measured access to recreational destinations and leisure-time physical activity: Associations and demographic moderators in a six-country study",2019,"Within the growing body of research linking neighbourhood environmental attributes with physical activity, associations between recreational destinations and non-walking leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) are rarely studied, and to date, not across multiple cities. We examined six potential associations of objectively-measured access to private recreational facilities (e.g., fitness centres, swimming pools) and parks with adults’ non-walking LTPA (e.g., swimming, cycling, tennis), using data gathered with consistent methods from adults living in international cities with a range of environment attributes. The potential effects of socio-demographic moderators and between-city variations were also examined. Data from 6725 adults from 10 cities (6 countries) were gathered. Adults were more likely to engage in non-walking LTPA if they had a greater number of private recreational facilities within 0.5 or 1 km of the home, particularly in women, and if they lived closer to a park. The amount of non-zero LTPA was only associated (positively) with the number of recreational facilities within 1 km. Relationships between amount of LTPA and park proximity appear complex, with likely contextual and cultural differences. Improving access to private recreational facilities could promote non-walking LTPA, especially in women. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","accessibility; data set; GIS; physical activity; private land; recreational facility; sport; womens status; adult; article; city; female; geographic information system; health center; human; human experiment; major clinical study; recreation; swimming pool; tennis"
"A short report on the acquisition of point-of-care ultrasound skills and knowledge by the ambulance personnel in Hong Kong",2019,"Background: Point-of-care ultrasound plays an important role in patient management in the prehospital setting. Prehospital ultrasound training for the paramedics has been developed in the West for many years. However, the present training curriculum for the local ambulance personnel does not include point-of-care ultrasound. This study is the first of its kind in Hong Kong on the feasibility of teaching ambulance personnel how to perform focused assessment with sonography in trauma by a 1-day course. Objective: It aimed to assess whether the ultrasound-na?ve ambulance personnel could acquire the skills and knowledge of point-of-care ultrasound following a tailor-made training programme. Methods: This was a prospective observational study. The training programme was a 1-day course consisted of didactic lectures and hands-on practice. Each participant was assessed by a written test and a skills test. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the ambulance personnel and their results of the written and skills test. Significance testing was by Mann–Whitney U test and Spearman correlation test where appropriate. Results: Seventeen members of Ambulance Service Institute (Hong Kong Branch) participated in the programme. All of them currently are the ambulance personnel and they joined the programme via the captioned institute. Enrollment was voluntary. The median score in the written test was 20 out of 25. The median time to complete the four views of the focused assessment with sonography in trauma scan was 3.4 min. There was no significant relationship between test performance and educational background and work experience of the ambulance personnel. Conclusion: Training the local ambulance personnel point-of-care ultrasound is feasible. Their acquisition of skills and knowledge of point-of-care ultrasound after a 1-day course was satisfactory. ?

"Matrine suppresses lung metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma by directly targeting matrix metalloproteinase-9",2019,"Matrine is a natural compound derived from Radix Sophora flavescens which is a commonly used Chinese herb. Herein, we report that matrine may inhibit lung metastasis in liver cancer in mice. Invasion chamber assay, scratch-wound assay and orthotopic liver tumor implantation mice were introduced to investigate the potential pharmacological effects of matrine on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our results showed that matrine at non-toxic dose could significantly suppress PLC/PRF/5 and MHCC97L cells migration and invasion. Furthermore, matrine treatment (5 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased lung metastasis in orthotopic HCC mouse models. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, gelatin zymography and immunoblotting assay indicated that matrine could inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 without down-regulating its protein expression in HCC. The docking approach, site-directed mutagenesis, and surface plasmon resonance were applied to identify residues involved in matrine binding in matrix metalloproteinase-9. The biophysical and cell-based assays showed that Pro415, Arg424 residue might contribute to the binding affinity of matrine on matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. In conclusion, matrine might be a promising anti-cancer agent for inhibiting HCC metastasis. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","arginine; gelatin; gelatinase B; matrine; proline; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; binding affinity; bioluminescence; biophysics; cancer inhibition; cancer transplantation; cell assay; cell cycle; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cellular distribution; clinical evaluation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dose response; down regulation; drug effect; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; female; fluorescence; human; human cell; image analysis; immunoblotting; in vitro study; in vivo study; invasion chamber assay; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; liver graft; liver metastasis; lung metastasis; MHCC97-L cell line; molecular docking; mouse; mutagenesis; nonhuman; PLC/PRF/5 cell line; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein targeting; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; surface plasmon resonance; wound healing assay; zymography"
"Effect of Essential Oil on Patients with Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial",2019,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of essential oil treatment for type III chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from December 2014 to October 2015. Seventy type III CP/CPPS patients were assigned to the essential oil group (35 cases) or almond placebo oil control group (35 cases) by a random number table. The oil was smeared by self-massage on the suprapubic and sacral region once a day for 4 weeks. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Syndrome Index (NIH-CPSI) and expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) were examined. The primary outcome was NIH-CPSI pain domain. The secondary outcomes included other NIH-CPSI domains and laboratory examinations of EPS. Adverse events were also observed. Results: Sixty-six subjects completed the full 4-week treatment. There was no significant difference between almond oil control and essential oil groups in terms of the total score of NIH-CPSI, pain, quality of life and urination domain scores of NIH-CPSI and EPS examinations (P>0.05). In the essential oil group, pain between rectum and testicles (perineum) in the domain of pain or discomfort was significantly reduced at week 2 and week 4 compared with almond oil control group (P<0.01). No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusion: The essential oil may reduce the pain or discomfort in the perineum region in patients with CP/CPPS.

"A successful combined laparoscopic cholecystectomy and laparoscopic exploration of common bile duct for acute gangrenous cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis during pregnancy: A case report",2019,"Introduction: Choledocholithiasis during pregnancy is relatively uncommon but it can be life-threatening. Therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) poses the risk of ionizing radiation exposure to the developing fetus. Other strategies are thus needed to tackle this problem. Presentation of case: A 38-year-old 8 weeks’ pregnant lady presented with acute onset of right upper quadrant pain. Ultrasonography showed features of acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis, which was later confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiogram. Emergency combined laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and laparoscopic exploration of common bile duct (Lap ECBD) were performed. Lap ECBD through trans-cystic duct approach was adopted. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 4. A healthy baby boy was delivered at 40 weeks’ gestation without developmental problem. Conclusion: Lap ECBD avoided ionizing radiation for choledocholithiasis during pregnancy, and can combined with LC as an effective minimally invasive procedure for complicated gallstone disease. ? 2019 The Authors","acute cholecystitis; adult; Article; biliary tract endoscopy; case report; cholangiography; choledochotomy; clinical article; clinical feature; common bile duct stone; convalescence; echography; emergency surgery; female; gangrene; hospital discharge; human; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; laparoscopic surgery; leukocytosis; nuclear magnetic resonance; operation duration; pain; postoperative period; pregnancy; priority journal; surgical approach"
"Dental care-seeking and information acquisition during pregnancy: A qualitative study",2019,"Background: Pregnant women are at risk of oral health problems. This qualitative study aims to understand dental care-seeking behaviours of pregnant women and their oral health-related information acquisition, to identify barriers to and motivators for, dental visits, and further explore their expectations and possible strategies to improve oral health care during pregnancy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 pregnant women (after 32 gestational weeks) enrolled in the antenatal care programme in a public hospital in Hong Kong. Two main areas of interest were probed: Dental care-seeking behaviour and oral health information acquisition. Their expectations and suggestions on oral health care service for pregnant women were also explored. An inductive thematic approach was adopted to analyse the data. Results: Pregnant women’s dental care-seeking behaviour was deterred by some internal factors, such as misunderstandings on oral health, and priority on other issues over oral health. External factors such as inconvenient access to dental service during pregnancy also affected their care-seeking behaviours. Oral health information was passively absorbed by pregnant women through mass media and the social environment, which sometimes led to confusion. Oral health information acquisition from antenatal institutions and care providers was rare. Greater attention was paid to dental visit when they obtained proper information from previous dental visit experience or family members. A potential strategy to improve oral health care suggested by the interviewees is to develop a health care system strengthened by inter-professional (antenatal-dental) collaboration. Efficient oral health information delivery, convenient access to dental service, and improved ‘quality’ of dental care targeting the needs of pregnant women were identified as possible approaches to improve dental care for this population. Conclusion: Dental care-seeking behaviour during pregnancy was altered by various internal and external factors. A lack of, or conflict between, information sources result in confusion that can restrict utilisation of dental service. Integrating dental care into antenatal service would be a viable way to improve dental service utilisation. ? 2019 by the authors.","dental health; health services; hospital sector; pregnancy; qualitative analysis; womens health; adult; article; attention; clinical article; controlled study; dental procedure; expectation; female; health care system; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; mass medium; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal care; public hospital; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; semi structured interview; social environment; attitude to health; health; information seeking; patient attitude; pregnancy; psychology; qualitative research; young adult; China; Hong Kong; Adult; Dental Care; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Oral Health; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Care; Qualitative Research; Young Adult"
"Phloretin and its methylglyoxal adduct: Implications against advanced glycation end products-induced inflammation in endothelial cells",2019,"Methylglyoxal (MGO), a cytotoxic factor, reacts irreversibly with the side chains of lysine, cysteine, and arginine residues in proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs)which might be a major pathological factor associated with diabetic complications. Thus, it is necessary to prevent or alleviate such diseases through inhibiting the formation of AGEs or lowering these AGEs-induced cellular damages. Based on our previous work, it was known that phloretin, an apple polyphenol, can inhibit the formation of AGEs under simulated physiological conditions. In this study, we found that phloretin prevented the formation of AGEs through trapping MGO in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). The phloretin-MGO adducts were analyzed in PBS and HUVECs. Surprisingly, only 1 MGO-phloretin adduct was detected in HUVECs, which was formed within 0.5 h and metabolized eventually within 24 h. The specific phloretin-MGO adduct was synthesized and identified by MS and NMR analysis. Its anti-inflammatory effect against AGEs was further investigated together with the parent compound, phloretin, which was proved to be through RAGE/p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Taken together, our data indicated the positive role of phloretin-MGO adduct on phloretin's protective effects, which might offer a new insight into the action mechanism of polyphenols against AGEs-induced damages. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","advanced glycation end product receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; methylglyoxal; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phloretin; advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; methylglyoxal; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phloretin; polyphenol; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell viability; controlled study; derivatization; endothelium cell; enzyme inhibition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; incubation time; liquid chromatography; quadrupole mass spectrometry; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; ultra performance liquid chromatography; cell free system; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; inflammation; metabolism; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular endothelium; Cell-Free System; Endothelium, Vascular; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Inflammation; NF-kappa B; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phloretin; Polyphenols; Pyruvaldehyde; Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products"
"A 12-week pilot study of acceptance of a computer-based chronic disease self-monitoring system among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension",2019,"This study tested a structural model examining the effects of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, health consciousness, and application-specific self-efficacy on the acceptance (i.e. behavioral intention and actual usage) of a computer-based chronic disease self-monitoring system among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension. The model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling, with 119 observations that were obtained by pooling data across three time points over a 12-week period. The results indicate that all of the seven constructs examined had a significant total effect on behavioral intention and explained 74 percent of the variance. Also, application-specific self-efficacy and behavioral intention had a significant total effect on actual usage and explained 17 percent of the variance. This study demonstrates that technology acceptance is determined by patient characteristics, technology attributes, and social influences. Applying the findings may increase the likelihood of acceptance. ? The Author(s) 2017.",""
"Continued social participation protects against depressive symptoms across the retirement transition: Longitudinal evidence from three waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey",2019,"Aim: Social participation is an important social resource over retirement, but little is known about how changing social participation might affect mental health over retirement. This study examined the impact of retirement status, changes in social participation and their interactions on subsequent depressive symptoms over a 4-year period. Methods: Data were obtained from the first three waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey. The analytical sample included 2364 individuals with different retirement statuses (remained retired, transitioned to retirement, remained working). Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the impact of retirement status, changes in social participation and their interactions on depressive symptoms. Results: Compared with those who remained working, individuals who remained retired reported reduced depressive symptoms (β = ?0.64, 95% CI ?1.23 to ?0.05); individuals who transitioned to retirement reported elevated depressive symptoms (β = 0.74, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.41). Relative to those who reported no participation over the study, individuals who maintained or increased social participation reported reduced depressive symptoms (β = ?1.12, 95% CI ?1.67 to ?0.56; β = ?1.03, 95% CI ?1.90 to ?0.17); individuals who decreased social participation reported elevated depressive symptoms (β = 0.70, 95% CI 0.13–1.28). Individuals with decreased social participation were more influenced by the negative impact of transition to retirement on depressive symptoms (β = 1.93, 95% CI 0.12–3.74). Conclusion: These results highlighted the time-varying effects of retirement on mental health, and continued social participation acting as an adaptive strategy to protect against depressive symptoms over time.

"Social-Emotional Functioning Explains the Effects of Physical Activity on Academic Performance among Chinese Primary School Students: A Mediation Analysis",2019,"Objective: To examine the mediating effects of socioemotional and behavioral functioning in the association between physical activity and academic achievement in Chinese children. Study design: Chinese children (n = 17 318; aged 6-11 years) from the Shanghai Children's Health, Education and Lifestyle Evaluation study in 2014 were the source of data. Children reported the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (MVPA) during weekdays and weekends. Parents rated their children's socioemotional and behavioral difficulties. Head teachers rated the academic performance of each student. A mediation analysis with multiple mediators was performed to test the mediation effects of 5 socioemotional and behavioral variables (emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention, peer relationship, and prosocial behaviors) in the association between MVPA and academic achievement, adjusting for demographic and health-related variables. Results: Results revealed that MVPA was positively associated with academic performance (b = 0.78; SE =.01; P <.001). Conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention, and peer problems showed significant mediating effects in the association between MVPA and academic achievement, with hyperactivity and inattention being the strongest mediator (b = 0.38; SE = 0.04; P <.001) accounting for 49% of the total effect. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that MVPA is associated with fewer socioemotional difficulties, which, in turn, is associated with better academic achievement. Promoting physical activity among school-aged children may benefit their overall development. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","article; child; child health; Chinese; controlled study; education; female; head; human; human experiment; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; mediator; peer group; physical activity; preschool child; primary school; student; teacher"
"Updated use of TACE for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment: How and when to use it based on clinical evidence",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer, representing the sixth leading cause of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Patient stratification and treatment allocation are based on tumor stage, liver function, and performance status. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the first-line treatment for patients with intermediate stage HCC, including those with large or multinodular HCC, well-preserved liver function, and no cancer-related symptoms or evidence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Two TACE techniques have been used since 2004, conventional TACE (cTACE) and TACE with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE). cTACE was evidenced first to treat intermediate stage HCC patients. It combines the transcatheter delivery of chemotherapy using Lipiodol-based emulsion plus an embolizing agent to achieve strong cytotoxic and ischemic effects. Drug-eluting beads (DEBs) were developed in order to slowly release chemotherapeutic agents, and to increase ischemia intensity and duration. Recent advances allow TACE treatment of both early stage patients (i.e. those with a solitary nodule or up to 3 nodules under 3 cm) and some advanced stage patients. Here we review recent clinical evidence related to TACE treatment of patients with early, intermediate, and advanced stage HCC. Based on the 2014 TACE algorithm of Raoul et al., this international expert panel proposes an updated TACE algorithm and provides insights into TACE use for patients at any HCC stage. ? 2018","antineoplastic agent; doxorubicin; gelatin sponge; iodinated poppyseed oil; microsphere; polyvinyl alcohol; advanced cancer; algorithm; chemoembolization; drug efficacy; drug eluting bead; drug safety; evidence based medicine; human; intermethod comparison; liver cell carcinoma; medical expert; practice guideline; Review; standardization; treatment indication; chemoembolization; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; procedures; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms"
"New insights into antibiotic resistome in drinking water and management perspectives: A metagenomic based study of small-sized microbes",2019,"The proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in drinking water and their potential horizontal transfer to pathogenic microbes may cause failure of antibiotics. However, antimicrobial resistome monitoring in drinking water is not currently routine. The bacterial hosts of ARGs, especially small-sized microbes in drinking water, may not be effectively removed by membrane filtration disinfection and thus pose threats to human health. In the present study, using metagenomic based approach, we investigated antibiotic resistome of small-sized microbes (0.2–0.45 μm) in 20 household drinking water samples from 12 cities in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. A total of 265 ARG subtypes belonging to 17 ARG types were detected at abundances ranging from 4.0 × 10?2 to 1.0 × 100 copies/cell. Multidrug, bacitracin and aminoglycoside resistance genes are dominant, and 43 ARG subtypes were specifically carried by small-size microbes. Metagenomic assembly strategy revealed fragments of three opportunistic pathogen, i.e. Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium gordonae, carried mexW, aph(3′)-I and aac(2′)-I, respectively. Drinking water samples were classified into three groups based on the presence of ARG, pathogen and ARG-carrying pathogen. These new insights into the antibiotic resistome of small microbes in drinking water over a broad scale indicate the need for more comprehensive ARGs monitoring and surveillance of drinking water supplies. These findings, together with the perspectives and strategies proposed in this study, could support initiatives to improve drinking water safety. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Genes; Health risks; Microfiltration; Public health; Water filtration; Water supply; Aminoglycoside resistance; Antibiotic resistance genes; Drinking water samples; Metagenomic assemblies; Metagenomic sequencing; Mycobacterium gordonae; Pathogenic host; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Potable water; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; bacitracin; drinking water; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; disinfection; drinking water; genomics; pathogen; public health; water management; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterium identification; China; disinfection; Hong Kong; metagenomics; Mycobacterium gordonae; nonhuman; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas alcaligenes; Singapore; water management; water sampling; bacterial gene; human; China; Hong Kong; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mycobacterium gordonae; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas alcaligenes; Anti-Bacterial Agents; China; Drinking Water; Genes, Bacterial; Hong Kong; Humans; Singapore"
"TIMI risk score for secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in a real-world cohort of post-non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients",2019,"Background Patients who survive non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are at heightened risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Data on long-term secondary atherothrombotic risk stratification are limited. Objectives To stratify post-NSTEMI patients for risk of recurrent cardiovascular events to maximise benefit from aggressive secondary prevention strategies using the TIMI Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS 2°P) score in a real-world cohort of NSTEMI patients. Methods and results This was a single-centre observational study of 891 post-NSTEMI patients (73.7 ± 12.7 years; male: 54.2%). The TRS 2°P is a nine-point risk stratification tool to predict cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal ischaemic stroke. After a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR: 11.4 - 60.2), 281 patients (31.5%) had developed a primary outcome (13.3%/year) including 196 cardiovascular deaths, 94 non-fatal MIs and 22 non-fatal strokes. The TRS 2°P score was strongly associated with the primary outcome. The annual incidence of primary composite endpoint for patients with TRS 2°P score =0 was 1.6%, and increased progressively to 47.4% for those with a TRS 2°P score ?6 (HR: 20.18, 95% CI: 4.85 to 84.05, p<0.001). Similar associations were also observed between the TRS 2°P score and cardiovascular death and MI (fatal and non-fatal), but not non-fatal ischaemic stroke. Conclusion The TRS 2°P score stratified post-NSTEMI patients for risk of future cardiovascular events and potentially help guide the selection of more aggressive secondary prevention therapy. ?

"High-sensitivity troponin I for cardiovascular risk stratification in the general asymptomatic population: Perspectives from Asia-Pacific",2019,"Cardiac troponin is a sensitive and specific biomarker for acute myocardial injury and has been used in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, and has emerged as a tool for identifying high risk individuals for primary preventive therapy. Recent evidence has emerged indicating that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, which allow robust detection of very low troponin concentrations, could detect subclinical injury in asymptomatic patients. On 24 March 2018, a group of cardiologists from the Asia Pacific region convened to review the data and discuss the potential utility of high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) in the risk assessment of cardiovascular disease in the general population. The group recognized the immense burden of cardiovascular disease in the Asia-Pacific region, and the limitations of current risk stratification strategies. Data demonstrates that cardiac biomarkers like hsTnI could improve risk stratification, and thresholds for hsTnI in cardiovascular disease risk classification have been developed in Caucasian populations but not validated in Asian populations. There is an urgent need to improve cardiovascular risk assessment in the Asia Pacific general population, validate the Asian threshold of high risk and prove the utility of targeting these high-risk individuals for primary preventive strategies. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","placebo; pravastatin; troponin I; biological marker; troponin I; acute heart infarction; all cause mortality; Article; Asian; asymptomatic disease; Australia; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; disease burden; epidemic; heart failure; high risk population; Hong Kong; human; India; Indonesia; mortality rate; Philippines; primary prevention; priority journal; risk assessment; Singapore; Thailand; Viet Nam; Asia; asymptomatic disease; blood; cardiovascular disease; Pacific Ocean; risk assessment; risk factor; Asia; Asymptomatic Diseases; Biomarkers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Pacific Ocean; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Troponin I"
"Bismuth drugs tackle: Porphyromonas gingivalis and attune cytokine response in human cells",2019,"Periodontitis is the leading cause of severe tooth loss and edentulism in adults worldwide and is closely linked to systemic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis is the key pathogen in periodontitis. Herein, we provided the first evidence that bismuth drugs suppress P. gingivalis in its planktonic, biofilm, and intracellular states. In total, 42 bismuth-associated proteins were identified including its major virulent factors (e.g., gingipains, hemagglutinin HagA, and fimbriae). Bismuth perturbed its iron acquisition, disturbed the energy metabolism and virulence, and deactivated multiple key enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase and thioredoxins). Moreover, bismuth inhibited its biofilm formation and disrupted the 3-day matured biofilms. Notably, the internalized P. gingivalis in various human cells (e.g., human gingival epithelium progenitors, HGEPs) was oppressed by bismuth but not the commonly used antibiotic metronidazole. Importantly, bismuth drugs enabled the counteraction of immuno-inflammatory responses in different host cells perturbed by P. gingivalis. The production of IL-6 and IL-8 attenuated by P. gingivalis in both of native and IL-1β-stimulated HGEPs was restored, while the bacterium-enhanced expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα in THP-1 macrophages was alleviated. This proof-of-concept study brings prospects for the potential reposition of the routinely used anti-Helicobacter pylori bismuth drugs to better manage inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis and P. gingivalis-related complex systemic disorders. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Biofilms; Diseases; Enzymes; Metabolism; Biofilm formation; Cardio-vascular disease; Cytokine response; Energy metabolism; Helicobacter pylori; Inflammatory disease; Inflammatory response; Super oxide dismutase; Bismuth; bismuth; fimbria protein; gingipain; hemagglutinin; hemagglutinin hagA; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; iron; superoxide dismutase; thioredoxin; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; virulence factor; antibacterial activity; antibiofilm activity; Article; bacterial virulence; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine response; energy metabolism; enzyme inactivation; host cell; human; human cell; nonhuman; Porphyromonas gingivalis; priority journal; proof of concept; protein expression; THP-1 cell line"
"Improving Survival with Tranexamic Acid in Cerebral Contusions or Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Univariate and Multivariate Analysis of Independent Factors Associated with Lower Mortality",2019,"Background: Fall with head injury is a pervasive challenge, especially in the aging population. Contributing factors for mortality include the development of cerebral contusions and delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma. Currently, there is no established specific treatment for these conditions. Object: This study aimed to investigate the impact of independent factors on the mortality rate of traumatic brain injury with contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods: Data were collected from consecutive patients admitted for cerebral contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage at an academic trauma center from 2010 to 2016. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate. Independent factors for analysis included patient factors and treatment modalities. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent factors related to mortality. Secondary outcomes included thromboembolic complication rates associated with the use of tranexamic acid. Results: In total, 651 consecutive patients were identified. For the patient factors, low Glasgow Coma Scale on admission, history of renal impairment, and use of warfarin were identified as independent factors associated with higher mortality from univariate and multivariate analyses. For the treatment modalities, univariate analysis identified tranexamic acid as an independent factor associated with lower mortality (P = 0.021). Thromboembolic events were comparable in patients with or without tranexamic acid. Conclusion: Tranexamic acid was identified by univariate analysis as an independent factor associated with lower mortality in cerebral contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Further prospective studies are needed to validate this finding. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","acetylsalicylic acid; mannitol; tranexamic acid; warfarin; tranexamic acid; acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain contusion; cerebrovascular accident; comorbidity; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; emergency health service; female; Glasgow coma scale; human; hypertension; kidney disease; liver cirrhosis; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality rate; neurosurgery; prospective study; subarachnoid hemorrhage; thrombocyte transfusion; thromboembolism; traumatic brain injury; very elderly; adolescent; brain contusion; brain hemorrhage; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; subarachnoid hemorrhage; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Contusion; Cerebral Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Female; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Traumatic; Tranexamic Acid; Young Adult"
"Prostaglandin E 2 -Mediated impairment of innate immune response to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in diet-induced obese mice could be restored by paracetamol",2019,"Background Obesity is associated with increased severity of influenza infection. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Methods We employed a mouse model with diet-induced obesity (DIO) to study the innate immune responses induced by influenza virus. Results The lungs of DIO mice were heavily affected by obesity-associated chronic systemic inflammation with a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Concurrently, lipid immune mediator prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) was also significantly elevated in DIO mice. However, the DIO mice mounted a blunted and delayed upregulation of mRNA and protein concentrations of interferon-β and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines upon A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (H1N1/415742Md) challenge compared with those of lean mice. PGE 2 concentrations were significantly higher in the lungs of DIO mice compared to that of lean mice postchallenge. Treatment with paracetamol in challenged DIO mice significantly enhanced the expression of interferon-α/β and cytokine genes at days 1 and 3 postinfection compared with that of untreated DIO mice. Furthermore, paracetamol treatment alone started 3 days before virus challenge and continued until 6 days postchallenge ameliorated the severity of a lethal H1N1/415742Md infection in DIO mice with improved survival. Conclusions Impaired innate response to influenza in DIO mice is associated with elevated PGE 2, which could be restored to some degree by paracetamol treatment. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Role of mental health in the attitude toward same-sex marriage among people in Taiwan: Moderating effects of gender, age, and sexual orientation",2020,"Purpose: The aims of the study were to examine the role of mental health in peoples’ attitude toward same-sex marriage in Taiwan, as well as the moderating effects of gender, age, and sexual orientation on the association between mental health and attitude toward same-sex marriage. Methods: In total, 3235 participants were recruited through a Facebook advertisement. Each participant completed a questionnaire assessing attitude toward same-sex marriage and a 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between mental health and attitude toward same-sex marriage. Results: Poor mental health was significantly associated with a low level of support for same-sex marriage. Age and sexual orientation moderated the association between mental health state and support for same-sex marriage. A significant association between poor mental health and a low level of support for same-sex marriage was observed only in older participants but not in younger participants. Moreover, a significant association between poor mental health and a low level of support for same-sex marriage was indicated only in heterosexual participants but not in non-heterosexual participants. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that poor mental health was significantly associated with opposition to same-sex marriage. This relationship is more pronounced among older and heterosexual people. ? 2019 Formosan Medical Association","adult; advertising; article; female; gender; heterosexuality; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mental health; multiple regression; questionnaire; rating scale; same-sex marriage; Taiwan"
"Effect of mycophenolate and rapamycin on renal fibrosis in lupus nephritis",2019,"Lupus nephritis (LN) leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD) through progressive fibrosis. Mycophenolate inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and is a standard treatment for LN. The mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is activated in LN. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR and is effective in preventing kidney transplant rejection, with the additional merits of reduced incidence of malignancies and viral infections. The effect of mycophenolate or rapamycin on kidney fibrosis in LN has not been investigated. We investigated the effects of mycophenolate and rapamycin in New Zealand Black and White first generation (NZB/W F1) murine LN and human mesangial cells (HMCs), focusing on mechanisms leading to kidney fibrosis. Treatment of mice with mycophenolate or rapamycin improved nephritis manifestations, decreased anti-double stranded (ds) DNA antibody titer and reduced immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition in the kidney. Both mycophenolate and rapamycin, especially the latter, decreased glomerular mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation. Renal histology in untreated mice showed mesangial proliferation and progressive glomerulosclerosis with tubular atrophy, and increased expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin (FN) and collagen. Both mycophenolate and rapamycin ameliorated the histopathological changes. Results from in vitro experiments showed that both mycophenolate and rapamycin decreased mesangial cell proliferation and their binding with anti-dsDNA antibodies. Mycophenolate and rapamycin also down-regulated mTOR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and inhibited fibrotic responses in mesangial cells that were induced by anti-dsDNA antibodies or TGF-β1. Our findings suggest that, in addition to immunosuppression, mycophenolate and rapamycin may reduce fibrosis in LN, which has important implications in preventing CKD in patients with LN. ? 2019 The Author(s).","alpha smooth muscle actin; collagen; double stranded DNA antibody; fibronectin; immunoglobulin G; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitogen activated protein kinase; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; mycophenolic acid; rapamycin; transforming growth factor beta1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody titer; antiproliferative activity; Article; cell proliferation; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; drug effect; female; glomerulosclerosis; histopathology; human; human cell; human cell culture; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; kidney fibrosis; leukocyte count; lupus erythematosus nephritis; mesangium cell; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; treatment duration"
"Circulating vitamin E levels and risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction: A mendelian randomization study",2019,"Observational studies have reported a cardioprotective effect of vitamin E whereas intervention trials failed to confirm its beneficial effects, and even some reported adverse effects of vitamin E supplements on coronary artery disease (CAD). To clarify, we conducted a two-sample mendelian randomization study to investigate causal association of vitamin E with the risk of CAD. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in a genome-wide analysis study including 7781 individuals of European descent, rs964184, rs2108622, and rs11057830 were used as the genetic instruments for vitamin E. Data for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) were available from Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics consortium. The effect of each SNP on CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) was weighted by its effect on serum vitamin E (mg/L), and results were pooled to give a summary estimates for the effect of increased vitamin E on risk of CAD/MI. Based on 3 SNPs each 1 mg/L increase in vitamin E was significantly associated with CAD (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.06), MI (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05), elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.021 standard deviations (SD), 95% CI 0.016, 0.027), triglycerides (0.026 SD, 95% CI 0.021, 0.031), and total cholesterol (0.043 SD, 95% CI 0.038, 0.048) and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.019 SD 95% CI -0.024, -0.014). Our findings indicate that higher vitamin E may increase the risk of CAD/MI and the safety and efficacy of vitamin E supplementation use should be reevaluated. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Pattern of mortality after menopausal hormone therapy: long-term follow up in a population-based cohort",2019,"Objective: To investigate long-term pattern of mortality in menopausal women according to different modalities of hormone therapy. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. Setting: Denmark 1993–2013. Population: A total of 29 243 women aged 50–64 years at entry into the Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort, enrolled 1993–97 and followed through 31 December 2013. Methods: Cox’ proportional hazards models for increasingly longer periods of follow-up time were used to estimate mortality pattern according to baseline hormone use adjusted for relevant potential confounders. Main outcome(s): All-cause and cause-specific mortality. Outcome information was obtained from the Danish Register of Causes of Death (linkage 99.6%). Results: A total of 4098 women died during a median follow up of 17.6 years. After adjustment for relevant lifestyle risk factors, hormone use had no impact on all-cause mortality, regardless of modality. Among baseline users, lower cardiovascluar disease mortality was only evident after 5 years [hazard ratio (HR) 0.54; 95% CI 0.32–0.92], but dissipated with additional follow up. Conversely, lower colorectal cancer mortality (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46–0.89) and higher breast cancer mortality (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.05–1.72) only became evident after 15 years of follow up. There were no significant associations for mortality from other types of cancer or from stroke. Conclusions: In this long-term follow-up study, taking hormones during menopause was not associated with overall mortality among middle-aged women. Investigating cause-specific mortality revealed significant, albeit weak, differential associations according to both causes of death and over time, underlining the importance of carefully considering individual risks and duration of treatment when making decisions on hormone therapy.

"Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer: Magnetic Tracer as the Only Localizing Agent",2019,"Background: The combined use of radioisotope and blue dye is the gold standard in sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization in early breast cancer. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) has recently emerged as a non-inferior new tracer in sentinel lymph node mapping with fewer disadvantages. This study represents the first and the largest cohort of superparamagnetic iron oxide application in Asian population. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed from August 2016 to December 2017. All patients with SLN localization by SPIO were included in this study. Results: A total of 328 breast cancer patients with 333 SLNB procedures were included in this study. Median age was 54?years (range 32–86). Median tumor size was 1.9?cm (range 0.1–12?cm).There were 138 breast-conserving surgeries and 195 mastectomies. All patients received injection of SPIO 1?day prior to operation. A total of 329 successful sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures were undertaken with 1514 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identified. One hundred and fifty-three (10.1%) of the SLNs were positive for malignancy. There were 54 patients with macrometastases, 26 with micrometastases and 24 with isolated tumor cells. Sixty-seven patients underwent subsequent axillary dissection. Four patients failed sentinel lymph node identification with SPIO. The success rate of SPIO in sentinel lymph node localization was 98.8%.

"Biological links in periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis: Discovery via text-mining PubMed abstracts",2019,"Background and Objective: Primary research concerning molecular pathways that link rheumatoid arthritis with periodontitis is limited. Biomedical literature data mining can offer insights into putative linkage mechanisms toward hypothesis development, based on information discovery. The aim of this study was to explore potential Periodontitis-Rheumatoid Arthritis biological links by analysing “overlapping” genes reported in biomedical abstracts. Material and Methods: PubMed abstracts for terms: (a) “Periodontitis” or “Periodontal Diseases” (PD), (b) “Rheumatoid arthritis” (RA), and (c) their combination with “AND” (RA+PD), were each text-mined to extract genes using “Human Genome Nomenclature Committee” (HGNC) symbols. A gene-set common to RA and PD abstracts was determined (RA∩PD). Gene ontology (GO) profiles of RA∩PD and RA+PD were compared using “GoProfiler.” Minimum order protein-protein interaction (PPI) and gene-miRNA networks of “differential genes” between RA∩PD and RA+PD were constructed with “networkAnalyst.”. Results: Among 1676 genes documented in RA (10?5241 abstracts), and 893 genes in PD (80?982 abstracts), 535 genes were common (RA∩PD), from which 35 genes were also documented in RA+PD (415 abstracts). 41 GO-terms significantly different between RA∩PD and RA+PD GO profiles represented 38 biological processes including; nitric oxide metabolism, immunoglobulin production, hormonal regulation, catabolic process down-regulation, and leukocyte proliferation. The 500 differential genes’ PPI and gene-miRNA networks showed REL, TRAF2, AQP1 genes, and miRNAs 335-5p, 17-5p, 93-5p with genes HMOX1 and SP1 as hub nodes. Conclusions: Text-mining biomedical abstracts revealed potentially shared but un-investigated links between PD and RA, meriting further research. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"The relevance of high-intensity zones in degenerative disc disease",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to review the current understanding of high-intensity zones (HIZ) in the lumbar spine with particular attention to its imaging phenotype and clinical relevance. Methods: A review was conducted of studies related to HIZ. Particular attention was made to imaging phenotypes and classification, and its relationship with discogenic low back pain (LBP). Results: The most current classification system of HIZ is based on location (anterior and posterior), morphology (round, fissure, vertical, rim, or giant types), and its appearance on both T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HIZ are commonly manifested with disc degeneration. Hence, both conditions share similar risk factors such as the effect of frequent and prolonged disc loading. The clinical significance of HIZ however is not conclusive. Provocative discography is not sensitive (~ 70%) for eliciting a concordant pain response. Population-based studies have conflicting results regarding the prevalence (14–63%) of HIZ and its correlation with LBP. Conclusions: HIZ are likely a risk factor for discogenic LBP. However, its etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Some clinical studies suggest a link between its occurrence and LBP. However, the results are not consistent as a result of studies which are underpowered and based on heterogeneous study populations, lacking control groups, and without standardized imaging phenotypes. HIZ may be an important pain biomarker that should be further studied. With more modern MRI technology and a detailed classification system, future large-scale population studies will improve our knowledge on its role in the disc degeneration cascade and development of LBP. ? 2018, SICOT aisbl.","clinical classification; diskography; high intensity zone; histology; human; imaging; imaging and display; intervertebral disk degeneration; low back pain; lumbar spine; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; pathophysiology; phenotype; prevalence; priority journal; Review; risk factor; adult; complication; diagnostic imaging; female; intervertebral disk; intervertebral disk degeneration; low back pain; lumbar vertebra; lumbosacral region; male; middle aged; procedures; Adult; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Low Back Pain; Lumbar Vertebrae; Lumbosacral Region; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors"
"Anti-diabetic effects and mechanisms of dietary polysaccharides",2019,"Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial, heterogeneous metabolic disorder, causing various health complications and economic issues, which apparently impacts the human’s life. Currently, commercial diabetic drugs are clinically managed for diabetic treatment that has definite side effects. Dietary polysaccharides mainly derive from natural sources, including medicinal plants, grains, fruits, vegetables, edible mushroom, and medicinal foods, and possess anti-diabetic potential. Hence, this review summarizes the effects of dietary polysaccharides on diabetes and underlying molecular mechanisms related to inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and diabetes in various animal models. The analysis of literature and appropriate data on anti-diabetic polysaccharide from electronic databases was conducted. In vivo and in vitro trials have revealed that treatment of these polysaccharides has hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, which enhance pancreatic β-cell mass and alleviates β-cell dysfunction. It enhances insulin signaling pathways through insulin receptors and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, and eventually modulates ERK/JNK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, dietary polysaccharides can effectively ameliorate hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and, thus, consumption of polysaccharides can be a valuable choice for diabetic control. ? 2018 by the authors.","antidiabetic agent; antiinflammatory agent; biological marker; insulin; polysaccharide; animal; chemistry; dietary supplement; drug effect; human; metabolism; oxidative stress; signal transduction; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Oxidative Stress; Polysaccharides; Signal Transduction"
"The Argument For and Against the Use of Multichannel Urodynamics in the Assessment of Post-Prostatectomy Incontinence",2019,"Purpose of Review: Prostate cancer is a common male malignancy. Radical prostatectomy is a common treatment option in patients with localised disease. Post-prostatectomy incontinence (PPI) is not uncommon, with a significant impact on the quality of life. However, it is often under-reported and undertreated. There are no standard international guidelines specifically for investigation and diagnosis of PPI. The routine use of urodynamic studies (UDS), with an attempt to assess urinary incontinence aetiology and to predict success prior to invasive surgical treatment, has been widely adopted but remains controversial. Recent Findings: Literature concerning the pros and cons of pre-operative UDS is reviewed. There are conflicting results on UDS findings post-prostatectomy. Few studies demonstrated that UDS findings are not predictive of outcomes of the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS). Other studies have shown the presence of detrusor overactivity (DO) to be an adverse prognostic factor, especially for PPI patients treated with male sling success. Currently, there is no consensus on the indication for UDS in patients with PPI. Summary: Despite conflicting results on the usefulness of UDS prior to PPI surgery, the majority of surgeons still routinely perform UDS pre-operatively. Further prospective and randomised controlled studies would be beneficial in determining if routine UDS is required before surgical treatment for PPI. The authors also gave their perspective on the application of personalised UDS in investigating patients PPI prior to treatment. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","bladder obstruction; conservative treatment; dysuria; electrostimulation; erectile dysfunction; hematuria; human; inflammation; lifestyle modification; lower urinary tract symptom; male; minimally invasive procedure; nocturia; overactive bladder; pelvic floor muscle training; physical examination; post prostatectomy incontinence; postvoid residual urine volume; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; quality of life; Review; sphincterotomy; stress incontinence; urinalysis; urine incontinence; urine retention; urodynamics"
"The power of suggestion: examining the impact of presence or absence of shared first language in the antenatal clinic",2019,"Healthcare encounters involving participants from diverse linguistic backgrounds are becoming more common due to the globalisation of health care and increasing migration levels. Research suggests that this diversity has a significant impact on health outcomes; however less is known about how it is managed in the actual consultation process. This article presents an analysis of antenatal screening consultations video recorded in Hong Kong, using conversation analysis. We consider how the use of a second or subsequent language impacts on these consultations, and on discussions and decisions about further action. The presence or absence of shared first language did not appear to affect the extent to which particular courses of action were promoted or recommended. Recommendations were a common occurrence across consultations with and without shared first language. However, we argue that the routine use of recommendations can be consequential, as second language speakers may have more limited resources to interrogate or contest these. This finding has implications for the ability for professionals to maximise patient involvement in decision-making. ? 2019 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness","adult; article; consultation; controlled study; conversation; Hong Kong; human; linguistics; midwife; patient participation; prenatal care; shared decision making; suggestion; videorecording"
"Physical activity of children with physical disabilities: Associations with environmental and behavioral variables at home and school",2019,"The purpose of this study was to examine the physical activity (PA) of children with physical disabilities (PD) and its associated environmental and behavioral factors at home and at school. One hundred and forty-seven Hong Kong children (mean age = 13.5 ± 2.5 years) with PD from three special schools participated. We used BEACHES (Behaviors of Eating and Activity for Children’s Health: Evaluation System) to assess their PA and associated variables at home (before dinner) and during four school settings (before classes, recess, lunch breaks, after classes) on four school days. Overall, the children were typically inactive and spent little time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), range = 6.3% to 17.0% across settings. At home, children were more active when fathers were present (p < 0.001). At school, prompts to be active contributed to their MVPA% before classes (p < 0.01) and during recess and lunch breaks (both p < 0.001). The presence of a child’s mother was positively associated with MVPA% before classes (p < 0.001) and the presence of other children was associated with MVPA% during recess and lunch breaks (both p < 0.05). With children with PD accruing small amounts of MVPA in both home and school settings, multifaceted interventions reflecting both contextual and personal factors should be considered in order to increase the health-enhancing PA of this population. ? 2019 by the authors.","child; disability; education; environmental factor; physical activity; adolescent; Article; child; child behavior; controlled study; environmental factor; father; female; human; leisure; major clinical study; male; mother; observational study; patient participation; peer group; physical activity; physical disability; population research; school child; social behavior; social environment; exercise; handicapped child; Hong Kong; school; China; Hong Kong; Adolescent; Child; Disabled Children; Exercise; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Schools"
"Is bridge to surgery stenting a safe alternative to emergency surgery in malignant colonic obstruction: a meta-analysis of randomized control trials",2019,"Background: Despite studies showing superior results in terms of reduced stoma rate and higher primary anastomosis rate, the safety of bridge to surgery stenting (BTS stent) for left-sided malignant colonic obstruction, especially in oncological terms, remains a concern. Aim: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether BTS stent is a safe alternative to emergency surgery (EmS). Methods: Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing BTS stent and EmS for left-sided colonic obstruction caused by primary cancer of the colon, up to Sep 2018, were retrieved from the Pubmed, Embase database, clinical trials registry of U. S. National Library of Medicine and BMJ and Google Search. Results: There were seven eligible RCTs, involving a total of 448 patients. Compared to EmS, BTS stent had a significantly lower risk of overall complications (RR = 0.605; 95% CI 0.382–0.958; p = 0.032). However, the overall recurrence rate was higher in the BTS stent group (37.0% vs. 25.9%; RR = 1.425; 95% CI 1.002–2.028; p = 0.049). BTS stent significantly increased the risk of systemic recurrence (RR = 1.627; 95% CI 1.009–2.621; p = 0.046). This did not translate into a significant difference in terms of 3-year disease-free survival or 3-year overall survival. Conclusion: BTS stent is associated with a lower rate of overall morbidities than EmS. However, BTS stent was associated with a greater chance of recurrence, especially systemic recurrence. Clinicians ought to be aware of the pros and cons of different interventions and tailor treatments for patients suffering from left-sided obstructing cancer of the colon. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article; bridge to surgery stenting; colon obstruction; disease free survival; emergency surgery; human; meta analysis; morbidity; mortality rate; multicenter study (topic); overall survival; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence risk; recurrent disease; surgical mortality; surgical technique; systematic review; systemic disease; adverse device effect; adverse event; anastomosis; colorectal tumor; complication; intestine obstruction; stent; survival analysis; Anastomosis, Surgical; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stents; Survival Analysis"
"Inhibition of autophagy enhances adenosine-induced apoptosis in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells",2019,"In cancer research, autophagy acts as a double-edged sword: It increases cell viability or induces cell apoptosis depending upon the cell context and functional status. Recent studies have shown that adenosine (Ado) has cytotoxic effects in many tumors. However, the role of autophagy in Ado-induced apoptosis is still poorly understood. In the present study, Ado-induced apoptotic death and autophagy in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells was investigated and the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis was identified. In the present study, it was demonstrated that Ado inhibited HepG2 cell growth in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, the increased mRNA and protein levels of GRP78/BiP, PERK, ATF4, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Ado also induced autophagic flux, revealed by the increased expression of the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II), Beclin-1, autophagosomes, and the degradation of p62, as revealed by western blot analysis and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) staining. Blocking autophagy using LY294002 notably entrenched Ado-induced growth inhibition and cell apoptosis, as demonstrated with the increased expression of cytochrome c and p62, and the decreased expression of LC3-II. Conversely, the autophagy inducer rapamycin alleviated Ado-induced apoptosis and markedly increased the ΔΨm. Moreover, knockdown of AMPK with si-AMPK partially abolished Ado-induced ULK1 activation and mTOR inhibition, and thus reinforced CHOP expression and Ado-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that Ado-induced ER stress resulted in apoptosis and autophagy concurrently. The AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway played a protective role in the apoptotic procession. Inhibition of autophagy may effectively enhance the anticancer effect of Ado in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Brain responses to stimuli mimicking dental treatment among non-phobic individuals: A meta-analysis",2019,"Numerous neuroimaging studies have attempted to identify how the brain responds to stimuli mimicking dental treatment in normal non-phobic individuals. However, results were sometimes inconsistent due to small sample sizes and methodological variations. This meta-analysis employs standardized procedures to summarize data from previous studies to identify brain regions that were consistently activated across studies, elicited by stimuli such as pictures, sounds, or audiovisual footage mimicking those encountered during dental treatments. A systematic literature search was carried out using PubMed and Scopus. The meta-analysis analyzed data from 120 healthy subjects from seven neuroimaging studies. We assessed the risk of bias among the included studies with the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. One study appeared to have a high risk of selection bias, whereas the others were considered to have a low risk of bias. Results revealed three clusters of activation with cluster sizes ranging from 768?mm3 to 1,424?mm3. Stimuli mimicking dental treatment consistently activated the bilateral anterior insula; right dorsal anterior cingulate, putamen, and medial prefrontal cortex; and left claustrum. This study confirmed that audio and/or visual stimuli mimicking dental treatment consistently activated the fear-related brain regions among healthy subjects, mostly consistent with activations from general anxiety but without the involvement of the amygdala. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"An evaluation of the air quality health index program on respiratory diseases in Hong Kong: An interrupted time series analysis",2019,"Background: On December 30th, 2013, the Hong Kong government implemented the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) alert programme warnings designed to reduce short-term effects of air pollution on population health. However, whether air quality alert programme warnings, such as the AQHI, reduce morbidity is still questionable. Using a quasi-experimental design, we conducted the first evaluation of the AQHI in Hong Kong focusing on respiratory morbidity. Method: Interrupted time series with Poisson segmented regression from 2010 to 2016 was used to detect any sudden or gradual changes in emergency respiratory hospital admissions, adjusted for air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10, O3), temperature and humidity, when the AQHI policy was implemented. The findings were validated using three false policy study periods and digestive diseases as a control. We also assessed effects on specific respiratory diseases (respiratory tract infections (RTI), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia) and by age. Results: From January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2016, 10576.98 deseasonalized, age-standardized hospital admissions for respiratory disease occurred in Hong Kong. On implementation of the AQHI, RTI admissions immediately dropped by 14% (relative risk (RR) 0.86 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76–0.98). In age specific analysis, immediate reductions in hospital admissions were only apparent in children for RTI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96) and pneumonia (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60–0.96). Conclusion: Hong Kong's AQHI helped reduced hospital admissions in children, particularly for RTI and pneumonia. To maximize health benefits of the policy, at risk groups need to be able to follow the behavioral changes recommended by the AQHI warnings. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Disease control; Health risks; Hospitals; Pulmonary diseases; Time series analysis; AQHI; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Confidence interval; Hospital admissions; Respiratory morbidity; Respiratory tract infections; Segmented regressions; Temperature and humidities; Quality control; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; confidence interval; health impact; index method; regression analysis; respiratory disease; time series analysis; adult; aged; air pollutant; air quality; Article; asthma; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; gastrointestinal disease; health program; Hong Kong; hospital admission; human; humidity; major clinical study; particulate matter; pneumonia; policy; priority journal; respiratory tract infection; temperature; China; Hong Kong"
"Recent trends in the prevalence of Helicobacter Pylori in symptomatic children: A 12-year retrospective study in a tertiary centre",2019,"Objective: Helicobacter pylori infection is common among Asians. However, evidence in the recent years has demonstrated a decrease in the prevalence of H. pylori infection among children and adults worldwide. Our aim was to update its prevalence in symptomatic children in our locality in the recent 12 years and compared to the results of our previous review published in 2005. Methods: A retrospective review was carried out between 2005 and 2017. All children who presented with dyspepsia or gastrointestinal bleeding and underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with antral biopsy taken were included. Patient demographics, endoscopic, or histological diagnosis and the H. pylori status were recorded. Main Results: A total of 602 patients were included. There was a statistically significant decreasing trend of H. pylori infection rate between 2005 and 2017 (p = 0.003). The overall infection rate from this study was 12.8%, compared to 25.6% from our previous review. Overall failure of eradication with first-line antibiotic therapy has increased to 29.3% from 10% in our previous review. Conclusion: There was a decrease in the prevalence of H. pylori infection among symptomatic children for the recent 12 years, comparing to our previous data from 2005. We hypothesize that the reduction in prevalence of H. pylori infection among adults and the decrease in the practice of sharing chopsticks during meals have led to a decrease in transmission of the bacteria among family members in Hong Kong. However, the failure of eradication with first line treatment was higher, possibly due to the increase in antibiotics usage and resistance.

"Myocardial oedema in an 8-year-old Chinese boy with Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome",2019,"Background: Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (ISCLS) is rare, and there has been about 32 cases reported in children worldwide since this disorder was first described in 1960. Clinical guidelines on the management approach stemming from robust scientific evidence are lacking. This case report presents the first reported paediatric case of severe ISCLS with significant myocardial oedema and emphasizes this disease’s impact on a child’s cardiac function. Case presentation: A Chinese boy had his first attack of severe hypovolaemic shock that responded to fluid resuscitation when he was 6 years of age. His second attack developed at 8 years of age. He was then transferred to our cardiac unit for refractory hypotensive shock. The patient’s echocardiogram revealed ventricular wall thickening with significant cardiac dysfunction requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Subsequently, he made a full recovery, including his myocardial wall thickness and function. The echocardiographic findings suggested myocardial oedema that was transient in nature. Clinical and laboratory investigation from both episodes were compatible with ISCLS. Conclusion: ISCLS is rare, and therefore there is only a limited understanding on the pathophysiology of this disorder. The current treatment approach is based on a few case reports and series. During the acute phase, optimal supportive management is paramount. Our case highlights the importance of early recognition and consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in patients with a life-threatening presentation, as it was lifesaving for this child who suffered myocardial oedema and ventricular dysfunction. ? 2019 The Author(s).","dopamine; hydrocortisone; immunoglobulin; noradrenalin; abdominal pain; anasarca; Article; capillary leak syndrome; case report; child; Chinese; clinical article; compartment syndrome; diarrhea; extracorporeal oxygenation; fever; fluid resuscitation; gastroenteritis; generalized edema; heart edema; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; hypoalbuminemia; hypotension; hypovolemic shock; kidney failure; lethargy; lung edema; male; metabolic acidosis; myocardial disease; myocardial edema; peroneal neuropathy; rhabdomyolysis; school child; tachycardia; vomiting; Asian continental ancestry group; capillary leak syndrome; cardiomyopathy; complication; edema; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Capillary Leak Syndrome; Cardiomyopathies; Child; Edema; Humans; Male"
"Novel nuclear partnering role of EPS8 with FOXM1 in regulating cell proliferation",2019,"One hallmark of cancer cells is sustaining proliferative signaling that leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Both the Forkhead box (FOX) M1 transcription factor and the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor Pathway Substrate 8 (EPS8) are known to be activated by mitogenic signaling and their levels upregulated in cancer. Well-known to regulate Rac-mediated actin remodeling at the cell cortex, EPS8 carries a nuclear localization signal but its possible nuclear role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated interaction of FOXM1 with EPS8 in yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays. Immunostaining revealed co-localization of the two proteins during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. EPS8 became nuclear localized when CRM1/Exportin 1-dependent nuclear export was inhibited by Leptomycin B, and a functional nuclear export signal could be identified within EPS8 using EGFP-tagging and site-directed mutagenesis. Downregulation of EPS8 using shRNAs suppressed expression of FOXM1 and the FOXM1-target CCNB1, and slowed down G2/M transition in cervical cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated recruitment of EPS8 to the CCNB1 and CDC25B promoters. Taken together, our findings support a novel partnering role of EPS8 with FOXM1 in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and provides interesting insight into future design of therapeutic strategy to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.

"EphrinB2/EphB4 Signaling Regulates DPSCs to Induce Sprouting Angiogenesis of Endothelial Cells",2019,"Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are capable of facilitating angiogenesis resembling pericytes when located adjacent to endothelial cells (ECs). Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms orchestrating their proangiogenic functions remain unclear. Using a 3-dimensional (3-D) fibrin gel model, we aimed to investigate whether EphrinB2/EphB4 signaling in DPSCs plays a role in supporting vascular morphogenesis mediated by ECs, together with the underlying mechanism involved. The EphrinB2/EphB4 signaling was inhibited either by a pharmacological inhibitor of EphB4 receptor or by knocking down the expressions of EphrinB2 and EphB4 using lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA). DPSCs were either encapsulated in fibrin gel together with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or cultured as a monolayer on top of HUVECs to investigate both paracrine and juxtacrine interactions simultaneously. Following 10 d of direct coculture, we found that pharmacological inhibition of EphrinB2/EphB4 signaling severely impaired vessel formation and laminin deposition. When directly cocultured with HUVECs, knockdown of EphrinB2 or EphB4 in DPSCs significantly inhibited endothelial sprouting, resulting in less capillary sprouts with reduced vessel length (P < 0.05). By contrast, when DPSCs were not in direct contact with HUVECs, attenuation of EphrinB2 or EphB4 expression levels in DPSCs did not exert any significant effects on capillary morphogenesis. Noticeably, exogenous stimulation with soluble EphrinB2-Fc or EphB4-Fc (1 ?g/mL) enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from DPSCs, thereby moderately promoting angiogenic cascades in the fibrin matrix. This study, for the first time, reveals a crucial role of EphrinB2/EphB4 signaling in regulating the capacity of DPSCs to induce sprouting angiogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of postnatal angiogenesis and may have future regenerative medicine applications. ? International & American Associations for Dental Research 2019.",""
"Clinical characteristics, rapid identification, molecular epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of Talaromyces marneffei infections in Shenzhen, China",2019,"Although case series of talaromycosis have been reported in China, their detailed clinical and microbiological characteristics have never been systematically profiled. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics, molecular epidemiology, rapid identification and antifungal susceptibilities of talaromycosis in The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital in Shenzhen. Seven cases of talaromycosis were observed since commencement of hospital service in 2012. Three patients were local Shenzhen residents, whereas the other four were immigrants from other parts of China. Two patients were HIV-negative, but with underlying diseases requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Two of the seven patients succumbed. All the seven isolates were successfully identified as T.?marneffei by MALDI–TOF MS using Bruker database expanded with in-house generated T.?marneffei mass spectra. MLST showed that the seven strains belonged to six different, novel sequences types. Phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated five-locus sequence revealed that the seven strains were scattered amongst other T.?marneffei strains. The MICs of itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole against the seven clinical isolates were low but MICs of anidulafungin were high. Underlying diseases other than HIV infection are increasingly important risk factors of talaromycosis. MALDI–TOF MS is useful for rapid identification.

"The potential role of human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) in the transport of Huperzine A in vitro",2020,"1. More than 30% of epilepsy patients suffer pharmacoresistance. Transport of antileptic drugs by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MRP2 plays an important role in drug-resistant epilepsy. Huperzine A (Hup-A) is a natural compound, which might have potential in treating neurological disorders including epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, we investigated whether human P-gp and MRP2 transport Hup-A. 2. LLC-PK1 and MDCKII cells transfected with human P-gp or MRP2 were used to establish concentration equilibrium transport assays (CETAs) and determine the transport profile of Hup-A. The expression of P-gp and MRP2 was detected by qPCR and western blotting. The transport function of P-gp and MRP2 was measured by Rho123 and CDFDA cell uptake assay. 3. In CETAs, Hup-A at concentrations of 10 ng/mL or 2??g/mL was transported by MDR1 and MRP2 from basolateral to apical sides of the cell monolayers. P-gp and MRP2 inhibitors completely blocked the efflux of Hup-A. There was no efflux of Hup-A in LLC-PK1 or MDCKII wild-type (WT) cells. 4. We demonstrate that Hup-A is a substrate of P-gp and MRP2. These results imply the efflux of Hup-A across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo, suggesting potential drug resistance of Hup-A. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","huperzine A; multidrug resistance associated protein 2; multidrug resistance protein 1; animal cell; Article; controlled study; drug transport; genetic transfection; human; human cell; in vitro study; LLC-PK1 cell line; MDCK-II cell line; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; transport assay; uptake assay; Western blotting"
"The family impact of dental general anaesthesia in children: A meta-analysis",2019,"Background: The health and well-being of children are intimately linked to their parents’ physical, emotional, and social health and social circumstances. Aim: To conduct a meta-analysis of studies that have used the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) and Child Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (COHRQoL) instruments, to evaluate the family impact scale (FIS) changes following their children's dental treatment under general anaesthesia (DGA). Methodology: A systematic search was undertaken using the PRISMA guidelines. The inclusion criteria consisted of patients below 16?years of age, DGA, pre- and post-operative assessments, and the use of ECOHIS and COHRQoL. FIS changes were the primary outcome measure, where the mean difference (MD) was calculated. Results: After initial search of 105 studies in the database, twenty-one articles were included in the analysis. A positive outcome in the FIS changes was identified in all studies. The combined MD for FIS using ECOHIS and COHRQoL was 1.52 [95% CI: 1.15-1.89; P?&lt;?0.00001; I 2 =87%] and 1.10 [95% CI: 0.68-1.52; P?&lt;?0.00001; I 2 =79%], respectively. Conclusions: Dental treatment with general anaesthesia for children had a significant positive impact on parental emotions, activity, and conflict. Following DGA, there was significant improvement in the FIS, with large MD. ? 2018 BSPD, IAPD and John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Neighborhood-based subjective environmental vulnerability index for community health assessment: Development, validation and evaluation",2019,"Neighborhood-based environmental vulnerability is significantly associated with long-term community health impacts. Previous studies have quantified environmental vulnerability using objective environmental datasets. However, environmental cognition among a population may influence subjective feelings of environmental vulnerability, and this can be associated with community health risk. In this study, a mixed-methods approach was applied to estimate neighborhood-based environmental vulnerability based on objective environmental measures and subjective environmental understanding from a local population. The synergistic use of both qualitative and quantitative data resulted in a “subjective environmental vulnerability” index which can demonstrate environmental deprivation across Hong Kong. The resultant maps were compared with a mortality dataset between 2007 and 2014, based on a case-series analysis. The case-series analysis indicated that using a subjective environmental vulnerability index as an approach for neighborhood mapping is able to estimate the community health risk across Hong Kong. In particular, the following types of cause-specific mortality have significant association with the subjective environmental vulnerability index: 1) mortality associated with mental and behavioral disorders, 2) cardiovascular mortality, 3) respiratory mortality, and 4) mortality associated with diseases of the digestive system. In conclusion, the use of a subjective environmental vulnerability index can be implemented within a community health planning program, especially to reduce long-term adverse impacts on population with mental impairment. ? 2018","Digestive system; Health; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Community health; Deprivation index; Environmental cognitions; Environmental measures; Environmental vulnerability; Spatial analytics; Health risks; cognition; health impact; health risk; mental health; mortality; neighborhood; risk assessment; spatial analysis; vulnerability; adult; air pollution; air temperature; Article; building; cancer mortality; cardiovascular mortality; case study; cause specific mortality; city; cohort analysis; controlled study; environmental factor; female; health hazard; heat; Hong Kong; human; male; mortality; neighborhood; personal income; priority journal; public health; risk assessment; sex ratio; suburban population; summer; urban population; urban rural difference; vulnerable population; air pollutant; analysis; cardiovascular disease; demography; environmental exposure; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; China; Hong Kong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Environmental Exposure; Hong Kong; Humans; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Residence Characteristics"
"Older Adults' Perceptions of Age-friendliness in Hong Kong",2019,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is little understanding about how rapid urban development has affected the extent to which communities are able to optimize health and participation opportunities for older adults in Hong Kong. Our objective was to examine what older residents perceive to be the shortcomings of their communities in meeting their psychosocial and physical needs as they age. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In reference to the WHO Age-Friendly Cities Project Methodology: Vancouver Protocol, we conducted nine focus groups comprising 65 participants for an Age-Friendly City baseline assessment in two districts in Hong Kong, China. Participants were asked to share their views on their respective district of residence, and identify aspects of the city they found unfriendly. Data generated from interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five of the following key themes were identified: the failure of public transportation to cater to the needs of older adults; a lack of public space for recreation and socializing; diminishing human interactions in welfare services; physical and financial challenges relating to housing; and workplace discrimination against older adults. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing the social welfare of older adults in building a more inclusive and age-friendly city. They also highlight the difficulties in fostering an inclusive environment while ensuring efficiency and profit maximization. ? The Author(s) 2018.

"Seasonal characteristics and particle-size distributions of particulate air pollutants in Urumqi",2019,"Urban particulate air pollution is a known cause of adverse human health effects worldwide. Urumqi is a large oasis city in which rapid urbanization has caused a series of eco-environmental problems including serious air pollution, water shortage, dense population, excess energy consumption, and the creation of an urban heat island, among others. Coal is the most important source of energy and air pollutants that are poorly dispersed into the natural surroundings are the main reasons for serious pollution in the Urumqi urban area. Using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), aerosol levels were determined using the double optical path method. We found that aerosol concentrations in Urumqi increased rapidly in winter, and that the concentration of fine particles was much higher than that of coarse particles. The background aerosol concentration was highest in winter in the research area, and the air-flow speed had a significant impact on this because high speed surface winds that correspond to high air flows can transport the aerosol to other places. Some of the observed day-to-night differences may be caused by differing wind directions that transport air masses from different emission sources during the day and the night. Daily and seasonal differences in PM 1.0 concentrations of different grades of polluted air were statistically analyzed using average daily concentration data for particles smaller than 10, 2.5 and 1.0 microns (PM 10 , PM 2.5 and PM 1.0 ), and meteorological observations for Urumqi, Tianshan District in 2010. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Associations Between Rejection Sensitivity, Aggression, and Victimization: A Meta-Analytic Review",2019,"Background: Rejection sensitivity (RS) is a personality disposition characterized by oversensitivity to social rejection; individuals who are sensitive to social rejection tend to anxiously or angrily expect, readily perceive, and overreact to it. The associations between (a) RS and aggression and (b) RS and victimization have been studied in recent years. However, the strength of these associations varied considerably between studies. This review aimed to synthesize the primary literature to improve our insight into these associations. Method: A comprehensive literature search yielded 52 studies (with a total of 66,405 participants and producing 203 effect sizes) on the RS-aggression and RS-victimization associations. Three-level meta-analytic models were used to synthesize effect sizes and to examine potential moderators of the RS-aggression association and the RS-victimization association, respectively. Results: There was a small but significant association between RS and aggression (pooled r =.183; p <.001) and a slightly below moderate and significant association between RS and victimization (pooled r =.298; p <.001). The RS-aggression association was stronger for angry RS than for anxious RS and stronger for reactive aggression than for proactive aggression. Similar results were obtained in analyzing the longitudinal associations only. Conclusions: RS is significantly associated with aggression and victimization. The implications of the results for clinical practice as well as directions for future research are discussed. ?

"Cobalt nanowire-based multifunctional platform for targeted chemo-photothermal synergistic cancer therapy",2019,"Cobalt nanowires (CoNWs)simultaneously possessing advantages in photothermal effect, targeting drug delivery and photoacoustic imaging property are hopefully promising strategies to further improve the treatment efficiency and reduce the side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Herein, a unique cobalt-based structure decorated with graphene oxide (GO)and polyethylene glycol (PEG)is fabricated through a facile approach. The resultant nanohybrids show relatively low cytotoxicity, favorable biocompatibility as well as inherit the outstanding properties of cobalt. Moreover, CoNWs decorated with GO and PEG (CoNWs-GO-PEG)can load therapeutic drug molecules (e.g., doxorubicin, DOX)with a high drug loading capacity (992.91 mg/g), and simultaneously they are responsive to pH, NIR (near-infrared)irradiation and magnetism stimulation. Accordingly, CoNWs-GO-PEG-DOX shows the satisfactory effect of eliminating cancer cells with synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy in vitro. Current work provides a solid demonstration of the potential of CoNWs-GO-PEG for serving as a targeted antitumor agent in synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biocompatibility; Chemotherapy; Diseases; Drug delivery; Graphene; Graphene oxide; Infrared devices; Nanowires; Oncology; Cancer therapy; Cobalt nanowires; Multifunctional platforms; Photo-acoustic imaging; Photo-thermal; Photothermal therapy; Targeted; Targeting drug deliveries; Cobalt compounds; cobalt nanowire; doxorubicin; graphene oxide; macrogol; nanowire; unclassified drug; cobalt; doxorubicin; graphite; nanowire; Article; biocompatibility; cancer chemotherapy; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug release; in vitro study; infrared radiation; Leporidae; magnetism; nanofabrication; nonhuman; pH; photothermal therapy; priority journal; synergistic chemophotothermal therapy; 3T3 cell line; animal; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; hemolysis; mouse; neoplasm; phototherapy; surface property; thermotherapy; tumor cell line; ultrastructure; 3T3 Cells; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Cobalt; Doxorubicin; Drug Liberation; Graphite; Hemolysis; Hyperthermia, Induced; Magnetic Phenomena; Mice; Nanowires; Neoplasms; Phototherapy; Polyethylene Glycols; Rabbits; Surface Properties"
"Breastfeeding outcomes among early-term and full-term infants",2019,"Background: When compared with full-term birth (39 to <42 weeks), early-term birth (37 to <39 weeks) is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes that may impede breastfeeding. Breastfeeding provides numerous benefits to infants and could potentially offset the effects of early-term birth. However, the effect of early-term birth on any and exclusive breastfeeding duration among healthy normal weight infants is unclear. Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the association between early-term birth and breastfeeding duration and exclusivity among healthy term infants. Methods: Two prospective cohorts of 2704 healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited in Hong Kong in 2006–07 and 2011–12. Participants were followed prospectively for 12 months or until they stopped breastfeeding. Results: Approximately one-third (32.8%) of the infants were born early-term. More than one-half of all participants had stopped breastfeeding by three months postpartum and approximately one-half of the infants were not being exclusively breastfed by two weeks postpartum. There was no significant difference in the odds of any (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.05; 95% 0.85, 1.31) or exclusive (aOR = 0.89; 95% 0.73, 1.08) breastfeeding at one-month postpartum between infants born early-term and at full-term. There was also no significant difference in the duration of any (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.0; 95% 0.91, 1.10) or exclusive (aHR = 1.0; 95% 0.91, 1.09) breastfeeding between early-term and full-term infants. Conclusion: In this cohort, early-term birth was not associated with breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. This suggests that, in the absence of neonatal complications, early-term birth itself may not lead to a shorter duration of any or exclusive breastfeeding. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; breast feeding; cohort analysis; female; gestational age; Hong Kong; human; newborn; outcome assessment; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; procedures; proportional hazards model; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; term birth; time factor; Adult; Breast Feeding; Cohort Studies; Female; Gestational Age; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Term Birth; Time Factors"
"Classic SRY-box protein SOX7 functions as a tumor suppressor regulating WNT signaling and is methylated in renal cell carcinoma",2019,"SOX7(SRY-relatedhighmobilitygroupbox7),ahighmobilitygroupprotein, is reportedtobedown-regulated in several cancer types, which indicates an important role in tumorigenesis; however, its biologic role in renal cell carcinoma(RCC)pathogenesis remainsunknown.Westudiedthealterationsandfunctions ofSOX7inRCC.Wedetected its broad expression inmultiplehumannormal tissues, including kidney,but frequentdown-regulation inRCCcell lines and primary tumors. Promoter CpG methylation seems to directly mediate SOX7 silencing in RCC cells,which could be reversed by demethylation treatment. SOX7 methylation was detected in primary RCC tumors, but rarely in normal kidney tissues. Restoration of SOX7 in silenced 786-O and A498 RCC cell lines inhibited their cell growth by inducing G0/G1 arrest,whereas SOX7knockdown promotedRCCcell proliferation.Wealso found that SOX7silencing resulted in the activation of WNT signaling and the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that SOX7 is frequently inactivated by promoter CpGmethylation in RCC and functions as a tumor suppressor by regulatingWNTsignaling. ?

"Emerging threats and persistent conservation challenges for freshwater biodiversity",2019,"In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment. ? 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society","fresh water; animal; biodiversity; climate change; environmental protection; human; risk factor; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fresh Water; Humans; Risk Factors"
"Infectious complications in lupus nephritis treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Objectives: Infection is an important concern in lupus nephritis treatment, but few studies have focused on this complication. Available data suggest marked variation in occurrence and outcome. This meta-analysis and review aims to provide an overview of infective complications, focusing on the risk factors and outcomes. Methods: Original articles on lupus nephritis Class III/IV/V published in the period January 1980 to December 2016 were identified from the Pubmed/Medline electronic database. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to investigate total and serious infections at different phases of treatment and their associated factors. A descriptive review that included all studies was also performed, providing details on the types of infection, infection-related mortality, and potential impact of different eras on infection rates. Results: A total of 56 studies (32 randomized controlled trials) were included. The incidence rates of overall and serious infections were higher during the induction than maintenance phase of therapy, with serious infections occurring at 8.2–50 and 3.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively. Recent data, predominantly from Asia, suggested lower rates of overall infections with induction regimens that included tacrolimus compared with mycophenolate (risk ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.33–0.76, p = 0.001). Mycophenolate as induction treatment was associated with lower overall infection risks than cyclophosphamide in non-Asians (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.48–0.75, p < 0.001). The rates of serious infections were 4.1–25% in Asian and 4.4–8.5% in non-Asian countries; with infection-related mortality rates of 0–6.7% in Asian, compared to 0–2.1% in non-Asian locations. Conclusions: Infection remains a serious complication during treatment of lupus nephritis, but the reported rates and outcomes varied markedly. Mycophenolate was associated with lower infection risk than cyclophosphamide in non-Asians. Infection-related deaths appeared more common in Asian patients. ?

"Chat-based instant messaging support combined with brief smoking cessation interventions for Chinese community smokers in Hong Kong: Rationale and study protocol for a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Novel approaches to engage community smokers in smoking cessation are needed as smokers typically lack motivation to quit or use evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment. Mobile instant messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger) are widely used but under-studied as a mobile health modality for delivering smoking cessation support. This paper presents the rationale and study design of a trial which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a chat-based intervention using mobile instant messaging combined with brief interventions for community smokers. Methods: This is a two-arm, parallel, accessor-blinded, pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial on an estimated 1172 daily cigarette smokers aged ?18 years proactively recruited from 68 community sites (cluster) throughout Hong Kong. Subjects in intervention group received three months of chat-based, instant messaging support guided by acceptance and commitment therapy and other behavioural change techniques, integrated with brief advice and active referral to a smoking cessation service using the AWARD (Ask, Warn, Advise, Refer, Do-it-again) intervention model. Control group received brief advice to quit plus a self-help booklet at baseline. Outcomes were assessed at 1-, 2-, 3- and 6-month after baseline. The primary outcome is abstinence validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (<4 ppm) and salivary cotinine (<10 ng/mL) at 6-month after baseline. Primary analyses will be based on intention-to-treat. Comments: This is the first trial examining the effectiveness of a chat-based cessation support programme combined with brief interventions in promoting abstinence. The intervention model can be adapted for other behavioural change treatments and more advanced digital smoking cessation intervention. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","carbon monoxide; cotinine; acceptance and commitment therapy; adult; Article; behavior change; Chinese; cigarette smoking; community; controlled study; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; mobile application; outcome assessment; parallel design; pragmatic trial; program effectiveness; randomized controlled trial; smoking cessation program; text messaging"
"Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation for post-traumatic stress disorder: Assessor-blinded, randomized controlled study",2019,"Aim: Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) has the potential to alleviate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to determine whether adding TEAS to sertraline or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could improve the anti-PTSD efficacy. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 240 PTSD patients (60 in each group) were assigned to receive simulated TEAS combined with sertraline (group A) or with CBT (group B), active TEAS combined with CBT (group C), or active TEAS combined with CBT plus sertraline (group D) for 12 weeks. The outcomes were measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, PTSD Check List-Civilian Version, and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Results: While PTSD symptoms reduced over time in all patients, groups C and D had markedly greater improvement in both PTSD and depressive measures than groups A and B in all post-baseline measurement points, with moderate to very large effect sizes of 0.484–2.244. Groups C and D also had a significantly higher rate than groups A and B on clinical response (85.0% and 95.0% vs 63.3% and 60.0%, P < 0.001) and on remission (15.0% and 25.0% vs 3.3% and 1.7%, P < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups A and D and between groups B and C. Conclusions: Additional TEAS augments the anti-PTSD and antidepressant efficacy of antidepressants or CBT, without increasing the incidence of adverse effects. TEAS could serve as an effective intervention for PTSD and comorbid depression. This trial was registered with www.chictr.org (no.: ChiCTR1800017255). ? 2018 The Authors.

"The impact of GDF-15, a biomarker for metformin, on the risk of coronary artery disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits: a Mendelian randomisation study",2019,"Aims/hypothesis: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a suggested biomarker for metformin use, may explain the potential cardioprotective and anti-cancer properties of metformin. We conducted a Mendelian randomisation study to examine the role of GDF-15 in risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and breast and colorectal cancer. Secondary analyses included examination of the association of GDF-15 with type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits, BP, lipids and BMI. Methods: We obtained SNPs strongly (p value &lt;5 × 10?8) predicting GDF-15 from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 5440) and applied them to genetic studies of CAD (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes-based GWAS [n = 184,305]), type 2 diabetes (DIAGRAM [DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis; n = 898,130]), glycaemic traits (MAGIC [the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium; HbA1c: n = 123,665; fasting glucose: n = 46,186]), BP, breast cancer and colorectal cancer (UK Biobank [n ? 401,447]), lipids (GLGC [Global Lipids Genetic Consortium; n ? 92,820]) and adiposity (GIANT [Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits Consortium; n = 681,275]). Causal estimates were obtained using inverse variance weighting, taking into account correlations between SNPs. Sensitivity analyses included focusing on the lead SNP (rs888663) and validation for CAD in the UK Biobank and for breast cancer in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Results: Using 5 SNPs, increased GDF-15 was associated with lower CAD (OR 0.93 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.87, 0.99) and breast cancer (OR 0.89 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.82, 0.96), with similar results from lead SNP analysis. However, the associations with CAD (OR 0.99 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.93, 1.04) and breast cancer (OR 0.97 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.94, 1.01) in the validation studies were not as apparent. GDF-15 was not associated with type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits, CAD risk factors or colorectal cancer. Conclusions/interpretation: There is no convincing evidence that GDF-15 reduces risk of CAD or breast or colorectal cancer. Whether the observed inverse association of metformin use with cancer risk is via other unexplored mechanistic pathways warrants further investigation. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","biological marker; glucose; growth differentiation factor 15; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; adult; Article; body mass; breast cancer; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; coronary artery disease; coronary risk; diastolic blood pressure; female; genetic association; genome-wide association study; glucose blood level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; major clinical study; male; Mendelian randomization analysis; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; protein function; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; systolic blood pressure"
"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasties in Hong Kong: 15 years of experience in a teaching hospital",2019,"Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a growing problem in an aging population. Unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKA) have been used for management of isolated OA of the medial tibiofemoral joint. This is the first study on the usage of UKA in Hong Kong. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing medial compartment UKA in a tertiary referral center since 2003. Preoperative and postoperative International Knee Society Knee Scores (KSKS) and Knee Societal Functional Assessment (KSFA) scores, range of motion, flexion deformity, and lower limb mechanical alignment were measured. Statistical analysis using paired sample t-tests was performed. Revision operations, rate of revisions, and causes of failure were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of risk factors for revision operation were performed against patient demographics, type of prosthesis, postoperative alignment, and degree of correction. Results: There were 94 UKA performed with an average follow-up of 4.3 years (range: 0.5–15.2 years). The KSKS and KSFA scores improved from 54.5 and 54.0 to 85.6 and 64.5 (p < 0.01), respectively. There was no significant improvement in the range of motion (p = 0.87) and fixed flexion deformity (p = 0.14). Mechanical alignment improved from 172.1° to 174.9° varus postoperatively (p < 0.01). Six cases required revision operation with a revision rate of 1.50 per 100 observed component years. Causes of revision included two cases of tibial tray loosening and one case each of progressive OA, mechanical failure, persistent pain, and infection. Logistic regression analysis for risk factors showed no statistical significance. Conclusions: UKA offers good functional improvement but further long-term studies are required to evaluate survivorship. ?

"Benchmarking Complications Associated with Esophagectomy",2019,"OBJECTIVE: Utilizing a standardized dataset with specific definitions to prospectively collect international data to provide a benchmark for complications and outcomes associated with esophagectomy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Outcome reporting in oncologic surgery has suffered from the lack of a standardized system for reporting operative results particularly complications. This is particularly the case for esophagectomy affecting the accuracy and relevance of international outcome assessments, clinical trial results, and quality improvement projects. METHODS: The Esophageal Complications Consensus Group (ECCG) involving 24 high-volume esophageal surgical centers in 14 countries developed a standardized platform for recording complications and quality measures associated with esophagectomy. Using a secure online database (ESODATA.org), ECCG centers prospectively recorded data on all resections according to the ECCG platform from these centers over a 2-year period. RESULTS: Between January 2015 and December 2016, 2704 resections were entered into the database. All demographic and follow-up data fields were 100% complete. The majority of operations were for cancer (95.6%) and typically located in the distal esophagus (56.2%). Some 1192 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (46.1%) and 763 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (29.5%). Surgical approach involved open procedures in 52.1% and minimally invasive operations in 47.9%. Chest anastomoses were done most commonly (60.7%) and R0 resections were accomplished in 93.4% of patients. The overall incidence of complications was 59% with the most common individual complications being pneumonia (14.6%) and atrial dysrhythmia (14.5%). Anastomotic leak, conduit necrosis, chyle leaks, recurrent nerve injury occurred in 11.4%, 1.3%, 4.7%, and 4.2% of cases, respectively. Clavien-Dindo complications ? IIIb occurred in 17.2% of patients. Readmissions occurred in 11.2% of cases and 30- and 90-day mortality was 2.4% and 4.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Standardized methods provide contemporary international benchmarks for reporting outcomes after esophagectomy.","adult; adverse event; aged; benchmarking; clinical trial; esophagus resection; esophagus tumor; female; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; postoperative complication; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Benchmarking; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Treatment Outcome"
"Reprogramming factors induce proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of melanoma cells by changing the expression of particular genes",2019,"Uncontrolled proliferation and defective apoptosis are two major factors responsible for maintaining the malignant properties of melanoma cells. Our previous study demonstrated that induced expression of four reprogramming factors remodeled the phenotype of B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells into melanoma stem cells. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of the four Yamanaka reprogramming factors, namely Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM), on the proliferation and apoptosis of melanoma cells, and to identify the responsible molecular signals. The results identified that expression of the four reprogramming factors was highly induced by doxycycline treatment in the stable melanoma cell clone that was transfected with a plasmid expressing these factors, driven by the Tet-On element. It was further confirmed that induced expression of these factors enhanced the proliferation and suppressed the apoptosis of the melanoma cells. In addition, induced OSKM expression increased cell proliferation, accelerated the progression of the cell cycle, and upregulated the mRNA expression levels of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Cyclin-B1. Induced expression of these factors also decreased the apoptosis, as well as upregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and downregulated BCL-2-associated X (BAX) mRNA expression levels. Taken together, the results suggested that upregulated JAK2 and Cyclin-B1 may be responsible for the enhanced proliferation of melanoma cells, and that BCL-2 upregulation and BAX downregulation may account for the suppressed apoptosis of these cells. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Bias-adjusted Kaplan–Meier survival curves for marginal treatment effect in observational studies",2019,"For time-to-event outcomes, the Kaplan–Meier estimator is commonly used to estimate survival functions of treatment groups and to compute marginal treatment effects, such as the difference in survival rates between treatments at a landmark time. The derived estimates of the marginal treatment effect are uniformly consistent under general conditions when data are from randomized clinical trials. For data from observational studies, however, these statistical quantities are often biased due to treatment-selection bias. Propensity score-based methods estimate the survival function by adjusting for the disparity of propensity scores between treatment groups. Unfortunately, misspecification of the regression model can lead to biased estimates. Using an empirical likelihood (EL) method in which the moments of the covariate distribution of treatment groups are constrained to equality, we obtain consistent estimates of the survival functions and the marginal treatment effect. Equating moments of the covariate distribution between treatment groups simulate the covariate distribution that would have been obtained if the patients had been randomized to these treatment groups. We establish the consistency and the asymptotic limiting distribution of the proposed EL estimators. We demonstrate that the proposed estimator is robust to model misspecification. Simulation is used to study the finite sample properties of the proposed estimator. The proposed estimator is applied to a lung cancer observational study to compare two surgical procedures in treating early-stage lung cancer patients. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article; bootstrapping; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; data analysis; disease free survival; early cancer; empirical likelihood; gender; health disparity; health insurance; human; Kaplan Meier method; lung cancer; observational study; priority journal; propensity score; race; rank sum test; selection bias; simulation; statistical bias; survival rate; therapy effect; tumor volume; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery"
"Rapid CD4 T-cell decline is associated with coreceptor switch among MSM primarily infected with HIV-1 CRF01-AE in Northeast China",2019,"CRF01-AE is the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype among MSM in China. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanism of the accelerated CD4 T-cell decline in CRF01-AE-infected MSM remain incompletely understood.Design:A long-term prospective follow-up study was conducted with 1388 MSM at risk of HIV-1 infection in Northeast China. MSM with primary HIV-1 CRF01-AE infection were identified and followed for 3-6 years to explore the determinants of rapid CD4 T-cell decline.Methods:Tropism was determined in primary infection by both single genome amplification-based genotypic prediction using four different algorithms and phenotypic determination using clinical isolates. Serial isolates were used to determine phenotype of coreceptor switch. Human leukocyte antigen genotypes and T-cell activation markers were determined.Results:Fifty-nine MSM primarily infected with HIV-1 CRF01-AE were discovered and recruited for the follow-up study. CCR5-utilizing (R5) viruses accounted for up to 98% of HIV-1 CRF01-AE infections in Northeast China. Survival analysis indicated 39.5% of the patients underwent coreceptor switch within 3 years after infection. After adjustment for other potential risk factors, linear mixed-effect models demonstrated patients experienced R5 to CXCR4-utilizing/dual-tropic (X4/DM) coreceptor switch within 3 years after infection underwent a faster CD4 T-cell decline compared to those without coreceptor switch.Conclusions:Primary HIV-1 CRF01-AE infection among MSM in Northeast China is characterized by R5 viral infection and early R5 to X4/DM coreceptor switch, which is associated with rapid CD4 T-cell decline. The findings highlight the importance of immediate treatment among the CRF01-AE-infected MSM. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Constituents of household air pollution and risk of lung cancer among never-smoking women in Xuanwei and Fuyuan, China",2019,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer rates among never-smoking women in Xuanwei and Fuyuan in China are among the highest in the world and have been attributed to the domestic use of smoky (bituminous) coal for heating and cooking. However, the key components of coal that drive lung cancer risk have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the relationship between lifelong exposure to the constituents of smoky coal (and other fuel types) and lung cancer. METHODS: Using a population-based case-control study of lung cancer among 1,015 never-smoking female cases and 485 controls, we examined the association between exposure to 43 household air pollutants and lung cancer. Pollutant predictions were derived from a comprehensive exposure assessment study, which included methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have never been directly evaluated in an epidemiological study of any cancer. Hierarchical clustering and penalized regression were applied in order to address high colinearity in exposure variables. RESULTS: The strongest association with lung cancer was for a cluster of 25 PAHs [odds ratio (OR): 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.67, 2.87 per 1 standard deviation (SD) change], within which 5-methylchrysene (5-MC), a mutagenic and carcinogenic PAH, had the highest individual observed OR (5.42; 95% CI: 0.94, 27.5). A positive association with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was also observed (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.49). By contrast, neither benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) nor fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ?2:5 lm (PM2:5) were associated with lung cancer in the multipollutant models. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the association between lung cancer and household air pollution (HAP) constituents estimated over the entire life course. Given the global ubiquity of coal use domestically for indoor cooking and heating and commercially for electric power generation, our study suggests that more extensive monitoring of coal combustion products, including methylated PAHs, may be warranted to more accurately assess health risks and develop prevention strategies from this exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4913. ? 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

"Rethinking safety in numbers: Are intersections with more crossing pedestrians really safer?",2019,"Objective To advance the interpretation of the 'safety in numbers' effect by addressing the following three questions. How should the safety of pedestrians be measured, as the safety of individual pedestrians or as the overall safety of road facilities for pedestrians? Would intersections with large numbers of pedestrians exhibit a favourable safety performance? Would encouraging people to walk be a sound safety countermeasure? Methods We selected 288 signalised intersections with 1003 pedestrian crashes in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2012. We developed a Bayesian Poisson-lognormal model to calculate two common indicators related to pedestrian safety: the expected crash rate per million crossing pedestrians and the expected excess crash frequency. The ranking results of these two indicators for the selected intersections were compared. Results We confirmed a significant positive association between pedestrian volumes and pedestrian crashes, with an estimated coefficient of 0.21. Although people who crossed at intersections with higher pedestrian volumes experienced a relatively lower crash risk, these intersections may still have substantial potential for crash reduction. Conclusions Conclusions on the safety in numbers effect based on a cross-sectional analysis should be reached with great caution. The safety of individual pedestrians can be measured based on the crash risk, whereas the safety of road facilities for pedestrians should be determined by the environmental hazards of walking. Intersections prevalent of pedestrians do not always exhibit favourable safety performance. Relative to increasing the number of pedestrians, safety strategies should focus on reducing environmental hazards and removing barriers to walking. ?

"Treating HR+/HER2? breast cancer in premenopausal Asian women: Asian Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 2019 Consensus and position on ovarian suppression",2019,"Purpose: Breast cancer in young Asian women has distinctive clinicopathological characteristics; hence, we question the universal generalizability of treatment recommendations based on data from predominantly non-Asian postmenopausal women. Methods: The Asian Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (ABCCG) reviewed current ESO-ESMO and St. Gallen recommendations for treating hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2?) breast cancer in premenopausal women. Points disputed by ? 3/12 members were discussed, and statements on contentious issues formulated for anonymous voting; consensus required a ? 75% majority. Results: The ABCCG contends that: (1) Trials in premenopausal women are not only necessary, but also worthwhile if performed separately from others that also enroll postmenopausal participants. (2) Not all premenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer need adjuvant ovarian function suppression (OFS). (3) Certain clinical factors might influence decision-making about prescribing OFS. (4) For early HR+/HER2? breast cancer in premenopausal patients with OFS, tamoxifen is preferred for intermediate-risk cases; for high risk, near-consensus supported aromatase inhibitor, despite no clear overall survival benefit versus tamoxifen. (5) Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score? has different treatment implications in patients aged ? 50 versus &gt; 50?years. (6) High-risk patients (if premenopausal after chemotherapy) should receive adjuvant chemotherapy and OFS plus aromatase inhibitor. (7) For patients with advanced disease receiving OFS on a backbone of tamoxifen, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists may be given 12-weekly. (8) For premenopausal women who decline OFS or oophorectomy, tamoxifen alone is still an option but is considered less effective; other monotherapies are also less effective than OFS plus such treatments. Conclusion: Premenopausal Asian women with breast cancer have unique disease characteristics and may benefit from treatment that differs somewhat from international guidelines. Given the great diversity of patients and clinical settings worldwide, the ABCCG advocates evidence-based yet flexible and individualized use of all potential options to improve breast cancer outcomes. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aromatase inhibitor; cyclin dependent kinase 4 inhibitor; cyclin dependent kinase 6 inhibitor; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor; gonadorelin agonist; mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase inhibitor; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor; tamoxifen; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; advanced cancer; Asian; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer inhibition; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical decision making; clinical trial (topic); consensus; disease free survival; early cancer; female; high risk patient; hormonal therapy; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; intermediate risk patient; monotherapy; ovariectomy; ovary function; overall survival; premenopause; prescription; priority journal; Review; treatment outcome; age; Asian continental ancestry group; breast tumor; cancer grading; consensus development; genetics; metabolism; premenopause; Age Factors; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Breast Neoplasms; Clinical Trials as Topic; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Premenopause; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Progesterone; Treatment Outcome"
"Health Beliefs of Wearing Facemasks for Influenza A/H1N1 Prevention: A Qualitative Investigation of Hong Kong Older Adults",2019,"Although vaccination is the first-line strategy controlling and preventing influenza A/H1N1 for older adults, personal protective measures, such as wearing facemasks, are also important preventive behaviors to reduce the risk of becoming infected with influenza A/H1N1 during a pandemic. In the current study, we aimed to explore the belief-related psychological factors of wearing facemasks for influenza A/H1N1 prevention in a sample of Hong Kong older adults. Community-dwelling Chinese adults (N = 137) aged between 65 and 80 years (Mage = 75.10; SDage = 6.49) participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using theoretical thematic analysis and identified themes were matched deductively within the belief-based processes of the health belief model. Results revealed beliefs that underpinned 4 general dimensions of facemask wearing: (1) perceived susceptibility and seriousness of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic (e.g., influenza A/H1N1 as contagious and lethal), (2) modifying factors (e.g., social responsibility to prevent influenza), (3) cues to action (e.g., seeing others doing it), and (4) perceived benefits and barriers (e.g., protects oneself and others, difficult to breathe). Future interventions can target these beliefs to improve facemask wearing of older adults and, thus, curb preventable infection rates during an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. ? 2019 APJPH.","aged; attitude to health; female; Hong Kong; human; influenza; Influenza A virus (H1N1); male; mask; qualitative research; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Male; Masks; Qualitative Research"
"Social inequalities in neighborhood visual walkability: Using street view imagery and deep learning technologies to facilitate healthy city planning",2019,"It is of great significance both in theory and in practice to propose an efficient approach to approximating visual walkability given urban residents' growing leisure needs. Recent advancements in sensing and computing technologies provide new opportunities in this regard. This paper first proposes a conceptual framework for understanding street visual walkability and then employs deep learning technologies to segment and extract physical features from Baidu Map Street View (BMSV) imagery using the case of Shenzhen City in China. Guided by this framework, four indicators are calculated based on the segmented imagery and further integrated into the visual walkability index (VWI), whose reliability is validated through manual interpretation and a subjective scoring experiment. Our results show that deep learning technologies achieve higher accuracy in segmenting street view imagery than the traditional K-means clustering algorithm and support vector machine algorithm. Moreover, the developed VWI is effective to measure visual walkability, and it presents great heterogeneity across streets within Shenzhen. Spatial regression further identifies that significant social inequalities are associated with neighborhood visual walkability. According to the findings, implications and suggestions on planning the healthy city are proposed. The methodological procedure is reduplicative and can be applied to other unfeasible or challenging cases. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Computation theory; K-means clustering; Computing technology; Conceptual frameworks; Human perception; Learning technology; Social inequalities; Streetscape; Support vector machine algorithm; Visual walkability; Deep learning"
"Surgical stress and cancer progression: The twisted tango",2019,"Surgical resection is an important avenue for cancer treatment, which, in most cases, can effectively alleviate the patient symptoms. However, accumulating evidence has documented that surgical resection potentially enhances metastatic seeding of tumor cells. In this review, we revisit the literature on surgical stress, and outline the mechanisms by which surgical stress, including ischemia/reperfusion injury, activation of sympathetic nervous system, inflammation, systemically hypercoagulable state, immune suppression and effects of anesthetic agents, promotes tumor metastasis. We also propose preventive strategies or resolution of tumor metastasis caused by surgical stress. ? 2019 The Author(s).",""

"Immediate versus delayed exercise in men initiating androgen deprivation: effects on bone density and soft tissue composition",2019,"Objectives: To examine whether it is more efficacious to commence exercise medicine in men with prostate cancer at the onset of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) rather than later on during treatment to preserve bone and soft-tissue composition, as ADT results in adverse effects including: reduced bone mineral density (BMD), loss of muscle mass, and increased fat mass (FM). Patients and methods: In all, 104 patients with prostate cancer, aged 48–84?years initiating ADT, were randomised to immediate exercise (IMEX, n?=?54) or delayed exercise (DEL, n?=?50) conditions. The former consisted of 6?months of supervised resistance/aerobic/impact exercise and the latter comprised 6?months of usual care followed by 6?months of the identical exercise programme. Regional and whole body BMD, lean mass (LM), whole body FM and trunk FM, and appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) were assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry, and muscle density by peripheral quantitative computed tomography at baseline, and at 6 and 12?months. Results: There was a significant time effect (P?<?0.001) for whole body, spine and hip BMD with a progressive loss in the IMEX and DEL groups, although lumbar spine BMD was largely preserved in the IMEX group at 6?months compared with the DEL group (?0.4% vs ?1.6%). LM, ASM, and muscle density were preserved in the IMEX group at 6?months, declined in the DEL group at 6?months (?1.4% to ?2.5%) and then recovered at 12?months after training. FM and trunk FM increased (P?<?0.001) over the 12-month period in the IMEX (7.8% and 4.5%, respectively) and DEL groups (6.5% and 4.3%, respectively). Conclusions: Commencing exercise at the onset of ADT preserves lumbar spine BMD, muscle mass, and muscle density. To avoid treatment-related adverse musculoskeletal effects, exercise medicine should be prescribed and commenced at the onset of ADT. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of BJU International","adult; aerobic exercise; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; bone density; controlled study; delayed exercise; exercise; fat mass; hip; human; immediate exercise; intermethod comparison; lean body weight; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease; priority journal; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; single blind procedure; skeletal muscle; soft tissue; therapy effect; adipose tissue; blood; body composition; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; exercise; middle aged; photon absorptiometry; physiology; prostate tumor; time factor; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; antiandrogen; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; prostate specific antigen; testosterone; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adipose Tissue; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Androgen Antagonists; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Body Composition; Bone Density; Exercise; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Single-Blind Method; Testosterone; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"Toxicity Related to Radiotherapy Dose and Targeting Strategy: A Pooled Analysis of Cooperative Group Trials of Combined Modality Therapy for Locally Advanced Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer",2019,"Objective: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs). Methods: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus ?60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models. Results: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543–1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501–2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035–1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191–1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099). Conclusions: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","adult; advanced cancer; adverse outcome; Article; cancer radiotherapy; chemoradiotherapy; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; death; ective nodal irradiation thoracic radiotherapy; follow up; human; involved field thoracic radiotherapy; major clinical study; middle aged; mortality rate; non small cell lung cancer; patient risk; priority journal; radiation dose; risk factor; survival rate; toxicity; treatment outcome"
"Associations between depression, anxiety, stress, hopelessness, subjective well-being, coping styles and suicide in Chinese university students",2019,"Suicide is a major public health concern worldwide. This study aimed to predict the suicidal behavior of Chinese university students by studying psychological measures such as hopelessness, orientation to happiness, meaning in life, depression, anxiety, stress, and coping styles. In November 2016, a stratified-clustered-random sampling approach was utilized to select subjects from two large public medical-related universities in Shandong province, China. This sample consisted of 2,074 undergraduate students (706 males, 1,368 females; mean age = 19.79±1.39 years). The students’ major risk factors for suicide were depression, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness, and the students’ minor risk factors included orientation to happiness and coping styles (including self-distraction, self-blame and substance use). Notably, the presence of meaning in life had a positive effect on preventing suicide and acted as a protective factor, which suggests that it is important to identify risk factors as well as protective factors relevant to the target population group in order to increase the effectiveness of counseling and suicide prevention programs. ? 2019 Lew et al.

"Literature Review of Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbs–Induced Liver Injury From an Oncological Perspective With RUCAM",2019,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs are commonly regarded to be safe with minimal toxicities in Chinese communities. Cancer patients who are receiving Western oncology therapy often concurrently take TCM herbs for anticancer and symptom relief purposes. We performed a literature review for current evidence on TCM herb–induced liver injury from an oncological perspective. A literature search on PubMed was performed to identify publications regarding TCM herbs and concoctions with hepatoprotective or hepatotoxic properties. Lists of commonly used herbs and their causality levels were compiled. In view of the wide range of evidence available, cases assessed by the well-established RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) algorithm were categorized as the highest level of evidence. More than one case of TCM herb–induced liver injury was confirmed by RUCAM in the following herbs and concoctions: Lu Cha (Camellia sinensis), Bai Xian Pi (Dictamnus dasycarpus), Tu San Qi (Gynura segetum), Jin Bu Huan (Lycopodium serratum), He Shou Wu (Polygoni multiflora), Ge Gen (Pueraria lobata), Dan Lu Tong Du tablet, Shou Wu Pian, Xiao Chai Hu Tang, Xiao Yin pill, and Yang Xue Sheng Fa capsule.

"Ammon’s Horn 2 (CA2) of the Hippocampus: A Long-Known Region with a New Potential Role in Neurodegeneration",2019,"The hippocampus has a critical role in cognition and human memory and is one of the most studied structures in the brain. Despite more than 400 years of research, little is known about the Ammon’s horn region cornu ammonis 2 (CA2) subfield in comparison to other subfield regions (CA1, CA3, and CA4). Recent findings have shown that CA2 plays a bigger role than previously thought. Here, we review understanding of hippocampus and CA2 ontogenesis, together with basic and clinical findings about the potential role of this region in neurodegenerative disease. The CA2 has widespread anatomical connectivity, unique signaling molecules, and intrinsic electrophysiological properties. Experimental studies using in vivo models found that the CA2 region has a role in cognition, especially in social memory and object recognition. In models of epilepsy and hypoxia, the CA2 exhibits higher resilience to cell death and hypoxia in comparison with neighboring regions, and while hippocampal atrophy remains poorly understood in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), findings from postmortem PD brain demonstrates clear accumulation of α-synuclein pathology in CA2, and the CA2-CA3 region shows relatively more atrophy compared with other hippocampal subfields. Taken together, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the CA2 can be an ideal hallmark with which to differentiate different neurodegenerative stages of PD. Here, we summarize these recent data and provide new perspectives/ideas for future investigations to unravel the contribution of the CA2 to neurodegenerative diseases. ?

Participants’ basic demographics, comorbidity, and six lifestyle factors: diet; smoking; alcohol drinking; and physical, mental, and social activities were surveyed. Cognitive function was assessed using the Cantonese Chinese Montreal Cognitive Assessment (CC-MoCA). Linear regressions were performed to examine the associations between lifestyle, gender, and cognitive performance. Results: There were gender differences in lifestyle: men smoked (χ2(1) = 159.4) and drank more (χ2(1) = 85.9) and were more active in mentally stimulating activities (χ2(1) = 14.3, all p&lt;.001); while women were more socially active (χ2(1) = 28.0). Age, gender and education explained the greatest variance in cognition (R2=.32). Being active/healthy in more domains further contributed to better cognitive function, although the effect was small (ΔR2=0.03 in women; ΔR2=0.01 in men, both p&lt;.05). Among the lifestyle domains, physical activity showed the strongest effects on cognitive function (ΔR2=0.004 in men and ΔR2=0.02 in women, both p&lt;.05). Conclusions: Naturalistically, a physically active lifestyle and being active/healthy in more domains is associated with better cognitive function in older people after controlling for non-modifiable and early-life factors. The effects are however small. There are gender differences in lifestyle and the impact of lifestyle on cognitive function. Preventive strategies targeting lifestyle domains for cognitive health in older people may consider these naturalistic associations. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aged; alcohol consumption; article; case report; Chinese; clinical article; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; diet; education; female; healthy lifestyle; Hong Kong; human; linear regression analysis; male; mental performance; Montreal cognitive assessment; physical activity; sex difference; smoking; social behavior; additive effect; demography"
"Accessing health care: Experiences of South Asian ethnic minority women in Hong Kong",2019,"The aim of the present qualitative study was to understand the experiences of South Asian ethnic minority women in accessing health-care services in Hong Kong, a Chinese-oriented society. Levesque's framework (2013) was adopted to conduct and analyze focus group discussions among 30 South Asian women aged between 21 and 72 years, who came from India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The overarching theme was identified as disengagement between South Asian women and the health-care system, with the following five themes: attitude and awareness, sociocultural factors, time constraints, financial burdens, and inadequate interaction. These were linked to barriers affecting South Asian women's ability to access health care, the common challenges encountered being those related to language, culture, and communication. Lengthy waiting periods discourage these women from seeking health care in Hong Kong. Enhancing accessibility to appropriate health-care-related information and culturally-informed patient–provider interaction can improve knowledge, trust, and satisfaction among these women, thereby enhancing their engagement with the health-care system. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adult; aged; article; awareness; clinical article; controlled study; ethnic group; female; health care access; health literacy; Hong Kong; human; India; language; Nepal; Pakistan; qualitative research; satisfaction; South Asian; transcultural care; trust; Asia; ethnology; health care delivery; Hong Kong; information processing; middle aged; minority group; patient attitude; psychology; qualitative research; standards; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Asia; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Hong Kong; Humans; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Qualitative Research"
"Pathological changes of cervical spinal canal in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: A retrospective study on 39 cases",2019,"Objective: To evaluate and compare the cervical spinal canal (CSC)morphology among healthy people, cervical spondylosis myelopathy (CSM), and latent cervical spondylosis (LCS, people with cervical spine degeneration on medical imaging but without clinic symptoms). Patients and Methods: We reviewed MRI data describing cervical spinal morphology in healthy persons, LSC patients and CSM patients. All cases underwent cervical MRI. In transverse image, anteroposterior diameter (A–P diameter), area of cervical spinal canal (CSC)and area of cervical spinal cord were measured. In sagittal image, A–P diameter was measured. Dural sac area = the area of CSC in the transverse position – the area of cervical spinal cord in transverse position. Results: There're 8 cases in the healthy group, 18 cases in the group of LCS, and 13 cases in CSM group. Generally, the measured indicators at two ends of CSC (C2/3 and C7)are larger than those at C3–C6. A–P diameters on axial and sagittal position show a decrease trend from healthy group to LCS group and to CSM group. CSC area and dural sac area on axial position of CSM group are significantly lower than those in healthy group and LCS group. Almost all measured indicators of CSM group are significantly lower than healthy group and LCS group. Every two measured indicators in each group are significantly corelated. Conclusions: The results suggested that CSC size of CSM was smaller than that of LCS, and A–P diameter &lt;11 mm, CSC area &lt;170mm 2 and dural sac area &lt;90 mm 2 were more advisable to indicate cervical spinal canal stenosis in Chinese people. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; Article; cervical spinal cord; cervical spondylosis; cervical spondylotic myelopathy; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image reconstruction; male; measurement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; retrospective study; spinal cord atrophy; vertebral canal stenosis"
"Health effects of physical activity as predicted by particle deposition in the human respiratory tract",2019,"Although health benefits of physical activity are well known, the risk of physical activity in polluted air is unclear. Our objective is to investigate health effects resulting from physical activity in polluted air by looking at particle deposition in human tracheobronchial (TB) airways. Airflow and particle deposition in TB airways were investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. We chose three regional airways: upper (G3–G5), central (G9–G11) and lower (G14–G16). Physical activity was described by breathing rate at the mouth, for three levels of activity: sedentary (15 l/min), moderate (30 l/min) and intense (60 l/min). We found that particle deposition was strongly affected by physical activity. Particles are deposited in greater number in the lower airways (G14–G16) during sedentary activity, more in the upper airways (G3–G5) during intense activity, and uniformly in the airways during moderate activity. The difference in the deposition pattern was due to the reason that physical activity increased the airflow which increased inertial impaction. Our modeling of particle deposition in the human respiratory airways shows that there are different health effects for different activity levels: sedentary activity leads to chronic health effects, intense activity results in acute effects, and moderate activity minimizes the adverse health effects of physical activity in polluted air. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air; Air pollution; Computational fluid dynamics; Deposition; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Adverse health effects; Computational fluid dynamics methods; Deposition patterns; Human respiratory tract; Particle depositions; Particulate Matter; Physical activity; Respiratory airways; Health; airflow; atmospheric pollution; computational fluid dynamics; deposition; health impact; particulate matter; physical activity; air pollution; airflow; article; breathing rate; computational fluid dynamics; human; lower respiratory tract; mouth; particulate matter; physical activity; sitting; upper respiratory tract; air pollutant; biological model; chemistry; computer simulation; drug effect; exercise; hydrodynamics; particle size; particulate matter; respiratory system; Air Pollutants; Computer Simulation; Exercise; Humans; Hydrodynamics; Models, Biological; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Respiratory System"
"Structural and mechanistic bases of nuclear calcium signaling in human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes",2019,"The loss of nonregenerative, terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes (CMs) due to aging or diseases is generally considered irreversible. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can self-renew while maintaining their pluripotency to differentiate into all cell types, including ventricular (V) cardiomyocytes (CMs), to provide a potential unlimited ex vivo source of CMs for heart disease modeling, drug/cardiotoxicity screening, and cell-based therapies. In the human heart, cytosolic Ca2+ signals are well characterized but the contribution of nuclear Ca2+ is essentially unexplored. The present study investigated nuclear Ca2+ signaling in hPSC-VCMs. Calcium transient or sparks in hPSC-VCMs were measured by line scanning using a spinning disc confocal microscope. We observed that nuclear Ca2+, which stems from unitary sparks due to the diffusion of cytosolic Ca2+ that are mediated by RyRs on the nuclear reticulum, is functional. Parvalbumin- (PV-) mediated Ca2+ buffering successfully manipulated Ca2+ transient and stimuli-induced apoptosis in hPSC-VCMs. We also investigated the effect of Ca2+ on gene transcription in hPSC-VCMs, and the involvement of nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) pathway was identified. The overexpression of Ca2+-sensitive, nuclear localized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δB (CaMKIIδB) induced cardiac hypertrophy through nuclear Ca2+/CaMKIIδB/HDAC4/MEF2 pathway. These findings provide insights into nuclear Ca2+ signal in hPSC-VCMs, which may lead to novel strategies for maturation as well as improved systems for disease modeling, drug discovery, and cell-based therapies.

"Complex dissociative disorders in social work: discovering the knowledge gaps",2019,"Social workers are major mental health service providers in many countries and regions. This paper presents five reasons to explain why complex dissociative disorders (complex DD) should receive more attention from social workers. We conducted a preliminary review of complex DD in the social work literature. In June 2019, we searched all articles related to complex DD in academic journals classified under the “Social Work” research area in two Web of Science databases. Twenty-four articles were identified and reviewed. Most articles did not even have insights/implications for working with trauma and dissociation survivors regarding the social aspects of their care. None of the articles discussed the potential role of social workers in the assessment or management of complex DD. The body of knowledge regarding complex DD remains seriously limited in the social work field. Several knowledge gaps are discussed. We highlight some issues that social workers should consider when working with individuals with complex DD. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.",""

"Efficacy of caries and gingivitis prevention strategies among children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Dental caries and periodontal diseases are the most common oral diseases among human beings. Individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) have poor oral health and limited access to dental care. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of strategies in caries and gingivitis prevention among children and adolescents with ID. Methods: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched from their commencement date to 17 April 2017. Randomised or non-randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions in caries and gingivitis prevention were included if the participants were children and adolescents with ID. Gingival index and caries experiences were reported in the format of mean difference and standard error. Meta-analysis was conducted if data could be pooled from two or more studies using similar outcome measurements and intervention. Results: A total of 1455 articles published in English were identified. Fourteen studies formed the basis of qualitative analysis; six studies were feasible to perform quantitative analysis. Meta-analysis favoured fluoride to placebo in caries prevention [Z?=?2.02, P?<?0.05, 95% CI: ?0.71 (?1.40, ?0.02)], while the effectiveness of chlorhexidine remained elusive. Conclusions: Both mechanical and chemical approaches had been applied to caries and gingivitis prevention among children and adolescents with ID. Insufficient evidence supported the efficacy of chlorhexidine nor powered toothbrush, while fluoride was suggested to be an effective caries preventive strategy in fluoride-deficient areas. More well-designed randomised controlled trials using integration strategies are encouraged in further studies. ? 2018 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","chlorhexidine; fluoride; adolescent; child; data analysis; data base; dental caries; dental prophylaxis; gingival index; gingivitis; health promotion; human; intellectual impairment; meta analysis; mouth hygiene; outcome assessment; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk assessment; statistical analysis; statistical bias; systematic review; tooth brushing"
"Optimization of protein–protein interaction measurements for drug discovery using AFM force spectroscopy",2019,"Increasingly targeted in drug discovery, protein–protein interactions challenge current high throughput screening technologies in the pharmaceutical industry. Developing an effective and efficient method for screening small molecules or compounds is critical to accelerate the discovery of ligands for enzymes, receptors, and other pharmaceutical targets. Here, we report developments of methods to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for screening protein–protein interactions using atomic force microscopy (AFM) force spectroscopy. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of these developments on detecting the binding process between focal adhesion kinases with protein kinase B (Akt1), which is a target for potential cancer drugs. These developments include optimized probe and substrate functionalization processes and redesigned probe-substrate contact regimes. Furthermore, a statistical-based data processing method was developed to enhance the contrast of the experimental data. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of the AFM force spectroscopy in automating drug screening with high throughput. ? 2019 IEEE.","Atomic force microscopy; Data handling; Enzymes; Probes; Signal to noise ratio; Data processing methods; Focal adhesion kinase; Force spectroscopy; High throughput screening; Pharmaceutical industry; Protein interaction; Substrate contact; Substrate functionalization; Drug interactions"
"APC-activated long noncoding RNA inhibits colorectal carcinoma pathogenesis through reduction of exosome production",2019,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) but remains a challenge for drug development. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are invaluable in identifying cancer pathologies and providing therapeutic options for patients with cancer. Here, we identified a lncRNA (lncRNA-APC1) activated by APC through lncRNA microarray screening and examined its expression in a large cohort of CRC tissues. A decrease in lncRNA-APC1 expression was positively associated with lymph node and/or distant metastasis, a more advanced clinical stage, as well as a poor prognosis for patients with CRC. Additionally, APC could enhance lncRNA-APC1 expression by suppressing the enrichment of PPARα on the lncRNA-APC1 promoter. Furthermore, enforced lncRNA-APC1 expression was sufficient to inhibit CRC cell growth, metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis by suppressing exosome production through the direct binding of Rab5b mRNA and a reduction of its stability. Importantly, exosomes derived from lncRNA-APC1–silenced CRC cells promoted angiogenesis by activating the MAPK pathway in endothelial cells, and, moreover, exosomal Wnt1 largely enhanced CRC cell proliferation and migration through noncanonicial Wnt signaling. Collectively, lncRNA-APC1 is a critical lncRNA regulated by APC in the pathogenesis of CRC. Our findings suggest that an APC-regulated lncRNA-APC1 program is an exploitable therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with CRC. ? 2018 American Society for Clinical Investigation.All right reserved.","APC protein; APC1 protein; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; rab5b protein; RNA binding protein; unclassified drug; Wnt1 protein; APC protein; APC protein, human; long untranslated RNA; RNA; Wnt1 protein; WNT1 protein, human; adult; advanced cancer; angiogenesis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; cell migration; cell proliferation; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; disease specific survival; distant metastasis; DLD-1 cell line; down regulation; endothelium cell; exosome; female; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; LoVo cell line; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; MAPK signaling; metastasis inhibition; microarray analysis; middle aged; molecular pathology; mRNA expression level; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression level; protein RNA binding; protein stability; SW480 cell line; Wnt signaling; animal; biosynthesis; colorectal tumor; genetics; MAPK signaling; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Exosomes; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HCT116 Cells; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Mice, Nude; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Neoplasm; Wnt1 Protein"
"Clearance of apoptotic cells by mesenchymal stem cells contributes to immunosuppression via PGE2",2019,"Background: Defective clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit promising therapeutic effects on SLE, but whether MSCs phagocytose ACs and contributes to the underlying mechanism in the treatment of SLE remain unknown. Methods: Human umbilical cord (UC) MSCs were co-cultured with ACs, and the engulfment of ACs by MSCs was either detected by flow cytometry or observed under confocal laser scanning microscope. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls (HCs) were cultured in MSC conditioned medium (MCM) or MSC exposed to ACs (AC-MSC) conditioned medium (ACMCM), and then CD4+ T cell proliferation was detected. Soluble factors including prostaglandin (PG)E2 in the supernatants of MSCs and AC-MSCs, as well as in the mouse peritoneal lavage fluids (PLF) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cyclooxygenase (COX)2 inhibitors and siRNA transfection were utilized to determine the function of COX2/PGE2 in AC-MSC-mediated immunosuppression. PGE2 metabolites (PGEM) in the plasma of SLE patients were measured before and 24 h after MSC transplantation respectively. Findings: Human UC MSCs possessed the ability to engulf ACs. AC-MSCs increased MSC-mediated suppression of CD4+ T cell proliferation compared to MSCs alone. Mechanistically, ACs stimulated MSCs to express COX2 and consequently produced PGE2 that inhibited T cell responses. NF-κB signalling pathway mediated the activation of COX2/PGE2 in AC-MSCs. Importantly, in patients with SLE, the plasma PGEM levels increased significantly in those with reduced apoptotic mononuclear cells in peripheral blood after MSC transplantation. Interpretation: Clearance of ACs by MSCs contributes to immunosuppressive function via increasing PGE2 production. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of MSC-mediated phagocytosis of ACs in MSC-based immunotherapy.

"The association of early-life exposure to air pollution with lung function at ~17.5?years in the “Children of 1997” Hong Kong Chinese Birth Cohort",2019,"Background: Early-life air pollution exposure is associated with lung function in children and adolescents. However, whether the association of prenatal and early postnatal exposure to air pollution with lung function continues into adulthood remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the associations of early exposure to air pollution with lung function at ~17.5 years in a non-western developed setting with more concentrated air pollutants. Methods: We examined the associations of exposure to particular matter with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt;10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2) in standard deviations (SD)) at different early life stages with lung function (indicated by forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced expiratory flow at 25%–75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25%–75%)) in SD at ~17.5 years, personal history of wheezing and asthma in the population-representative Hong Kong Chinese birth cohort “Children of 1997”(n = 2942). Results: Higher in utero and infancy and toddlerhood NO2 were associated with lower FEV1 (?0.022, 95% confidence interval (CI) –0.029 to ?0.015 and ? 0.026, 95% CI –0.033 to ?0.019), FEV1/FVC (?0.035, 95% CI –0.050 to ?0.021 and –0.052, 95% CI –0.066 to ?0.038) and FEF25%–75% (?0.031, 95% CI –0.040 to ?0.022 and –0.043, 95% CI –0.051 to ?0.035). A similar association was observed for NO. Weak associations of NO2 and NO with FVC were observed (–0.011, 95% CI –0.018 to ?0.003 and –0.010, 95% CI –0.020 to ?0.001). NOx was associated with higher risk of wheezing (1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14) but not asthma (1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11). SO2 and PM10 were not clearly associated with lung function, wheezing or asthma. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that early exposure to air pollution from NO2 may have long-term effects on lung function, which could affect respiratory health throughout life. ? 2018 The Authors","Air pollution; Diseases; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Aerodynamic diameters; Air pollution exposures; Children and adolescents; Confidence interval; Forced expiratory volume in 1; Nitrogen dioxides; Postnatal exposure; Standard deviation; Biological organs; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; asthma; atmospheric pollution; cohort analysis; health impact; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; young population; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; asthma; child; cohort analysis; developmental stage; environmental protection; female; forced expiratory flow; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; infant; lung function; lung volume; male; particulate matter; passive smoking; prenatal exposure; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; wheezing; adolescent; air pollution; Asian continental ancestry group; drug effect; environmental exposure; follow up; Hong Kong; lung; lung function test; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; toxicity; vital capacity; China; Hong Kong; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Forced Expiratory Volume; Hong Kong; Humans; Infant; Lung; Male; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen Dioxide; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Respiratory Function Tests; Sulfur Dioxide; Vital Capacity"

"Factors Associated With Rates of HBsAg Seroclearance in Adults With Chronic HBV Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",2019,"Background &amp; Aims: Seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a marker for clearance of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but reported annual incidence rates of HBsAg seroclearance vary. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide more precise estimates of HBsAg seroclearance rates among subgroups and populations. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library for cohort studies that reported HBsAg seroclearance in adults with chronic HBV infection with more than 1 year of follow-up and at least 1 repeat test for HBsAg. Annual and 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative incidence rates were pooled using a random effects model. Results: We analyzed 34 published studies (with 42,588 patients, 303,754 person-years of follow-up, and 3194 HBsAg seroclearance events), including additional and updated aggregated data from 19 studies. The pooled annual rate of HBsAg seroclearance was 1.02% (95% CI, 0.79–1.27). Cumulative incidence rates were 4.03% at 5 years (95% CI, 2.49–5.93), 8.16% at 10 years (95% CI, 5.24–11.72), and 17.99% at 15 years (95% CI, 6.18–23.24). There were no significant differences between the sexes. A higher proportion of patients who tested negative for HBeAg at baseline had seroclearance (1.33%; 95% CI, 0.76–2.05) than those who tested positive for HBeAg (0.40%; 95% CI, 0.25–0.59) (P &lt;.01). Having HBsAg seroclearance was also associated with a lower baseline HBV DNA level (6.61 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 5.94–7.27) vs not having HBsAg seroclearance (7.71 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 7.41–8.02) (P &lt;.01) and with a lower level of HBsAg at baseline (2.74 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 1.88–3.60) vs not having HBsAg seroclearance (3.90 log 10 IU/mL, 95% CI, 3.73–4.06) (P &lt;.01). HBsAg seroclearance was not associated with HBV genotype or treatment history. Heterogeneity was substantial across the studies (I 2 = 97.49%). Conclusion: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found a low rate of HBsAg seroclearance in untreated and treated patients (pooled annual rate, approximately 1%). Seroclearance occurred mainly in patients with less active disease. Patients with chronic HBV infection should therefore be counseled on the need for lifelong treatment, and curative therapies are needed. ? 2019 AGA Institute","hepatitis B surface antigen; virus DNA; biological marker; hepatitis B surface antigen; virus DNA; Article; chronic hepatitis B; follow up; genotype; Hepatitis B virus; human; incidence; patient counseling; priority journal; risk factor; adult; blood; chronic hepatitis B; female; immunology; isolation and purification; male; meta analysis; middle aged; prognosis; reference value; seroepidemiology; serology; Adult; Biomarkers; DNA, Viral; Female; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Reference Values; Risk Factors; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Serologic Tests"
"Pneumocystis jirovecii-related spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in a liver transplant recipient: A case report",2019,"Background: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. Its incidence at 2 years or more after liver transplant (LT) is < 0.1%. PCP-related spontaneous pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum is rare in patients without the human immunodeficiency virus, with an incidence of 0.4-4%. Case presentation: A 65-year-old woman who had split-graft deceased-donor LT for primary biliary cirrhosis developed fever, dyspnea and dry coughing at 25 months after transplant. Her immunosuppressants included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. PCP infection was confirmed by molecular detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii,in bronchoalveolar lavage. On day-10 trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, her chest X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally, right pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Computed tomography of the thorax confirmed the presence of right pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. She was managed with 7-day right-sided chest drain and a 21-day course of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole before discharge. Conclusion: Longer period of PCP prophylaxis should be considered in patients who have a higher risk compared to general LT patients. High index of clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis and treatment with ongoing patient reassessment to detect and exclude rare, potentially fatal but treatable complications are essential, especially when clinical deterioration has developed. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aciclovir; corticosteroid; cotrimoxazole; ganciclovir; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisolone; tacrolimus; cotrimoxazole; immunosuppressive agent; aged; antibiotic prophylaxis; Article; bile leakage; biliary anastomotic stricture; blood oxygen tension; blood pressure; case report; cholestasis; clinical article; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; coughing; Cytomegalovirus; deceased donor; drug dose reduction; dyspnea; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; female; fever; graft recipient; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; Human respiratory syncytial virus; immunosuppressive treatment; liver transplantation; lung lavage; maintenance therapy; oxygen therapy; Pneumocystis jiroveci; Pneumocystis pneumonia; pneumomediastinum; polymerase chain reaction; primary biliary cirrhosis; pulse rate; spontaneous pneumothorax; subcutaneous emphysema; thorax radiography; treatment duration; virus detection; diagnostic imaging; liver transplantation; microbiology; pathogenicity; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumocystis pneumonia; pneumomediastinum; pneumothorax; subcutaneous emphysema; x-ray computed tomography; Aged; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Liver Transplantation; Mediastinal Emphysema; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumonia, Pneumocystis; Pneumothorax; Subcutaneous Emphysema; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination"
"Saikosaponin D suppresses enterovirus A71 infection by inhibiting autophagy",2019,"The dysregulation of autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process, has been implicated in a wide variety of human diseases, and thus, small chemicals that modulate autophagy have therapeutic potential. Here, we assessed the ability of active components isolated from Bupleurum falcatum, a popular Chinese herb, to modulate autophagy. We found that saikosaponin D (SsD) and A (SsA) but not C (SsC) potently and reversibly inhibited the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes, an increased lysosomal pH, and TFEB nuclear translocation. RAB5A knockdown or the expression of a dominant-negative RAB5 mutant significantly reduced the ability of SsD or SsA to block autophagy. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), the cause of hand-foot-mouth disease, has been shown to induce autophagy. We found that SsD potently inhibited EV-A71 RNA replication and subsequent viral protein synthesis, thereby preventing EV-A71-induced cell death. ATG5 knockdown inhibited EV-A71 viral protein synthesis, whereas autophagy induction by rapamycin promoted synthesis. Taken together, our data indicate that SsD and SsA are potent late-stage autophagy inhibitors that can be used to prevent EV-A71 infection. ? 2019, The Author(s).","mammalian target of rapamycin; protein VP1; rapamycin; saikosaponin a; saikosaponin c; saikosaponin d; short hairpin RNA; small interfering RNA; viral protein; antiviral activity; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; Bupleurum; calcium signaling; cell viability assay; chemoluminescence; confocal microscopy; controlled study; endocytosis; Enterovirus A71; Enterovirus infection; gene expression; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; hand foot and mouth disease; HEK293T cell line; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence; immunofluorescence test; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; lysosome; microtiter plate assay; MTT assay; pH; plaque forming cell assay; protein synthesis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rhabdomyosarcoma; RNA replication; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting"
"The effect of a brief mindfulness-based intervention on personal recovery in people with bipolar disorder: A randomized controlled trial (study protocol)",2019,"Background: With the advent of the recovery movement in mental health, a humanistic paradigm shift has occurred, placing the focus on personal recovery (i.e., hope, identity, and life meaning) instead of functional or clinical recovery only (i.e., symptom reduction or increases in physical function). Along the journey of recovery, people with bipolar disorder (BD) struggle to cope with recurring mood fluctuations between depression and mania. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have the potential to result in improvements in personal recovery outcomes. Thus, this protocol will evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of a brief MBI for helping individuals with BD with their personal recovery. It is hypothesized that adults with BD randomly assigned to a brief MBI intervention will report greater improvements in personal recovery than those in a waiting list control condition. In addition, it is hypothesized that such benefits will be mediated by improvements in emotion awareness, emotion regulation, and illness acceptance. Moreover, the specific stage of BD is hypothesized to moderate the beneficial effects of the brief MBI, such that those in the early stage of BD will report more benefits regarding emotion awareness and emotion regulation, whereas those in the late stage of BD will report more advantages concerning illness acceptance. Method: One hundred and fifty-four adults with BD will be recruited from hospitals and community settings for this research project. This study will use a mixed methods design. A randomized-controlled trial will be conducted to compare a brief MBI (four sessions in total) group and a waiting list control group. Assessments will be made at baseline, after intervention, and at six-month follow-up. In addition, a qualitative and participatory research method called Photovoice will be employed to further understand the experiences of the participants who receive the brief MBI along their personal recovery journey. Discussion: If the study hypotheses are supported, the findings from this research project will provide empirical support for an alternative treatment. Moreover, by identifying the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of the brief MBI, the findings will highlight process variables that could be specifically targeted to make MBI treatment even more effective in this population.

"A field-deployable insulated isothermal RT-PCR assay for identification of influenza A (H7N9) shows good performance in the laboratory",2019,"Background: Avian influenza A (H7N9) remains circulating in China. For countries at risk of introduction of H7N9, such as Vietnam, early detection of H7N9 virus is essential for the early containment of the virus. Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR (iiRT-PCR) is a portable PCR system that can be deployed under field conditions to identify pathogens at the sampling site. Applying PCR at the sampling site will greatly reduce the time to obtain a diagnostic result which allows the veterinary authority to take immediate action to contain disease spreading. Objective: To determine analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the portable iiRT-PCR for H7N9 virus detection. Methods: A panel of 59 virus isolates, including H7N9, avian influenza viruses of subtype H1 to H13, swine and human influenza viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus, were tested by H7 and N9 iiRT-PCR reagents, using probes and primers specific to H7 or N9, in comparison with laboratory-based real-time RT-PCR assays to determine analytical sensitivity and specificity. Fifty oropharyngeal samples from experimentally infected chicken and ducks with H7N9 and 50 non-infected control swabs were tested by the H7 iiRT-PCR to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Results: The H7 and N9 iiRT-PCR reagents yielded comparable levels of analytical sensitivity and specificity with real-time RT-PCR for the detection of H7N9 virus. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of H7 iiRT-PCR were 98% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: The observed high sensitivity and specificity of iiRT-PCR for H7N9 detection show its potential for early detection of H7N9 in risk-based surveillance. ? 2019 The Authors.

"A powerful conditional gene-based association approach implicated functionally important genes for schizophrenia",2019,"It remains challenging to unravel new susceptibility genes of complex diseases and the mechanisms in genome-wide association studies. There are at least two difficulties, isolation of the genuine susceptibility genes from many indirectly associated genes and functional validation of these genes. Results: We first proposed a novel conditional gene-based association test which can use only summary statistics to isolate independently associated genes of a disease. Applying this method, we detected 185 genes of independent association with schizophrenia. We then designed an in-silico experiment based on expression/co-expression to systematically validate pathogenic potential of these genes. We found that genes of independent association with schizophrenia formed more co-expression pairs in normal post-natal but not pre-natal human brain regions than expected. Interestingly, no co-expression enrichment was found in the brain regions of schizophrenia patients. The genes with independent association also had more significant P-values for differential expression between schizophrenia patients and controls in the brain regions. In contrast, indirectly associated genes or associated genes by other widely-used gene-based tests had no such differential expression and co-expression patterns. In summary, this conditional genebased association test is effective for isolating directly associated genes from indirectly associated genes, and the results insightfully suggest that common variants might contribute to schizophrenia largely by distorting expression and co-expression in post-natal brains. ? 2018.

"Voluntary running delays primary degeneration in rat retinas after partial optic nerve transection",2019,"Running is believed to be beneficial for human health. Many studies have focused on the neuroprotective effects of voluntary running on animal models. There were both primary and secondary degeneration in neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma. However, whether running can delay primary or secondary degeneration or both of them was not clear. Partial optic nerve transection model is a valuable glaucoma model for studying both primary and secondary degeneration because it can separate primary (mainly in the superior retina) from secondary (mainly in the inferior retina) degeneration. Therefore, we compared the survival of retinal ganglion cells between Sprague-Dawley rat runners and non-runners both in the superior and inferior retinas. Excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are involved in the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. So we also used western immunoblotting to compare the expression of some proteins involved in apoptosis (phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p-JNKs), oxidative stress (manganese superoxide dismutase, MnSOD) and excitotoxicity (glutamine synthetase) between runners and non-runners after partial optic nerve transection. Results showed that voluntary running delayed the death of retinal ganglion cells vulnerable to primary degeneration but not those to secondary degeneration. In addition, voluntary running decreased the expression of glutamine synthetase, but not the expression of p-JNKs and MnSOD in the superior retina after partial optic nerve transection. These results illustrated that primary degeneration of retinal ganglion cells might be mainly related with excitotoxicity rather than oxidative stress; and the voluntary running could down-regulate excitotoxicity to delay the primary degeneration of retinal ganglion cells after partial optic nerve transection. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.","glutamate ammonia ligase; stress activated protein kinase; adult; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cell survival; excitotoxicity; exercise; eye surgery; glaucoma; nerve transection; nonhuman; optic nerve; oxidative stress; pont surgery; protein expression; rat; retina degeneration; retina ganglion cell; runner; running; superior colliculus; Western blotting"
"Suicide deaths by gas inhalation in Toronto: An observational study of emerging methods of suicide",2019,"Background: Suicide death by gas inhalation has been the subject of global scientific interest due to a rapid increase in the use of helium and charcoal gas for suicide. These may be particularly amenable to means restriction strategies. There has been little scientific attention of this phenomenon in Canada. Methods: A review of coroner records was conducted for all suicide deaths in Toronto (1998–2015). Deaths were categorized as due to inhalational asphyxia by compressed gas (i.e. helium or nitrogen), charcoal burning or motor vehicle exhaust, with suicide deaths by other methods as a comparator. Demographic, clinical and suicide specific differences between decedents in these four categories were compared using chi-squared or ANOVA global test of significance with additional pairwise comparisons where appropriate. Secular trends were also examined. Results: Gas inhalational deaths accounted for 190 (4.7%) of all suicides in Toronto (n = 4062) over the study period and a higher proportion of males used compressed gas or motor vehicle exhaust gases than those who died by other methods (83.3% and 84.0% vs.69.7%, both p = 0.01). Comparing 1998–2003 to 2010–2015 there was a 1075% increase in deaths by helium (4 vs. 43 deaths) and a 533% increase in deaths by charcoal burning (3 vs. 16 deaths) although helium and charcoal burning deaths still accounted for only 4.2% of total suicides 2010–2015. Deaths by helium were more likely to be accompanied by the book “Final Exit” than those by non-inhalational methods (15% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.0001) while 13 of 14 people who died by charcoal burning whose ethnicity could be determined were Asian. Limitations: Ethnicity and specific details of procurement of suicide methods were not systematically available in coroner records. Discussion: Suicide by inhalational asphyxia, particularly by compressed gases, has increased substantially over time in Toronto consistent with observations in other countries. Increased surveillance of these deaths, efforts to restrict access to these methods, and timely interventions including minimizing media reporting are all warranted. ? 2018","charcoal; helium; nitrogen; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Canada; controlled study; exhaust gas; female; gas; human; major clinical study; male; motor vehicle; observational study; priority journal; schizophrenia; suicide; suicide attempt; toxic inhalation; trend study; age distribution; cause of death; gas poisoning; inhalational drug administration; intoxication; middle aged; Ontario; sex ratio; suicide; trends; very elderly; young adult; Administration, Inhalation; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Female; Gas Poisoning; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Sex Distribution; Suicide; Vehicle Emissions; Young Adult"
"Psychological Well-Being of Coresiding Elderly Parents and Adult Children in China: Do Father–Child and Mother–Child Relationships Make a Difference?",2019,"Using the baseline wave (2010) of the China Family Panel Studies, this study conducted an investigation of the associations between intergenerational relationships and the psychological well-being of elderly parents and adult children based on 2,401 coresiding parent–child dyads. Parents receiving support from children in three to four life areas were more likely to have higher life satisfaction than parents with no upward support. Downward support in more life areas was associated with poorer psychological well-being for adult children. Good quality parent–child relationships were positively associated only with parents’ life satisfaction. This association was stronger for elderly mothers than for elderly fathers. No significant differences were found between father–child and mother–child relationships with regard to their implications for children’s psychological outcomes. This study highlights the importance of considering cultural sensitivity and parental gender roles when applying attachment theory to aging families. ?

"Specifically blocking the fatty acid synthesis to inhibit the malignant phenotype of bladder cancer",2019,"Fatty acid synthesis is regulated by transcription factors SREBPs and their escort protein SCAP. Malignant cells become dependent on de novo lipogenesis, which sustains rapid proliferation and resistance to cellular stress. Increasing evidence showed SCAP participated in various disease processes including malignant tumors, which regulate transcription factors SREBPs Tumorigenesis is associated with incur glucose consumption and lipogenesis. In our study, we discovered that SCAP was upregulated in BC tissues. SCAP knockdown by CRISPR-Cas9 inhibit the cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Additionally, the cell apoptosis was facilitated. What’s more, downregulation of SCAP could weaken the cancer-promoting effects of estrogen on BC. Our study revealed that SCAP played a carcinogenic role in BC and lipogenesis might promote the initiation of BC by inducing SCAP. Thus, Targeting SCAP may provide a promising means of treating BC and a new perspective for the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer. ? Ivyspring International Publisher.",""
"Structures of SCCmec elements in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus lugdunensis are closely related to those harboured by community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus",2019,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus lugdunensis (MRSL) is increasingly recognized in healthcare and community settings. To obtain a better understanding of the emergence of MRSL, this study characterized the structure and content of the SCCmec elements harboured by 36 MRSL isolates obtained from diverse sources in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2017. The isolates were investigated by whole-genome sequencing. SCCmec types and subtypes were assigned according to the guidelines from the International Working Group on the Classification of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome Elements. The sequence type (ST)-SCCmec combinations in the 36 MRSL isolates were as follows: ST3-SCCmec IV (n=2), ST3-SCCmec V (n=28), ST27-SCCmec V (n=5) and ST42-SCCmec V (n=1). The two SCCmec IV elements were highly similar to the SCCmec IV element harboured by the community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strain, JCSC6668. The J3-mec complex-J2 regions in the SCCmec V elements were highly similar to the corresponding regions in the CA-MRSA strains PM1 (n=13) or WIS (n=21). Based on the J1 to J3 sequences, the SCCmec V elements can be categorized into nine different subtypes. Our findings highlight the diversified structures of SCCmec elements among MRSL strains and their close relationship with SCCmec elements harboured by CA-MRSA.","antiinfective agent; bacterial DNA; bacterial chromosome; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; classification; community acquired infection; DNA sequence; drug effect; genetics; Hong Kong; human; isolation and purification; medical student; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; molecular epidemiology; Staphylococcus infection; Staphylococcus lugdunensis; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chromosomes, Bacterial; Community-Acquired Infections; DNA, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Hong Kong; Humans; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Epidemiology; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus lugdunensis; Students, Medical"
"Spatiotemporal prediction of increasing winter perceived temperature across a sub-tropical city for sustainable planning and climate change mitigation",2019,"Climate variability has been documented as being key to influencing human wellbeing across cities as it is linked to mortality and illness due to changes in the perceived weather cycle. Many studies have investigated the impact of summer temperature on human health and have proposed mitigation strategies for summer heat waves. However, sub-tropical cities are still experiencing winter temperature variations. Increasing winter perceived temperature through the decades may soon affect city wellbeing, due to a larger temperature change between normal winter days and extreme cold events, which may cause higher health risk due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness. Therefore, winter perceived temperature should also be considered and integrated in urban sustainable planning. This study has integrated the increasing winter perceived temperature as a factor for developing spatiotemporal protocols for mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite images and building data extracted from aerial photographs were used to simulate the adjusted wind chill equivalent temperature (AWCET) particularly for sub-tropical scenarios between 1990 and 2010 of the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong. Compared with perceived temperature based on the representative station located at the headquarters of the Hong Kong Observatory, the temperature of half the study area in the Kowloon Peninsula has raised by 1.5?C. The areas with less green space and less public open space in 2010 show higher relative temperatures. Socioeconomically deprived areas (e.g., areas with lower median monthly income) may suffer more from this scenario, but not all types of socioeconomic disparities are associated with poor sustainable planning. Based on our results and the “no-one left behind” guideline from the United Nations, climate change mitigation should be conducted by targeting socioeconomic neighborhoods more than just aging communities. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Cost-effectiveness of a primary care multidisciplinary Risk Assessment and Management Program for patients with diabetes mellitus (RAMP-DM) over lifetime",2019,"Purpose: The multidisciplinary Risk Assessment and Management Program for patients with diabetes mellitus (RAMP-DM) was found to be cost-saving in comparison with usual primary care over 5 years’ follow-up. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifetime. Methods: We built a Discrete Event Simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifespan from public health service provider’s perspective. Transition probabilities among disease states were extrapolated from a cohort of 17,140 propensity score matched participants in RAMP-DM and those under usual primary care over 5-year’s follow-up. The mortality of patients with specific DM-related complications was estimated from a cohort of 206,238 patients with diabetes. Health preference and direct medical costs of DM patients referred to our previous studies among Chinese DM patients. Results: RAMP-DM individuals gained 0.745 QALYs and cost US$1404 less than those under usual care. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that RAMP-DM had 86.0% chance of being cost-saving compared to usual care under the assumptions and estimates used in the model. The probability of RAMP-DM being cost-effective compared to usual care would be over 99%, when the willingness to pay threshold is HK$20,000 (US$ 2564) or higher. Conclusion: RAMP-DM added to usual primary care was cost-saving in managing people with diabetes over lifetime. These findings support the integration of RAMP-DM as part of routine primary care for all patients with diabetes. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aged; Article; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; health care cost; human; interdisciplinary education; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; patient preference; primary medical care; priority journal; probability; propensity score; public health service; risk assessment; social support; treatment outcome"
"Antioxidants: Scientific literature landscape analysis",2019,"Antioxidants are abundant in natural dietary sources, and the consumption of antioxidants has a lot of potential health benefits. However, there has been no literature analysis on this topic to evaluate its scientific impact in terms of citations. This study is aimed at identifying and analysing the antioxidant publications in the existing scientific literature. In this context, a literature search was performed with the Web of Science database. Full records and cited references of the 299,602 identified manuscripts were imported into VOSviewer for bibliometric analysis. Most of the manuscripts were published since 1991. The publications were mainly related to the categories biochemistry/molecular biology, food science technology, and pharmacology/pharmacy. These topics have been prolific since 1990 and before. Polymer science was prolific before, but its publication share declined in the recent two decades. Brazil, China, India, and South Korea have emerged as upcoming major contributors besides USA. Most prolific journals were Food Chemistry, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Free Radical Biology and Medicine, and PLOS One. Clinical conditions with high citations included Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Chemical terms and structures with high citations included alpha-tocopherol, anthocyanin, ascorbate, beta-carotene, carotenoid, curcumin, cysteine, flavonoid, flavonol, hydrogen peroxide, kaempferol, N-acetylcysteine, nitric oxide, phenolic acid, uric acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and resveratrol.

"FAM83D promotes ovarian cancer progression and its potential application in diagnosis of invasive ovarian cancer",2019,"Although invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (IOC) and low malignant potential ovarian tumour (LMP) are similar, they are associated with different outcomes and treatment strategies. The current accuracy in distinguishing these diseases is unsatisfactory, leading to delays or unnecessary treatments. We compared the molecular signature of IOC and LMP cases by analysing their transcriptomic data and re-clustered them according to these data rather than the pathological dissection. We identified that FAM83D was highly expressed in IOC. To verify the role of FAM83D in the progression and metastasis, we used the isogenic ovarian cancer metastatic models, highly metastatic cells (HM) and non-metastatic cells (NM). Overexpression of FAM83D significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration and spheroid formation. This was consistent with previous data showing that high FAM83D expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Moreover, similar to the HM cells, the FAM83D-overexpressing NM cells demonstrated stronger phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Raf. This indicates that the action of FAM83D is mediated by the activation of the EGFR pathway. Taken together, this report suggested that FAM83D might be an excellent molecular marker to discriminate between IOC and LMP. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Development and pre/post testing of a decision aid supporting Chinese parental and young women’s HPV vaccination decision-making",2020,"We developed and tested the acceptability and utility of a novel HPV vaccination decision aid (DA) among Chinese young women aged 18–26?years and parents of adolescent girls aged 9–17?years. From March to May 2016, a total of 101 parents plus 109 young women completed baseline surveys assessing their HPV vaccination knowledge, decision self-efficacy, decision conflict, and HPV vaccination intention. Two weeks after receiving the DA, 84 (83.2%) parents and 92 (84.4%) young women completed re-assessments. Chi-square tests or t-tests were performed to compare the before-and-after differences. Cohen’s d was calculated to indicate the effect size. After reading the DA, both participating young women’s and parents’ knowledge of HPV vaccination (Cohen’s d =?0.62 among young women and d =?0.59 among parents) and decision self-efficacy (d?=?0.38 among young women and d =?0.59 among parents) significantly increased. Both young women’s and parents’ decision conflict (d?=??0?·?98 and ?1.06) significantly decreased. The proportion of young women intending to receive HPV vaccination and parents deciding to vaccinate daughters against HPV significantly increased (p <?0?·?0001).

"Emergence of human infection with Jingmen tick virus in China: A retrospective study",2019,"Background: A tick-borne segmented RNA virus called Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) was recently identified, variants of which were detected in a non-human primate host and fatal patients with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. We investigated its infectivity and pathogenicity for humans. Methods: We obtained skin-biopsy, blood and serum samples from patients with tick bites, and used high-throughput sequencing, in situ hybridisation, and serologic testing to diagnose and ascertain the cases of JMTV infection. Findings: A JMTV strain was isolated from the tick Amblyomma javanense into an embryo-derived tick cell line. We obtained sustained passage of JMTV, and revealed that it was able to accumulate in salivary glands of experimentally infected ticks. Four JMTV-infected patients were identified by high-throughput sequencing of skin biopsies and blood samples. The virus replication in skin tissue was visualised by in situ hybridisation. The four patients all had an itchy or painful eschar at the site of tick bite, with or without lymphadenopathy. Immunohistochemical examination revealed remarkable local inflammation manifested as infiltration by neutrophils. Eight patients were identified by serological testing and showed more severe clinical manifestations. Two Ixodes persulcatus ticks detached from patients were positive for JMTV. All JMTV strains identified in this study formed a well-supported sub-lineage, distinct from those previously reported in China. Interpretation The public significance of JMTV should be highly concerning due to its potential pathogenicity for humans and efficient transmission by potential ticks.

"Occupations and the Risk of Head and Neck Cancer: A Pooled Analysis of the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) Consortium",2019,"Objective:To investigate the associations between head and neck cancer (HNC) risk and occupations.Methods:We harmonized data on occupations in a pooled analysis of 8839 HNC cases and 13,730 controls in International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations of occupations and HNC risk. Population attributable fraction (PAF) for occupations was calculated using the formula PEC×(OR-1)/OR.1Results:Trend of increasing HNC risk was found with increasing duration of employment for many occupations, including cooks (OR=1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 1.68), cleaners (OR=1.38; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.69), painters (OR=1.82; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.35).

"Clinical Therapeutics in Hong Kong",2019,"Hong Kong is a compact territory in Southern China that enjoys a high degree of autonomy. Despite its dense population and uneven wealth distribution, infant mortality is low and life expectancy is long. The health service is more hospital and clinic based than community based. This seems cost-effective while professional standards are high and rigorously maintained. Drug registration follows American and European requirements. Hong Kong is a part of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme, which brings a high standard of drug regulation. Hong Kong is a good choice for clinical trials because the subjects are Chinese and protocols in English do not need to be translated. There are also 2 well-established clinical trials centers in university hospitals that also run Phase I and clinical pharmacology studies. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Article; China; clinical pharmacology; cost effectiveness analysis; health care system; health practitioner; health service; human; infant mortality; life expectancy; registration; regulatory mechanism"
"Intimate Partner Sexual Violence and Mental Health Indicators Among Chinese Emerging Adults",2019,"Intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV) among emerging adults, including heterosexuals and sexual minorities in the Chinese population, is poorly understood. Focusing on college students, the objectives of the present study were to estimate the prevalence of IPSV among Chinese emerging adults, examine the association between sexual orientation and IPSV, and evaluate the mental health and quality of life of survivors of IPSV. Data were collected from four university campuses in Hong Kong. A total of 1,015 participants were included in the data analysis. The prevalence of IPSV as identified by Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS)-2 was 12.1%. There was no gender difference in the prevalence of IPSV. Multiple logistic regression found that being older; having experienced childhood sexual abuse and having a smoking habit; and belonging to a sexual minority were factors associated with IPSV. Multiple linear regression found that IPSV survivors were more likely to have higher levels of anxiety and depression, more severe psychosomatic symptoms, and poorer quality of life in three domains: psychological, social relationships, and environment when compared with those without IPSV experience. The documented factors underscored the importance of awareness that men and sexual minorities might incur IPSV, which should receive more attention in IPSV prevention programs. Also, interventions for IPSV survivors should be targeted at improving their mental health and quality of life and sex education should place more emphasis on sexual consent and sexual health in dating relationships. ?

"Relationships among fatigue, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in Chinese children and adolescents surviving cancer",2019,"Purpose: Fatigue is the most common concern reported by childhood cancer survivors. Assessing its occurrence and severity is a prerequisite for planning and evaluating appropriate interventions. Nevertheless, there is a lack of large-scale surveys which examine the occurrence and severity of fatigue and its associated factors. The study aimed to shed light on this under researched area. Methods: A cross-sectional study was used. A total of 400 childhood cancer survivors (7- to 18-year olds) were invited to participate in the study. The cancer-related fatigue, depressive symptoms, physical activity level, and quality of life of participants were assessed. Results: An average of 46.4% of children and 48.4% of adolescents were found to display symptoms of cancer-related fatigue between “half the time” and “all the time” over the previous seven days. Besides, greater occurrence and severity of fatigue in childhood cancer survivors were associated with more self-reported depressive symptoms, lower level of physical activity and quality of life. In addition, the study revealed that physical activity level is a significant factor associated with cancer-related fatigue. Conclusion: The findings provide further support that cancer and its treatment have adverse effects on survivors’ fatigue, which can manifest months or even years after the completion of treatment. Importantly, this study reveals that physical activity is a significant factor associated with fatigue in children and adolescents. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to identify strategies that can help children and adolescents surviving cancer increase their adoption and maintenance of regular activity throughout their life. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","adolescent; age; Asian continental ancestry group; cancer survivor; child; China; cross-sectional study; depression; ethnology; exercise; fatigue; female; human; male; neoplasm; nursing; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; Adolescent; Age Factors; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cancer Survivors; Child; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Exercise; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Genetic variations in familial hypercholesterolemia and cascade screening in East Asians",2019,"Background: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic disorder of lipoprotein metabolism leading to an increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Genetic testing for FH is not commonly used in Asian countries. We aimed to define the genetic spectrum of FH in Hong Kong and to test the feasibility of cascade genetic screening. Methods: Ninety-six Chinese subjects with a clinical diagnosis of FH were recruited, and family-based cascade screening incorporating genetic testing results was performed. Results: Forty-two distinct mutations were identified in 67% of the index FH cases. The majority of causative mutations were in the LDLR gene. The three commonest mutations in the LDLR gene were NM_000527.4(LDLR): c.1241 T>G, NM_000527.4(LDLR): c.1474G>A, and NM_000527.4(LDLR): c. 682G>A, and nine novel variants were identified. The NM_000384.2(APOB): c.10579 C>T variant of the APOB gene was found in 5% of the index subjects. The presence of causative mutation significantly increased the odds of successful family recruitment for screening with an OR of 3.7 (95% CI: 1.53–9.11, p?=?0.004). Conclusion: Approximately two-third of the subjects in this clinically ascertained sample of patients with FH had a discrete genetic basis. Genetic identification improves the response rate and efficiency of family screening. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Cumulative Effective Dose and Cancer Risk of Pediatric Population in Repetitive Whole-Body Scan Using Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry",2019,"This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the cumulative effective dose and associated cancer risk of pediatric patients of US and Hong Kong population undergoing repetitive whole-body scans with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) during their diagnosis and follow-up periods. Organ-absorbed doses of pediatric patients undergoing DXA whole-body scan have been computer simulated using patient imaging parameters input to the Monte Carlo software PCXMC. Gender- and age-specific effective doses have been calculated with the simulated organ-absorbed doses using the ICRP-103 approach. The associated radiation-induced cancer risk, expressed as lifetime attributable cancer risk (LAR), has been estimated according to the method introduced in the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report. Mathematical fitting for effective dose and for LAR, as a function of age at exposure, has been analytically obtained to quantitatively estimate the cumulated effective dose and LAR for pediatric patients of US and Hong Kong population with repetitive DXA whole-body scan during their follow-up period. The effective dose of a single DXA whole-body scan for patients exposed at the age between 5 and 18 years was calculated as 8.47–17.68 ?Sv. The corresponding LAR for US and Hong Kong population was between the range of 4.57 × 10 ?7 and 7.14 × 10 ?7 . The cumulative effective dose of DXA whole-body scan for patients exposed annually at age between 5 and 18 years was calculated as 180 ?Sv for girls and 168 ?Sv for boys. The corresponding cumulative LAR for US and Hong Kong population was calculated as 3.77 × 10 ?6 to 5.48 × 10 ?6 . Girls would be at a statistically significant higher cumulated cancer risk than boys under the same whole-body DXA protocol (p = 0.03). The probability of cumulative LAR for pediatric populations undergoing annual DXA whole-body scan is regarded as minimal. We demonstrate the use of computer simulation and analytic formulation to quantitatively obtain the cumulated effective dose and cancer risk at any age of exposure, which are useful information for medical personnel to track patient radiation dose and to alleviate patients’ parents concern about radiation safety in repetitive whole-body scan using DXA. ? 2017 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry","adolescent; adult; Article; biological activity; cancer risk; child; clinical assessment; densitometry; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; follow up; Hong Kong; human; ionizing radiation; male; pediatric patient; preschool child; priority journal; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation induced neoplasm; repetitive whole body scan; school child; United States; whole body scintiscanning"
"Indirect protection from vaccinating children against influenza in households",2019,"Vaccination is an important intervention to prevent influenza virus infection, but indirect protection of household members of vaccinees is not fully known. Here, we analyze a cluster household randomized controlled trial, with one child in each household randomized to receive influenza vaccine or placebo, for an influenza B epidemic in Hong Kong. We apply statistical models to estimate household transmission dynamics and quantify the direct and indirect protection of vaccination. Direct vaccine efficacy was 71%. The infection probability of unvaccinated household members in vaccinated households was only 5% lower than in control households, because only 10% of infections are attributed to household transmission. Even when that proportion rises to 30% and all children are vaccinated, we predict that the infection probability for unvaccinated household members would only be?reduced by 20%. This suggests that benefits of individual vaccination remain important even when other household members are vaccinated. ? 2019, The Author(s).","influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; adolescent; antibody titer; Article; blood sampling; child; comparative study; controlled study; disease surveillance; epidemic; hemagglutination inhibition; household; human; influenza B; influenza vaccination; major clinical study; randomized controlled trial; serology; single drug dose; virus transmission; drug effect; epidemic; family size; Hong Kong; immunology; influenza; Influenza B virus; outcome assessment; preschool child; procedures; statistics and numerical data; vaccination; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Epidemics; Family Characteristics; Hong Kong; Humans; Influenza B virus; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Vaccination"
"New therapeutic aspects of steroidal cardiac glycosides: The anticancer properties of Huachansu and its main active constituent Bufalin",2019,"Aim of the review: In the past decade, increasing research attention investigated the novel therapeutic potential of steroidal cardiac glycosides in cancer treatment. Huachansu and its main active constituent Bufalin have been studied in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. This review aims to summarize the multi-target and multi-pathway pharmacological effects of Bufalin and Huachansu in the last decade, with the aim of providing a more comprehensive view and highlighting the recently discovered molecular mechanisms. Results: Huachansu and its major derivative, Bufalin, had been found to possess anti-cancer effects in a variety of cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. The underlying anti-cancer molecular mechanisms mainly involved anti-proliferation, apoptosis induction, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition inhibition, anti-inflammation, Na+/K+-ATPase activity targeting, the steroid receptor coactivator family inhibitions, etc. Moreover, the potential side-effects and toxicities of the toad extract, Huachansu, and Bufalin, including hematological, gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous and cardiovascular adverse reactions, were reported in animal studies and clinic trails. Conclusions: Further research is needed to elucidate the potential drug-drug interactions and multi-target interaction of Bufalin and Huachansu. Large-scale clinical trials are warranted to translate the knowledge of the anticancer actions of Bufalin and Huachansu into clinical applications as effective and safe treatment options for cancer patients in the future. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); bufalin; cardiac glycoside; herbaceous agent; Huachansu; inducible nitric oxide synthase; lipoxygenase; nitric oxide; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin synthase; steroid receptor; steroid receptor coactivator 1; unclassified drug; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; antiangiogenic activity; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; breast cancer; cancer patient; cardiovascular disease; cell proliferation; Chinese medicine; colorectal cancer; drug potentiation; drug structure; endometrium cancer; enzyme activity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; esophagus cancer; female; gallbladder cancer; gastrointestinal disease; hematologic disease; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; leukemia; liver cancer; lung cancer; male; medicinal plant; melanoma; molecular mechanics; mouse; mouth cancer; nonhuman; osteosarcoma; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; Review; skin disease; stomach cancer; tongue cancer; uterine cervix cancer"
"Gender differences in correlates of cognition in first-episode psychosis",2019,"Studies of gender cognitive differences in schizophrenia have reported mixed results. This study examined cognitive correlates including demographics, symptoms and functioning in men and women in a large sample of first-episode adult-onset psychosis patients. Detailed demographic, clinical and functioning data were collected from 360 first-episode patients upon admission into an early intervention service for psychotic disorders. They were also administered a comprehensive neurocognitive battery. Correlation analyses showed that memory and working memory were more significantly associated with onset age, negative symptoms and side effects in women. Processing speed correlated with antipsychotic dosage in men and side effects in women. Selective attention correlated with reality distortion and negative symptoms in women, and onset age and education in men. Executive function correlated with onset age and reality distortion in women. All cognitive domains significantly correlated with educational level and functioning in both genders. Negative symptoms explained significant variability in cognition in both genders, while reality distortion, side effects and affective symptoms were significant factors that differentiated between genders. Although there are similarities in cognitive deficits, considerable heterogeneity exists in associations of symptoms and cognition in men and women. Results facilitate individualised tailoring of interventions, including cognitive remediation therapy. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","academic achievement; adult; adverse outcome; Article; cognition; cognitive defect; cognitive remediation therapy; cohort analysis; correlational study; demography; disease activity; disease association; early intervention; educational status; executive function; female; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; negative syndrome; onset age; priority journal; processing speed; psychosis; selective attention; sex difference; working memory; China; cognitive defect; complication; emotional disorder; middle aged; pathophysiology; psychosis; schizophrenia; sexual characteristics; Adult; Affective Symptoms; China; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Sex Characteristics"
"The effect of sleep deprivation and disruption on DNA damage and health of doctors",2019,"Observational studies have highlighted the detrimental health effects of shift work. The mechanisms through which acute sleep deprivation may lead to chronic disease have not been elucidated, but it is thought that increased DNA damage or decreased repair can lead to disease. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of acute sleep deprivation on DNA damage. This was a cross-sectional observational study on 49 healthy, full-time doctors. Baseline blood was sampled from each participant after three consecutive days of adequate sleep. Participants (n?=?24) who were required to work overnight on-site had additional blood sampled on a morning after acute sleep deprivation. DNA damage and expression of DNA repair genes were quantified. Information on health, working patterns and sleep diaries were collected. Independent t-tests were used to compare differences between groups and standardised mean differences expressed as Cohen's d. Overnight on-site call participants had lower baseline DNA repair gene expression and more DNA breaks than participants who did not work overnight (d?=?1.47, p?=?0.0001; and 1.48, p?=?0.0001, respectively). In overnight on-site call participants, after acute sleep deprivation, DNA repair gene expression was decreased (d?=?0.90, p?=?0.0001) and DNA breaks were increased (d?=?0.87, p?=?0.0018). Sleep deprivation in shift workers is associated with adverse health consequences. Increased DNA damage has been linked to the development of chronic disease. This study demonstrates that disrupted sleep is associated with DNA damage. Furthermore, larger prospective studies looking at relationships between DNA damage and chronic disease development are warranted, and methods to relieve, or repair, DNA damage linked to sleep deprivation should be investigated. ? 2019 Association of Anaesthetists","DNA repair protein XRCC1; excision repair cross complementing protein 1; hprt1 protein; ogg1 protein; protein; unclassified drug; DNA binding protein; DNA glycosyltransferase; endonuclease; ERCC1 protein, human; oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human; adult; Article; chronic disease; comet assay; controlled study; cross-sectional study; DNA damage; DNA repair; DNA strand breakage; female; gene expression; health; human; human experiment; male; night shift; normal human; observational study; physician; prospective study; shift worker; sleep; sleep deprivation; thinking; circadian rhythm sleep disorder; complication; genetics; sleep deprivation; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; DNA Damage; DNA Glycosylases; DNA Repair; DNA-Binding Proteins; Endonucleases; Female; Humans; Male; Physicians; Sleep Deprivation; Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm"
"The relationship between comorbidities in dementia patients and burden on adult–child primary caregivers: Does having a secondary caregiver matter?",2019,"Primary family caregivers of patients with dementia often experience high caregiver burden and significant decline in a range of health outcomes. The current study examined the relationship between medical comorbidities of inpatients with dementia and caregiver burden in adult–child primary caregivers, and the buffering effect of having a secondary caregiver on the relationship between patients’ comorbidities and caregiver burden. The study is a secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional observational study design. The sample comprised 477 dyads of inpatients with dementia and adult–child primary caregivers attending the neurological department of two grade A hospitals. All the inpatients were assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). All the adult–child primary caregivers were assessed with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and completed the questionnaires on socio-demographic data, caring hours, presence of secondary caregiver, and the level of impairment of the patient. Higher burden was associated with higher scores on the CCI and having a spouse of the patient as the secondary caregiver. A significant interaction occurred between the CCI and caregiver burden when having a spouse as the secondary caregiver, indicating the negative effect of the CCI on caregiver burden was greater when the spouse of the patient served as the secondary caregiver. In summary, the negative impact of patients’ comorbidities on caregiver burden in adult–child primary caregivers was heightened when the secondary caregiver role was undertaken by the spouse of the patient with dementia. These results may inform programmes targeted to improve care arrangements for people with dementia and their caregivers. ? 2019 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.",""
"Assessment of binocular imbalance with an augmented virtual reality platform in a normal population",2019,"We examined and analyzed binocular imbalance in a group of randomly selected normal subjects with corrected visual acuity of 0.8 or more in both eyes without ocular diseases, by using augmented virtual reality system. This study will quantify the correlation between binocular imbalance in these normal subjects and various spatial frequencies and temporal frequencies in the integrated binocular stimulation mode. A retrospective study was carried out and data from 97 patients (51 males and 46 females) who were diagnosed with no eye diseases, and with corrected binocular visual acuity of 0.8 or more, were collected. Their binocular visual function, Hirschberg test refraction status, and binocular imbalance were assessed using the quantified visual perception stimulation mode in an augmented virtual reality platform. When normal subjects (with corrected binocular vision of 0.8 or more without ocular diseases) were assessed using the integrated binocular stimulation mode with different temporal and spatial frequencies, a gradual reduction of binocular imbalance could be observed when spatial frequencies were increased. When contrast balance was adjusted, binocular imbalance was more prevalent in the horizontal state compared with the vertical state. This was seen when patients were stimulated by different temporal frequencies in the virtual reality testing mode. 17.53% and 29.90% of participants reached complete binocular fusion under low temporal frequency stimulation and high temporal frequency stimulation, respectively, while binocular imbalance was found in 65.9% and 62.89% of participants who were stimulated, respectively, by low temporal frequency and high temporal frequency. In addition, 16.5% and 7.21% experienced severe binocular imbalance under low temporal and high temporal frequency stimulation, respectively. The integrated binocular stimulation mode under low temporal frequency was more sensitive in detecting binocular imbalance. The status of binocular balance in normal subjects was not the same when stimulated by the augmented virtual reality platform, as many showed varying degrees of binocular imbalance. The results from our clinical study demonstrate that integrated binocular stimulation with different spatial and temporal frequencies enables a more sensitive detection of binocular imbalance, making it a powerful new tool for the diagnosis and analysis of clinical binocular abnormalities. In addition, since more than half of the normal subjects (without eye diseases who has corrected vision of 0.8 or more) exhibited binocular imbalance in our study, we believe that this brief binocular imbalance is likely a transient physiological phenomenon, which is not pathological to visual acuity and function, and should only be seen as pathological when binocular imbalance is prolonged, causing functional deficits such as reading impairment. ?

"Efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture on treating depression-related insomnia: A study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial",2019,"Introduction Sleep disorders including insomnia occur frequently in depressive patients. Acupuncture is a widely recognised therapy to treat depression and sleep disorders in clinical practice. This multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) is aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of depression patients with insomnia. Methods and analysis We describe a protocol for a multicentre RCT. A total of 270 eligible patients in three different healthcare centres in Shanghai will be randomly assigned to one of these three groups: treatment group (EA + standard care), control A group (sham electroacupuncture + standard care) and control B group (standard care). Treatment will be given three times per week for 8 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The secondary outcomes are sleep parameters recorded in the actigraphy, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score and Self-rating Anxiety Scale score. Daily dose of patients' antidepressant and sedative-hypnotic medication will be recorded in the dairy. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment and 8 weeks post-treatment, as well as at 1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2017SHL-KY-04).

"Electrospun chitosan/PVA/bioglass Nanofibrous membrane with spatially designed structure for accelerating chronic wound healing",2019,"Cutaneous wounds, especially chronic wounds, remain clinical challenges, and this is partially due to the complex healing process composed of four overlapping but distinct stages including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodeling. Therefore, wound dressings with spatially designed structures which can temporally regulate certain bioactive components to function at specific healing stages might be able to accelerate the healing process. In this study, nanobioglass incorporated chitosan-PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) trilayer nanofibrous membrane (nBG-TFM) was fabricated via sequential electrospinning. This membrane exhibited excellent biocompatibility, antibacterial activity and regeneration promotion effect. Furthermore, spatially designed structure optimized functions of each component and provided more suitable microenvironment as compared with uniform membrane. Rat full-thickness skin defects model and mice diabetic chronic wound model showed that nBG-TFM could achieve significantly accelerated and enhanced healing, in terms of complete re-epithelialization, improved collagen alignment and formation of skin appendages. It was revealed that nBG-TFM functioned through upregulating growth factors including VEGF and TGF-β. Meanwhile inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β were downregulated. The technology presented in this study shed new light on designing functional wound dressings which can promote healing of chronic wounds. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bioactive glass; Biocompatibility; Chitosan; Electrospinning; Mammals; Nanofibers; Anti-bacterial activity; Bioactive components; Chronic wounds; Inflammatory cytokines; Multilayer structures; Nanofibrous membranes; Re-epithelialization; Wound healing; Multilayers; Bioglass; chitosan; nanofiber; polyvinyl alcohol; animal; artificial membrane; bandage; cell line; ceramics; chemistry; chronic disease; diabetic complication; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; injury; male; metabolism; mouse; pathology; pharmacology; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; wound healing; Animals; Bandages; Cell Line; Ceramics; Chitosan; Chronic Disease; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Male; Membranes, Artificial; Mice; Nanofibers; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Wound Healing; Wounds and Injuries"
"Effect of morning exercise with or without breaks in prolonged sitting on blood pressure in older overweight/obese adults: Evidence for sex differences",2019,"Both exercise and breaks in prolonged sitting can reduce blood pressure (BP) in older overweight/obese adults. We investigated whether there is an additive hypotensive effect when exercise is combined with subsequent breaks in sitting. Sex differences and changes in plasma catecholamines as a potential candidate mechanism underlying BP responses were also examined. Sedentary older adults (n=67; 67±7 years; 31.2±4.1 kg/m2) completed 3 conditions in random order-sitting (SIT): Uninterrupted sitting (8 hours, control); exercise+sitting (EX+SIT): Sitting (1 hour), moderate-intensity walking (30 minutes), uninterrupted sitting (6.5 hours); exercise+breaks (EX+BR): Sitting (1 hour), moderate-intensity walking (30 minutes), sitting interrupted every 30 minutes with 3 minutes of light-intensity walking (6.5 hours). Serial BP and plasma epinephrine/norepinephrine measurements occurred during 8 hours. The 8-hour average systolic and diastolic BP (mm Hg 95% CI) was lower in EX+SIT-3.4 (-4.5 to-2.3),-0.8 (-1.6 to-0.04), and EX+BR-5.1 (-6.2 to-4.0),-1.1 (-1.8 to-0.3), respectively, relative to SIT (all P &lt;0.05). There was an additional reduction in average systolic BP of-1.7 (-2.8 to-0.6) in EX+BR relative to EX+SIT (P=0.003). This additional reduction in systolic BP was driven by women-3.2 (-4.7 to-1.7; P&lt;0.001 EX+BR versus EX+SIT). Average epinephrine decreased in EX+SIT and EX+BR in women (-13% to-12%) but increased in men (+12% to +23%), respectively, relative to SIT (P&lt;0.05). No differences in average norepinephrine were observed. Morning exercise reduces BP during a period of 8 hours in older overweight/obese adults compared with prolonged sitting. Combining exercise with regular breaks in sitting may be of more benefit for lowering BP in women than in men. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: Https://www.anzctr.org.au.

"Exploring the culturally specific factors of mental health in South Asian minority students in Hong Kong [探討影響香港南亞裔學生精神健康的文化相關因素]",2019,"Ethnic minority mental health in Hong Kong is understudied. This study assessed the mental well-being of minority youth in Hong Kong and explored culturally relevant factors that may promote or adversely affect this well-being. Four focus groups (including Pakistani and Indian students) were involved in this pilot qualitative study. Thematic analysis generated five main themes, related to: positive mental health outcomes for students: (1) peer and family support; (2) adolescents’ recreational activities; (3) adolescents’ sense of humour; (4) strong religious beliefs and (5) local Chinese community support. Adolescents’ adverse life experiences emerged as a significant theme in the assessment of risk factors in relation to the mental health of the students involved in the study. Two unique findings should serve to guide future research on culturally specific factors that promote positive mental health among Indian and Pakistani minority ethnic groups. First, religion and sense of humour were seen to be important to young male individuals. Second, research suggests that support from local Chinese is a significant factor in the promotion of positive mental health. The findings of the study offer insights to guide further larger scale quantitative research, and innovative and empirical driven social work practice. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescent; article; clinical assessment; controlled study; ethnic group; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; humor; Indian; juvenile; male; personal experience; psychological well-being; qualitative research; quantitative analysis; religion; risk factor; social work practice; student; thematic analysis"
"Silver deposition on demineralized dentine surface dosed by silver diammine fluoride with different saliva",2019,"AIM: Silver diammine fluoride (SDF) is an anticaries agent that binds to tooth tissue. The aim of the present study was investigate the dose-response effect of SDF on demineralized dentine in basal medium mucin (BMM) saliva substitute and human saliva. METHODS: Dentine discs stored in saliva substitute, BMM, and human unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) were chemically demineralized, and 10?μL of 10 wt%, 24 wt%, or 38 wt% SDF was applied and then stored in its respective saliva (BMM or UWS) for 5?days. Dentine disc samples were digested in 70% HNO3 , and silver was quantitatively detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. RESULTS: For both the BMM and UWS groups, the presence of silver increased proportionally with increasing concentrations of SDF (P?<?0.05). For the 38 wt% SDF application, the mean absorption percentage of silver in dentine was 3.90% for the UWS group and 6.61% for the BMM group. The BMM group was found to yield a significantly higher amount of silver compared to UWS at 10 wt% and 38 wt% SDF application (α?=?0.05); 38 wt% SDF interacts more with BMM with higher silver deposition than UWS. CONCLUSION: The amount of silver found in dentine was in proportion to the concentration of SDF. Extrapolation of in vitro investigations using artificial saliva for SDF tooth interactions should be interpreted with caution. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","ammonia; anticaries agent; fluoride; fluoride varnish; quaternary ammonium derivative; silver; silver derivative; silver diamine fluoride; silver diammine; chemistry; dental caries; dentin; dose response; drug effect; human; in vitro study; pathology; saliva; surface property; tooth disease; topical drug administration; Administration, Topical; Ammonia; Cariostatic Agents; Dental Caries; Dentin; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fluorides; Fluorides, Topical; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Saliva; Silver; Silver Compounds; Surface Properties; Tooth Demineralization"

Estimates suggest that SC increased the proportion of Latino immigrants with mental health distress by 2.2 percentage points (14.7%), Task Force Enforcement under Section 287(g) worsened their mental health distress scores by 15 percent (0.08 standard deviation), and Jail Enforcement under Section 287(g) increased the proportion of Latino immigrants reporting fair or poor health by 1 percentage point (11.1%) and lowered the proportion reporting very good or excellent health by 4.8 to 7.0 percentage points (7.8% to 10.9%). These findings are robust to various sensitivity checks and have long-term implications for population health, public health expenditure, and immigrant integration. ?

"Cost-effectiveness analysis of Abiraterone Acetate versus Docetaxel in the management of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: Hong Kong’s perspective",2020,"Background: Several randomized control trials (RCTs) have showed that adding either abiraterone acetate (AA) or docetaxel (D) to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients (mCSPC). Yet, the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options has not been fully compared under Hong Kong’s setting. This cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) serves as the first study in Hong Kong to compare the economic value of these two combinations ADT + AA vs. ADT + D. Methods: A deterministic Markov model is used to project cost-effectiveness of each treatment until death. Survival curves for progression/death were extracted and digitized from the five RCTs (CHAARTED, LATITUDE, two STAMPEDE (2016/2017), and GETUG-AFU15). Clinically significant adverse events (AEs) were modeled; utility values were obtained from the literature. Primary outcomes were the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We used the societal perspective from Hong Kong and considered three times of local gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) as the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (i.e., US$138,649). We estimated the break-even cost of AA in case ADT + AA is not a cost-effective strategy under this WTP threshold. While considering the standard AA dosage (1000 mg) as the main analysis, we also examined the potential impact of the low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy. Results: Integrating simulations with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ADT + D returns 0.79 (median; 95% credible interval 0.56–0.97) QALY with an ICER of US$14,397/QALY ($7824–22,632) compared to ADT-alone. A head-to-head comparison indicates that ADT + AA further gains 0.79 (0.45–1.17) QALY but with an ICER of $361,439/QALY ($260,615–599,683) when compared to ADT + D. Considering three times of GDPpc as WTP threshold, ADT + D is more cost-effective in all simulations; while ADT + AA is more cost-effective than ADT + D only if the cost of AA is reduced by at least 63%. The low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy is potentially cost-effective when it generates equivalent efficacy as the standard dosage (1000 mg). Conclusions: ADT + D is therefore shown to be a more cost-effective strategy than ADT + AA in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients in developed economies. Addition of AA substantially improved QALY compared to D but at a significant cost. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","abiraterone acetate; docetaxel; prednisone; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; cancer growth; cause of death; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; failure free survival; gross domestic product per capita; gross national product; Hong Kong; human; low drug dose; male; metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer; multiple cycle treatment; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; progression free survival; prostate cancer; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; urogenital tract metastasis; Willingness To Pay"
"Short version dental anxiety inventory score may predict the response in the insular cortex to stimuli mimicking dental treatment",2019,"Background: Dental anxiety is a common reason for avoiding dental visits and is associated with poor dental status. The short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory (SDAxI) is an easy-to-use, multi-faceted questionnaire for assessing the level of trait dental anxiety. However, there was no neurophysiological data indicating if its score associates with the state anxiety when an individual is under real/mock dental environment. We hypothesized that there exists such an association. Materials and Methods: Twenty systemic healthy adults with dental attendance experience and self-claimed free of dental phobia were recruited in this cross-sectional study, with their dental anxiety level assessed by SDAxI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging recorded their brain signals in response to audiovisual footages resembling dental scaler or turbine in action. After the brain imaging, they gave fear ratings to the footages in visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Participants’ SDAxI scores positively correlated with their responses in the insular cortex (r2 = 0.388–0.445, P &lt; 0.005). Their SDAxI scores also positively correlated with their fear ratings of the footages (r2 = 0.415–0.555, P &lt; 0.005). Discussion: Our findings indicated a possible neurobiological relevance of SDAxI, and reinforced its neurobiological validity in assessing dental anxiety level of dental attenders. ? 2019 Yeung, Lee, Tanabe, Ng, Khong, Leung and Goto.","adult; Article; clinical article; clinical protocol; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; dental facility; dental phobia; electroencephalography; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; image analysis; image processing; insula; magnetic field; male; neurobiology; neurophysiology; personal experience; scoring system; short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory score; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; visual analog scale; young adult"
"Working while sick: Validation of the multidimensional presenteeism exposures and productivity survey for nurses (MPEPS-N)",2019,"Background: Presenteeism is the employee behaviour of physically attending work with reduced performance due to illness or for other reasons. Nurses are four times more likely to exhibit presenteeism compared to other occupations, threatening patient safety through increased patient falls, medication errors and staff-to-patient disease transmission. There is a paucity of standardized instruments that quantify the association between presenteeism with its exposures and related productivity. This study aims to validate an instrument that comprehensively measures presenteeism workplace and personal exposures specifically for Asian nurses. Methods: Questionnaire domain items were selected based on the JD-R framework and a previously conducted systematic review of pre-existing validated scales measuring work attendance exposures used in previous healthcare studies. The preliminary questionnaire consisted of two outcomes (presenteeism frequency, productivity) and five exposure domains: work resources, work demands, work stress, work engagement, personal traits and health. Content validation and back translation (English-Cantonese Chinese-English) were carried out. Responses from full-time nurses working in two acute care hospitals (Preliminary questionnaire at Hospital 1: N = 295 and main round questionnaire at Hospital 2: N = 1146) were included in the validation study to ensure an adequate sample size of ten cases per indicator variable for CFA analysis. A random sample of 80 nurses from Hospital 1 were selected for test-retest reliability 4 weeks post the initial survey. Internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity tests were also tested. Results: Satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7), test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.4); and construct validity - convergent and discriminant validity was achieved. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded satisfactory fitness indices (CFI and TLI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.08). Presenteeism and productivity significantly associated with all work resources, work engagement and work stress constructs in Hospital 2. Conclusion: A reliable Multidimensional Presenteeism Exposures and Productivity Survey (MPEPS-N) has been validated in two distinct hospital environments. The instrument helps to identify and quantify organizational or individual exposures that significantly associate with presenteeism and its related productivity, thus allowing hospital managers to set evidence-based intervention targets for wellness programs and formulate human resource policies in reducing presenteeism-related productivity loss. ? 2019 The Author(s).","factor analysis; health survey; human; nursing staff; occupational health; patient safety; presenteeism; productivity; psychology; validation study; workplace; Efficiency; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Health Surveys; Humans; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Occupational Health; Patient Safety; Presenteeism; Workplace"
"Can grief be a mental disorder? An online survey on public opinion in mainland China",2020,"This study investigates Chinese people’s opinions about the diagnosis of grief and the factors associated with their opinions. Among 1041 participants who completed the online survey, over half (56.5%) agreed that grief could be a mental disorder under certain circumstances, such as harm to self or others, functional impairment, and persistent grief. Primary reasons against the diagnosis were that grief is normal and its intensity decreases over time. A small proportion of opponents also expressed concerns about stigmatization resulting from labeling grief as being pathological. Younger, male, and full-time employed adults tended to support diagnosing grief as a mental disorder. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",""
"Disparities Between HIV Testing Levels and the Self-Reported HIV-Negative Status of Sexually Active College Students",2019,"The methodological issues of using self-reported human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing history to determine HIV infection status are understudied. This study aimed to assess the disparities between HIV testing history and self-reported HIV status, with a specific objective of estimating the prevalence of self-reported HIV-negative status in sexually active students who had never had an HIV test (inaccurate self-disclosure). Participants were recruited from four Hong Kong universities; 255 students were included in the analysis, with 16.1% of participants being men who have sex with men (MSM). Overall, 81.6% of participants reported they never had been tested for HIV, with inaccurate self-disclosure by 65.9% of participants. Among participants who used condoms inconsistently, only 20.2% had had HIV tests, with inaccurate self-disclosure by 66.7% of subjects. Among MSM students, only 36.6% had had HIV tests, with inaccurate self-disclosure by 61.0% of participants. Among MSM students who used condoms inconsistently, only 35.1% had had HIV tests, with inaccurate self-disclosure by 62.2% of participants. The findings raise concerns about the use of self-reported HIV status in clinical practice and research. The low prevalence of HIV testing found suggests that interventions to promote HIV testing should be continued. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.",""
"Effect of acupuncture on insomnia in menopausal women: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: The National Institutes of Health estimates the prevalence of insomnia in menopausal women at 40-50%. Some studies have shown that acupuncture might be effective in treating primary insomnia and insomnia related to depression and stroke. Although there are some programs supporting insomnia during the menopausal transition, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCT) to provide evidence regarding their effectiveness. We design a RCT of suitable sample size to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with insomnia during the menopausal transition and to form an optimized acupuncture treatment protocol. Method/Design: In this randomized, single-site, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 84 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group (n = 42) or the sham control group (n = 42) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will receive a total of 18 treatment sessions for eight consecutive weeks. Treatments will be given three times per week in the first four weeks, twice a week for the next two weeks, and finally once weekly for the final two weeks. Treatment will utilize eight main acupoints (GV20, GV24, GV29, RN6, RN4, SP6, HT7, EX-HN22) and extra two acupoints based on syndrome differentiation. The primary outcome will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary outcomes will be measured by sleep parameters recorded in the Actigraphy (SE, TST, SA), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Menopause Quality of Life (Men-QOL). The primary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and the first and third month after the end of treatment. Discussion: If the results confirm that acupuncture is effective and safe for the treatment on insomnia in menopausal women, this positive outcome could provide evidence for clinical application.

"Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of strengths model case management (SMCM) with Chinese mental health service users in Hong Kong",2019,"Introduction Strengths-based approaches mobilise individual and environmental resources that can facilitate the recovery of people with mental illness. Strengths model case management (SMCM), developed by Rapp and Goscha through collaborative efforts at the University of Kansas, offers a structured and innovative intervention. As evidence of the effectiveness of strengths-based interventions come from Western studies, which lacked rigorous research design or failed to assure fidelity to the model, we aim to fill these gaps and conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of SMCM for individuals with mental illness in Hong Kong. Methods and analysis This will be an RCT of SMCM. Assuming a medium intervention effect (Cohen's d=0.60) with 30% missing data (including dropouts), 210 service users aged 18 years or above will be recruited from three community mental health centres. They will be randomly assigned to SMCM groups (intervention) or SMILE groups (control) in a 1:1 ratio. The SMCM groups will receive strengths model interventions from case workers, whereas the SMILE groups will receive generic care from case workers with an attention placebo. The case workers will all be embedded in the community centres and will be required to provide a session with service users in both groups at least once every fortnight. There will be two groups of case workers for the intervention and control groups, respectively. The effectiveness of the SMCM will be compared between the two groups of service users with outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months after recruitment. Functional outcomes will also be reported by case workers. Data on working alliances and goal attainment will be collected from individual case workers. Qualitative evaluation will be conducted to identify the therapeutic ingredients and conditions leading to positive outcomes. Trained outcome assessors will be blind to the group allocation. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Hong Kong has been obtained (HRECNCF: EA1703078).

"Long-term survival comparison between primary transplant and upfront curative treatment with salvage transplant for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Background: Whether primary liver transplantation (PLT) or upfront curative treatment with salvage liver transplantation (SLT) is a better treatment option for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. This study aims to compare the long-term survival starting from the time of primary treatment between the two approaches for early HCC using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Methods: From 1995 to 2014, 175 patients with early HCC undergoing either PLT (n = 149) or SLT (n = 26) were retrospectively reviewed in a prospectively collected database. Patients' demographic data, tumor characteristics, short-term and long-term outcome were compared between two groups after PSM. Results: After matching, the baseline characteristics were comparable between mPLT group (n = 45) and mSLT group (n = 25). The tumor recurrence rate after transplant was significantly higher in mSLT group than mPLT group (28% vs. 15.6%). Calculating from the time of primary treatment, the 1, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates were comparable between mPLT group (97.8%, 91.1% and 86.3%) and mSLT group (100%, 95% and 85%). However, the 1, 3, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were significantly better in mPLT group than mSLT group (95.6% vs. 90%, 86.6% vs. 80% and 84.3% vs. 70%). SLT approach and high pre-treatment serum alpha-fetoprotein level (>200 ηg/mL) were poor prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival after transplant. Conclusions: PLT may be a better treatment option for early HCC, whereas SLT approach for HCC should be cautiously considered under the circumstance of organ shortage. ? 2018","adult; aged; cancer staging; comparative study; female; follow up; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver transplantation; liver tumor; male; middle aged; mortality; pathology; propensity score; retrospective study; salvage therapy; survival analysis; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome"
"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in infant formulae, follow-on formulae, and baby foods in Iran: An assessment of risk",2019,"Twenty-seven samples of infant formulae and follow-on formulae and fifteen samples of baby food from Iranian markets were analyzed for concentrations of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH4) determined by use of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrophotometry. An assessment of risks posed to infants and toddlers was conducted by calculating the margin of exposure and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) by use of the Monte Carlo Simulation Method. Benzo (a) anthracene, was not detected in any of the samples, while approximately 64.3% samples contained detectable amounts of benzo (a) pyrene, while chrysene was observed in three samples and benzo (b) fluoranthene was detected in one sample. One of the samples contained 1.43 μg PAH4/kg, which was greater than the maximum tolerable limit (MTL; 1 μg/kg) stated in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1125. Accordingly, the 95% ILCRs in the infants/toddlers due to ingestion of milk powder and baby foods were determined to be 1.3 × 10?6 and 7.3 × 10?7, respectively. Also, the 95th centiles of the MOEs, due to ingesting milk powder or baby foods by infants/toddlers were estimated to be 3.6 × 104 and 7.2 × 104, respectively.

"Pedagogical demonstration of twitter data analysis: A case study of world AIDS day, 2014",2019,"As a pedagogical demonstration of Twitter data analysis, a case study of HIV/AIDS-related tweets around World AIDS Day, 2014, was presented. This study examined if Twitter users from countries with various income levels responded differently to World AIDS Day. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models as classifiers of relevant tweets was evaluated. A manual coding of 1,826 randomly sampled HIV/AIDS-related original tweets from November 30 through December 2, 2014 was completed. Logistic regression was applied to analyze the association between the World Bank-designated income level of users’ self-reported countries and Twitter contents. To identify the optimal SVM model, 1278 (70%) of the 1826 sampled tweets were randomly selected as the training set, and 548 (30%) served as the test set. Another 180 tweets were separately sampled and coded as the held-out dataset. Compared with tweets from low-income countries, tweets from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries had 60% lower odds to mention epidemiology (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.404; 95% CI: 0.166, 0.981) and three times the odds to mention compassion/support (aOR = 3.080; 95% CI: 1.179, 8.047). Tweets from lower-middle-income countries had 79% lower odds than tweets from low-income countries to mention HIV-affected sub-populations (aOR = 0.213; 95% CI: 0.068, 0.664). The optimal SVM model was able to identify relevant tweets from the held-out dataset of 180 tweets with an accuracy (F1 score) of 0.72. This study demonstrated how students can be taught to analyze Twitter data using manual coding, regression models, and SVM models. ? 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",""
"Association between quantitative parameters of CEUS and Sall4/Wnt/β-catenin signaling in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Objectives: In this study, we aim to investigate the correlations of quantitative parameters of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and Spalt-Like Transcription Factor 4 (Sall4)/ Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway with clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The CEUS was performed to detect the liver function and the prognosis of patients. The expression of Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining. Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin mRNA expression was measured by SYBR green qPCR assay. Results: We found that the mRNA and protein expression of Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin in the HCC tissues were significantly upregulated compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Upregulation of these proteins was associated with tumor differentiation, TNM stage, tumor size, vascular invasion and liver cirrhosis of HCC patients. In addition, we found that decreased time to peak and washout time and increased peak intensity and area under the curve of CEUS in the HCC were also correlated with TNM stage, tumor size and vascular invasion. Moreover, Sall4, WNT3a and β-catenin protein were significantly associated with the TTP, PI, AUC, and WOT. Conclusion: This study suggests that quantitative parameters of CEUS and Sall4/Wnt/ β-catenin signaling may be helpful for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of HCC patients. ? 2019 Wang et al.","beta catenin; messenger RNA; RNA; spalt like transcription factor 4; transcription factor; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cancer staging; cancer tissue; clinical feature; contrast-enhanced ultrasound; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver function; liver parenchyma; major clinical study; male; polymerase chain reaction; prognosis; protein expression; RNA extraction; signal transduction; tumor differentiation; tumor volume; upregulation"
"Challenging digital capitalism: SACOM's campaigns against Apple and Foxconn as monopoly capital",2019,"‘Utopia or dystopia–to where will the “digital revolution” lead human society?’ is a question that remains unanswered. Negotiating between two opposing standpoints, this article, looking at a form of trans-border activism originally driven by suicides and protests of Foxconn workers who produce iPhones, iPads, and many other i-gadgets for the world's consumers, is an attempt to explore a politics of online and offline resistance against anti-digital capitalism. Based in Hong Kong (HK), SACOM is a leftist student group which works to support Chinese workers in campaigning against corporate power and generating trans-border networks through media exposure, international activism, and localized organizing. Combining online and offline activism, SACOM strives to extend the reach of their worker–consumer campaign to the worldwide audience by transgressing dominance of capital and political control of the Chinese state. The most intriguing question to us is could this proactive activism be possible and, if so, how could it act at the grid of China's transformation and incorporation into global capitalism?. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Evaluation of GDF15 as a therapeutic target of cardiometabolic diseases in human: A Mendelian randomization study",2019,"Background: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a key regulator of body weight in animals by regulating food intake. Its receptor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like (GFRAL), was identified recently. Pre-clinical studies showed that it is a promising therapeutic target for cardiometabolic diseases and anorexia/cachexia. Although many pharmaceutical companies are developing drugs targeting GFRAL, whether the findings from animal studies can be extrapolated to man is unknown. Mendelian randomization (MR) is useful in investigating the relationship between risk factors and disease outcomes. We aimed to use a two-sample MR approach to evaluate the clinical usefulness of targeting GDF15 for cardiometabolic diseases. Methods: Genetic instruments and summary statistics for MR analyses were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of GDF15 and cardiometabolic outcomes (n = 27,394 to 644,875), including body mass index, waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, whole-body lean mass, fat percentage, Type 2 Diabetes, fasting glucose, glycated haemoglobin, fasting insulin, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, coronary artery disease, and estimated BMD (eBMD). Conventional inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was adopted to obtain the causal estimates of GDF-15 with different outcomes; weighted median and MR-egger were used for sensitivity analyses. Findings: There was null association between GDF15 levels and anthropometric outcomes. One SD increase in genetically-determined GDF15 was significantly associated with reduced HDL-C (beta: -0.048SD; SE: 0.014; P = .001) but the result was not significant in sensitivity analyses. A consistent significant causal association was observed between GDF15 and eBMD in IVW (beta: 0.026 SD; SE: 0.005; P < .001) and subsequent sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: This study sheds lights on the potential of drugs targeting the GDF15/GFRAL axis. It suggested that the effect of targeting GDF15/GFRAL axis for weight control in human may be different from the effects observed in animal studies. GDF15 treatment may improve BMD in humans.

"A rare case of rectal prolapse after Deloyers procedure in a patient with Hirschsprung's disease: A case report",2019,"Introduction: Deloyers procedure has been reported in the literature as a viable alternative to the more commonly performed Swenson, Soave and Duhamel methods. As of yet, the long term sequelae of this procedure for patients with Hirschsprung's disease have not been studied in depth. Presentation of case: We report the first case in the literatures of a 27-year-old man presenting with rectal prolapse due to colorectal anastomotic intussusception after Deloyers procedure for Hirschsprung's disease. Discussion: Few studies with low case volume have been performed investigating the long term sequelae of Deloyers procedure as a mainstay in patients undergoing operative treatment for Hirschsprung's disease. This procedure allows for preservation of a longer segment of colon, in turn potentially improving absorption and continence compared to other methods. Studies are limited and as of yet the viability of Deloyers as a mainstay of treatment for Hirschsprung's disease is inconclusive. Conclusion: We report the first adult case of prolapsed colorectal anastomotic intussusception after Deloyers procedure for Hirschsprung's disease.

All newborns received standard HBV vaccination and immunoglobulin. Hepatitis B surface antigen of infants was tested at 9–12 months of age. Results: 641 pregnancies were recruited and analyzed. No statistically significant difference was found in gravida, parity, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, duration of rupture of membranes, duration of labour, preterm delivery, preterm rupture of membranes or birth weight (p &gt; 0.05). Subgroup analysis in viral load &gt; 7log 10 IU/ml and 8log 10 IU/ml also did not find a significant association between duration of rupture of membranes and labour with immunoprophylaxis failure. Conclusions: Duration of rupture of membranes and labour would not affect the risk of HBV vertical transmission in infants following standard HBV vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","engerixtm b; hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B vaccine; virus DNA; adult; Article; female; gestational age; hepatitis B; Hong Kong; human; immunoprophylaxis; infection risk; labor complication; major clinical study; multicenter study; observational study; pregnant woman; premature fetus membrane rupture; premature labor; priority journal; prospective study; vaccination; vertical transmission; clinical trial; hepatitis B; labor; newborn; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prevention and control; risk factor; transmission; vertical transmission; virology; virus load; Adult; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Hepatitis B; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Labor, Obstetric; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Viral Load"
"A Novel AID Shuffle Mechanism for RAW Slot Assignment in IEEE 802.11ah Networks",2019,"To implement the new restricted access window (RAW) medium access control mechanism in IEEE 802.11ah, stations (STAs) must be assigned to RAW slots based on their association IDs (AIDs). In this paper, we first identify the fixed subgroup problem with the current round-robin slot assignment. To address it, a novel AID shuffle mechanism is proposed for each STA to distributedly find a different and distinct temporary AID in each RAW. Each STA then reuses the round-robin slot assignment with its temporary AID. As a result, the set of STAs assigned to each subgroup/slot are randomized, yet with the same subgroup size. Simulation results show that the transmission fairness problem with the original round-robin assignment is solved and the system throughput is also improved. ? 2018 IEEE.","Computer networks; Medium access control; Round Robin; Round-Robin assignments; Slot assignment; System throughput; Transmission fairness; IEEE Standards"
"Major postoperative complications compromise oncological outcomes of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma after curative resection – A 13-year cohort in a tertiary center",2019,"Background/Objective: Hepatectomy is the mainstay of curative treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The relationship between postoperative complication and oncological outcome has not been defined. We aimed to elucidate the effect of postoperative complication on long-term survival of ICC patients after curative resection. Methods: Data of consecutive patients who had curative resection for ICC at our hospital from 1991 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients with cholangiohepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic adenocarcinoma or Klaskin tumor were excluded. Clinicopathological data and postoperative events were extracted from database for survival analysis. Results: There were 107 patients in our series. Their median age was 61 years. The median follow-up time was 24 months. The median tumor size was 6 cm. Major hepatectomy was required in 52.3% of them. The median operation time and blood loss was 439 minutes and 0.9L respectively. R0 resection was achieved in 88.8% of them. The median length of stay was 11 days. The 30-day and 90-day mortality was 2.5% and 6.8% respectively. Major complications were found in 20.6% of them. Patients with postoperative complications had significantly inferior survival than patients without (3-yr DFS 38% vs. 27%, P = 0.001; 3-yr overall: 51% vs. 27%, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that postoperative complication was an independent factor associated with disease-free survival (OR 1.9 95% C.I. 1.10–3.24, P = 0.021) and overall survival (OR 2.1, 95% C.I. 1.13–3.93, P = 0.018). Conclusion: Postoperative complication has a significant impact on ICC patients’ long-term survival. Extra measures such as adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered for patients who develop major complications after surgery. ? 2018","adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; bile duct cancer; bile duct carcinoma; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; length of stay; liver resection; male; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; operation duration; operative blood loss; pathology; postoperative complication; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; survival rate; tertiary care center; time factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Blood Loss, Surgical; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cholangiocarcinoma; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatectomy; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Tertiary Care Centers; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"HN1L-mediated transcriptional axis AP-2γ/METTL13/TCF3-ZEB1 drives tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies and lacks targeted therapies. Here, we reported a novel potential therapeutic target hematological and neurological expressed 1 like (HN1L) in HCC. First, HCC tissue microarray analysis showed that HN1L was frequently up-regulated in cancer tissues than that in normal liver tissues, which significantly associated with tumor size, local invasion, distant metastases, and poor prognosis for HCC patients. Functional studies demonstrated that ectopic expression of HN1L could increase cell growth, foci formation in monolayer culture, colony formation in soft agar and tumorigenesis in nude mice. In addition, HN1L could also promote HCC metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Inversely, silencing HN1L expression with shRNA could effectively attenuate its oncogenic function. We further showed that HN1L transcriptionally up-regulated methyltransferase like 13 (METTL13) gene in an AP-2γ dependent manner, which promoted cell proliferation and metastasis by up-regulating TCF3 and ZEB1. Importantly, administration of lentivirus-mediated shRNA interfering HN1L expression could inhibit tumorigenesis and metastasis in mice. Collectively, HN1L-mediated transcriptional axis AP-2γ/METTL13/TCF3-ZEB1 promotes HCC growth and metastasis representing?a promising therapeutic target in HCC treatment. ? 2019, ADMC Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare.","lentivirus vector; methyltransferase; methyltransferase like 13; short hairpin RNA; transcription factor 7 like 1; transcription factor ZEB1; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cancer tissue; cell proliferation; cohort analysis; colony formation; controlled study; disease association; distant metastasis; ectopic expression; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene; gene expression; gene silencing; HN1L gene; liver cell carcinoma; liver metastasis; metastasis inhibition; metastasis potential; microarray analysis; monolayer culture; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; protein protein interaction; receptor upregulation; RNA interference; spleen metastasis; TCF gene; tumor invasion; tumor volume; upregulation; ZEB1 gene"
"2018 APLAR axial spondyloarthritis treatment recommendations",2019,"Introduction: Despite the availability of axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) recommendations proposed by various rheumatology societies, we considered that a region-specific guideline was of substantial added value to clinicians of the Asia-Pacific region, given the wide variations in predisposition to infections and other patient factors, local practice patterns, and access to treatment across countries. Materials and methods: Systematic reviews were undertaken of English-language articles published between 2000 and 2016, identified from MEDLINE using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. The strength of available evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were developed through consensus using the Delphi technique. Results: Fourteen axial SpA treatment recommendations were developed based on evidence summaries and consensus. The first 2 recommendations cover non-pharmacological approaches to management. Recommendations 3 to 5 describe the following: the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first-line symptomatic treatment; the avoidance of long-term corticosteroid use; and the utility of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) for peripheral or extra-articular manifestations. Recommendation 6 refers to the indications for biological DMARDs (bDMARDs). Recommendation 7 deals specifically with screening for infections endemic to Asia, prior to use of bDMARDs. Recommendations 7 to 13 cover the role of bDMARDs in the treatment of active axial SpA and include related issues such as continuing therapy and use in special populations. Recommendation 14 deals with the utility of surgical intervention in axial SpA. Conclusion: These recommendations provide up-to-date guidance for treatment of axial SpA to help meet the needs of patients and clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","corticosteroid; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; placebo; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; antirheumatic agent; biological product; corticosteroid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; Article; Asia; clinical decision making; clinical feature; clinical practice; consensus development; drug choice; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug safety; endemic disease; evidence based medicine; health care access; health care need; human; infection; outcome assessment; practice guideline; priority journal; spine surgery; spondylarthritis; systematic review; treatment duration; visual analog scale; consensus; Delphi study; immunology; patient safety; practice guideline; rheumatology; risk assessment; risk factor; spondylarthritis; standards; treatment outcome; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antirheumatic Agents; Asia; Biological Products; Consensus; Delphi Technique; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Patient Safety; Rheumatology; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Spondylarthritis; Treatment Outcome"
"Heated tobacco products use in Chinese adults in Hong Kong: A population-based cross-sectional study",2019,"Introduction: We investigated heated tobacco products (HTPs) use and associated factors in Chinese adults in Hong Kong where HTPs are not formally marketed yet, and cigarette smoking prevalence was the lowest in the developed world. Methods: A population-based landline telephone survey in 2017 interviewed 5131 (45.2% male; 26.7% aged ?60) adults to collect information on awareness, intention to use, ever use of HTPs, cigarette smoking status and sociodemographic characteristics. Descriptive statistics were weighted by the age, sex and smoking status of the Hong Kong adult population. Sociodemographics were mutually adjusted in logistic regression to yield adjusted ORs (AORs) for awareness of HTPs, controlling for smoking status. Results: Overall, 11.3% (95% CI 10.0% to 12.7%) were aware of HTPs and 1.0 % (0.8%-1.2%) had ever used it. Awareness was associated with aged 40-49 years (AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87) or 30-39 years (2.03, 1.41-2.91) (vs ?60 years), born in Hong Kong (1.37, 1.11-1.68) and higher monthly household income (p for trend 0.001). Ever HTP users had higher educational attainment and monthly household income, and more were aged 30-39 and economically active (all p<0.003). In never HTP users, intention to use HTPs (7.3%, 4.9%-10.8%) were more prevalent in respondents with similar characteristics (all p<0.008). More current (vs never) smokers were aware of HTPs, intent to use HTPs and had ever used HTPs (all p<0.001). Conclusion: Higher socioeconomic status was associated with HTP use and intention to use. Public health education on HTPs is needed especially for this high-risk group. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.",""
"Serum Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in entecavir-treated chronic hepatitis B patients",2019,"Background and Aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can still develop in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving antiviral treatment. Serum Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) is a novel marker for liver fibrosis. We investigated its role on incidence of HCC in entecavir (ETV)-treated CHB patients. Methods: We identified HCC cases diagnosed at ??1?year of ETV treatment. CHB patients without HCC (matched for age, gender, baseline hepatitis B virus-DNA, and duration of ETV treatment) were identified in approximately 1:2 ratio (HCC: non-HCC) for comparison. Serum samples were retrieved at baseline (initiation of ETV), 3, and 5?years of ETV for serum M2BPGi measurement (expressed in cut-off index [COI]). Results: One hundred HCC cases were matched with 185 CHB patients without HCC (median age 56.7?years, 78.9% male, baseline hepatitis B virus-DNA 5.6?logIU/mL, and median follow-up 7.1?years). Median time from ETV initiation to incident HCC was 3.9?years. Serum M2BPGi levels were significantly higher in HCC cases compared with controls at baseline and year 3 (1.25 vs 0.98 [P?=?0.004], 0.89 vs 0.74 [P?=?0.018] COI, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that baseline M2BPGi was the only independent factor associated with incident HCC (odds ratio 1.241, 95% confidence interval 1.039–1.482, P?=?0.017). Using a cut-off value of 1.15 COI, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of baseline serum M2BPGi in cirrhotic patients to predict incident HCC were 90%, 53.8%, 69.6%, and 82.1%, respectively. Conclusions: Baseline and 3-year serum M2BPGi may be useful to identify high risk patients on antiviral treatment for subsequent HCC development. ? 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","albumin; bilirubin; carrier proteins and binding proteins; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; mac 2 binding protein; unclassified drug; virus DNA; adult; albumin blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; cancer risk; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; female; follow up; Hepatitis B virus; high risk patient; human; isomer; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; predictive value; priority journal; protein blood level; protein glycosylation; sensitivity and specificity; treatment duration"
"Pityriasis rosea: Elucidation of environmental factors in modulated autoagressive etiology and dengue virus infection",2019,"Introduction: A retrospective epidemiological study was conducted to study seasonal variation in the incidence of pityriasis rosea (PR) and its temporal association with various meteorological variables, and dengue virus infection. Methods: The study was conducted at a tertiary referral center in Guwahati, Assam, India. We searched for and retrieved all medical records of patients diagnosed with PR by dermatologists from December 1st, 2014 to July 31st, 2017. The diagnosis was made only if the patient fulfilled at least three out of the following four clinical features: 1) herald patch, 2) peripheral collaret scales, 3) predominant truncal and proximal limb distribution of the lesions, and 4) orientation of lesions along the lines of cleavage. For each visit by every patient, we retrieved data for the monthly mean air temperature, mean total rainfall, and mean relative humidity. PR patients that had dengue fever with NS1 antigen and/or IgM/IgG antibody positivity were studied along with healthy controls. Results: Overall, PR occurred more frequently in the colder months and months with less rainfall. However, these associations were insignificant (p = 0.23, R = ?0.38, and R = ?0.55, respectively). Upon further examination of the data, we found that the monthly incidence of PR was significantly lower in March and April than the other months during the study period (F = 8.31, p = 0.002). A statistically significant higher incidence was detected in September, November, and December (p < 0.01 for 2014 and 2017, but not in the 2016 seasonal cohort) and also in January and February (p < 0.05 for 2016 and 2017). Interestingly, a retrospective history of dengue fever emerged as a significant correlate. Conclusions: In our setting, there was significant temporal clustering and seasonal variation among patients with PR. The incidence of dengue fever is significantly correlated with PR. ? 2019, Slovenian Medical Society.

"Epstein-Barr virus-coded miR-BART13 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell growth and metastasis via targeting of the NKIRAS2/NF-κB pathway",2019,"Based on analysis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BART microRNA expression profiles, we previously reported that EBV-encoded miR-BART13 is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) plasma specimens. However, the effects and molecular mechanisms of miR-BART13 in NPC remain largely unknown. We found that miR-BART13 was significantly upregulated in NPC tissue specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-BART13 promoted NPC cell proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and metastasis in vitro, and facilitated xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Molecularly, NF-κB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2 (NKIRAS2), a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling, was identified to be a direct target of miR-BART13 in NPC cells, and NKIRAS2 mRNA and protein expression was inversely correlated with miR-BART13 in NPC tissues, respecitvely. Furthermore, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by miR-BART13. By rescued experiments, reconstitution of NKIRAS2 expression abrogated all the phenotypes upregulated by miR-BART13, and attenuated activity of NF-κB signaling pathway activated by miR-BART13 in NPC cells. Our findings indicated the newly identified miR-BART13/NKIRAS2/NF-κB signaling axis may provide further insights into better understanding of NPC initiation and development, and targeting of this pathway could be further studied as a therapeutic strategy for NPC patients. ? 2019","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; microRNA; NKIRAS2 protein; regulator protein; unclassified drug; carrier protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; microRNA; virus RNA; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; BART13 gene; cancer growth; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; Epstein Barr virus; female; gene expression; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung metastasis; metastasis; mouse; nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line; nasopharynx carcinoma; NKIRAS2 gene; nonhuman; oncogene; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; Bagg albino mouse; drug screening; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metastasis; nasopharynx carcinoma; nasopharynx tumor; nude mouse; procedures; signal transduction; tumor cell line; virology; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis; NF-kappa B; RNA, Viral; Signal Transduction; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
"Dimethyl fumarate, a two-edged drug: Current status and future directions",2019,"Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a fumaric acid ester registered for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It induces protein succination leading to inactivation of cysteine-rich proteins. It was first shown to possess cytoprotective and antioxidant effects in noncancer models, which appeared related to the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)–related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. DMF also displays antitumor activity in several cellular and mice models. Recently, we showed that the anticancer mechanism of DMF is dose-dependent and is paradoxically related to the decrease in the nuclear translocation of NRF2. Some other studies performed indicate also the potential role of DMF in cancers, which are dependent on the NRF2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program, such as KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. It, however, seems that DMF has multiple biological effects as it has been shown to also inhibit the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), thus blocking downstream targets that may be involved in the development and progression of inflammatory cascades leading to various disease processes, including tumors, lymphomas, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, and psoriasis. Herein, we present the current status and future directions of the use of DMF in various diseases models with particular emphases on its targeting of specific intracellular signal transduction cascades in cancer; to shed some light on its possible mode of action. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cysteine; fumaric acid dimethyl ester; G protein coupled receptor; G protein coupled receptor 109A; glutathione; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; K ras protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; thiol; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; agonist; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; cancer therapy; cell function; cell protection; colitis; colorectal cancer; concentration (parameter); detoxification; drug cytotoxicity; drug structure; drug targeting; drug use; endoplasmic reticulum; futurology; glycolysis; history of medicine; human; inflammatory disease; melanoma; microtubule; multiple sclerosis; nonhuman; personalized medicine; primary tumor; psoriasis; Review; signal transduction; systemic sclerosis; uterine cervix cancer"
"Compound haploinsufficiency of Dok2 and Dusp4 promotes lung tumorigenesis",2019,"Recurrent broad-scale heterozygous deletions are frequently observed in human cancer. Here we tested the hypothesis that compound haploinsufficiency of neighboring genes at chromosome 8p promotes tumorigenesis. By targeting the mouse orthologs of human DOK2 and DUSP4 genes, which were co-deleted in approximately half of human lung adenocarcinomas, we found that compound-heterozygous deletion of Dok2 and Dusp4 in mice resulted in lung tumorigenesis with short latency and high incidence, and that their co-deletion synergistically activated MAPK signaling and promoted cell proliferation. Conversely, restoration of DOK2 and DUSP4 in lung cancer cells suppressed MAPK activation and cell proliferation. Importantly, in contrast to downregulation of DOK2 or DUSP4 alone, concomitant downregulation of DOK2 and DUSP4 was associated with poor survival in human lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, our findings lend in vivo experimental support to the notion that compound haploinsufficiency, due to broad-scale chromosome deletions, constitutes a driving force in tumorigenesis. ? 2019 American Society for Clinical Investigation.

"SBP2 deficiency in adipose tissue macrophages drives insulin resistance in obesity",2019,"Proinflammatory activation and accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are associated with increased risk of insulin resistance in obesity. Here, we described the previously unidentified role of selenocysteine insertion sequence-binding protein 2 (SBP2) in maintaining insulin sensitivity in obesity. SBP2 was suppressed in ATMs of diet-induced obese mice and was correlated with adipose tissue inflammation. Loss of SBP2 initiated metabolic activation of ATMs, inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species content and inflammasome, which subsequently promoted IL-1-associated local proliferation and infiltration of proinflammatory macrophages. ATM-specific knockdown of SBP2 in obese mice promoted insulin resistance by increasing fat tissue inflammation and expansion. Reexpression of SBP2 improved insulin sensitivity. Last, an herbal formula that specifically induced SBP2 expression in ATMs can experimentally improve insulin sensitivity. Clinical observation revealed that it improved hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. This study identified SBP2 in ATMs as a potential target in rescuing insulin resistance in obesity.

"Development and validation of a parent-based program for preventing gaming disorder: The game over intervention",2019,"Since the inclusion of gaming disorder in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition for further study, there has been an increasing consensus that problematic gaming can be detrimental to mental health, yet efforts in preventing such problems from emerging have been limited. To address this gap, we developed the Game Over Intervention (GOI), a parent-based program designed based on the frameworks of ecological systems theory and self-determination theory. This study aimed to test the efficacy of the new program using the method of a randomized controlled trial, with the control condition being a program for effective learning. Participants were the parents of upper primary school students, with 163 (77% women; Mage = 42.70) and 199 (83% women; Mage = 41.82) partaking in the intervention and the control conditions, respectively. Participants rated their children’s gaming time, exposure to violent video games, and symptoms of gaming disorder at three time points: Baseline, one week after intervention, and three months after intervention. The results indicate a general reduction in these three criteria across the three-month period. Our study provides tentative evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the GOI in mitigating some gaming-related problems. ? 2019 by the author.

"Multidimensional vertebral endplate defects are associated with disc degeneration, modic changes, facet joint abnormalities, and pain",2019,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the multi-dimensional characteristics of lumbar endplate defects in humans in relation to disc degeneration and other MRI phenotypes as well as their role with pain and disability. A total of 108 subjects were recruited and underwent 3T MRI of the lumbar spine. Structural endplate defects were identified and their dimensions were measured in terms of maximum width and depth, and were then standardized to the actual width of the endplate and depth of the vertebral body, respectively. Both width and depth of all endplate defects in each subject were added separately and scores were assigned on the basis of size from 1 to 3. Combining both scores provided “cumulative endplate defect scores.” Disc degeneration scores, Modic changes, disc displacement, HIZ, and facet joint changes were assessed. Subject demographics, pain profile, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were also obtained. Endplate defects were observed in 67.5% of the subjects and in 13.5% of the endplates. All dimensions of endplate defects showed significance with disc degenerative scores, Modic changes, and posterior disc displacement (p < 0.05). Maximum width (p = 0.009) and its standardized value (p = 0.02), and cumulative endplate defect scores (p = 0.004) increased with narrow facet joints. Cumulative endplate defect scores showed a strong positive association with ODI (p < 0.05) compared to disc degenerative scores. Large size endplate defects were strongly associated with degenerative spine changes and more back-related disability. Findings from this study stress the need to assess endplate findings from a multi-dimensional perspective, whose role may have clinical utility. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

"Short-term and long-term exposures to fine particulate matter constituents and health: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Fine particulate matter (Particulate matter with diameter ? 2.5 μm) is associated with multiple health outcomes, with varying effects across seasons and locations. It remains largely unknown that which components of PM2.5 are most harmful to human health. Methods: We systematically searched all the relevent studies published before August 1, 2018, on the associations of fine particulate matter constituents with mortality and morbidity, using Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE. Studies were included if they explored the associations between short term or long term exposure of fine particulate matter constituents and natural, cardiovascular or respiratory health endpoints. The criteria for the risk of bias was adapted from OHAT and New Castle Ottawa. We applied a random-effects model to derive the risk estimates for each constituent. We performed main analyses restricted to studies which adjusted the PM2.5 mass in their models. Results: Significant associations were observed between several PM2.5 constituents and different health endpoints. Among them, black carbon and organic carbon were most robustly and consistently associated with all natural, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Other potential toxic constituents including nitrate, sulfate, Zinc, silicon, iron, nickel, vanadium, and potassium were associated with adverse cardiovascular health, while nitrate, sulfate and vanadium were relevant for adverse respiratory health outcomes. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that black carbon and organic carbon are important detrimental components of PM2.5, while other constituents are probably hazardous to human health. However, more studies are needed to further confirm our results. ? 2018","Air pollution; Diseases; Nitrates; Random processes; Sulfur compounds; Vanadium; Cardiovascular mortality; Fine particulate matter; Long term exposure; Morbidity; Mortality; Particulate Matter; PM2.5; Random effects model; Organic carbon; black carbon; iron; nickel; nitrate; organic carbon; potassium; silicon; sulfate; vanadium; zinc; nitric acid derivative; sulfate; vanadium; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; health impact; health risk; literature review; morbidity; mortality; organic carbon; particulate matter; pollution exposure; cardiovascular disease; environmental exposure; human; long term exposure; morbidity; mortality; particle size; particulate matter; respiratory tract disease; Review; systematic review; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental exposure; meta analysis; particulate matter; season; soot; statistics and numerical data; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Nitrates; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Soot; Sulfates; Vanadium"

Confounder-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models showed that both diagnosed diabetes category (yes or no) and diabetes status (diabetes, prediabetes, or no diabetes) were associated with all-cause mortality and with mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia, and kidney disease. No associations were found for cancer-, accidents-, or Alzheimer's disease-related mortality. Conclusion: The current study's findings provide epidemiological evidence that diagnosed diabetes at the baseline is associated with increased mortality risk due to cardiovascular disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia, and kidney disease, but not with cancer or Alzheimer's disease.

"More than anti-malarial agents: Therapeutic potential of artemisinins in neurodegeneration",2019,"Artemisinin, also called qinghaosu, is originally derived from the sweet wormwood plant (Artemisia annua), which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Artemisinin and its derivatives (artemisinins) have been widely used for many years as anti-malarial agents, with few adverse side effects. Interestingly, evidence has recently shown that artemisinins might have a therapeutic value for several other diseases beyond malaria, including cancers, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Neurodegeneration is a challenging age-associated neurological disorder characterized by deterioration of neuronal structures as well as functions, whereas neuroinflammation has been considered to be an underlying factor in the development of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Recently discovered properties of artemisinins suggested that they might be used to treat neurodegenerative disorders by decreasing oxidation, inflammation, and amyloid beta protein (Aβ). In this review, we will introduce artemisinins and highlight the possible mechanisms of their neuroprotective activities, suggesting that artemisinins might have therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders. ? 2019 Medknow.

"Test–retest reliability and validity of a single-item Self-reported Family Happiness Scale in Hong Kong Chinese: findings from Hong Kong Jockey Club FAMILY Project",2019,"Purpose: Family happiness is one major theme of family well-being in Chinese culture. We investigated the reliability and validity of the single-item Self-reported Family Happiness Scale (SFHS-1) with the score of 0–10, based on two studies in Hong Kong Chinese. Methods: Study 1 was a territory-wide population-based telephone survey (n = 4038) conducted in 2016. Study 2 was a community-based family intervention program conducted during 2012–2013 (n = 1261) to enhance family communication and well-being. Test–retest reliability of the SFHS-1 was assessed over 1?month in Study 2. Family APGAR (Adaption, Partnership, Growth, Affection, Resolve) Scale, Family Communication Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale, 12-item Short Form Health Survey Version 2, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire were used to assess the convergent and discriminant validities of the SFHS-1 in both studies. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the incremental validity by identifying the additional contribution of the SFHS-1 score in predicting subjective happiness. Results: The 1-month test–retest reliability assessed by intraclass correlation was 0.76. Family happiness was moderately to strongly correlated with family function, family communication, subjective happiness, mental health-related quality of life and depression, but weakly correlated with physical health-related quality of life. Furthermore, the score of the SFHS-1 added predictive power to mental health-related quality of life and depression in assessing subjective happiness. Conclusions: Our results have shown the SFHS-1 as a reliable and valid measurement of family happiness in Hong Kong Chinese, suggesting SFHS-1 is highly practicable for future large epidemiological and community-based intervention studies. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","adult; Article; Chinese; depression; discriminant validity; family therapy; female; happiness; health survey; Hong Kong; human; interpersonal communication; major clinical study; male; medical information; mental disease assessment; mental health; patient health questionnaire; population; priority journal; quality of life; Self Reported Family Happiness Scale; Short Form 12; telecommunication; telephone interview; test retest reliability; validity; adolescent; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; middle aged; procedures; psychology; reproducibility; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Happiness; Health Surveys; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult"
"Combined Atropine with Orthokeratology for Myopia Control: Study Design and Preliminary Results",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to present the study design and one month’s preliminary results of a 2-year randomized trial, Combined Atropine with Orthokeratology (AOK), for myopia control study. Methods: Children aged 6 to <11?years and with 1.00–4.00?D myopia were randomly assigned to AOK group or ortho-k alone (OK) group. Subjects are required to attend routine ortho-k aftercare visits (first-overnight, 1?week, 2?weeks, 3?weeks, 1?month, and every 3?months after commencement of lens wear). Clinical outcomes, including lens performance, changes in refractive error, unaided vision, ocular adverse events, corneal staining, lens binding and centration, and axial length, are also assessed at 6-monthly data collection visit. Results: Data of 30 AOK and 34 OK subjects who had completed the 1-month visit were analyzed. No significant differences in baseline data were found between the two groups (P >?0.05). At the 1-month visit, first-fit success rate was 95%, with full myopia reduction. Mild corneal staining was observed in 23.3% and 30.9% and mild self-reported lens binding in 50% and 41% in AOK and OK groups, respectively, after 1-month lens wear. Mean (±standard deviation) change in axial length was significantly higher in AOK than OK subjects (AOK: ?0.05?±?0.05 mm; OK: ?0.02?±?0.03 mm) (P =?0.003). Conclusions: After 1?month of treatment, first-fit success rate of ortho-k lenses was high in both groups of subjects; addition of 0.01% atropine in AOK subjects did not affect the lens performance or clinical responses. These results provide the assurance that it is acceptable to continue this longitudinal study, as longer study duration, usually 2?years, is required to determine the effectiveness of treatment for myopia control. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","antibiotic agent; atropine; aftercare; allergic conjunctivitis; Article; astigmatism; bacterial conjunctivitis; best corrected visual acuity; blurred vision; child; clinical outcome; controlled study; cornea; cornea injury; disease control; eye axis length; eye refraction; female; follow up; human; information processing; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; medical device complication; monotherapy; myopia; preliminary data; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; school child; skin allergy; staining; study design; treatment duration; vision; visual acuity"
"Global comparison of cancer outcomes: Standardization and correlation with healthcare expenditures",2019,"Background: Cancer outcomes vary widely among different countries. However, comparisons of cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency of different systems are complex because the incidences of different cancers vary across countries and their chances of cure also differ substantially. We aim to propose a new standardized method for global comparison and to explore its relationship with economic indicators. Methods: Cancer statistics from all 184 countries and 27 cancers listed in GLOBOCAN 2012 were analyzed. The complement of age-standardized mortality/incidence ratio [1 - (ASM/ASI)] was taken as the proxy relative survival (RS). Accounting for various country-specific cancer patterns, the cancer site-standardized proxy RS (proxy SS-RS) of individual countries were calculated by weighting the proportion of specific cancer sites as compared with the global pattern of incidence. Economic indicators of different countries listed by the World Bank were correlated with corresponding proxy SS-RS. Results: Substantial variation in site-specific survival and new case distribution supported the use of proxy SS-RS, which ranged from 0.124 to 0.622 (median 0.359). The median total health expenditure per capita (HEpc) increased from US$44 for countries with proxy SS-RS < 0.25, to US$4643 for countries with proxy SS-RS =0.55. Results from logarithmic regression model showed exponential increase in total HEpc for better outcome. The expenditure varied widely among different strata, with the widest difference observed among countries with SS-RS =0.55 (total HEpc US$1412-$9361). Conclusions: Similar to age-standardization, cancer site-standardization adjusted for variation in pattern of cancer incidence provides the best available and feasible strategies for comparing cancer survivals across countries globally. Furthermore, cancer outcome correlated significantly with economic indicators and the amount of HEpc escalated exponentially. Our findings call for more in-depth studies applying cancer-site standardization to provide essential data for sharing of experience and urgent actions by policy makers to develop comprehensive and financially sustainable cancer plan for greater equity. ? 2019 BioMed Central Ltd..

"Self-collected compared with professional-collected swabbing in the diagnosis of influenza in symptomatic individuals: A meta-analysis and assessment of validity",2019,"Self-collected nasal swabs offer a cheaper alternative to professional-collected swabs for influenza testing. However, the diagnostic accuracy of self-collection has not been quantitatively reviewed. We identified 14 studies that compared diagnostic accuracy of self-collected to professional-collected swabs in influenza symptomatic individuals. Self-collected swabs were found to be highly acceptable, simple and comfortable to use. Data from nine studies were meta-analyzed. Pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI: 80%, 92%) and specificity was 99% (95% CI: 98%, 100%), compared to professional-collected swabs in the diagnosis of influenza. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were used to assess the potential bias that would be introduced in studies had self-collected rather than professional-collected samples been used. While self-collected swabbing should not replace the role of clinical testing, our findings support the use of self-collected swabs for influenza research and surveillance. This method will be an important tool for evaluating novel influenza vaccines and vaccination strategies. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","influenza vaccine; comparative study; diagnostic accuracy; drug efficacy; health care personnel; human; influenza; influenza vaccination; Influenza virus; meta analysis; nonhuman; nose smear; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; Review; self concept; sensitivity and specificity; symptom; systematic review; virus load"

"Beyond the Resource Drain Theory: Salary satisfaction as a mediator between commuting time and subjective well-being",2019,"Introduction: Understanding the mechanism between commuting time and subjective well-being is of great importance in formulating policies. In previous research, the negative impact of long commuting time on subjective well-being was mainly explained by the Resource Drain Theory which claims that the main reason for the impact was inadequate health-related and social activities in the commuters’ life. However, this theory neglects the mediating roles of salary and residence satisfaction proposed by the Ecological Framework of Commuting Stress. According to this framework, commuting stress generated by prolonged commuting time may cause low satisfaction towards salary and residence and hence low life satisfaction. Using health, social support, satisfaction with salary, and satisfaction with residence in a mediation framework, this study aims to integrate the Resource Drain Theory and the Ecological Framework of Commuting Stress by analysing the direct and indirect effects of commuting time on subjective well-being. Methods: We used data on 813 commuters from the first wave of the Hong Kong Panel Survey for Poverty Alleviation. Health was operationalised in terms of physical health (obesity measured by BMIs), psychological health (mental distress measured by the Chinese Health Questionnaire-12) and general health (measured by self-rated health). Social support is measured by using the Oslo 3-item Social Support Scale (“OSS-3”). Subjective well-being is measured by the satisfaction with life scale (SWLS-5). A bootstrapping-based multiple mediation analysis is used in this study. Results: Significant direct and indirect effects on subjective well-being with indirect effects resulted in 23.1% of the effect of commuting time on well-being. It is also discovered that salary satisfaction is the only significant mediator of the association between commuting time and subjective well-being. Conclusion: Policymakers need to consider not only the direct effects but also the indirect effects between commuting time and subjective well-being. The negative impact of commuting time on subjective well-being may be alleviated by improving the commuter's salary satisfaction. ? 2019",""
"Using smartphone-based psychoeducation to reduce postnatal depression among first-time mothers: Randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Smartphone-based psychoeducation interventions may be a low-cost, user-friendly alternative to resource-consuming, face-to-face antenatal classes to educate expectant mothers. Objective: This study aimed to empirically examine whether such an intervention would lead to reduced postnatal depression, anxiety, or stress and result in a better health-related quality of life. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hong Kong. All first-time expectant mothers with less than 24 weeks of gestation remaining and attending the antenatal clinic at a public hospital were included. Participants were assigned to the intervention group or the control group by drawing lots. The lots, presented in sealed opaque envelopes, were randomly designated as “intervention” or “control” by stratified randomization. The intervention, a psychoeducational mobile app, was provided in addition to the treatment as usual (TAU) services from the hospital. Follow up with participants took place at 4 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was the difference in the levels of antenatal and postnatal depression, assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The intention-to-treat approach was employed in the analyses. Results: The final sample was 660 expectant mothers (nintervention=330 and ncontrol=330). The mean difference in EPDS scores between the two groups was ?0.65 (95% CI ?1.29 to 0.00; P=.049) after adjusting for confounding factors. Associations were found between participation in the intervention and reduced depression, and attendance in TAU classes and increased stress levels. Conclusions: The smartphone-based intervention plus TAU services was effective in reducing postnatal depression at 4 weeks postpartum compared with a control condition of TAU only, making this a cost-effective alternative to TAU education for expectant mothers. Limitations of the study included the short postpartum period after which the follow-up assessment was conducted and the inclusion of first-time mothers rather than all mothers. ?

"Prevalence of early childhood caries among 5-year-old children: A systematic review",2019,"The aim of the present review was to describe the updated prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC) among 5-year-old children globally. Two independent reviewers performed a systematic literature search to identify English publications from January 2013 to December 2017 using MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus. Search MeSH key words were ""dental caries"" and ""child, preschool"". The inclusion criteria were epidemiological surveys reporting the caries status of 5-year-old children with the decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (dmft) index. The quality of the publications was evaluated with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Among the 2410 identified publications, 37 articles of moderate or good quality were included. Twenty of the included studies were conducted in Asia (China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Nepal, and Thailand), seven in Europe (Greece, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy), six in South America (Brazil), two in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and Turkey), one in Oceania (Australia), and one in Africa (Sudan). The prevalence of ECC ranged from 23% to 90%, and most of them (26/37) were higher than 50%. The mean dmft score varied from 0.9 to 7.5. Based on the included studies published in the recent 5?years, there is a wide variation of ECC prevalence across countries, and ECC remains prevalent in most countries worldwide. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","Africa; Asia; deciduous tooth; dental caries; dental restoration; DMF index; Europe; factual database; health; human; Middle East; Pacific islands; preschool child; prevalence; questionnaire; South America; statistics and numerical data; Africa; Asia; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Dental Caries; Dental Restoration, Permanent; DMF Index; Europe; Humans; Middle East; Oceania; Oral Health; Prevalence; South America; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tooth, Deciduous"
"Collaboration with Status Asymmetry: Evidence from HIV/AIDS Disease Control in China",2019,"ABSTRACT: Studies on organization and management theory use status to explain intra-organizational behaviors such as developing alliances and partnerships by drawing on the practices of the private sector. We extend the concept of status to the public sector to study how the different status of partners influences their collaboration. Through studying collaboration in the field of HIV/AIDS disease control in China from 2015 to 2017, we assess how status asymmetry (different-status partners) affects collaboration by comparing several dimensions of different-status organizations, including their structure, funding distribution, target population, and service category. We find that, through structure design, a collaboration between high- and low-status organizations improves health service delivery in the epidemic disease control process by providing more integrated health schemes. This article contributes to the body of knowledge on collaboration by studying the dynamic role of status, thereby helping practitioners better understand how to effectively manage collaboration with status asymmetry. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",""

"Effect of glutamate and aspartate on ischemic heart disease, blood pressure, and diabetes: A Mendelian randomization study",2019,"Background: Evolutionary biology suggests reproduction trades off against longevity. Genetic selection in favor of fertility and ischemic heart disease (IHD) exists in humans. Observationally, soy protects against IHD. Soy amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, may lower androgens. No large randomized controlled trials testing their health effects exist. Objective: Using Mendelian randomization, we assessed how genetically predicted glutamate and aspartate affected IHD, blood pressure, and diabetes. Methods: A separate sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments was used to obtain unconfounded estimates using genetic variants strongly (P < 5 × 10-8) and solely associated with glutamate or aspartate applied to an IHD case (n =76,014)-control (n = 264,785) study (based on a meta-analysis of CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes, UK Biobank CAD SOFT GWAS and Myocardial Infarction Genetics and CARDIoGRAM Exome), blood pressure from the UK Biobank (n = 361,194), and the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis diabetes case (n = 26,676)-control (n = 132,532) study. A weighted median and MR-Egger were used for a sensitivity analysis. Results: Glutamate was not associated with IHD, blood pressure, or diabetes after correction for multiple comparisons. Aspartate was inversely associated with IHD (odds ratio (OR) 0.92 per logtransformed standard deviation (SD); 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88, 0.96) and diastolic blood pressure (-0.03; 95% CI-0.04,-0.02) using inverse variance weighting, but not diabetes (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.91, 1.09). Associations were robust to the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest aspartate may play a role in IHD and blood pressure, potentially underlying cardiovascular benefits of soy.

"Progesterone Is More Effective Than Dexamethasone in Prolonging Overall Survival and Preserving Neurologic Function in Experimental Animals with Orthotopic Glioblastoma Allografts",2019,"Objective: Dexamethasone (DEXA) has been widely used in the management of peritumoral brain edema. DEXA, however, has many systemic side effects and can interact negatively with glioma therapy. Progesterone (PROG), however, is a well-tolerated and readily accessible anti-inflammatory and antiedema agent, with potent neuroprotective properties. We investigated whether PROG could serve as a viable alternative to DEXA in the management of peritumoral brain edema. Methods: We used an orthotopic C6 glioblastoma model with male Sprague-Dawley rats. Tumor grafts were allowed to grow for 14 days before drug treatment with DEXA 1 mg/kg, PROG 10 mg/kg, or PROG 20 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days. The overall animal survival and neurologic function were evaluated. Mechanistic studies on blood–brain barrier permeability and angiogenic responses were performed on the ex vivo tumor grafts. Results: We found that all drug treatments prolonged overall survival to different extents. PROG 10 mg led to significantly longer survival and better preservation of neurologic function and body weight. The blood–brain barrier permeability was better preserved with PROG 10 mg than with DEXA, possibly through downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and aquaporin-4 expression. Antiangiogenic responses were also observed in the PROG group. Conclusions: The present proof-of-concept pilot study has provided novel information on the use of PROG as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in brain tumor management. Further translational and clinical studies are warranted. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","aquaporin 4; dexamethasone; gelatinase B; progesterone; antiinflammatory agent; dexamethasone; neuroprotective agent; progesterone; allograft; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiangiogenic activity; Article; blood brain barrier; body weight; brain function; cancer graft; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; ex vivo study; glioblastoma; male; neurologic function; nonhuman; overall survival; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; animal; brain edema; brain tumor; disease model; drug effect; glioblastoma; human; mortality; pathology; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Edema; Brain Neoplasms; Dexamethasone; Disease Models, Animal; Glioblastoma; Humans; Male; Neuroprotective Agents; Progesterone; Rats, Sprague-Dawley"
"The impact of congenital heart disease on the psychological well-being and quality of life of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Aims and objectives: To examine the psychological well-being and quality of life of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents with congenital heart disease. Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) in adolescents is associated with having negative psychological impact and impairment to quality of life. A literature review revealed that most studies on the impact of CHD on the psychological well-being and quality of life of adolescents to date have been conducted in Western populations. Method: A cross-sectional design was employed. Adolescents aged 12–18 with CHD attending an outpatient clinic in an acute public hospital were invited to participate. Another similar age group of healthy Chinese adolescents was also invited to participate for comparison purposes. Subjects were asked to respond to the Chinese version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and a demographic sheet. A STROBE checklist was completed. Results: Adolescents with CHD exhibited more depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem and poorer quality of life than their healthy counterparts. Disease severity might affect the self-esteem, depressive symptoms and quality of life of adolescents with CHD. Disease severity, depressive symptoms, self-esteem level and types of treatment received were associated with the quality of life of adolescents with CHD. Conclusions: Hong Kong Chinese adolescents suffering from CHD experience negative impacts on their psychological well-being and quality of life. In this group, disease severity may affect psychological well-being and quality of life. Specifically, quality of life of adolescents with CHD was associated with disease severity, depressive symptoms, self-esteem level and the type of treatment received. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings contribute to clinical care guidelines and serve as a reference in developing nursing intervention to adolescents with CHD so as to uphold quality of care.

"Eyes closed elevates brain intrinsic activity of sensory dominance networks: A classifier discrimination analysis",2019,"Brain neocortex is usually dominated by visual input (with eyes open [EO]), whereas this visual predominance could be reduced by closing eyes. Cutting off visual input from the eyes (with eyes closed [EC]) would also benefit other sensory performance; however, the neural basis underlying the state-switching remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the brain intrinsic activity of either the EO or EC states by using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 22 healthy participants. The 10 resting-state networks (RSNs) of these participants were explored by the independent component analysis method. Within each RSN, various network parameters (i.e., the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, the voxel-wise weighted degree centrality, and the RSN-wise functional connectivity) were measured to depict the brain intrinsic activity properties underlying the EO and EC states. Taking these brain intrinsic activity properties as discriminative features in a linear classifier, we found that the EO and EC states could be effectively classified using the intrinsic properties of the sensory dominance networks and the salience network (SN). Further analysis showed that the brain intrinsic activity within the sensory dominance networks was constantly overwhelmed during the EC state relative to that in the EO state. The SN might play a key role as a switcher between state-switching. Therefore, this study indicated that the brain intrinsic activity in the sensory dominance networks would be enhanced with EC, which might improve other sensory-relative task performance. ? 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","adult; article; classifier; clinical article; controlled study; eye dominance; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; independent component analysis; intrinsic activity; male; salience network; task performance; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; discriminant analysis; eye; image processing; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; rest; vision; visual system function; young adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Discriminant Analysis; Eye; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Ocular Physiological Phenomena; Rest; Vision, Ocular; Visual Perception; Young Adult"
"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for cervical myelopathy using stand-alone tricortical iliac crest autograft: Predictive factors for neurological and fusion outcomes",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this article is to investigate the outcomes after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery with stand-alone tricortical iliac crest autograft and to determine predictive factors for poor neurological recovery, non-union, graft collapse and loss of C2–C7 sagittal alignment. Methods: This was a retrospective study involving patients with cervical myelopathy who underwent ACDF surgery with stand-alone tricortical iliac autograft between 2006 and 2016, with a minimum 2-year postoperative follow-up. Outcomes included the change in Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores clinically and timing of fusion, graft height and C2–7 angle measured on lateral radiographs. Any complication such as neurological deterioration, non-union, graft collapse or loss of angle was recorded. Delayed union was considered as radiological union identified only beyond postoperative 6 months. Risk factors including age, smoking, drinking, comorbidities and operative levels were analysed through a multivariate regression for their respective influences on the various outcomes. Results: Of the 69 patients studied, none of the patients had non-union, while 33 (47.1%) achieved fusion in 6 months. The most common complications were anterior protrusion of graft (5.8%) and hoarseness (2.9%). The 1-year mean change in JOA score was 3.9 ± 2.7. The C2–7 angle gradually became more kyphotic, despite an initial lordosis correction intraoperatively. The graft height also gradually collapsed during subsequent follow-ups. Multivariate regression model suggested that diabetics (cumulative odds ratio 7.4) and drinkers (cumulative odds ratio 8.6) were associated with delayed union. Conclusion: ACDF using tricortical iliac crest autograft has satisfactory outcomes with low occurrence of complications. Diabetics and drinkers were predictors of delayed union. ?

"Valence-related impairments in the retrieval of specific autobiographical memories amongst patients with schizophrenia",2019,"Objectives: People with schizophrenia have difficulty recalling specific autobiographical events from their past. However, the nature of this difficulty (e.g., whether these problems are only for memories that are negative or positive) and the mechanisms associated with it remain poorly understood. Methods: The present investigation asked patients with schizophrenia (n?=?91) and healthy controls (n?=?109) to recall memories related to several positive and negative cue words. Participants also completed self-report measures of rumination and depressive symptoms and a measure of verbal fluency to assess executive functioning. Participants' memories were coded for specificity (whether or not they referred to a specific event lasting <24?hr) and valence (positive vs. negative). Results: Patients recalled fewer specific memories than controls and they showed particular difficulty recalling specific negative memories cued by negative words. For healthy controls, impoverished verbal fluency was associated with recall of fewer specific memories and particularly recall of fewer positive specific memories. These variables were unrelated to specificity amongst patients. Rumination was not associated with specificity in either group. Conclusions: These findings are discussed with reference to other mechanisms that might contribute towards reduced specificity in schizophrenia, such as the tendency to avoid negative affect, and the implications of this for interventions for schizophrenia and memory specificity problems. Practitioner points: The experience of schizophrenia is associated with problems recalling specific events from one's past. In particular, patients have difficulty recalling specific negative memories from their past. These memory problems are independent of executive functioning difficulties, ruminative tendencies, and also depression symptoms. Interventions for memory problems in schizophrenia must target the difficulty people have in recalling specific negative events. ? 2018 The British Psychological Society","adult; complication; episodic memory; executive function; female; human; male; pathology; schizophrenia; self report; Adult; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Episodic; Schizophrenia; Self Report"
"Impact of Head and Neck Cancer Treatment on Survivors' Mealtime Experience",2019,"Objectives/Hypothesis: The objectives of the study were to develop a mealtime experience self-assessment questionnaire that was head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors–driven and based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, and to identify common mealtime issues reported by HNC survivors. Study Design: Outcomes research. Methods: Mealtime issues reported by HNC survivors in prior research was synthesized and classified using the ICF framework to develop the content and structure of the Head and Neck Cancer Survivors' Assessment of Mealtimes (HNSAM). A total of 122 HNC survivors completed both HNSAM and M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) to assess for concurrent validity, whereas 51% of participants completed a second HNSAM for test–retest reliability. Results: The HNSAM scores were significantly correlated with the MDADI scores. Dysphagic participants (n = 45) had significantly higher HNSAM scores than the nondysphagic participants (n = 77). Principal component analysis revealed three factors that matched with the HNSAM subscales. Good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.72–0.96) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation = 0.76–0.91) were found. Both dysphagic and nondysphagic participants reported difficulties with saliva-related issues and were not able to enjoy food/drinks that they previously enjoyed. Conclusions: HNC survivors experience mealtime changes after cancer treatment. These initial validity data support the potential for the HNSAM to help HNC survivors' identify changes to the mealtime experience. Validation of the English version of the tool is now required.

"An Antitumor Bis(N-Heterocyclic Carbene)Platinum(II) Complex That Engages Asparagine Synthetase as an Anticancer Target",2019,"New anticancer platinum(II) compounds with distinctive modes of action are appealing alternatives to combat the drug resistance and improve the efficacy of clinically used platinum chemotherapy. Herein, we describe a rare example of an antitumor PtII complex targeting a tumor-associated protein, rather than DNA, under cellular conditions. Complex [(bis-NHC)Pt(bt)]PF6 (1 a; Hbt=1-(3-hydroxybenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)ethanone) overcomes cisplatin resistance in cancer cells and displays significant tumor growth inhibition in mice with higher tolerable doses compared to cisplatin. The cellular Pt species shows little association with DNA, and localizes in the cytoplasm as revealed by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry. An unbiased thermal proteome profiling experiment identified asparagine synthetase (ASNS) as a molecular target of 1 a. Accordingly, 1 a treatment reduced the cellular asparagine levels and inhibited cancer cell proliferation, which could be reversed by asparagine supplementation. A bis-NHC-ligated Pt species generated from the hydrolysis of 1 a forms adducts with thiols and appears to target an active-site cysteine of ASNS. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Intensive insulin therapy versus plasmapheresis in the management of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (Bi-TPAI trial): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: It is widely agreed that triglyceride (TG)-lowering therapy is imperative in early hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP). Intravenous insulin with or without heparin, and plasmapheresis are available regimens. However, there is no consensus on first-line therapy. Methods/design: The Bi-TPAI trial is a multicenter, parallel group, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial in patients with early HTG-AP. The Bi-TPAI trial will include 220 patients with HTG-AP from 17 large tertiary hospitals in China. Patients assigned to the intensive insulin group will be administered an intravenous continuous infusion of regular human insulin at a rate of 0.1 units/kg·h and up to 0.3 units/kg·h. Patients allocated to the plasmapheresis group will receive standard-volume plasmapheresis. The primary endpoint is the time it takes for the TG level to reduce to 500 mg/dl. The secondary endpoints are ICU and hospital lengths of stay, 28-day mortality, severity of HTG-AP, incidence of hypoglycemia, HTG-AP complications, and cost-effectiveness. Discussion: The Bi-TPAI trial will prove that intensive insulin therapy is non-inferior to plasmapheresis. Intensive insulin therapy should be an effective, safe, available, and cheaper triglyceride-lowering therapy for hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis.

"A Luminescence Turn-On Assay for Acetylcholinesterase Activity and Inhibitor Screening Based on Supramolecular Self-Assembly of Alkynylplatinum(II) Complexes on Coordination Polymer",2019,"A new approach toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) detection has been demonstrated based on the electrostatic interactions between anionic alkynylplatinum(II) complex molecules and cationic coordination polymer, together with the spectroscopic and emission characteristics of alkynylplatinum(II) complexes upon supramolecular self-assembly. This process involves strengthening of distinct noncovalent Pt(II)?Pt(II) and π- π stacking interactions, which is evidenced by UV-vis absorption, emission, and resonance light scattering results. Such a method has been applied to AChE inhibitor screening, which is important as the demand for AChE inhibitor assays arises along with the drug development for Alzheimer's disease. It affords an emission turn-on response and operates in a continuous and label-free fashion. The low-energy red emission and large Stokes shift of alkynylplatinum(II) complexes are advantageous to biological applications. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Agglomeration; Biosensors; Coordination reactions; Diagnosis; Light scattering; Neurodegenerative diseases; Platinum; Self assembly; Supramolecular chemistry; Acetylcholinesterase; Acetylcholinesterase activity; Biological applications; Coordination Polymers; Emission characteristics; Inhibitor screenings; Resonance light scattering; Supramolecular self-assemblies; Platinum compounds; acetylcholinesterase; cholinesterase inhibitor; platinum complex; polymer; animal; chemistry; drug development; genetic procedures; human; luminescence; metabolism; procedures; Acetylcholinesterase; Animals; Biosensing Techniques; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Drug Discovery; Humans; Luminescent Measurements; Organoplatinum Compounds; Polymers"
"Exercise Mode Specificity for Preserving Spine and Hip Bone Mineral Density in Prostate Cancer Patients",2019,"Purpose Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer (PCA) is associated with an array of adverse effects, including reduced bone mineral density (BMD) predisposing patients to increased fracture risk. Our purpose was to examine the effects of targeted exercise modes on BMD in men with PCA undergoing ADT. Methods Between 2009 and 2012, 154 PCA patients 43-90 yr old on ADT were randomized to exercise targeting the musculoskeletal system (impact loading + resistance training [ImpRes], n = 57) supervised for 12 months, cardiovascular and muscular systems (aerobic + resistance training, n = 50) supervised for 6 months followed by a 6-month home-based program, or delayed aerobic exercise (DelAer, n = 47) received exercise information for 6 months followed by 6 months of supervised aerobic exercise (stationary cycling). End points were lumbar spine, hip and whole-body BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with secondary end points of lean and fat mass, appendicular skeletal muscle mass, and neuromuscular strength. ANOVA was used to compare the exercise groups with DelAer at 6 and 12 months. Results There was a between-group difference in BMD for ImpRes and DelAer at the spine (6 months, P = 0.039; 12 months, P = 0.035) and femoral neck (6 months, P = 0.050), with decline attenuated in ImpRes (-1.0% vs -2.0%). Compared with DelAer, ImpRes increased appendicular skeletal muscle at 6 months (0.3 kg, P = 0.045) and improved muscle strength at 6 and 12 months (P ? 0.012) by 9%-34%. A limitation was inclusion of well-functioning patients. Conclusion Combined impact loading and resistance exercise attenuates bone loss at the spine and enhances overall musculoskeletal function in PCA patients undergoing ADT. ? 2018 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","antiandrogen; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; anatomy and histology; body mass; bone density; clinical trial; controlled study; drug effect; hip; human; kinesiotherapy; male; muscle strength; phase 3 clinical trial; physiology; procedures; prostate tumor; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; skeletal muscle; spine; Androgen Antagonists; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Body Mass Index; Bone Density; Exercise Therapy; Hip; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Prostatic Neoplasms; Resistance Training; Spine"
"The impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Conflicting results regarding the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may cause confusion regarding the benefits of receiving the current season's vaccine. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from database inception to August 17, 2016, for observational studies published in English that reported VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the following four vaccination groups: current season only, prior season only, both seasons, and neither season. We pooled differences in VE (δVE) between vaccination groups by influenza season and type/subtype using a random-effects model. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016037241). Results: We identified 3435 unique articles, reviewed the full text of 634, and included 20 for meta-analysis. Compared to prior season vaccination only, vaccination in both seasons was associated with greater protection against influenza H1N1 (δVE = 25%; 95% CI 14%, 35%) and B (δVE = 18%; 95% CI 3%, 33%), but not H3N2 (δVE = 7%; 95% CI - 7%, 21%). Compared to no vaccination for either season, individuals who received the current season's vaccine had greater protection against H1N1 (δVE = 62%; 95% CI 51%, 70%), H3N2 (δVE = 45%; 95% CI 35%, 53%), and B (δVE = 64%; 95% CI 57%, 71%). We observed no differences in VE between vaccination in both seasons and the current season only for H1N1 (δVE = 3%; 95% CI - 8%, 13%), but less protection against influenza H3N2 (δVE = - 20%; 95% CI - 36%, - 4%), and B (δVE = - 11%; 95% CI - 20%, - 2%). Conclusions: Our results support current season vaccination regardless of prior season vaccination because VE for vaccination in the current season only is higher compared to no vaccination in either season for all types/subtypes, and for H1N1 and influenza B, vaccination in both seasons provides better VE than vaccination in the prior season only. Although VE was lower against H3N2 and B for individuals vaccinated in both seasons compared to those vaccinated in the current season only, it should be noted that past vaccination history cannot be altered and this comparison disregards susceptibility to influenza during the prior season among those vaccinated in the current season only. In addition, our results for H3N2 were particularly influenced by the 2014-2015 influenza season and the impact of repeated vaccination for all types/subtypes may vary from season to season. It is important that future VE studies include vaccination history over multiple seasons to evaluate repeated vaccination in more detail. ? 2019 The Author(s).","influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; drug efficacy; human; infection prevention; influenza A (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); influenza vaccination; meta analysis; Review; season; systematic review; vaccination; female; influenza; male; observational study; Female; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Male; Observational Studies as Topic"
"Institutional logics of processing safety in production: The case of heat stress management in a megaproject in Australia",2019,"Despite evidence that a safe and healthy workforce is essential to construction project productivity, the resources and time committed to safety are often perceived as counterproductive. This study explores the multiple institutional logics underpinning the duality between safety and productivity in the construction industry. Specifically, it explores the tensions between safety and production through an institutional lens by untangling the institutional logics of processing safety in production. A theory of protection, production and reconciling logics is developed and refined through an in-depth case study of heat stress management in a mega-project in Australia. Ethnographic data were collected over a six-day working week on site, interpreted using institutional analysis and conceptualized with a grounded theory approach. The results confirmed the co-existence of the three logics in the power dynamics between employers, unions, regulators and workers. It is found that the production and the protection logic leads to paradoxical effect of their desired goals, and a reconciling logic emerges in the bottom-up initiatives which aims for community building and leads to improvement in both safety and productivity. However, the reconciling logic was found incomplete and handicapped due to the lack of involvement at senior management level and the production side of the project organization. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accident prevention; Construction industry; Human resource management; Productivity; Thermal stress; Construction safety; Heat stress; Institutional analysis; Productivity analysis; Protection logic; Reconciling logic; Computer circuits; article; Australia; building industry; disabled person; employer; grounded theory; heat stress; human; logic; multicenter study; productivity; tension; theoretical study; worker; working time"
"Glycodelin-A stimulates the conversion of human peripheral blood CD16-CD56 bright NK cell to a decidual NK cell-like phenotype",2019,"STUDY QUESTION Does glycodelin-A (GdA) induce conversion of human peripheral blood CD16-CD56 bright natural killer (NK) cells to decidual NK (dNK) cells to facilitate placentation? SUMMARY ANSWER GdA binds to blood CD16-CD56 bright NK cells via its sialylated glycans and converts them to a dNK-like cells, which in turn regulate endothelial cell angiogenesis and trophoblast invasion via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) secretion, respectively. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY dNK cells are the most abundant leucocyte population in the decidua. These cells express CD16-CD56 bright phenotype. Peripheral blood CD16-CD56 bright NK cells and hematopoietic precursors have been suggested to be capable of differentiating towards dNK cells upon exposure to the decidual microenvironment. These cells regulate trophoblast invasion during spiral arteries remodelling and mediate homoeostasis and functions of the endothelial cells. GdA is an abundant glycoprotein in the human decidua with peak expression between the 6th and 12th week of gestation, suggesting a role in early pregnancy. Indeed, GdA interacts with and modulates functions and differentiation of trophoblast and immune cells in the human feto-maternal interface. Aberrant GdA expression during pregnancy is associated with unexplained infertility, pregnancy loss and pre-eclampsia. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION CD16 + CD56 dim, CD16-CD56 bright and dNK cells were isolated from human peripheral blood and decidua tissue, respectively, by immuno-magnetic beads or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Human extravillous trophoblasts were isolated from first trimester placental tissue after termination of pregnancy. Biological activities of the cells were studied after treatment with GdA at a physiological dose of 5 μg/mL. GdA was purified from human amniotic fluid by immuno-affinity chromatography. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Expression of VEGF, CD9, CD49a, CD151 and CD158a in the cells were determined by flow cytometry. Angiogenic proteins in the spent media of NK cells were determined by cytokine array and ELISA. Blocking antibodies were used to study the functions of the identified angiogenic proteins. Endothelial cell angiogenesis was determined by tube formation and trans-well migration assays. Cell invasion and migration were determined by trans-well invasion/migration assay. Binding of normal and de-sialylated GdA, and expression of L-selectin and siglec-7 on the NK cells were analysed by flow cytometry. The association between GdA and L-selectin on NK cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) activation was determined by Western blotting and functional assays. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE GdA treatment enhanced the expression of dNK cell markers CD9 and CD49a and the production of the functional dNK secretory product VEGF in the peripheral blood CD16-CD56 bright NK cells. The spent media of GdA-treated CD16-CD56 bright NK cells promoted tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and invasiveness of trophoblasts. These stimulatory effects were mediated by the stimulatory activities of GdA on an ERK-activation dependent production of VEGF and IGFBP-1 by the NK cells. GdA had a stronger binding affinity to the CD16-CD56 bright NK cells as compared to the CD16 + CD56 dim NK cells. This GdA-NK cell interaction was reduced by de-sialylation. GdA interacted with L-selectin, expressed only in the CD16-CD56 bright NK cells, but not in the CD16 + CD56 dim NK cells. Anti-L-selectin functional blocking antibody suppressed the binding and biological activities of GdA on the NK cells. LARGE SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Some of the above findings are based on a small sample size of peripheral blood CD16-CD56 bright NK cells. These results need to be confirmed with human primary dNK cells. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This is the first study on the biological role of GdA on conversion of CD16-CD56 bright NK cells to dNK-like cells. Further investigation on the glycosylation and functions of GdA will enhance our understanding on human placentation and placenta-associated complications with altered NK cell biology.

"Clinical significance and biological role of cancer-derived Type I collagen in lung and esophageal cancers",2019,"Background: Extracellular matrix (ECM) is remodeled during carcinogenesis. An abundant constituent of ECM is collagen. Type I collagen is secreted by fibroblasts, is important for tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and may also be secreted by cancer cells. However, the role and function of cancer-derived Type I collagen in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Methods: We used immunohistochemistry and Western blot to detect Type I collagen expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines, respectively. We assessed the migration and adhesion capability of these cells in vivo by inhibiting Type I collagen in tumors. Relevant data were extracted from a large cohort study of The Cancer Genome Atlas to analyze messenger RNA levels. Protein expression of Type I collagen was further determined in tumor tissues of patients using tissue microarray. Results: Cancer cell lines secreted Type I collagen. The molecular weight of cancer-derived Type I collagen was different from that secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts. Expression levels of COL1A1 and COL1A2 (subtypes of Type I collagen) messenger RNA in NSCLC and ESCC tumors were higher than in normal tissues, but were not associated with tumor node metastasis stages. Low expression of Type I collagen was significantly associated with poor overall survival and cancer cell differentiation. Conclusion: NSCLC and ESCC cells could produce Type I collagen endogenously, revealing the potential functions of Type I collagen in cancer development. Cancer-derived Type I collagen was associated with overall survival and cancer cell differentiation. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Study protocol for a peer-led web-based intervention to promote safe usage of dating applications among young adults: A cluster randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Dating applications are a popular platform to meet new people. At the same time, they have been associated with risks such as unsafe sexual behavior and privacy concerns in young adults. This paper presents a study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-led web-based intervention to promote its safe usage in young adults. Methods: The study design is an open-labeled cluster RCT with an intervention and a placebo control arm. The intervention group will receive a web-based intervention developed through focus group discussions, a crowdsourcing contest, and a Peer-Vetted Creative Production (PVCP) workshop. The control group will receive a web-based resource on health and exercise. We aim to recruit approximately 338 young adults aged 17-27 years from three tertiary educational institutions in Hong Kong with the class as the cluster unit. Based on the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) model, the primary outcome of this study is self-efficacy in using dating applications measured by the General Self Efficacy Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in risk perception measured by the Risk Propensity Scale and a Risk Assessment Tool. Questionnaires will be administered before the intervention, after the intervention, and at one-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis and multilevel regression modeling will be used to evaluate differences in outcomes between groups and the factors affecting these outcomes, respectively. Discussion: Dating application usage presents opportunities as well as challenges to young adults meeting new friends. Innovative and relatable interventions are needed to promote the safe usage of dating applications to this population. Practical knowledge gained from the development process may be helpful for future intervention utilizing the peer-led approach. If effective, the intervention will be disseminated to non-governmental organizations and educational institutions to be used as a teaching resource. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adolescent; adult; Article; behavior assessment; controlled study; follow up; General Self Efficacy Scale; health care planning; Hong Kong; human; information processing; motivation; non profit organization; online dating; online support group; online system; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; risk factor; school health education; scoring system; self concept; teaching hospital; tertiary care center; treatment outcome; web browser; adolescent behavior; attitude to computers; female; high risk behavior; human relation; Internet; male; mobile application; multicenter study (topic); peer pressure; prevention and control; privacy; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); sexual behavior; time factor; unsafe sex; young adult; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Attitude to Computers; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Internet; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Mobile Applications; Motivation; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Peer Influence; Privacy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Self Efficacy; Sexual Behavior; Time Factors; Unsafe Sex; Young Adult"
"Tropism of influenza B viruses in human respiratory tract explants and airway organoids",2019,"Despite causing regular seasonal epidemics with substantial morbidity, mortality and socioeconomic burden, there is still a lack of research into influenza B viruses (IBVs). In this study, we provide for the first time a systematic investigation on the tropism, replication kinetics and pathogenesis of IBVs in the human respiratory tract. Physiologically relevant ex vivo explant cultures of human bronchus and lung, human airway organoids, and in vitro cultures of differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells and type-I-like alveolar epithelial cells were used to study the cellular and tissue tropism, replication competence and induced innate immune response of 16 IBV strains isolated from 1940 to 2012 in comparison with human seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs), H1N1 and H3N2. IBVs from the diverged Yamagata- and Victoria-like lineages and the earlier undiverged period were included. The majority of IBVs replicated productively in human bronchus and lung with similar competence to seasonal IAVs. IBVs infected a variety of cell types, including ciliated cells, club cells, goblet cells and basal cells, in human airway organoids. Like seasonal IAVs, IBVs are low inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Most results suggested a higher preference for the conducting airway than the lower lung and strain-specific rather than lineage-specific pathogenicity of IBVs. Our results highlighted the non-negligible virulence of IBVs which require more attention and further investigation to alleviate the disease burden, especially when treatment options are limited. ?

"Professional socialisation of nursing students in a collectivist culture: A qualitative study",2019,"Background: Beyond the formal curriculum of skill attainment, nursing students are able to undergo the professional socialisation process in clinical contexts and establish their identity as healthcare providers. However, the cultural context that affects the socialisation process in clinical placements is less discussed. We aimed to explore nursing students' learning and professional socialisation during clinical placements by considering the socio-cultural contexts in South Korea. Methods: A grounded theory approach was used for this research. Four rounds of in-depth and intensive interviews were carried out, with the recruitment of 16 nursing students, four nurses and two university lecturers in South Korea (29 interviews in total). A constructivist grounded theory framework was adopted to analyse the interview data. NVivo 11 was used to manage the interview data for analysis. Results: The researchers identified the process of learning and professional socialisation under three core themes: 1) Struggling at the bottom of the hierarchy, 2) Acceptance and conformity, and 3) The need for 'nunchi' (in Korean, it means to study the atmosphere and discover the embedded intention of others' behaviour). The results offered insights into the challenges encountered by nursing students on clinical placements and how students attempt to adapt and conform to the difficulties encountered in clinical education to maximise their learning and for their professional socialisation. The significance of the hidden curriculum was discussed. Conclusions: While experiential learning is a great opportunity for students to build on their coping skills and professional socialisation, a lack of support can result in failure to manage the hidden curriculum and theoretical and practical skills. Nursing educators therefore need to orientate students to the professional culture prior to beginning clinical placements. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; atmosphere; clinical article; clinical education; coping behavior; curriculum; experiential learning; grounded theory; human; human experiment; interview; nursing student; qualitative research; scientist; skill; South Korea; theoretical study; adult; clinical competence; curriculum; epidemiology; female; health personnel attitude; nursing education; psychology; public relations; qualitative research; socialization; workplace; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Grounded Theory; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Qualitative Research; Republic of Korea; Socialization; Students, Nursing; Workplace"
"MiRNA-21 promotes osteogenesis via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α pathway and enhances bone regeneration in critical size defects",2019,"Background: Functional reconstruction of maxillofacial bone defects is a considerable clinical challenge. Many studies have emphasized the osteogenic and angiopoietic abilities of stem cells for tissue regeneration. We previously showed that microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) can promote angiogenesis in human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCBMSCs). In the present study, the role of miRNA-21 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) was investigated. Methods: Western blotting and qPCR were performed to investigate the influences of miRNA-21 on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The effects of miRNA-21 on PTEN/PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α pathway were also assessed using western blotting. To further evaluate the roles of miRNA-21 in osteogenesis in vivo, we conducted animal experiments in rat and canine. New bone formation was assessed using micro-CT and histological methods. Results: In the present study, we found that miRNA-21 promotes the migration and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro. Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, we found that miRNA-21 promoted the osteogenic ability of BMSCs by increasing P-Akt and HIF-1α activation. Finally, we verified the essential role of miRNA-21 in osteogenesis by implanting a miRNA-21-modified BMSCs/β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) composite into critical size defects. Radiography, micro-CT, and histology revealed significantly greater volume of new bone formation in the miRNA-21 group than in the control group. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study demonstrated an essential role of miRNA-21 in promoting maxillofacial bone regeneration via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α pathway. ? 2019 The Author(s).","calcium phosphate; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; microRNA 21; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase B; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone defect; bone development; bone mass; bone radiography; bone regeneration; cell differentiation; cell migration; controlled study; disease severity; drug mechanism; experimental study; gene function; gene therapy; hematopoietic stem cell; histopathology; in vivo study; jaw disease; mandible; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; ossification; osteoblast; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein RNA binding; rat; transcription initiation; Western blotting"

"Optimal timing of hepatitis B virus DNA quantification and clinical predictors for higher viral load during pregnancy",2019,"Introduction: Authorities publish recommendations on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral load threshold to initiate antiviral treatment but the timing of quantification during pregnancy is not well defined. HBV DNA levels in pregnancy women at 28-30?weeks predict the risk of immunoprophylaxis failure. This study compared and evaluated the correlation between HBV DNA levels before 22 and 28-30?weeks’ gestation. Clinical predictive factors for HBV DNA?&gt;6, 7 and 8?log10?IU/mL were studied. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of HBV DNA levels of women &lt;22 and 28-30?weeks of gestation was carried out in 352 pregnant HBV carriers. HBV DNA was examined using the COBAS TaqMan HBV Monitor Test coupled with the COBAS Ampliprep extraction system (Both Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ, USA). Results: A strong positive correlation was found between the viral loads of women &lt;22?weeks (mean 16.7?weeks) and 28-30?weeks of gestation, which was independent of the viral load level and gestational age of quantification (r?= 0.942, P?&lt; 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), maternal age &lt;35?years old and body mass index ?21?kg/m2 were associated with a higher mean viral load at 28-30?weeks of gestation (P?&lt; 0.05). These factors were also associated with a higher chance of viral load &gt;6, 7 and 8?log10?IU/mL at 28-30?weeks (P?&lt; 0.05). In multiple regression analysis, only the viral load of &lt;22?weeks and positive HBeAg remained predictive of a higher mean viral load at 28-30?weeks of gestation (P?&lt; 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the HBV DNA of &lt;22?weeks was an excellent predictor for different viral load cut-offs at 28-30?weeks. The area under curve was 0.986, 0.998 and 0.994 for viral load 6, 7 and 8?log10?IU/mL, respectively. Conclusions: HBV DNA quantification should be performed before 22?weeks of gestation. Viral load cut-offs similar to those at 28?weeks can be used to determine immunoprophylaxis failure at earlier gestation. Maternal positive HBeAg status was associated with a higher chance of viral load &gt;6, 7 or 8?log10?IU/mL. ? 2019 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","antivirus agent; hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B vaccine; hepatitis B(e) antigen; adult; antiviral therapy; Article; body mass; female; gestational age; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunoprophylaxis; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; nulligravida; nullipara; parity; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; smoking; virus load"
"Oral arsenic trioxide incorporation into frontline treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia: A 5-year prospective study",2019,"Background: Strategies using oral arsenic trioxide (As2O3) are efficacious in relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but they have not been examined in newly diagnosed cases. Methods: Sixty-two consecutive patients (24 men and 38 women) with a median age of 52?years (range, 22-85?years), 36% of whom had high-risk features, underwent induction with all-trans retinoic acid at 45?mg/m2/d, oral As2O3 at 10?mg/d, and ascorbic acid at 1?g/d (the all-trans retinoic acid–arsenic trioxide–ascorbic acid [AAA] regimen) for 6?weeks (with patients younger than 70?years additionally receiving daunorubicin at 50?mg/m2/d?×?3); they then underwent consolidation with 2 monthly cycles of daunorubicin (50?mg/m2/d?×?2) and cytarabine (100?mg/m2/d?×?5) and received AAA maintenance (2?weeks every 8?weeks) for 2?years. A contemporaneous cohort of 37 newly diagnosed patients (15 men and 22 women) with a median age of 51?years (range, 23-78?years), not consenting to oral As2O3 induction but receiving similar induction, consolidation, and AAA maintenance, served as a comparator group; 46% of these patients had high-risk features. Results: The oral As2O3 induction cohort showed a complete remission (CR) rate of 100%. After a median of 37?months (range, 13-82?months), there were no relapses, so conventional risks (age, leukocyte and platelet counts, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3] mutations) were not relevant. The leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 100% at 3?years and 94.1% at 5?years. The non–As2O3 induction cohort showed a CR rate of 100%. After a median of 52?months (range, 14-77?months), there were 3 relapses (8%). Comparable patients in the oral As2O3 induction and non–As2O3 induction cohorts showed similar OS, but LFS was significantly superior in the oral As2O3 induction cohort. Conclusions: The incorporation of oral As2O3 into induction for newly diagnosed APL was safe and decreased relapses. ? 2019 American Cancer Society","arsenic trioxide; ascorbic acid; CD135 antigen; cytarabine; daunorubicin; hydroxyurea; idarubicin; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; retinoic acid; acute heart infarction; adult; age distribution; aged; anemia; Article; bleeding; cancer specific survival; cohort analysis; consolidation chemotherapy; controlled study; drug dose reduction; drug safety; female; fever; headache; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; hematologic disease; high risk patient; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypertransaminasemia; induction chemotherapy; infection; kidney dysfunction; leukemia relapse; leukemia remission; leukocyte count; leukopenia; liver toxicity; maintenance chemotherapy; major clinical study; male; mutational analysis; nausea and vomiting; nephrotoxicity; neutropenia; overall survival; platelet count; priority journal; promyelocytic leukemia; prospective study; QT prolongation; rash; sex difference; survival rate; thrombocytopenia; very elderly"
"Effect of specially designed oral health preventive programme on oral health of visually impaired children: use of audio and tactile aids",2019,"Introduction: Contemporary methods of teaching oral hygiene for the removal of dental plaque are not beneficial for visually impaired children, who depend on tactile sensations and hearing for learning. The present study was conducted to educate and motivate visually impaired children to maintain their oral health using specially designed methods that are easy for these children to understand. Additionally, the study evaluated the effectiveness of these methods over a 6-month period. Methodology: The investigation was done on 148 visually impaired children who were residents of two institutes for the visually impaired. The efficacy of a specially designed oral health education programme and two different motivational techniques utilising tactile (Group I: braille + plastic models) or auditory sensations (Group II: audio story + JAWS ? , i.e. Job Access With Speech) was evaluated over 6 months based on the children's plaque and gingival scores. Results: Significant improvement in mean plaque and gingival scores was evident in both the groups at the 6-month evaluation, validating the effectiveness of both the programmes. In Group I, the mean plaque score decreased from 1.34 ± 0.29 at baseline to 1.09 ± 0.26 at 3 months, with a further decrease to 1.04 ± 0.31 at 6 months post-implementation (P &lt; 0.01). The mean plaque score in Group II decreased from 1.24 ± 0.47 at baseline to 1.15 ± 0.15 at 3 months (P = 0.12), and further to 1.10 ± 0.17 at 6 months (P &lt; 0.01) post-implementation of the educational programme. At baseline, 87.8% of the children in Group I had moderate gingivitis, whereas 52.7% of the children in Group II belonged to the mild category. At the end of 6 months, 52.7% of the children in Group I were in the mild category, and 62.2% children in Group II were in the moderate category. Conclusion: Tactile and auditory measures were found to be effective in educating and motivating visually impaired children regarding maintenance of oral hygiene. ? 2018 FDI World Dental Federation","child; dental health education; health; human; mouth hygiene; tooth plaque; visually impaired person; Child; Dental Plaque; Health Education, Dental; Humans; Oral Health; Oral Hygiene; Visually Impaired Persons"
"Self-harm attempters’ perception of community services and its implication on service provision",2019,"Objective: This study aimed at exploring the attempters’ perception of community social services included any barriers to seeking help and services. Method: The participants were patients with self-harming behavior aged 15 years or above. A set of guiding questions were designed to explore the general barriers and accessibility to community social services. A voice recording was made, which was later converted into a text transcript and then preceded for content analysis with co-occurrence and similarity matrix interpretation. Two males and nine females with a history of self-harm aged between 24 and 58 years were recruited for the interviews. Result: The participants had diverse experiences and backgrounds, and attitudes toward community social services. However, there was a shared perception of the need to enhance community social services. There were four main themes and 12 sub themes identified. The main theme included the service availability, service accessibility, affordability and acceptability. For details, participants were unaware of the available types of care/social services in the community, and were unaware about the nearby social services. They also suggested extending service hours and focused services should be offered to help people with different backgrounds and needs. Actually, those with experience of service utilization had both positive and negative perspectives and they gave suggestions for service delivery, mainly extending service hours and offering focused services such as for gambling control and financial planning. In view of interaction with service providers, counseling skills and trust were highly appreciated by the participants. Conclusion: The results identified common circumstances of falling into financial hardship (gambling) and social fragmentation (divorce, poor family relationships, and poor marital relationships), which also suggested to enhance services on center location, service arrangement, and skill of caregivers. ? 2018 Chinese Nursing Association","adult; Article; automutilation; caregiver; clinical article; economic status; emotion; family; female; follow up; gambling; human; interpersonal communication; male; mental disease; middle aged; perception; psychological aspect; questionnaire; semi structured interview; social aspect; social isolation; social welfare; stress management; structured interview; thematic analysis; young adult"
"Evaluation of the responsiveness of Short Form-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) in Chinese patients with hypertension in primary care",2019,"Purpose: There is limited evidence on the responsiveness of the Short Form-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) in hypertensive patients. This study aimed to evaluate both the responsiveness of the SF-12 measures in Chinese hypertensive patients. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on hypertensive patients managed in public primary care clinics between 2012 and 2013. A total of 583 and 431 patients were surveyed and completed SF-12v2 at baseline and at 12-month follow-up interviews, respectively. Using global rating of change scale as an external anchor, the responsiveness was assessed by linear mixed effect models, multiple linear regression models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: SF-12v2 managed to detect negative changes among hypertensive patients in worsened general health group but failed to identify changes among hypertensive patients in improved general health group. Meanwhile, some domains of SF-12v2 detected a significant difference in difference between patients of worsened and stable/improved group and between patients of stable and improved group, but none of the domains and the summary scales reached the recommended standard of 0.7 in any comparisons in ROC analysis. Conclusions: The SF-12v2 was responsive to worsening of HRQOL but not to improvements in HRQOL among hypertensive patients. The overall responsiveness of SF-12v2 in hypertensive patients is unsatisfactory. Further studies are needed to identify HRQOL measures with good internal and external responsiveness for hypertensive patients. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","adult; article; Chinese; controlled study; female; follow up; human; hypertensive patient; interview; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; multiple linear regression analysis; primary medical care; prospective study; quality of life; receiver operating characteristic; Short Form 12; Asian continental ancestry group; health survey; middle aged; primary health care; procedures; quality of life; questionnaire; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Donor-derived genotype 4 hepatitis E virus infection, Hong Kong, China, 2018",2019,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 4 (HEV-4) is an emerging cause of acute hepatitis in China. Less is known about the clinical characteristics and natural history of HEV-4 than HEV genotype 3 infections in immunocompromised patients. We report transmission of HEV-4 from a deceased organ donor to 5 transplant recipients. The donor had been viremic but HEV IgM and IgG seronegative, and liver function test results were within reference ranges. After a mean of 52 days after transplantation, hepatitis developed in all 5 recipients; in the liver graft recipient, disease was severe and with progressive portal hypertension. Despite reduced immunosuppression, all HEV-4 infections progressed to persistent hepatitis. Four patients received ribavirin and showed evidence of response after 2 months. This study highlights the role of organ donation in HEV transmission, provides additional data on the natural history of HEV-4 infection, and points out differences between genotype 3 and 4 infections in immunocompromised patients. ? 2019, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"Factors Associated with Dental Root Caries: A Systematic Review",2020,"Objectives: The objectives of this review were to identify the factors associated with root caries and to describe their relationship with the presence and extent of root caries. Methods: A search was carried out on the PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases for articles published between January 1990 and October 2018. Information was extracted on the factors associated with the presence or extent of decayed or filled root surfaces and/or decayed root surfaces. Factors were sorted into 6 categories: social-demographic background, general health, health behaviors, fluoride exposure, oral health habits, and oral health condition. Results: The quality of the 127 identified relevant papers was assessed, and those of low methodological quality were excluded. Finally, 44 articles reporting on 40 cross-sectional studies were included. The total sample size comprised 78,183 participants from different countries around the world. Positive correlations were detected between root caries and age, gingival recession, and use of tobacco, while negative correlations were found for social position, use of fluoride toothpaste, and oral hygiene status. Mixed findings were reported for association with the number of teeth and dental visit behaviors. Conclusion: This systematic review found a number of factors in different categories to be associated with root caries. People who are older, of lower socioeconomic status, or tobacco users and those with more gingival recession and poorer oral hygiene have higher risk of root caries. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This systematic review found a number of factors associated with root caries, including age, social position, exposure to fluoride, and oral hygiene status. This information helps dental public health workers and clinicians identify the groups at high risk of caries and the factors to act on for more effective prevention and management of root caries (e.g., use fluoride toothpaste and improve oral hygiene). ?

"Tractography-based classification in distinguishing patients with first-episode schizophrenia from healthy individuals",2019,"Background: Schizophrenia has been characterized as a neurodevelopmental disorder of brain disconnectivity. However, whether disrupted integrity of white matter tracts in schizophrenia can potentially serve as individual discriminative biomarkers remains unclear. Methods: A random forest algorithm was applied to tractography-based diffusion properties obtained from a cohort of 65 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and 60 healthy individuals to investigate the machine-learning discriminative power of white matter disconnectivity. Recursive feature elimination was used to select the ultimate white matter features in the classification. Relationships between algorithm-predicted probabilities and clinical characteristics were also examined in the FES group. Results: The classifier was trained by 80% of the sample. Patients were distinguished from healthy individuals with an overall accuracy of 71.0% (95% confident interval: 61.1%, 79.6%), a sensitivity of 67.3%, a specificity of 75.0%, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 79.3% (χ2 p < 0.001). In validation using the held-up 20% of the sample, patients were distinguished from healthy individuals with an overall accuracy of 76.0% (95% confident interval: 54.9%, 90.6%), a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of 75.0%, and an AUC of 73.1% (χ2 p = 0.012). Diffusion properties of inter-hemispheric fibres, the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits and the long association fibres were identified to be the most discriminative in the classification. Higher predicted probability scores were found in younger patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the widespread connectivity disruption observed in FES patients, especially in younger patients, might be considered potential individual discriminating biomarkers. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","accuracy; adult; algorithm; area under the curve; Article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; demography; diffusion; disease classification; DSM-IV; echo planar imaging; electroconvulsive therapy; female; functional connectivity; human; interhemispheric transfer; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mental disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organic brain syndrome; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; probability; psychosis; random forest; rating scale; receiver operating characteristic; schizophrenia; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; structured interview; superior longitudinal fasciculus; thalamocortical tract; tractography; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; white matter; anisotropy; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; drug effect; nerve tract; psychological rating scale; schizophrenia; young adult; neuroleptic agent; Adult; Anisotropy; Antipsychotic Agents; Brain; Brain Mapping; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Neural Pathways; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; ROC Curve; Schizophrenia; White Matter; Young Adult"
"The impact of the national action plan on the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance among 352,238 isolates in a teaching hospital in China from 2015 to 2018",2019,"Background: We sought to understand the epidemiology and characteristics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the impact of the National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR. This information will be critical to develop interventions and strengthen antibiotic stewardship in hospital settings in China. Methods: Cross-sectional data collection from the hospital information management system from 1 January 2015 to 30 August 2018. Variables included patient age, sex, diagnosis, hospital department and antibiotic sensitivity test. T-test for two samples method was applied to compare the results before and after NAP implementation. Multivariate analysis with binary logistic regression was conducted to examine the associations of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance. Results: In total there were 352,238 isolates in the final analysis after excluding contamination strains and isolates with incomplete information. More than 50% of patients were > 66 years old. 62% were male. 40% of the total samples were sputum. Among the total sample, the total resistance rate was 42% among all isolates. The rate of resistance to all antibiotics declined by 5.3% (95% CI 4.96-5.64%, p < 0.0001) and culture positivity rate declined by 9.8% (95% CI 9.22-10.34%, p < 0.0001) after NAP. Logistical regression showed that the NAP had effect with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71-0.81, p = 0.002). Being male, age > 65 years, ICU department, diagnosed with certain diseases were more likely to be associated with antimicrobial resistance. Conclusions: Antibiotic resistance rates were high in this teaching hospital. However, the introduction of the China NAP since 2016 followed by hospital policy emphasis was associated with a declining AMR trend. Policies will need to incorporate antimicrobial stewardship with a focus on certain departments, with infection control practices and with increases in vaccination coverage among elderly. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amikacin; amoxicillin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; azithromycin; cefazolin; cefepime; cefotaxime; cefoxitin; ceftazidime; ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid; ceftriaxone; cefuroxime; ciprofloxacin; clavulanic acid; ertapenem; erythromycin; gentamicin; imipenem; josamycin; levofloxacin; lincomycin; meropenem; moxifloxacin; oxacillin; piperacillin; piperacillin plus tazobactam; roxithromycin; timentin; tobramycin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter baumannii; adult; aged; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; China; controlled study; cross-sectional study; Enterobacter cloacae; Escherichia coli; female; hospital information system; hospital policy; human; intensive care unit; Klebsiella pneumoniae; logistic regression analysis; male; Neisseria; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; risk factor; teaching hospital; adolescent; antimicrobial stewardship; bacterial infection; bacterium; child; classification; drug effect; genetics; infant; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; preschool child; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Stewardship; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Female; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Infant; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Young Adult"
"Effects of the Satir Model on Mental Health: A Randomized Controlled Trial",2019,"Objective: This randomized controlled trial examined the effect of an intensive experiential workshop based on the Satir growth model (SGM) that aims at cultivating self-transformation. Method: Ninety-six adult participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (52 participants) or the wait-list control group. The role of self-transformation, measured by the Perceived Self-Transformation Scale, in the relationship between affects and mental health problems was examined using mediation analyses. Results: After the workshop, the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of self-transformation (η2 =.308, p &lt;.001), as well as significant improvement (p &lt;.001) in positive (η2 =.557) and negative (η2 =.293) affects, self-esteem (η2 =.538), spirituality (η2 =.473), and mental health problems (η2 =.386). Importantly, increased self-transformation after the workshop partially mediated the relationship between reduced negative affect and mental health problems in the intervention group (indirect effect: β = 0.163, 95% confidence interval [0.035, 0.343]). Conclusion: Findings of this study suggest that the SGM-based intervention can be effective in ameliorating mental health problems. ? The Author(s) 2018.",""

"AQAMAN, a bisamidine-based inhibitor of toxic protein inclusions in neurons, ameliorates cytotoxicity in polyglutamine disease models",2019,"Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the affected genes. Hallmarks of polyQ diseases include the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, leading to neuronal degeneration and cell death. PolyQ diseases are currently incurable, highlighting the urgent need for approaches that inhibit the formation of disaggregate cytotoxic polyQ protein inclusions. Here, we screened for bisamidine-based inhibitors that can inhibit neuronal polyQ protein inclusions. We demonstrated that one inhibitor, AQAMAN, prevents polyQ protein aggregation and promotes de-aggregation of self-assembled polyQ proteins in several models of polyQ diseases. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that AQAMAN significantly reduces polyQ protein aggregation and specifically suppresses polyQ protein–induced cell death. Using a recombinant and purified polyQ protein (thioredoxin–Huntingtin–Q46), we further demonstrated that AQAMAN interferes with polyQ self-assembly, preventing polyQ aggregation, and dissociates preformed polyQ aggregates in a cell-free system. Remarkably, AQAMAN feeding of Drosophila expressing expanded polyQ disease protein suppresses polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in vivo. In addition, using inhibitors and activators of the autophagy pathway, we demonstrated that AQAMAN’s cytoprotective effect against polyQ toxicity is autophagy-dependent. In summary, we have identified AQAMAN as a potential therapeutic for combating polyQ protein toxicity in polyQ diseases. Our findings further highlight the importance of the autophagy pathway in clearing harmful polyQ proteins. ? 2019 Hong et al.

"Seasonal changes in suicide in South Korea, 1991 to 2015",2019,"Seasonality of suicidal behavior has been widely reported in many epidemiological studies with a well replicated suicide peak in spring followed by a trough in winter season. Research from some regions over the past few decades has shown a diminishing seasonal pattern of suicides and this introduced a new perspective on the suicide study. Data on all suicide deaths from the period 1991 to 2015 was extracted from the South Korean National Death Registration data set which was made available by Statistics Korea. Our findings confirmed a strong seasonal effect of suicides in South Korea throughout the study period and a marked diminishing pattern was observed since the period of 2006–2010. The rhythm of suicides kept changing across the time intervals with a spring peak followed by a second peak in late summer/autumn. The seasonality varied across age groups and the seasonal effect among the Korean elderly suicides was still found to be significant though a diminishing pattern was observed recently. ? 2019 Yang et al.

"Endothelial SIRT1 prevents age-induced impairment of vasodilator responses by enhancing the expression and activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle cells",2019,"Aims Aged arteries are characterized by attenuated vasodilator and enhanced vasoconstrictor responses, which contribute to the development of diseases such as arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. SIRT1 is a longevity regulator exerting protective functions against vascular ageing, although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study was designed to elucidate the signalling pathways involved in endothelial SIRT1-mediated vasodilator responses in the arteries of young and old mice. In particular, the contributions of nitric oxide (NO), endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX), and/or soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) were examined. Methods and results Wild type (WT) or eNOS knockout (eKO) mice were cross-bred with those overexpressing human SIRT1 selectively in the vascular endothelium (EC-SIRT1). Arteries were collected from the four groups of mice (WT, EC-SIRT1, eKO, and eKO-SIRT1) to measure isometric relaxations/contractions in response to various pharmacological agents. Reduction of NO bioavailability, hyper-activation of COX signalling, and down-regulation of sGC collectively contributed to the decreased vasodilator and increased vasoconstrictor responses in arteries of old WT mice. Overexpression of endothelial SIRT1 did not block the reduction in NO bioavailability but attenuated the hyper-activation of COX-2, thus protecting mice from age-induced vasoconstrictor responses in arteries of EC-SIRT1 mice. Deficiency of eNOS did not affect endothelial SIRT1-mediated anti-contractile activities in arteries of eKO-SIRT1 mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that overexpression of endothelial SIRT1 enhanced Notch signalling to up-regulate sGCβ1 in smooth muscle cells. Increased expression and activity of sGC prevented age-induced hyper-activation of COX-2 as well as the conversion of endothelium-dependent relaxations to contractions in arteries of EC-SIRT1 mice. Conclusion Age-induced down-regulation of sGC and up-regulation of COX-2 in arteries are at least partly attributable to the loss-of-endothelial SIRT1 function. Enhancing the endothelial expression and function of SIRT1 prevents early vascular ageing and maintains vasodilator responses, thus representing promising drug targets for cardiovascular diseases. ?

"Metabolomics analysis in serum from patients with colorectal polyp and colorectal cancer by 1H-NMR spectrometry",2019,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Colorectal adenomatous polyps are at high risk for the development of CRC. In this report, we described the metabolic changes in the sera from patients with colorectal polyps and CRC by using the NMR-based metabolomics. 110 serum samples were collected from patients and healthy controls, including 40 CRC patients, 32 colorectal polyp patients, and 38 healthy controls. The metabolic profiles and differential metabolites of sera were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. A total of 23 differential metabolites were identified from MSA. According to the pathway analysis and multivariate ROC curve-based exploratory analysis by using the relative concentrations of differential metabolites, we found abnormal metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers involved with the colorectal polyp and CRC. The results showed that the pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps. And the glycolysis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC. The changed metabolism may promote cellular proliferation. In addition, we found that the rates of acetate/glycerol and lactate/citrate could be the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and CRC, respectively. The application of 1H-NMR metabolomics analysis in serum has interesting potential as a new detection and diagnostic tool for early diagnosis of CRC. Copyright ? 2019 Jinping Gu et al.

"The impact of expanded brucellosis surveillance in beef cattle on human brucellosis in Korea: An interrupted time-series analysis",2019,"Background: Korean surveillance program for bovine brucellosis was improved by extending it to beef slaughterhouses and by pre-movement testing of bulls on May 2005 (Intervention 1). The bovine brucellosis surveillance program was further extended to beef cattle farms with more than 10 heads of cattle on June 2006 (Intervention 2). Methods: To quantify the temporal relationship between bovine and human brucellosis, a time-series analysis was conducted using Korean national notification data reported between January 2004 and December 2014. Results: Our findings indicate that while during the pre-intervention phase (January 2004 to March 2005) there was no significant temporal relationship between the incidences of bovine and human brucellosis, significant temporal relationships were observed after Intervention 1 (June 2005 to June 2006, no lag, β = 0.57, p = 0.04), and Intervention 2 (July 2006 to June 2007, 1-month lag, β = 0.65, p = 0.03). Furthermore, significant changes in incidence in human were observed after Intervention 1 (β = - 0.17 per 10 million-people, p = 0.03) and Intervention 2 (β = - 0.19 per 10 million-people, p = 0.04). Conclusions: These findings indicated the changes of a nationwide comprehensive surveillance programme targeting all cattle is required for effective reduction in the human population. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; bacterial transmission; beef cattle; bovine brucellosis; brucellosis; controlled study; disease surveillance; human; human brucellosis; incidence; Korea; nonhuman; time series analysis; animal; bovine; bovine brucellosis; brucellosis; health survey; microbiology; red meat; South Korea; Animals; Brucellosis; Brucellosis, Bovine; Cattle; Humans; Incidence; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Population Surveillance; Red Meat; Republic of Korea"
"Brosimone I, an isoprenoid-substituted flavonoid, induces cell cycle G1 phase arrest and apoptosis through ROS-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress in HCT116 human colon cancer cells",2019,"Brosimone I is an isoprenoid-substituted flavonoid from Artocarpus heterophyllus. Here, we reported for the first time that brosimone I induced cell cycle G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells. Brosimone I treatment increased the cytosolic Ca2+ level, and subsequently activated the CaMKKβ-AMPK pathway. STO-609, a CaMKKβ inhibitor, and compound C, an AMPK-specific inhibitor, attenuated brosimone I-induced loss of cell viability in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, brosimone I enhanced ER stress. Salubrinal, an ER stress inhibitor, reduced brosimone I-induced cell growth inhibition. In addition, brosimone I was found to increase ROS generation and the inhibition of ROS formation by NAC, a ROS inhibitor, attenuated brosimone I-induced cell death, cytosolic Ca2+ increase, and ER stress markers. Collectively, our findings reveal that brosimone I induces cell cycle G1 phase arrest and apoptosis via the induction of ROS-mediated increased cytosolic Ca2+, ER stress, and the activation of the CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling pathway. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Cell death; Cell membranes; Diseases; Lipids; Artocarpus heterophyllus; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; G1 phase arrest; Growth inhibition; HCT116 human colon cancer cells; Ros generations; Signaling pathways; Specific inhibitors; Cell signaling; calcium; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase; flavonoid; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; apoptosis; Artocarpus; cell proliferation; chemistry; colon tumor; drug effect; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; human; metabolism; pathophysiology; signal transduction; Apoptosis; Artocarpus; Calcium; Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase; Cell Proliferation; Colonic Neoplasms; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Flavonoids; G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Plant Extracts; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction"
"Targeting of lipid metabolism with a metabolic inhibitor cocktail eradicates peritoneal metastases in ovarian cancer cells",2019,"Ovarian cancer is an intra-abdominal tumor in which the presence of ascites facilitates metastatic dissemination, and associated with poor prognosis. However, the significance of metabolic alterations in ovarian cancer cells in the ascites microenvironment remains unclear. Here we show ovarian cancer cells exhibited increased aggressiveness in ascites microenvironment via reprogramming of lipid metabolism. High lipid metabolic activities are found in ovarian cancer cells when cultured in the ascites microenvironment, indicating a metabolic shift from aerobic glycolysis to β-oxidation and lipogenesis. The reduced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity due to the feedback effect of high energy production led to the activation of its downstream signaling, which in turn, enhanced the cancer growth. The combined treatment of low toxic AMPK activators, the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors synergistically impair oncogenic augmentation of ovarian cancer. Collectively, targeting lipid metabolism signaling axis impede ovarian cancer peritoneal metastases. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Range of Normal Liver Stiffness and Factors Associated With Increased Stiffness Measurements in Apparently Healthy Individuals",2019,"Background &amp; Aims: Transient elastography (TE) is a noninvasive technique used to measure liver stiffness to estimate the severity of fibrosis. The range of liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) in healthy individuals is unclear. We performed a systematic review to determine the range of LSMs, examined by TE, in healthy individuals and individuals who are susceptible to fibrosis. Methods: We collected data from 16,082 individuals, in 26 cohorts, identified from systematic searches of Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies of liver stiffness measurements. Studies analyzed included apparently healthy adults (normal levels of liver enzymes, low-risk alcohol use patterns, and negative for markers of viral hepatitis). The presence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or steatosis, based on ultrasound examination, was known for most participants. We performed a meta-analysis of data from individual participants. The cohort was divided into 4 groups; participants with a body mass index &lt;30 kg/m2 were examined with the medium probe and those with a body mass index ?30 kg/m2 were examined with the extra-large probe. Linear regression models were conducted after adjusting for potential confounding factors of LSMs. We performed several sensitivity analyses. Results: We established LSM ranges for healthy individuals measured with both probes—these did not change significantly in sensitivity analyses of individuals with platelets ?150,000/mm3 and levels of alanine aminotransferase ?33 IU/L in men or ?25 IU/L in women. In multivariate analysis, factors that modified LSMs with statistical significance included diabetes, dyslipidemia, waist circumference, level of aspartate aminotransferase, and systolic blood pressure at examination time. Significant increases in LSMs were associated with the metabolic syndrome in individuals examined by either probe. Diabetes in obese individuals increased the risk of LSMs in the range associated with advanced fibrosis. Conclusions: In a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from individual participants, we established a comprehensive set of LSM ranges, measured by TE in large cohorts of healthy individuals and persons susceptible to hepatic fibrosis. Regression analyses identified factors associated with increased LSMs obtained by TE with the medium and extra-large probes. ? 2019 AGA Institute","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; liver enzyme; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alcohol consumption; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body mass; diabetes mellitus; disease predisposition; dyslipidemia; echography; fatty liver; high risk population; human; hypertension; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness; metabolic syndrome X; normal value; platelet count; Review; risk factor; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; transient elastography; virus hepatitis; waist circumference; adolescent; adult; aged; anthropometry; elasticity; elastography; female; liver; male; meta analysis; middle aged; normal human; physiology; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthropometry; Elasticity; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult"
"Identifying rural–urban differences in the predictors of emergency ambulance service demand and misuse",2019,"Objective: This study aims to assess rural–urban differences in the predictors of emergency ambulance service (EAS) demand and misuse in New Taipei City. Identifying the predictors of EAS demand will help the EAS service managing authority in formulating focused policies to maintain service quality. Methods: Over 160,000 electronic EAS usage records were used with a negative binomial regression model to assess rural–urban differences in the predictors of EAS demand and misuse. Results: The factors of 1) ln-transformed population density, 2) percentage of residents who completed up to junior high school education, 3) accessibility of hospitals without an emergency room, and 4) accessibility of EAS were found to be predictors of EAS demand in rural areas, whereas only the factor of percentage of people aged above 65 was found to predict EAS demand in urban areas. For EAS misuse, only the factor of percentage of low-income households was found to be a predictor in rural areas, whereas no predictor was found in the urban areas. Conclusion: Results showed that the factors predicting EAS demand and misuse in rural areas were more complicated compared to urban areas and, therefore, formulating EAS policies for rural areas based on the results of urban studies may not be appropriate. ? 2018","adult; ambulance; article; emergency ward; female; geographic information system; high school; household; human; human experiment; lowest income group; male; population density; resident; rural area; urban area; ambulance; clinical trial; comparative study; emergency health service; health care delivery; health service; multicenter study; prognosis; rural population; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Taiwan; urban population; Ambulances; Emergency Medical Services; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Misuse; Humans; Linear Models; Prognosis; Rural Population; Taiwan; Urban Population"
"The influence of undetermined deaths on suicides in Shanghai, China",2019,"Purpose: In global forensic practice, some suicides were misclassified as undetermined deaths, leading to suicide underreporting. In this study, we aimed to explore the influence of undetermined deaths on suicides in Shanghai, China. Methods: The police records on suicide verdicts and undetermined deaths in Pudong, Shanghai, from 2004 to 2016 were used. In this study, undetermined deaths have been classified into three levels of suicide possibilities namely, probable, possible, and highly unlikely. Probable suicides were presumed as misclassified suicides. Poisson regression was used to calculate the rate ratio (“RR”) of probable suicides compared to suicide verdicts. Poisson regression was also used to calculate the annual percentage change (“APC”) of the original suicide rates (crude suicide rates based on the suicide verdicts) and adjusted suicide rates (crude suicide rates based on the suicide verdicts and probable suicides). Results: Among the 1,318 underdetermine deaths, 560 (42.5%) were classified as probable suicides. The overall RR was 0.23 (95% CI 0.21–0.26): 0.15 (0.13–0.17) for the locals’ RR and 0.22 (0.19–0.26) for the migrants’ RR. The APCs of the original and adjusted suicide rates were ? 2.0 (??3.1 to ??0.9) and ? 2.9 (??3.8 to ??2.0), respectively, for the overall population. Conclusions: The number of suicides could be 23% higher than the reported cases. Suicides were more likely to be underreported in migrants than in the locals. Thus, it is important to improve suicide monitoring and the surveillance systems in China. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adolescent; adult; cause of death; China; epidemiology; female; forensic pathology; health survey; human; male; middle aged; Poisson distribution; premature mortality; statistics and numerical data; suicide; trends; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cause of Death; China; Female; Forensic Pathology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality, Premature; Poisson Distribution; Population Surveillance; Suicide; Young Adult"
"An innovative medical consultation model in mainland China: Acceptance and perceptions",2019,"Purpose: The purposes of this paper are two-fold: first, to introduce a new concept of primary care consultation system at a mainland Chinese hospital in response to healthcare reform; and second, to explore the factors associated with change resistance and acceptance from both patients’ and medical staff’s perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: A survey design study, with two questionnaires developed and distributed to patients and medical staff. Convenience and stratified random sampling methods were applied to patient and medical staff samples. Findings: A 5-dimension, 21-item patient questionnaire and a 4-dimension, 16-item staff questionnaire were identified and confirmed, with 1020 patients (91.07 percent) and 202 staff (90.18 percent) as effective survey participants. The results revealed that patient resistance mainly stems from a lack of personal experiences with visiting general practice (GP) and being educated or having lived overseas; while staff resistance came from occupation, education, GP training certificate, and knowledge and experience with specialists. Living in overseas and knowledge of GP concepts, gender and education are associated with resistance of accepting the new practice model for both patients and staff. Originality/value: There are few Chinese studies on process reengineering in the medical sector; this is the first study to adopt this medical consultation model and change in patients’ consultation culture in Mainland China. Applying organizational change and process reengineering theories to medical and healthcare services not only extends and expands hospital management theory but also allows investigation of modern hospital management practice. The experience from this study can serve as a reference to promote this new consultation model in Chinese healthcare reform. ? 2019, Xiao Ping Xu, Dong Ge Ke, Dong Ning Deng, Shannon H.

"Do elderly breast cancer patients have poorer survival outcome?",2019,"Aim: The aim of the present study was to compare breast cancer in elderly patients to their younger counterparts, and look for factors affecting the survival of elderly patients. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study of breast cancer patients who had surgery at a university hospital from 2000 to 2015 was performed. Stage on presentation, tumour characteristics and modalities of treatment for patients aged >70 years were compared with those aged <70 years. Factors affecting breast cancer specific survival were assessed by multivariate Cox regression. Results: In total, 3825 patients with breast cancer underwent surgery during the study period; 510 patients (13.3 per cent) were aged >70 years. The 5-year overall survival for elderly patients was 76.9 per cent, which was poorer than their younger counterparts (89.5 per cent, P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy (P = 0.001, hazard ratio: 0.481), advanced T-stage (P < 0.05) and advanced N-stage (P < 0.001) were the independent factors affecting breast cancer-specific survival in elderly patients. Conclusions: Elderly breast cancer patients had worse overall and breast cancer-specific survival. Stage on presentation and the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy were independent factors affecting survival among elderly patients. Early diagnosis and comprehensive geriatric assessment to guide the optimal treatment plan would be useful for better survival outcomes in elderly breast cancer patients. ? 2018 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong","aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer hormone therapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; controlled study; human; lumpectomy; major clinical study; mastectomy; multivariate analysis; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; outcome assessment; overall survival; priority journal; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; university hospital"
"Immunodiagnosis of human neurocysticercosis: comparative performance of serum diagnostic tests in Mexico",2019,"Immunodiagnosis has a supportive role in the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis (NCC). The aim of this study was to compare the validity of seven immunodiagnostic tests among serum samples from 58 patients with NCC, 26 patients with neurological diseases other than NCC, and 15 healthy controls. One test for viable parasite detection (HP10 antigen assay) and six for antibody detection were evaluated. For the entire sample, sensitivities ranged from 55.2% (NOVALISA) to 81.0% (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] Taenia solium antibody), with the sensitivity of the latter test significantly higher than that of the in-house ELISA Taenia crassiceps, NOVALISA, enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) CDC, and HP10. Overall, specificities were high, ranging from 85.4% (ELISA Ts) to 97.1% (NOVALISA), with no statistically significant differences. Detection of HP10 antigen was significantly associated with the presence of vesicular parasites. The simple and low-cost ELISA Taenia solium antibody Ab instead of EITB is recommended to support NCC diagnosis in both rural and hospital settings in Mexico. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G; parasite antigen; helminth antibody; parasite antigen; adult; antibody detection; antigen detection; Article; central nervous system tumor; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; demyelinating disease; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; headache; human; immunoassay; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; Mexico; neck pain; neurocysticercosis; neuropathy; nonhuman; parasite examination; priority journal; seizure; sensitivity and specificity; serodiagnosis; Taenia crassiceps; Taenia solium; Western blotting; animal; blood; comparative study; diagnostic test; immunological procedures; immunology; neurocysticercosis; procedures; rural population; Adult; Animals; Antibodies, Helminth; Antigens, Helminth; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Immunologic Tests; Male; Mexico; Neurocysticercosis; Rural Population; Sensitivity and Specificity; Taenia solium"
"The genetic interplay between body mass index, breast size and breast cancer risk: A Mendelian randomization analysis",2019,"Background: Evidence linking breast size to breast cancer risk has been inconsistent, and its interpretation is often hampered by confounding factors such as body mass index (BMI). Here, we used linkage disequilibrium score regression and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine the genetic associations between BMI, breast size and breast cancer risk. Methods: Summary-level genotype data from 23andMe, Inc (breast size, n = 33 790), the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (breast cancer risk, n = 228 951) and the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (BMI, n = 183 507) were used for our analyses. In assessing causal relationships, four complementary MR techniques [inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, weighted mode and MR-Egger regression] were used to test the robustness of the results. Results: The genetic correlation (rg) estimated between BMI and breast size was high (rg = 0.50, P = 3.89x10-43). All MR methods provided consistent evidence that higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with larger breast size [odds ratio (ORIVW): 2.06 (1.80-2.35), P = 1.38x10-26] and lower overall breast cancer risk [ORIVW: 0.81 (0.74-0.89), P = 9.44x10-6]. No evidence of a relationship between genetically predicted breast size and breast cancer risk was found except when using the weighted median and weighted mode methods, and only with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative risk. There was no evidence of reverse causality in any of the analyses conducted (P &gt; 0.050). Conclusion: Our findings indicate a potential positive causal association between BMI and breast size and a potential negative causal association between BMI and breast cancer risk. We found no clear evidence for a direct relationship between breast size and breast cancer risk. ? 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

"Phase-Type models in life insurance: fitting and valuation of equity-linked benefits",2019,"Phase-type (PH) distributions are defined as distributions of lifetimes of finite continuous-time Markov processes. Their traditional applications are in queueing, insurance risk, and reliability, but more recently, also in finance and, though to a lesser extent, to life and health insurance. The advantage is that PH distributions form a dense class and that problems having explicit solutions for exponential distributions typically become computationally tractable under PH assumptions. In the first part of this paper, fitting of PH distributions to human lifetimes is considered. The class of generalized Coxian distributions is given special attention. In part, some new software is developed. In the second part, pricing of life insurance products such as guaranteed minimum death benefit and high-water benefit is treated for the case where the lifetime distribution is approximated by a PH distribution and the underlying asset price process is described by a jump diffusion with PH jumps. The expressions are typically explicit in terms of matrix-exponentials involving two matrices closely related to the Wiener-Hopf factorization, for which recently, a L?vy process version has been developed for a PH horizon. The computational power of themethod of the approach is illustrated via a number of numerical examples. ? 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",""

"Wastewater treatment plant resistomes are shaped by bacterial composition, genetic exchange, and upregulated expression in the effluent microbiomes",2019,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are implicated as hotspots for the dissemination of antibacterial resistance into the environment. However, the in situ processes governing removal, persistence, and evolution of resistance genes during wastewater treatment remain poorly understood. Here, we used quantitative metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to achieve a broad-spectrum view of the flow and expression of genes related to antibacterial resistance to over 20 classes of antibiotics, 65 biocides, and 22 metals. All compartments of 12 WWTPs share persistent resistance genes with detectable transcriptional activities that were comparatively higher in the secondary effluent, where mobility genes also show higher relative abundance and expression ratios. The richness and abundance of resistance genes vary greatly across metagenomes from different treatment compartments, and their relative and absolute abundances correlate with bacterial community composition and biomass concentration. No strong drivers of resistome composition could be identified among the chemical stressors analyzed, although the sub-inhibitory concentration (hundreds of ng/L) of macrolide antibiotics in wastewater correlates with macrolide and vancomycin resistance genes. Contig-based analysis shows considerable co-localization between resistance and mobility genes and implies a history of substantial horizontal resistance transfer involving human bacterial pathogens. Based on these findings, we propose future inclusion of mobility incidence (M%) and host pathogenicity of antibiotic resistance genes in their quantitative health risk ranking models with an ultimate goal to assess the biological significance of wastewater resistomes with regard to disease control in humans or domestic livestock. ? 2018, International Society for Microbial Ecology.","antimicrobial activity; bacterium; biomass; biome; community composition; disease control; effluent; gene expression; gene transfer; molecular analysis; relative abundance; species richness; wastewater treatment plant; Bacteria (microorganisms); antiinfective agent; transcriptome; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; horizontal gene transfer; metabolism; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; microflora; sewage; upregulation; waste water; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genes, Bacterial; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water"
"Perioperative Quality Initiative consensus statement on postoperative blood pressure, risk and outcomes for elective surgery",2019,"Background: Postoperative hypotension and hypertension are frequent events associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, proper assessment and management is often poorly understood. As a part of the PeriOperative Quality Improvement (POQI) 3 workgroup meeting, we developed a consensus document addressing this topic. The target population includes adult, non-cardiac surgical patients in the postoperative phase outside of the ICU. Methods: A modified Delphi technique was used, evaluating papers published in MEDLINE examining postoperative blood pressure monitoring, management, and outcomes. Practice recommendations were developed in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. Results: Consensus recommendations were that (i) there is evidence of harm associated with postoperative systolic arterial pressure <90 mm Hg; (ii) for patients with preoperative hypertension, the threshold at which harm occurs may be higher than a systolic arterial pressure of 90 mm Hg; (iii) there is insufficient evidence to precisely define the level of postoperative hypertension above which harm will occur; (iv) a greater frequency of postoperative blood pressure measurement is likely to identify risk of harm and clinical deterioration earlier; and (v) there is evidence of harm from withholding beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the postoperative period. Conclusions: Despite evidence of associations with postoperative hypotension or hypertension with worse postoperative outcome, further research is needed to define the optimal levels at which intervention is beneficial, to identify the best methods and timing of postoperative blood pressure measurement, and to refine the management of long-term antihypertensive treatment in the postoperative phase. ? 2019 British Journal of Anaesthesia","angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; antihypertensive agent; Article; blood pressure; consensus; elective surgery; human; hypertension; hypotension; intensive care unit; postoperative blood pressure; practice guideline; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; complication; consensus development; Delphi study; elective surgery; evidence based medicine; hypertension; hypotension; pathophysiology; perioperative period; physiology; postoperative complication; procedures; prognosis; risk assessment; standards; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Delphi Technique; Elective Surgical Procedures; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Hypertension; Hypotension; Perioperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Risk Assessment"

"Sleep Duration and Adiposity in Children and Adults: Observational and Mendelian Randomization Studies",2019,"Objective: This study used two complementary designs, an observational and a Mendelian randomization (MR) study, to assess whether sleep duration causes adiposity in children and adults. Methods: In Hong Kong's “Children of 1997” birth cohort, the adjusted cross-sectional associations of sleep duration with BMI z score and obesity and overweight were assessed at ~11 years of age. Generalized estimating equations were also used to examine longitudinal associations of sleep duration at ~11 years with annual BMI z score and obesity and overweight at about 11 to 16 years of age. Using MR, this study assessed the association of genetically predicted sleep duration, based on 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, applied to genetic studies of adiposity in children (n = 35,668), men (n = 152,893), and women (n = 171,977). Results: Longer sleep was cross-sectionally associated with lower BMI z score at ~11 years of age (?0.13 per category, 95% CI: ?0.22 to ?0.04) and at about 11 to 16 years of age longitudinally in girls (?0.39, 95% CI: ?0.66 to ?0.13). Using MR, sleep duration was inversely associated with BMI in children (?0.29 SD per hour, 95% CI: ?0.54 to ?0.04), but was not clearly associated with BMI in adults, particularly for women. Conclusions: A small beneficial effect of sleep on BMI in children cannot be ruled out. ? 2019 The Obesity Society","adolescent; adult; Article; body mass; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; genetic association; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; Mendelian randomization analysis; obesity; observational study; prediction; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; sleep time"
"Cancer cell reprogramming: A promising therapy converting malignancy to benignity",2019,"In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in reprogramming terminally differentiated somatic cells and cancer cells into induced pluripotent cells and cancer cells with benign phenotypes. Recent studies have explored various approaches to induce reprogramming from one cell type to another, including lineage-specific transcription factors-, combinatorial small molecules-, microRNAs-and embryonic microenvironment-derived exosome-mediated reprogramming. These reprogramming approaches have been proven to be technically feasible and versatile to enable re-activation of sequestered epigenetic regions, thus driving fate decisions of differentiated cells. One of the significant utilities of cancer cell reprogramming is the therapeutic potential of retrieving normal cell functions from various malignancies. However, there are several major obstacles to overcome in cancer cell reprogramming before clinical translation, including characterization of reprogramming mechanisms, improvement of reprogramming efficiency and safety, and development of delivery methods. Recently, several insights in reprogramming mechanism have been proposed, and determining progress has been achieved to promote reprogramming efficiency and feasibility, allowing it to emerge as a promising therapy against cancer in the near future. This review aims to discuss recent applications in cancer cell reprogramming, with a focus on the clinical significance and limitations of different reprogramming approaches, while summarizing vital roles played by transcription factors, small molecules, microRNAs and exosomes during the reprogramming process. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cell adhesion molecule; microRNA; transcription factor; transcription factor NANOG; transcription factor Sox; cancer cell; cancer stem cell; cell function; DNA methylation; down regulation; embryonic stem cell; exosome; feasibility study; gene therapy; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; malignant neoplasm; methylation; nuclear reprogramming; pluripotent stem cell; Review"

"Bituminous coal combustion and Xuan Wei Lung cancer: a review of the epidemiology, intervention, carcinogens, and carcinogenesis",2019,"Indoor air pollution from bituminous coal combustion has been linked to the extremely high lung cancer rates of nonsmoking women in Xuan Wei County, Yunnan Province, China. Venting the smoke outdoors by installing chimneys was found to be effective at reducing the lung cancer risk in a cohort study of 21,232 farmers in central Xuan Wei. However, the lung cancer mortality rates in all 1.2?million residents of Xuan Wei have been increasing dramatically over the last four decades. It was higher than that in Yunnan Province and China overall, with significant heterogeneities in the geographic patterns of Xuan Wei. Intervention measures targeting certain types of coal or certain carcinogenic components in coal smoke need to be explored. To inform targeted intervention policies, it is essential to pinpoint the specific substance (particulate matter, organic extract, PAHs, free radicals, crystalline silica, and inorganic matter) that might account for the carcinogenicity of bituminous coal smoke. Exploring the underlying carcinogenesis mechanisms would also contribute to the intervention and control of the lung cancer epidemic in Xuan Wei, China. Here we review the suspected carcinogens and carcinogenesis mechanisms and discuss future research directions towards a better understanding of the etiology of lung cancer in Xuan Wei, China. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bituminous coal; carcinogen; coal; free radical; fuel; iron; organic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; radioactive material; silicate; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; alkylation; cancer epidemiology; cancer susceptibility; carcinogenesis; China; combustion; epigenetics; gene mutation; genetic susceptibility; human; inflammation; lung cancer; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particulate matter; priority journal; radioactivity; Review; toxicology"
"Conditional deletion of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) in urorectal mesenchyme causes mesenchyme apoptosis and urorectal developmental anomalies in mice",2019,"In mammals, urorectal development starts at early embryonic stage, defective urorectal development results in anorectal malformations, which are common congenital developmental defects of the anus and the urethra in newborns. The etiology and embryology of the defects are still largely unknown. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, upon binding to its ligands (Pdgfa-d), mediates intracellular signaling and regulates embryonic development. The expression of Pdgfra is tightly regulated in the developing urorectal mesenchyme, and its dysregulation is associated with urorectal defects in animals with urorectal defects. Knockout of Pdgfra induces early embryo lethality which precludes investigation of Pdgfra in urorectal development. To address the temporal requirement of Pdgfra in urorectal development, we conditionally deleted Pdgfra in Pdgfra-expressing tissues using a tamoxifen inducible Cre-loxP approach in mice, examined the urorectal development in Pdgfra conditional knockout (Pdgfra-cKO) embryos. We showed that conditional deletion of Pdgfra in Pdgfra-expressing tissues at E10-E11 caused cloaca septation defect, anteriorly displaced anus, defective urogenital folds development and abnormal urethra tubularization in both male and female mice. Furthermore, we showed that Pdgfra was required for the survival of urorectal mesenchyme, deletion of Pdgfra caused apoptosis in the peri-cloacal, the peri-urethra and the urorectal septum mesenchyme of Pdgfra-cKO mutants, associated with an induction of p53, Ndrg1 and activation of caspase-3 in Pdgfra-cKO embryos. In conclusion, Pdgfra is required for the development and survival of the urorectal mesenchyme in embryo, dysregulated Pdgfra signaling induced urorectal defects in mice resembling human congenital diseases of anorectal malformations and hypospadias. Perturbation of PDGFRA signaling may contribute to anorectal malformations and hypospadias in human. ? 2018, ADMC Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare.","2 imidazolidinethione; caspase 3; membrane protein; messenger RNA; n myc downregulated gene 1 protein; platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor; protein p53; tamoxifen; unclassified drug; abnormal urethra tubularization; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anorectal malformation; anteriorly displaced anus; apoptosis; Article; cloaca septation defect; controlled study; developmental disorder; down regulation; embryo; embryo development; enzyme activation; female; gene; gene deletion; gene expression; gene knockout; hypospadias; intracellular signaling; lethality; male; mesenchyme; mouse; Ndrg1 gene; nonhuman; Pdgfra gene; priority journal; protein expression; transcription regulation; urinary tract disease"

"Developing a preventive psycho-oncology for a global context. The International Psycho-Oncology Society 2018 Sutherland Award Lecture",2019,"Objective: Growing rates of cancer and survivorship, in situations of severe resource constraints, force a rethink about managing cancer-related psychosocial distress (CRPD). Here, a prevention-oriented natural history of distress is proposed, derived from developments in our understanding of the evolution and decay of CRPD. Methods: The literature indicates that at least four classes or natural histories of CRPD are identifiable. These are described in the context of prevention-oriented activities in psycho-oncology: (1) CRPD in persons with good coping resources, resulting from reaction to the diagnosis and treatment lifestyle disruption, which is largely self-limiting and preferably self-managed; (2) CRPD arising from residual, or late effects of disease or treatment, potentially persistent and debilitating; (3) CRPD in persons with preexisting coping difficulties; and (4) CRPD arising from existential issues such as mortality and fear of recurrence. Results: It is hypothesized that different natural histories of CRPD display different evolution, indicating potential causal processes, treatment priorities, and preventive strategies. In particular, the effective management of residual symptoms is crucial to prevent CRPD chronicity. Optimal patient involvement in treatment decision-making is also required. Conclusions: There is a need to develop methods to differentiate if, early in the illness trajectory, the distressed patient is not able to self-manage the stress of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Not all distressed patients want or need help, and addressing just the CRPD may be inadequate where unresolved residual symptoms prevent renormalization after treatment. Improved doctor-patient communication around treatment decisions is warranted. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer related psychosocial distress; cancer therapy; chronicity; clinical decision making; coping behavior; distress syndrome; doctor patient relationship; fear; human; illness trajectory; lifestyle modification; patient participation; primary prevention; psycho-oncology; secondary prevention; self care; tertiary prevention"
"Rapid and Highly Effective Noninvasive Disinfection by Hybrid Ag/CS@MnO 2 Nanosheets Using Near-Infrared Light",2019,"A bacterial infection on the surface of medical apparatus and instruments as well as artificial implants is threatening human health greatly. Antibiotics and traditional bacterial-killing agents, even silver nanoparticles, can induce bacterial resistance during long-term interaction with bacteria. Hence, rapid surface sterilization and prevention of bacterial infection in the long term are urgent for biomedical devices, especially for artificial implant materials. Herein, a hybridized chitosan (CS), silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and MnO 2 nanosheets coating was designed on the surface of titanium plates, which can ensure the implants a rapid and highly effective antibacterial efficacy of 99.00% against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and 99.25% against Escherichia coli (E. coli) within 20 min of 808 nm near-infrared light (NIR) irradiation. The exogenous NIR irradiation can trigger the MnO 2 nanosheets to produce enough hyperthermia within 10 min, which can combine with a low concentration of prereleased Ag + from the coating to achieve superior antimicrobial efficacy through synergistic effects. In contrast, either prereleased Ag ions or a photothermal effect alone can achieve much lower antibacterial efficiency under the same concentration, i.e., 24.00% and 30.01% for the former and 30.00% and 42.54% for the later toward S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The possible cytotoxicity of coatings could be eliminated owing to the low concentration of AgNPs and chitosan encapsulation. Thus, the novel bifunctional coating Ag/CS@MnO 2 can exhibit great potential in deep site disinfection of Ti implants through the synergy of prereleased Ag ions and a photothermal effect within a short time. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Chitosan; Coatings; Disinfection; Escherichia coli; Infrared devices; Irradiation; Manganese oxide; Metal nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Silver nanoparticles; antibacterial; Antibacterial efficacy; Bacterial infections; Escherichia coli (E. coli); Long-term interaction; Near infrared light; Photothermal therapy; Silver nanoparticles (AgNps); Silver compounds; antiinfective agent; biocompatible coated material; chitosan; manganese derivative; manganese oxide; nanoparticle; oxide; silver; animal; chemistry; disinfection; Escherichia coli; growth, development and aging; infrared radiation; mouse; NIH 3T3 cell line; Staphylococcus aureus; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chitosan; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Disinfection; Escherichia coli; Infrared Rays; Manganese Compounds; Mice; Nanoparticles; NIH 3T3 Cells; Oxides; Silver; Staphylococcus aureus"
"Hippocampal CA2 Lewy pathology is associated with cholinergic degeneration in Parkinson's disease with cognitive decline",2019,"Although the precise neuropathological substrates of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain elusive, it has long been regarded that pathology in the CA2 hippocampal subfield is characteristic of Lewy body dementias, including dementia in PD (PDD). Early non-human primate tracer studies demonstrated connections from the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (nvlDBB, Ch2) to the hippocampus. However, the relationship between Lewy pathology of the CA2 subfield and cholinergic fibres has not been explored. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the burden of pathology in the CA2 subsector of PD cases with varying degrees of cognitive impairment and correlated this with the extent of septohippocampal cholinergic deficit. Hippocampal sections from 67 PD, 34 PD with mild cognitive impairment and 96 PDD cases were immunostained for tau and alpha-synuclein, and the respective pathology burden was assessed semi-quantitatively. In a subset of cases, the degree of CA2 cholinergic depletion was quantified using confocal microscopy and correlated with cholinergic neuronal loss in Ch2. We found that only cases with dementia have a significantly greater Lewy pathology, whereas cholinergic fibre depletion was evident in cases with mild cognitive impairment and this was significantly correlated with loss of cholinergic neurons in Ch2. In addition, multiple antigen immunofluorescence demonstrated colocalisation between cholinergic fibres and alpha-synuclein but not tau pathology. Such specific Lewy pathology targeting the cholinergic system within the CA2 subfield may contribute to the unique memory retrieval deficit seen in patients with Lewy body disorders, as distinct from the memory storage deficit seen in Alzheimer's disease.",""
"Psychometric evaluation of the Chinese version of the Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale",2019,"Given the severe mental health consequences that may ensue after bereavement, it is crucial to better understand malleable cognitive factors that are associated with poorer bereavement outcomes. Grief rumination (i.e., repetitive thinking about the causes and consequences of a loss) is a malleable cognitive process that is concurrently and longitudinally associated with postloss mental health problems. To assess grief rumination, the English and Dutch Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS) were recently developed. The current study examined the reliability and validity of a Chinese version of the UGRS. Three hundred and ninety-three Chinese adults (56% women) bereaved on average 16.88?months ago filled out online questionnaires assessing demographic and loss-related characteristics, grief rumination (UGRS), trait rumination, trait mindfulness, and anxiety, depressive, and prolonged grief symptoms. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that a second-order five-factor hierarchical model provided the most optimal factor structure for the Chinese UGRS. UGRS total scale and subscale scores demonstrated acceptable internal consistency. Grief rumination had a moderate positive association with trait rumination and a low negative association with trait mindfulness, providing convergent and discriminant validity evidence. Test-criterion validity evidence was also provided. UGRS scores could distinguish bereaved groups with different relationships with the deceased. Moreover, grief rumination was associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and prolonged grief even after controlling for demographic and loss-related variables, trait rumination, and trait mindfulness. The Chinese UGRS appears a valid and reliable instrument to assess grief rumination in Chinese bereaved individuals. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; anxiety; article; Chinese; controlled study; discriminant validity; factor analysis; female; grief; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; mindfulness; questionnaire; rumination; China; cognitive rumination; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; translating (language); Adult; China; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Grief; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Rumination, Cognitive; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating"
"Efficacy and safety of naltrexone for amfetamine and methamfetamine use disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials",2019,"Introduction: Amfetamine and methamfetamine abuse remains a prevalent health problem, increasing the burden on healthcare. Naltrexone, a ?-opioid receptor antagonist, has been suggested as a promising treatment for amfetamine and methamfetamine use disorder. Objective: To review the current evidence for the efficacy and safety of naltrexone as a pharmacological treatment for amfetamine and methamfetamine use disorder. The primary outcome was defined as abstinence or reduction of use. Secondary outcomes were, attenuated “positive” subjective effects (e.g., “feel good,” “craving,” etc.) of amfetamine or methamfetamine after naltrexone treatment, adverse events and physiological changes (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate). Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A systematic literature search was conducted on 2 April 2017, and updated on 31 March 2018. Records were retrieved from databases including PubMed, EMBASE Classic plus EMBASE 1980 via Ovid, and the databases were searched using keywords and/or headings: (naltrexone AND amfetamine AND dependence) OR (naltrexone AND amfetamine AND craving) OR (vivitrol AND amfetamine) OR (revia AND amfetamine) OR (naltrexone AND amfetamine) OR (naltrexone AND methamfetamine dependence) OR (naltrexone AND methamfetamine AND craving) OR (vivitrol AND methamfetamine) OR (revia AND methamfetamine) OR (naltrexone AND ice) OR (naltrexone AND crystal meth) OR (naltrexone AND methamfetamine). Studies investigating the effects of naltrexone on amfetamine or methamfetamine use were eligible for inclusion. All studies were rated as low risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for risk of bias. Results: Among 591 identified studies, there were four randomized controlled trials. Two studies investigated the effects of naltrexone on amfetamine use disorder and two on methamfetamine use. Compared to placebo, the abstinence rate was increased significantly (p < 0.05) by naltrexone in one of two amfetamine studies, whereas there was no statistical difference in the only study reporting methamfetamine use. In one out of two amfetamine studies, naltrexone significantly attenuated either craving levels or subjective effects (e.g., “want more,” “like effect”) relative to placebo (p < 0.05). Additionally, only in one of two methamfetamine studies did naltrexone produce a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in craving levels or attenuated subjective effects. Both amfetamine and methamfetamine studies showed good tolerability of naltrexone, with few adverse events seen. Conclusions: There is presently insufficient evidence to support the use of naltrexone in amfetamine and metamfetamine use disorders. There is a compelling need for high-quality studies to further evaluate the potential use of naltrexone. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; amphetamine; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; gamma glutamyltransferase; methamphetamine; naltrexone; placebo; amphetamine; methamphetamine; naltrexone; narcotic antagonist; abstinence; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; amphetamine abuse; amphetamine dependence; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; automutilation; bilirubin blood level; clinical evaluation; controlled drug release; creatinine blood level; dehydration; diastolic blood pressure; drug craving; drug efficacy; drug safety; Embase; fatigue; follow up; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; heart rate; human; hyperglycemia; hypoalbuminemia; hypocalcemia; hypokalemia; injection; injection site pain; injection site pruritus; intention to treat analysis; medical literature; Medline; methamphetamine dependence; monotherapy; nausea; outcome assessment; patient compliance; patient counseling; peripheral edema; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); relapse; Review; risk assessment; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration; upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract disease; urine sampling; amphetamine dependence; treatment outcome; Amphetamine; Amphetamine-Related Disorders; Humans; Methamphetamine; Naltrexone; Narcotic Antagonists; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome"
"A cross sectional study to evaluate the oral health status of children with intellectual disabilities in the National Capital Region of India (Delhi-NCR)",2019,"Background: Children with intellectual disabilities (ID) have usually been reported to have poorer levels of oral hygiene and higher prevalence of dental caries than their compeers. The present study was conducted to assess the status of dental caries and oral hygiene in different categories of institutionalised children with ID (syndromic and non-syndromic) registered in various special schools of Delhi (National Capital Region, India). Methods: The present cross sectional study was conducted on 269 children [52 with cerebral palsy (CP), 35 with Down syndrome (DS), 30 with autism and 152 with non-syndromic intellectual disability] attending nine special schools who were examined for dental caries [Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth index for permanent teeth (DMFT); decayed, missing/indicated for extraction, filled index for primary teeth (dmft) and prevalence of caries] and oral hygiene status [Oral Hygiene Index-simplified (OHI-S)]. The levels of disability were classified according to Stanford Binet scale as severe (IQ???35), moderate (IQ = 36–51) and mild (IQ?=?52–67). Statistical analysis was performed using one way analysis of variance and post hoc test to compare the levels between groups at a significance level of P?<?0.05. Results: Mean DMFT, dmft and OHI-S indices scores for all the children irrespective of the category and the level of ID were 2.12?±?1.95, 0.97?±?1.60 and 2.05?±?1.07, respectively. As the level of ID increased among these children, the mean DMFT index and OHI-S index increased with no significant effect on dmft. However, children with severe ID had higher OHI-S and DMFT scores than children with mild or moderate ID. The dental caries prevalence was 86.53%, 68.57%, 76% and 86.18% in children with CP, DS, autism and non-syndromic intellectual disability, respectively. Conclusions: The level of caries in permanent teeth and oral hygiene deteriorated with the increasing severity of ID as indicated by DMFT and OHI-S scores (severe?>?mild, moderate). However, the level of caries (dmft) was not affected by the level of ID in primary dentition. The prevalence of dental caries was highest among children with CP and least among children with DS. ? 2018 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article; attitude to health; autism; cerebral palsy; child; child behavior; child care; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dental caries; DMFT index; Down syndrome; female; health status; high risk population; human; India; intellectual impairment; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; male; mouth hygiene; risk assessment; Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale"
"Prospective associations of circulating adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein levels with risks of renal outcomes and mortality in type 2 diabetes",2019,"Aims/hypothesis: Elevated circulating adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) levels have been found to correlate with diabetic nephropathy staging in cross-sectional studies. However, it remains unclear whether these higher serum levels reflect a role of AFABP in the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), or simply result from its impaired renal clearance in DKD. Here we investigated prospectively the prognostic importance of serum AFABP level in the development of adverse renal outcomes in a large clinic-based cohort of participants with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Baseline serum AFABP levels were measured in 5454 Chinese participants from the Hong Kong West Diabetes Registry. The association between circulating AFABP levels and incident adverse renal outcomes—defined as a composite endpoint of a sustained 40% decline in eGFR, end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy or kidney transplantation, or renal deaths—was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression analysis. Results: Over a median follow-up of 5?years, 754 of the 5454 participants developed incident adverse renal outcomes. Elevated circulating AFABP levels were independently associated with incident adverse renal outcomes (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.31, 1.57, p < 0.001) after adjustments for conventional risk factors for DKD progression. Importantly, the prognostic role of serum AFABP was independent of the baseline albuminuria status or eGFR levels of the study participants. Conclusions/interpretation: Circulating AFABP levels were predictive of incident adverse renal outcomes, even in participants with relatively well-preserved kidney function at baseline, suggesting its potential to be a useful marker for early risk stratification in DKD. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; C reactive protein; creatinine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; fatty acid binding protein 4; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; fatty acid binding protein; adult; albuminuria; Article; biochemical analysis; China; clinical feature; creatinine blood level; diabetic complication; diabetic nephropathy; end stage renal disease; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; human; ICD-9; kidney transplantation; major clinical study; male; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; prospective study; renal replacement therapy; risk factor; aged; albuminuria; blood; cross-sectional study; diabetic nephropathy; glomerulus filtration rate; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; physiology; proportional hazards model; Adult; Aged; Albuminuria; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies"
"Solid liver tumours with cystic appearance: do they have the same outcome?",2019,"Objective: Paediatric undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (UES) and mesenchymal hamartoma (MH) of liver have similar imaging cystic imaging characteristic but have totally different clinical behaviour. We reviewed ours experience and compared that with the literature. Methods: Our patients' database over the past 25 years and all articles available from PubMed up to December 2016 were searched. Case reports recorded with demographic data, clinical information and investigations were recruited. The diagnosis of all cases had to be confirmed by histopathology. The data was analysed by SPSS 11.0 software. Results: We identified 2 cases each of UES and MH in our centre, and from the literature, there were a total of 219 cases of UES and 138 cases of MH. The age at diagnosis for UES ranged from 1-83 years but 39.73% were between 6-10 years, whereas 65.22% of MH were found at <2 years (range, newborn-73 years). The chief complaint for UES was abdominal distension with or without abdominal pain and 50.81% of them had accompanied systemic symptoms. In contrary, only 9.57% of MH had systemic symptoms. Interestingly, both tumours were more commonly found in the right hepatic lobe. The prognosis of these two entities was quite different, 41/103 (39.81%) of UES died, whereas only 7/110 (6.36%) cases with MH died. UES required additional chemotherapy whereas MH did not. With the limited information, some authors suggested that the ultrasonography findings were better concordant with the histology than computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. 54.9% UES patients' tumour was solid and only 30.36% were cystic. For MH, there was no significant difference in the nature of tumour. Conclusion: Similar imaging appearance and possible pathological overlap between UES and MH makes the initial diagnosis difficult to be established. Surgical biopsy and excision remained mandatory to confirm the diagnosis and to guide the subsequent treatment option. ? 2018, Medcom Limited.

"Application of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) to Study Synaptopathy of Neurodevelopmental Disorders",2019,"Synapses are the basic structural and functional units for information processing and storage in the brain. Their diverse properties and functions ultimately underlie the complexity of human behavior. Proper development and maintenance of synapses are essential for normal functioning of the nervous system. Disruption in synaptogenesis and the consequent alteration in synaptic function have been strongly implicated to cause neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia (SCZ). The introduction of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provides a new path to elucidate disease mechanisms and potential therapies. In this review, we will discuss the advantages and limitations of using hiPSC-derived neurons to study synaptic disorders. Many mutations in genes encoding for proteins that regulate synaptogenesis have been identified in patients with ASDs and SCZ. We use Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3) and Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) as examples to illustrate the promise of using hiPSCs as cellular models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying disease-related synaptopathy. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ankyrin; disrupted in schizophrenia 1 protein; methyl CpG binding protein 2; protein SH3; autism; embryoid body; gene deletion; gene mutation; genetic code; genetic variation; glia cell; human; human cell; induced pluripotent stem cell; nerve cell; nerve cell differentiation; neuropathology; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; schizophrenia; synapse; synaptogenesis"
"Database establishment for the secondary fungal DNA barcode translational elongation factor 1α (TEF1α)",2019,"With new or emerging fungal infections, human and animal fungal pathogens are a growing threat worldwide. Current diagnostic tools are slow, non-specific at the species and subspecies levels, and require specific morphological expertise to accurately identify pathogens from pure cultures. DNA barcodes are easily amplified, universal, short species-specific DNA sequences, which enable rapid identification by comparison with a well-curated reference sequence collection. The primary fungal DNA barcode, ITS region, was introduced in 2012 and is now routinely used in diagnostic laboratories. However, the ITS region only accurately identifies around 75% of all medically relevant fungal species, which has prompted the development of a secondary barcode to increase the resolution power and suitability of DNA barcoding for fungal disease diagnostics. The translational elongation factor 1α (TEF1α) was selected in 2015 as a secondary fungal DNA barcode, but it has not been implemented into practice, due to the absence of a reference database. Here, we have established a quality-controlled reference database for the secondary barcode that together with the ISHAM-ITS database, forms the ISHAM barcode database, available online at http://its.mycologylab.org/. We encourage the mycology community for active contributions. ? 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.","elongation factor 1; fungal DNA; ribosomal spacer DNA; biodiversity; classification; DNA barcoding; factual database; fungus; genetics; procedures; Biodiversity; Databases, Factual; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal Spacer; Fungi; Peptide Elongation Factor 1"
"Esophagogastric Preservation in the Surgical Management of Proximal Esophageal Cancer",2019,"Background: Definitive chemoradiotherapy is offered for most patients with isolated cervical esophageal tumor. Surgery is reserved for locally advanced diseases and salvage for failed chemoradiotherapy. Traditionally, surgery comprises total pharyngolaryngeal esophagectomy and gastric pull-up, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We hereby propose pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy by a transcervical approach, allowing preservation of the esophagus and stomach below, reducing operative morbidity and mortality. Methods: A retrospective review of 31 patients who underwent curative pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy for isolated cervical esophageal tumor at the Department of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2018, was performed. Results: There were 26 male and 5 female patients. Median age was 64.8 years. Seventeen patients underwent definitive surgery. Fourteen patients underwent salvage surgery for failed chemoradiotherapy. Most patients presented with stage III and IV diseases (90.3%). Median length of pharyngoesophageal defect was 14.0 cm (range, 8.0-21.0 cm). Free jejunal flap was used for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction in 77.4%. Eight complications developed in 7 patients (22.6%). There was no in-hospital mortality. Clear radial and longitudinal resection margins were achieved in 96.8%. Median follow-up was 21.5 months. Locoregional recurrence rate was 32.3%. Nine patients died of disease progression (29.0%). Seven died of other causes (22.6%). Median survival was 21.5 months. Overall 2-year survival rate was 36.7%. Conclusions: Transcervical pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy should be considered in patients with isolated cervical esophageal tumors. Pharyngo-laryngo-cervico-esophagectomy allows adequate tumor resection while preserving the esophagus and stomach below. Operative morbidity and mortality outcomes were improved without compromising oncologic control. ? 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","adult; aged; Article; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; disease exacerbation; esophagus; esophagus cancer; esophagus resection; female; follow up; Hong Kong; hospital mortality; human; laryngectomy; male; morbidity; mortality; operation duration; pharyngectomy; priority journal; recurrence risk; retrospective study; stomach; surgical margin; survival rate; trachea resection; treatment failure; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; esophagoscopy; esophagus resection; esophagus tumor; middle aged; procedures; prognosis; salvage therapy; surgery; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chemoradiotherapy; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Esophagoscopy; Esophagus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy; Survival Rate"
"Parental knowledge, attitudes, and practices about vocal hygiene for their children in Chengdu, a city from China",2019,"This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of parents towards vocal hygiene for their children and explore the barriers against implementation of vocal hygiene in Chengdu, a city from mainland China.An online questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes, and practice was available for parents to complete between March 1 and March 31, 2017. The questionnaire included 5 sections, general demographics; knowledge; attitudes; practices and barriers; and expectation. Scores were calculated for each category of knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests between the parents with and without a history of voice disorders. The internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha coefficient. The correlations between vocal hygiene knowledge, attitude, and practice were analyzed using Spearman correlation test.The questionnaire was completed by 1075 parents. There were certain misconceptions in vocal hygiene knowledge among parents, and the parents had higher level knowledge of positive factors than negative factors about vocal hygiene. Attitudes towards vocal hygiene were positive. Practices of vocal hygiene were poor. The most common barriers to implementation of vocal hygiene practices were related to lack of awareness and knowledge for this topic.The level of parental vocal hygiene knowledge, practice, and barriers suggest that carry out vocal hygiene programs extremely urgent for school-aged children and their parents.","adult; attitude to health; child; child parent relation; China; cross-sectional study; female; human; hygiene; male; middle aged; preschool child; psychology; questionnaire; socioeconomics; voice disorder; young adult; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Hygiene; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Voice Disorders; Young Adult"
"West Nile virus infection in horses in Saudi Arabia (in 2013–2015)",2019,"West Nile virus (WNV) is an important emerging zoonotic arbovirus giving rise to clinical syndromes of varying severity in humans and horses. Culex mosquitoes are the main vector. Although WNV has been reported in many countries in the Middle East and Asia, little is known about its prevalence in equine populations in the Arabian Peninsula. We have carried out a serological study on 200 horses to assess WNV infection in the Eastern and Central regions of Saudi Arabia in 2013–2015. Sera were tested for the presence of WNV antibodies in parallel using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit and microneutralization (MN) tests. In comparison with the MN assay used as “gold standard,” we find the ELISA had a sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 80.1%. The prevalence of WNV neutralizing antibody ranged from 5 (17.3%) of 29 sera collected in Riyadh up to 15 (55.6%) of 27 sera collected from Al-Qateef. These findings highlight the need to be aware of the possibility of WNV disease in humans and horses presenting with central nervous system disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ? 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; Article; assay; blood sampling; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Flavivirus infection; gold standard; horse disease; microneutralization test; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; Saudi Arabia; sensitivity and specificity; serology; West Nile virus; animal; blood; Culex; horse; horse disease; immunology; mosquito vector; serodiagnosis; veterinary medicine; virology; West Nile fever; West Nile virus; zoonosis; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Culex; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Horse Diseases; Horses; Mosquito Vectors; Neutralization Tests; Prevalence; Saudi Arabia; Sensitivity and Specificity; West Nile Fever; West Nile virus; Zoonoses"
"Rational use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders",2019,"Autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) refer to a range of conditions characterized by impaired social and communication skills and repetitive behaviors caused by different combinations of genetic and environmental influences. Although the pathophysiology underlying ASD is still unclear, recent evidence suggests that immune dysregulation and neuroinflammation play a role in the etiology of ASD. In particular, there is direct evidence supporting a role for maternal immune activation during prenatal life in neurodevelopmental conditions. Currently, the available options of behavioral therapies and pharmacological and supportive nutritional treatments in ASD are only symptomatic. Given the disturbing rise in the incidence of ASD, and the fact that there is no effective pharmacological therapy for ASD, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess immunomodulatory properties that make them relevant to several diseases associated with inflammation and tissue damage. The paracrine regenerative mechanisms of MSCs are also suggested to be therapeutically beneficial for ASD. Thus the underlying pathology in ASD, including immune system dysregulation and inflammation, represent potential targets for MSC therapy. This review will focus on immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ASD and will further discuss the therapeutic potential for MSCs in mediating ASD-related immunological disorders. ?

"The Gendered Self of Chinese Lesbians: Self-Esteem as a Mediator Between Gender Roles and Depression",2019,"Sexual minority women are at an elevated risk for depression compared to heterosexual women, yet less is known about how gender roles affect the mental health of sexual minority women. Existing studies examining the role of self-esteem in the relationship between gender roles and depression are scarce and have predominantly focused on heterosexual populations. Using a cross-sectional survey of Chinese lesbians in Hong Kong (N = 438), the study tested the direct and indirect effects of different types of gender roles (masculine, feminine, and androgynous) on depression through the mediating factor of self-esteem. We found that masculinity and androgyny were positively associated with self-esteem, while femininity was negatively associated with self-esteem. More importantly, self-esteem fully mediated the inverse relationship between masculinity and depression and that between androgyny and depression. The positive relationship between femininity and depression was also fully mediated by self-esteem. By examining different types of gender roles and incorporating gender roles, self-esteem, and depression into a unified framework, the research highlighted the particularly protective effect of androgyny, which had the strongest positive direct effect on self-esteem and indirect effect on depression through the mediation of self-esteem compared to the effects of other types of gender roles. Our results illuminate the importance of understanding how individual differences in gender roles relate to the mental health of sexual minority women in future research and interventions. Implications for interventions that help Chinese lesbians cope with gender expectations and improve their mental health are discussed. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"HAp@GO drug delivery vehicle with dual-stimuli-triggered drug release property and efficient synergistic therapy function against cancer",2019,"Nanoscale hydroxyapatite (HAp) is an optimal candidate material in biomedical area for its good biocompatibility and bioactivity. In this study, HAp nanorods are prepared via hydrothermal method and combined with monolayered graphene oxide (GO). The obtained HAp@GO with excellent biocompatibility is revealed to have high drug loading capacity (698.7 μg/mg) for anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and efficient photothermal conversion property. And the drug release property of DOX loaded HAp@GO (HAp@GO-DOX) is demonstrated to be controlled by pH and near-infrared light, which is favorable for cancer therapy. in vitro studies on cancer therapy demonstrate that the combined treatment, compared with either chemotherapy or photothermal therapy alone, has better synergistic therapeutic effect.

"Evaluating mortality risk adjustment among children receiving extracorporeal support for respiratory failure",2019,"This study evaluates whether three commonly used pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) severity of illness scores, pediatric risk of mortality score (PRISM) III, pediatric index of mortality (PIM) 2, and pediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD), are the appropriate tools to discriminate mortality risk in children receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for respiratory failure. This study also evaluates the ability of the Pediatric Risk Estimate Score for Children Using Extracorporeal Respiratory Support (Ped-RESCUERS) to discriminate mortality risk in the same population, and whether Ped-RESCUERS' discrimination of mortality is improved by additional clinical and laboratory measures of renal, hepatic, neurologic, and hematologic dysfunction. A multi-institutional retrospective cohort study was conducted on children aged 29 days to 17 years with respiratory failure requiring respiratory ECMO support. Discrimination of mortality was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC); model calibration was measured by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test and Brier score. Admission PRISM-III, PIM-2, and PELOD were found to have poor ability to discriminate mortality with an AUC of 0.56 [0.46-0.66], 0.53 [0.43-0.62], and 0.57 [0.47-0.67], respectively. Alternatively, Ped-RESCUERS performed better with an AUC of 0.68 [0.59-0.77]. Higher alanine aminotransferase, ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen the fraction of inspired oxygen, and lactic acidosis were independently associated with mortality and, when added to Ped-RESCUERS, resulted in an AUC of 0.75 [0.66-0.82]. Admission PRISM-III, PIM-2, and PELOD should not be used for pre-ECMO risk adjustment because they do not discriminate death. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation population-derived scores should be used to risk adjust ECMO populations as opposed to general PICU population-derived scores. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Eternal sunshine of the neuromodulated mind: Altering fear memories through neuromodulation",2019,"Anxiety disorders pose one of the greatest threats to mental health. Modern treatment methods exist but are hindered by relapse, toxicity, and low efficacy. The use of neuromodulation to treat anxiety disorders has shown promising results, yet its underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this review, we make the case for further development of neuromodulation techniques to alter fear memories, with particular regard to future clinical applications in treating anxiety disorders. We start by briefly summarizing the neural circuitry of fear while identifying the pros and cons of possible neuromodulation targets. We then highlight recent advances in neuromodulation techniques that have been used to alter fear memories. Next, we apply a novel network-based approach to elucidate possible mechanisms of neuromodulation which may disrupt the consolidation of fear memory. Finally, we emphasize the need for more systematic neuromodulation studies on animal models and the developing brain. Overall, we aim to provide an integrated framework for future action, identifying key research priorities that must be addressed before effective neuromodulation-based treatments can be developed for practical use. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","anxiety disorder; brain depth stimulation; brain development; clinical practice; cognition; developmental stage; fear; hippocampus; human; memory; nerve cell network; neuromodulation; nonhuman; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; Review; sensory nerve; therapy effect; transcranial magnetic stimulation; treatment outcome; animal; disease model; fear; psychology; reinforcement; transcranial direct current stimulation; Animals; Anxiety Disorders; Deep Brain Stimulation; Disease Models, Animal; Extinction, Psychological; Fear; Humans; Memory; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"
"The effect of antiseptic oral sprays on dental plaque and gingival inflammation: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Objectives: To review the effectiveness of antiseptic oral sprays on oral health. Methods and materials: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of oral sprays to placebo/control spray or mouthrinse on dental plaque and gingival inflammation were included. Results: Among a total of 996 papers, 20 effective studies fulfilled the selection criteria, and 8 studies were suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses. A meta-analysis of three studies using a 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) spray intervention, without prophylaxis at baseline, showed reductions in Plaque Index (PI) (Silness and L?e) and Gingival Index (GI) (Silness and L?e) scores of 0.74 (95% CI: ?1.03 to ?0.45) and 0.22 (95% CI: ?0.38 to ?0.06), respectively. Five studies provided a prophylaxis for subjects before study initiation. Three of these five studies used 0.2% CHX spray. A meta-analysis demonstrated an increase of 0.18 (95% CI: ?0.01 to 0.37) in PI (Silness and L?e) scores. Two RCTs compared 0.12% and 0.2% CHX spray, and a meta-analysis showed increases of 1.71 (95% CI: 1.27 to 2.14) and 1.58 (95% CI: 1.23 to 1.93), respectively, in PI (Quigley and Hein) scores. Of the RCTs not amenable to meta-analysis, eight studies reported significant improvements in PI and GI scores. Conclusions: Available evidence suggests that oral sprays are an acceptable delivery method for antiseptic agents. Further high-quality studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness of alternative chemotherapeutic agents delivered via oral sprays on oral health. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Molecular prevalence and subtyping of Cryptosporidium hominis among captive long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) from Hainan Island, southern China",2019,"Background: Cryptosporidium is an important zoonotic parasite that is commonly found in non-human primates (NHPs). Consequently, there is the potential for transmission of this pathogen from NHPs to humans. However, molecular characterization of the isolates of Cryptosporidium from NHPs remains relatively poor. The aim of the present work was to (i) determine the prevalence; and (ii) perform a genetic characterization of the Cryptosporidium isolated from captive Macaca fascicularis and M. mulatta on Hainan Island in southern China. Methods: A total of 223 fresh fecal samples were collected from captive M. fascicularis (n = 193) and M. mulatta (n = 30). The fecal specimens were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the partial small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. The Cryptosporidium-positive specimens were subtyped by analyzing the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene sequence. Results: Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 5.7% (11/193) of M. fascicularis. All of the 11 Cryptosporidium isolates were identified as C. hominis. Subtyping of nine of these isolates identified four unique gp60 subtypes of C. hominis. These included IaA20R3a (n = 1), IoA17a (n = 1), IoA17b (n = 1), and IiA17 (n = 6). Notably, subtypes IaA20R3a, IoA17a, and IoA17b were novel subtypes which have not been reported previously. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first reported detection of Cryptosporidium in captive M. fascicularis from Hainan Island. The molecular characteristics and subtypes of the isolates here provide novel insights into the genotypic variation in C. hominis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","small subunit ribosomal RNA; adult; Article; China; controlled study; Cryptosporidium hominis; feces analysis; female; gene; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; gp60 gene; Macaca fascicularis; male; nonhuman; parasite prevalence; polymerase chain reaction; rhesus monkey; rRNA gene; animal; classification; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; feces; genetics; genotype; island (geological); isolation and purification; parasitology; phylogeny; prevalence; primate disease; Animals; China; Cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; Feces; Genotype; Islands; Macaca fascicularis; Macaca mulatta; Phylogeny; Prevalence; Primate Diseases"

"The molecular differences between human papillomavirus-positive and -negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: A bioinformatics study",2019,"Objective: To investigate the genetic and epigenetic differences between human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and HPV-negative OPSCC. Methods: Microarray data of HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC were retrieved from NCBI GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified by performing differential expression analysis. A functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore the biological processes and signaling pathways that DEGs and DE-miRNAs were involved in, respectively. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed to identify hub genes. miRNA-target network and miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network were each constructed in order to identify risk-marker miRNAs. An miRNA-target-pathway network was constructed in order to explore the function of identified risk-marker miRNAs. Results: Microarray data from 3 datasets (GSE39366, GSE40774, and GSE55550) was included and analyzed. The PPI network identified 3 hub genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2). MiR-107 and miR-142-3p were found to play the most significant role in both the DE-miRNA-target network as well as in the miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network. MiR-107 was involved in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting many genes (CAV1, CDK6, MYB, and SERPINB5) and regulating the p53 signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the autophagy pathway. In addition, miR-142-3p was implicated in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting the PPFIA1 gene and regulating transcriptional dysregulation and other cancerous pathways. Conclusion: Three genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2), two miRNAs (miR-107 and miR-142-3p), and four pathways (p53, PI3K-Akt, autophagy, and transcription dysregulation in cancer) were identified to play critical roles in distinguishing HPV-positive OPSCC from HPV-negative OPSCC. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","caveolin 1; cyclin dependent kinase 6; microRNA; microRNA 107; microRNA 142 3p; ppfia1 protein; protein Myb; protein p53; rpa2 protein; serpinb5 protein; tumor protein; ubiquitin; ubiquitin D; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; microRNA; MIRN107 microRNA, human; MIRN142 microRNA, human; PPFIA1 protein, human; replication factor A; RPA2 protein, human; signal transducing adaptor protein; UBD protein, human; ubiquitin; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; Article; autophagy; bioinformatics; carcinogenesis; controlled study; down regulation; epigenetics; gene function; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; gene targeting; genetic difference; microarray analysis; molecular pathology; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma; papillomavirus infection; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; transcription regulation; upregulation; Wart virus; biology; gene expression; genetic epigenesis; genetics; human; information processing; metabolism; oropharynx tumor; Papillomaviridae; protein analysis; squamous cell carcinoma; virology; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Computational Biology; Datasets as Topic; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression; Humans; Microarray Analysis; MicroRNAs; Oropharyngeal Neoplasms; Papillomaviridae; Protein Interaction Maps; Replication Protein A; Ubiquitins; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1"
"Fibrosis evolution in chronic hepatitis B e antigen-negative patients across a 10-year interval",2019,"The degree of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection influences outcome and management. Existing data describing the long-term dynamic changes of liver fibrosis are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the evolution of liver fibrosis in CHB across a 10-year period. CHB patients with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography 10?years ago were recruited for follow-up LSM. Fibrosis stages were classified according to EASL-ALEH guidelines. Fibrosis progression/regression was arbitrarily defined as ?1 fibrosis stage change from baseline. A total of 459 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients (224 untreated, 235 treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues [NAs]) were recruited. The mean age at baseline LSM was 41.7?±?9.0?years (56.2% male). Over 10?years, the proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis significantly reduced from 16.3% to 5.7% (P?<?0.001). Fibrosis progression and regression were observed in 8.7% and 37.5%, respectively. No treatment with NAs (OR 2.259, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.032-4.945), metabolic syndrome (OR 4.379, 95% CI: 1.128-16.999) and hepatic steatosis (OR 7.799, 95% CI: 2.271-26.776) was associated with fibrosis progression. Liver stiffness decline demonstrated positive correlation with the time after HBsAg seroclearance (r?=??0.50, P?<?0.001). Median liver stiffness was higher both at baseline (14.0 vs 6?kPa, P?<?0.001) and 10?years (9.1 vs 4.9?kPa, P?<?0.001) in patients with cirrhosis-related complications/hepatocellular carcinoma compared with those without. In conclusion, CHB-related liver fibrosis changed dynamically across 10?years. Metabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis were associated with fibrosis progression, while antiviral therapy was associated with fibrosis regression.

"Global Consultation on Cancer Staging: promoting consistent understanding and use",2019,"Disease burden is the most important determinant of survival in patients with cancer. This domain, reflected by the cancer stage and codified using the tumour-node-metastasis (TNM)?classification, is a fundamental determinant of prognosis. Accurate and consistent tumour?classification is required for the development and use of treatment guidelines and to enable clinical research (including clinical trials), cancer surveillance and control. Furthermore, knowledge of the extent and stage of disease is frequently important in the context of translational studies. Attempts to include additional prognostic factors in staging classifications, in order to facilitate a more accurate determination of prognosis, are often made with a lack of knowledge and understanding and are one of the main causes of the inconsistent use of terms and definitions. This effect has resulted in uncertainty and confusion, thus limiting the utility of the TNM classification. In this Position paper, we provide a consensus on the optimal use and terminology for cancer staging that emerged from a consultation process involving representatives of several major international organizations involved in cancer classification. The consultation involved several steps: a focused literature review; a stakeholder survey; and a consultation meeting. This aim of this Position paper is to provide a consensus that should guide the use of staging terminology and secure the classification of anatomical disease extent as a distinct aspect of cancer classification. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Article; cancer classification; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; consensus development; consultation; health care access; health care planning; health care quality; high risk population; human; international organization; medical terminology; priority journal; social determinants of health; stakeholder engagement; cancer staging; clinical practice; comprehension; consensus; global health; international cooperation; national health organization; neoplasm; nomenclature; oncology; organization and management; pathology; practice guideline; procedures; prognosis; United States; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Comprehension; Consensus; Global Health; Humans; Internationality; Medical Oncology; National Cancer Institute (U.S.); Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prognosis; Terminology as Topic; United States"
"Recognition of aerosol transmission of infectious agents: A commentary",2019,"Although short-range large-droplet transmission is possible for most respiratory infectious agents, deciding on whether the same agent is also airborne has a potentially huge impact on the types (and costs) of infection control interventions that are required. The concept and definition of aerosols is also discussed, as is the concept of large droplet transmission, and airborne transmission which is meant by most authors to be synonymous with aerosol transmission, although some use the term to mean either large droplet or aerosol transmission. However, these terms are often used confusingly when discussing specific infection control interventions for individual pathogens that are accepted to be mostly transmitted by the airborne (aerosol) route (e.g. tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox). It is therefore important to clarify such terminology, where a particular intervention, like the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used, is deemed adequate to intervene for this potential mode of transmission, i.e. at an N95 rather than surgical mask level requirement. With this in mind, this review considers the commonly used term of 'aerosol transmission' in the context of some infectious agents that are well-recognized to be transmissible via the airborne route. It also discusses other agents, like influenza virus, where the potential for airborne transmission is much more dependent on various host, viral and environmental factors, and where its potential for aerosol transmission may be underestimated. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aerosol; air sampling; airborne particle; airflow; ambient air; bacterial transmission; chickenpox; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; Ebolavirus; environmental factor; human; infection control; infectious agent; influenza; Influenza virus; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; smallpox; Smallpox virus; tuberculosis; Varicella zoster virus; virus transmission; disease transmission; infection control; microbiology; prevention and control; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Infection Control"
"Sensing and Data Analysis for Assessing Human Balance Ability",2019,"This paper presents the development of a novel balance sensor capable of assessing human balance ability. This sensor can effectively detect the tread force distribution information under human feet with high resolution and frame rate while they are trying to balance themselves. The principle and performance of the sensor are discussed in the paper. We have used this sensor to capture tread force distribution variation videos from 6 categories of different human balancing actions. A novel 3D convolutional neural network is developed to classify these 6 actions. The high accuracy of video classifications have been achieved using 3D CNN. In addition, our preliminary experimental results demonstrates that applying deep learning method, this sensor is able to recognize different human motion patterns.

Methods: Random telephone surveys of the general Hong Kong population were conducted in April 2009 (1 month before the incident) and June 2009 (1 week after the incident). Stigma was measured with the Link’s Perceived Discrimination-Devaluation Scale (LPDDS). Knowledge about the symptoms, treatment and belief of dangerousness of psychosis were assessed. The emotional reaction of the public to the news was explored, and its effects on knowledge and stigma were studied. Results: Overall, 1016 and 506 participants completed the two surveys. More participants in the post-incident survey agreed that people with psychosis are dangerous to the public (χ 2 = 4.934, p = 0.026). However, no significant differences were observed in the LPDDS scores. Participants who reported a high level of distress related to the news were more likely to perceive people with psychosis as dangerous to the public (χ 2 = 6.738, p = 0.009). Women and older people reported greater distress. Conclusions: These findings suggest that media reporting of violent incidents involving people with schizophrenia increases the public belief in the dangerousness of people with psychosis but not the overall stigma. Further studies of the differential effects of violence reporting on public perceptions about people with psychosis and schizophrenia are warranted. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; attitude to health; female; homicide; Hong Kong; human; male; mass medium; nomenclature; psychology; psychosis; social stigma; Adult; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Homicide; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mass Media; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenic Psychology; Social Stigma; Terminology as Topic"
"Transmission of a novel genotype of hepatitis E virus from Bactrian camels to cynomolgus macaques",2019,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is zoonotic and a major cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. Recently, we identified a novel HEV genotype 8 (HEV8) in Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China. However, the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and zoonotic potential of HEV8 are unclear. Here, we present the prevalence of HEV8 in China and investigate its pathogenicity and cross-species transmission in cynomolgus macaques. Fresh fecal and milk samples from Bactrian camels collected from four provinces/regions in China were screened for HEV RNA by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). An HEV8-positive sample was used to inoculate two cynomolgus macaques to examine the potential for cross-species infection. The pathogenicity of HEV8 was analyzed by testing HEV markers and liver function during the study period and histopathology of liver biopsy specimens at 3, 13, and 25 weeks postinoculation. Extrahepatic replication was tested by using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence assays. The overall prevalence of HEV8 RNA in Chinese Bactrian camels was 1.4% (4/295), and positive samples were found in three different provinces/regions in China. Histopathology confirmed acute and chronic HEV8 infections in the two monkeys. Multiple tissues were positive for HEV RNA and ORF2 proteins. Renal pathology was observed in the monkey with chronic hepatitis. Whole-genome sequencing showed only 1 to 3 mutations in the HEV8 in the fecal samples from the two monkeys compared to that from the camel. HEV8 is circulating in multiple regions in China. Infection of two monkeys with HEV8 induced chronic and systemic infections, demonstrating the high potential zoonotic risk of HEV8. IMPORTANCE It is estimated that one-third of the world population have been exposed to hepatitis E virus (HEV). In developed countries and China, zoonotic HEV strains are responsible for almost all acute and chronic HEV infection cases. It is always of immediate interest to investigate the zoonotic potential of novel HEV strains. In 2016, we discovered a novel HEV genotype, HEV8, in Bactrian camels, but the epidemiology, zoonotic potential, and pathogenicity of the virus were unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that HEV8 was circulating in multiple regions in China and was capable of infecting cynomolgus macaques, a surrogate for humans, posing high risk of zoonosis. Chronic hepatitis, systemic infection, and renal pathology were observed. Collectively, these data indicate that HEV8 exhibits a high potential for zoonotic transmission. Considering the importance of Bactrian camels as livestock animals, risk groups, such as camelid meat and milk consumers, should be screened for HEV8 infection. ? 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

"End-of-Life Health Care Utilization Between Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Lung Cancer Patients",2019,"Context: At the end of life, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC) patients exhibit similar symptoms; however, a large-scale study comparing end-of-life health care utilization between these two groups has not been conducted in East Asia. Objectives: To explore and compare end-of-life resource use during the last six months before death between COPD and LC patients. Methods: Using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in COPD (n = 8640) and LC (n = 3377) patients who died between 1997 and 2013. Results: The COPD decedents were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units (57.59% vs 29.82%), to have longer intensive care unit stays (17.59 vs 9.93 days), and to undergo intensive procedures than the LC decedents during their last six months; they were less likely to receive inpatient (3.32% vs 18.24%) or home-based palliative care (0.84% vs 8.17%) and supportive procedures than the LC decedents during their last six months. The average total medical cost during the last six months was approximately 18.42% higher for the COPD decedents than for the LC decedents. Conclusion: Higher intensive health care resource use, including intensive procedure use, at the end of life suggests a focus on prolonging life in COPD patients; it also indicates an unmet demand for palliative care in these patients. Avoiding potentially inappropriate care and improving end-of-life care quality by providing palliative care to COPD patients are necessary. ? 2019 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","benzodiazepine; hypertensive factor; opiate; adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; Asia; blood transfusion; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; enterostomy; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; gastrostomy; health care cost; health care quality; health care utilization; hemodialysis; home care; hospital patient; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; palliative therapy; parenteral nutrition; retrospective study; symptom; Taiwan; terminal care; total parenteral nutrition; very elderly"
"Motivating diabetic and hypertensive patients to engage in regular physical activity: A multi-component intervention derived from the concept of photovoice",2019,"Aims: A community-based multi-component intervention (increasing awareness of the importance of physical activity in chronic illness management through reading comic books, training regarding warm-up stretching exercises, identifying facilitators and barriers to exercise through photosharing, supporting self-reflection and development of action plans) was developed to promote physical activity (PA) among patients with diabetes and hypertension. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention on health behaviour (walking) and health outcomes. Design: A non-randomized controlled trial with waitlisted control and pre-and post-measures. Setting: Community centres for the elderly. Participants: A total of 204 older adults with diabetes and/or hypertension were recruited. They were assigned to either the intervention group (IG) or waitlisted to the control group (CG). Intervention: Under the supervision of a nurse, six weekly group meetings were arranged in community centres for the elderly in which the participants freely exchanged their views regarding the barriers and facilitators of regular physical activity. Participants were encouraged to take photos in their neighbourhood or at home and brought these photos to share at the group meetings. The photos showed both the barriers and the facilitators to PA. In the last meeting, each participant worked out a plan to perform PA in the coming four weeks. Measures: PA referred to the number of steps taken per day and it was measured by a Garmin Accelerometer at baseline, Week 6 and Week 10. Other measures included the nine-item Self-Efficacy Scale for Exercise–Chinese version (SEE-C), and the 23-item Chinese Barriers to Exercise Scale and Senior Fitness Tests. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) models compared the outcomes over time between IG and CG. Results: A statistically significant difference in the changes in the average number of steps taken daily between the two groups at Week 10 (mean difference = 965.4; 95% confidence interval: 92.2, 1838.6, p = 0.030) was observed, although the difference at Week 6 was non-significant (mean difference = 777.6; 95% confidence interval: ?35.3, 1590.5, p = 0.061). IG participants also showed significant improvements in lower body strength (mean difference = 0.967; 95% confidence interval: 0.029, 1.904, p = 0.043) and lower limb flexibility (mean difference = 2.068; 95% confidence interval: 0.404, 3.731, p = 0.015) at Week 10 compared to CG participants. Conclusion: This multi-component intervention improved the participants’ physical activity level and physical fitness, particularly in lower limb flexibility and body strength. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The mediating roles of social benefits and social influence on the relationships between collectivism, power distance, and influenza vaccination among Hong Kong nurses: A cross-sectional study",2019,"Background: Despite being recommended by many medical organizations, the uptake rates of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers, including nurses, are still unsatisfactory. Considering the impact of cultural values on organizational behaviors, vaccination among nurses may also be influenced by cultural values via their impacts on socially oriented motivation and the acceptance of social influence. Objectives: This study examined whether and in what way two individual-level cultural dimensions, collectivism and power distance, would influence vaccination via social benefits (i.e., self-and-clan protection and community protection) and social influence (i.e., authority advice, and family-and-peer advice), respectively, among nurses. Design: A cross-sectional online survey. Setting: An invitation to participate in the survey was sent to nurses using the contact list of a professional nursing organization in Hong Kong and by personal referrals. Participants: A total of 1386 nurses (mean age = 37.82, SD = 10.36; 89% women) completed the survey. Methods: The survey included instruments on cultural values, perceived social benefits, and social influence, and questions regarding 2-year vaccination records. The mediation model was tested using structural equation modeling with bootstrapped samples. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine whether the mediation paths were different across different levels of demographic factors. Results: The structural paths in the mediation model were different between nurses that had been vaccinated in the past and those who had not. In the adoption model (i.e., for nurses non-vaccinated in the past), the positive effects of collectivism on vaccination were mediated by self-and-clan protection and authority advice, whereas the negative effect of collectivism on vaccination was mediated by community protection. In addition, the positive effect of power distance on vaccination was mediated by authority advice. In the maintenance model (i.e., for nurses vaccinated in the past), except for the positive effect of collectivism on vaccination via authority advice, the other indirect effects were not significant. The direct effect of collectivism on vaccination was negative, whereas the direct effect of power distance on vaccination was positive. Conclusions: Collectivism and power distance may guide how nurses attend to and process social information and subsequently influence their vaccination adoption behaviors. More research is needed to examine how cultural dimensions may influence vaccination maintenance and the applicability of the current findings to other cultures. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adoption; adult; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cultural value; female; Hong Kong; human; human experiment; influenza vaccination; male; nurse; nursing organization; structural equation modeling"
"Saxagliptin suppresses degradation of type II collagen and aggrecan in primary human chondrocytes: a therapeutic implication in osteoarthritis",2019,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health concern for which a reliable non-invasive treatment option has yet to be developed. In the present study, we investigated the effects of saxagliptin, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor, on several important aspects of the pathophysiology of OA using primary human chondrocytes. The results of real-time PCR and ELISA analyses show that saxagliptin treatment significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression of three key cartilage degrading enzymes: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13. The results of western blot confirmed that this decrease in MMP-1, -3, and -13 expression prevented degradation of type II collagen. We also found that saxagliptin significantly inhibited expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS)-4 and ADAMTS-5, which was reflected by markedly decreased degradation of aggrecan. Inhibition of DPP-4 by saxagliptin also reduced oxidative stress in human primary chondrocytes as evidenced by decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased glutathione (GSH) levels. Additionally, the results of western blot analysis show that the effects of saxagliptin are mediated through the p38/IκBα/NF-κB pathway, which is considered an important treatment target for OA. These findings suggest a potential role for saxagliptin as a novel treatment against OA. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Current status and challenges of NRF2 as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic cardiomyopathy",2019,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy is one of the main causes of heart failure and death in patients with diabetes mellitus. Reactive oxygen species produced excessively in diabetes mellitus cause necrosis, apoptosis, ferroptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis of the myocardium as well as impair the cardiac structure and function. It is increasingly clear that oxidative stress is a principal cause of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) activates the transcription of more than 200 genes in the human genome. Most of the proteins translated from these genes possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-ferroptotic, and anti-fibrotic actions. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that NRF2 and its target genes are crucial in preventing high glucose-induced oxidative damage in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Recently, many natural and synthetic activators of NRF2 are shown to possess promising therapeutic effects on diabetic cardiomyopathy in animal models of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Targeting NRF2 signaling by pharmacological entities is a potential approach to ameliorating diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, the persistent high expression of NRF2 in cancer tissues also protects the growth of cancer cells. This “dark side” of NRF2 increases the challenges of using NRF2 activators to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. In addition, some NRF2 activators were found to have off-target effects. In this review, we summarize the current status and challenges of NRF2 as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic cardiomyopathy. ? 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

"Endothelin type B receptor promotes cofilin rod formation and dendritic loss in neurons by inducing oxidative stress and cofilin activation",2019,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neuroactive peptide produced by neurons, reactive astrocytes, and endothelial cells in the brain. Elevated levels of ET-1 have been detected in the post-mortem brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of astrocytic ET-1 exacerbates memory deficits in aged mice or in APPK670/M671 mutant mice. However, the effects of ET-1 on neuronal dysfunction remain elusive. ET-1 has been reported to mediate superoxide formation in the vascular system via NADPH oxidase (NOX) and to regulate the actin cytoskeleton of cancer cell lines via the cofilin pathway. Interestingly, oxidative stress and cofilin activation were both reported to mediate one of the AD histo-pathologies, cofilin rod formation in neurons. This raises the possibility that ET-1 mediates neurodegeneration via oxidative stress– or cofilin activation–driven cofilin rod formation. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to 100 nM ET-1 or to a selective ET type B receptor (ETB) agonist (IRL1620) induces cofilin rod formation in dendrites of primary hippocampal neurons, accompanied by a loss of distal dendrites and a reduction in dendritic length. The 100 nM IRL1620 exposure induced superoxide formation and cofilin activation, which were abolished by pretreatment with a NOX inhibitor (5 M VAS2870). Moreover, IRL1620-induced cofilin rod formation was partially abolished by pretreatment with a calcineurin inhibitor (100 nM FK506), which suppressed cofilin activation. In conclusion, our findings suggest a role for ETB in neurodegeneration by promoting cofilin rod formation and dendritic loss via NOX-driven superoxide formation and cofilin activation. ? 2019 Tam et al.","Cell culture; Chemical activation; Endothelial cells; Mammals; Oxidative stress; Proteins; Actin cytoskeleton; Calcineurin inhibitors; Cancer cell lines; Neurodegeneration; Neuronal dysfunction; Over-expression; Primary hippocampal neurons; Vascular system; Neurons; calcineurin; calcineurin inhibitor; cofilin; endothelin B receptor; endothelin B receptor agonist; enzyme inhibitor; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; succinylendothelin 1 [8-21][9 glutamic acid 11,15 alanine]; tacrolimus; unclassified drug; vas 2870; animal cell; Article; brain nerve cell; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dendrite; embryo; exposure; hippocampus; mouse; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein function"
"Risk of HBV reactivation in patients with B-cell lymphomas receiving obinutuzumab or rituximab immunochemotherapy",2019,"Risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation was assessed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients with resolved HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody positive) who received obinutuzumab- or rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy in the phase 3 GOYA and GALLIUM studies. HBV DNA monitoring was undertaken monthly to 1 year after the last dose of study drug. In case of HBV reactivation (confirmed, HBV DNA ?29 IU/mL), immunochemotherapy was withheld and nucleos(t)ide analog treatment (preemptive NAT) started. Immunochemotherapy was restarted if HBV DNA became undetectable or reactivation was not confirmed, and discontinued if HBV DNA exceeded 100 IU/mL on NAT. Prophylactic NAT was allowed by investigator discretion. Among 326 patients with resolved HBV infection, 27 (8.2%) had HBV reactivation, occurring a median of 125 days (interquartile range, 85-331 days) after the first dose. In 232 patients without prophylactic NAT, 25 (10.8%) had HBV reactivation; all received preemptive NAT. Ninety-four patients received prophylactic NAT; 2 (2.1%) had HBV reactivation. No patients developed HBV-related hepatitis. On multivariate Cox analysis, detectable HBV DNA at baseline was strongly associated with an increased risk of reactivation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 18.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.04-54.93; P < .0001). Prophylactic NAT was strongly associated with a reduced risk (adjusted HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.41; P 5 .0018). HBV DNA monitoring–guided preemptive NAT was effective in preventing HBV-related hepatitis during anti–CD20-containing immunochemotherapy in B-cell NHL patients with resolved HBV infection. Antiviral prophylaxis was also effective and may be appropriate for high-risk patients. These trials were registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01287741 (GOYA) and NCT01332968 (GALLIUM). ? 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.","adefovir; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; lamivudine; obinutuzumab; rituximab; tenofovir; virus DNA; antivirus agent; immunological antineoplastic agent; monoclonal antibody; obinutuzumab; rituximab; virus DNA; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; B cell lymphoma; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; clinical feature; controlled study; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; disease course; electrocorticography; female; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; open study; patient monitoring; patient safety; priority journal; prophylaxis; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; very elderly; virus reactivation; B cell lymphoma; chemically induced; clinical trial; drug effect; follow up; genetics; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; immunology; immunotherapy; middle aged; phase 3 clinical trial; prognosis; prospective study; virology; virus activation; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Antiviral Agents; DNA, Viral; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Immunotherapy; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Rituximab; Virus Activation"
"Effect of Kinesio taping on Y-balance test performance and the associated leg muscle activation patterns in children with developmental coordination disorder: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have leg muscular deficits which negatively affects their dynamic postural stability. Kinesio tape (KT) could enhance muscle activation, postural control and functional activities in healthy individuals. Therefore, we hypothesized that the usage of KT may address the postural instability problem of children with DCD. Research question: To investigate the immediate effect of KT on dynamic postural stability and the associated lower limb muscle activity in children with DCD. Methods: Forty-nine children with DCD were recruited where twenty-five children were randomly assigned to the KT group (mean age = 8.18 ± 1.16 years) and twenty-four to the control group (mean age = 8.06 ± 0.93 years). KT group received KT application to the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius muscles whereas the control group received no intervention. Measurements were taken before and after the application of KT. Dynamic balance performance was measured using a lower quartile Y-balance test (YBT-LQ). Leg muscle peak activation and time-to-peak muscle activation of the dominant lower limb during YBT-LQ were measured by surface electromyography. Results: YBT-LQ composite score increased by 6.3% in the KT group at posttest (95% CI: -7.308, -2.480). In addition, a higher rectus femoris peak activation was illustrated for YBT-LQ anterior (32.5%; 95% CI: -48.619, -16.395) and posteromedial (24.6%; 95% CI: -42.631, -6.591) reach directions from pretest values in the KT group. Moreover, KT group exhibited a 38% (95% CI: 0.015, 2.983) longer gastrocnemius medialis time-to-peak duration for YBT-LQ posteromedial reach direction when compared to the control group. Significance: KT revealed an immediate beneficial effect on YBT-LQ performance. Application of KT also increased rectus femoris peak activation and lengthened the muscle time-to-peak duration for specific reach directions. Incorporating KT as an adjunct with dynamic balance training programme could be beneficial for children with DCD. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article; biceps femoris muscle; biomechanics; body equilibrium; child; clinical article; controlled study; developmental coordination disorder; electromyography; female; gastrocnemius muscle; human; kinesiology; leg length; leg muscle; male; maximal voluntary isometric contraction; Movement Assessment Battery for Children; muscle contraction; muscle isometric contraction; pediatric rehabilitation; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; rectus femoris muscle; task performance; tibial tuberosity; tibialis anterior muscle; vastus medialis muscle; athletic tape; body equilibrium; lower limb; muscle contraction; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychomotor disorder; skeletal muscle; Athletic Tape; Child; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Motor Skills Disorders; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance"
"Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: a review of the current evidence",2019,"Gastric cancer remains one of the leading cancers in the world with a high mortality, particularly in East Asia. Helicobacter pylori infection accounts for the majority of the noncardia gastric cancers by triggering gastric inflammation and subsequent neoplastic progression. Eradication of H. pylori can reduce, but not totally eliminate, subsequent risk of developing gastric cancer. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. With their profound gastric-acid suppression, there are concerns about a possible carcinogenic role in gastric cancer, due to induced hypergastrinemia, gastric atrophy and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. While randomized clinical trials to establish causality between long-term PPI use and gastric cancer are lacking, current evidence based on observational studies suggests PPIs are associated with an increased gastric cancer risk. However, opinions on causality remain divergent due to unmeasured and possible residual confounding in various studies. Our recent study has showed that even after H. pylori eradication, long-term PPI use is still associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer by more than twofold. Hence, long-term PPIs should be used judiciously after considering individual’s risk–benefit profile, particularly among those with history of H. pylori infection. Further well-designed prospective studies are warranted to confirm the potential role of PPIs in gastric cancer according to baseline gastric histology and its interaction with other chemopreventive agents like aspirin, statins and metformin. ?

"Ultrafine particle emissions from a smouldering cigarette in a residence and its associated lung cancer risk",2019,"After smoking bans were enforced in most public spaces, residences became the major places for exposure to second-hand smoke. Since cigarette smoke contains mainly submicron and ultrafine particles (UFPs), the harmful effects of the particles in cigarette smoke might be correlated more with number and surface area concentrations of UFPs instead of their mass concentration. To assess these harmful effects, we investigated the size distribution of particles (20 nm to 600 nm) released from sidestream smoke. An experiment was carried out in a two-zone house which was divided into smoking and non-smoking areas. Particle concentrations were measured in both zones and the exposure doses of people in both zones were calculated. The lung cancer risk of UFPs was then analysed by a modified surface area-based risk assessment scheme, which was found to be much closer to the incidence rate of lung cancer. In most of the studied scenarios, the excess lifetime cancer risks to non-smoker occupants exceeded an acceptable level. Although closing a door separating the two zones is a common isolation measure, adequate protection for the non-smokers cannot be achieved unless sufficient ventilation in the smoking zone is provided. ?

"Adolescent Mental Health Problems in Hong Kong: A Critical Review on Prevalence, Psychosocial Correlates, and Prevention",2019,"Purpose: Adolescent mental health problems are a public health issue in Hong Kong and a review of the situation can have implications for intervention and prevention. This paper aims to review the available prevalence rates of mental health problems among adolescents in Hong Kong and examines the correlates of these conditions through a positive youth development (PYD) framework. Methods: Local studies published in English between January 1995 and September 2017 were searched in ERIC, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, and PubMed. Data were selected and extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was the prevalence or the scores of mental health problems among adolescents. The secondary outcome was the correlates associated with the problems identified in the studies. Results: Twenty-three studies were identified. The prevalence of depression was between 0.55% and 2.2% (three studies), whereas the prevalence for anxiety (one study) and generalized anxiety disorder (two studies) were 6.9% and 2.6%, respectively. Comparatively higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower levels of general mental health among Hong Kong adolescents than adolescents in other regions. The protective factors examined in these studies were categorized into PYD constructs, namely: cognitive competence, behavioral competence, emotional competence, resilience, and bonding with family, which were associated with better mental health. Conclusions: This review contends that future mental health research and intervention for adolescents should focus more on PYD constructs and family factors. ? 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","adolescent disease; Beck Depression Inventory; cognition; competence; depression; emotional competence; generalized anxiety disorder; Hong Kong; human; mental disease; prevalence; priority journal; prophylaxis; psychological resilience; psychosocial care; quality of life; Review; social support; systematic review"

"Anti-M?llerian Hormone in PCOS: A Review Informing International Guidelines",2019,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 8–13% of women. The Rotterdam diagnostic criteria include polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound, but given recognized challenges, serum anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) is proposed as an alternative. To inform international PCOS guidelines, a systematic review was completed. Key identified gaps include large international studies in well-defined populations across the lifespan, clustering of AMH with PCOS features, relationships to long-term health outcomes, and improved quality, assay standardization, and sample handling, all needed to determine cut offs. Here we identify research priorities to address these gaps and enhance AMH utility in PCOS. Once issues are addressed, AMH levels could replace more costly and less accessible ultrasound in PCOS diagnosis. ? 2019","Muellerian inhibiting factor; transforming growth factor beta; body mass; conformational transition; diagnostic accuracy; granulosa cell; human; hyperandrogenism; meta analysis; obesity; ovary follicle; ovary follicle development; ovary insufficiency; ovary polycystic disease; pathogenesis; priority journal; Review; systematic review"
"Non-surgical treatment of knee osteoarthritis",2019,"Knee osteoarthritis is one of the most common degenerative diseases causing disability in elderly patients. Osteoarthritis is an increasing problem for ageing populations, such as that in Hong Kong. It is important for guidelines to be kept up to date with the best evidence-based osteoarthritis management practices available. The aim of this study was to review the current literature and international guidelines on non-surgical treatments for knee osteoarthritis and compared these with the current guidelines in Hong Kong, which were proposed in 2005. Internationally, exercise programmes for non-surgical management of osteoarthritis have been proven effective, and a pilot programme in Hong Kong for comprehensive non-surgical knee osteoarthritis management has been successful. Long-term studies on the effectiveness of such exercise programmes are required, to inform future changes to guidelines on osteoarthritis management. ? 2019 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.

"Biculturalism in couple support for diabetes care in U.S.-born Chinese Americans",2019,"Support in couples living with type 2 diabetes is associated with better health outcomes but support provision in collectivistic cultures has received limited research attention. To address this gap, we focused on couple dynamics and support in type 2 diabetes in U.S.-born Chinese Americans. Acculturation processes, particularly biculturalism, that is, the capacity to enact habits and practices from both the heritage and U.S. mainstream culture, were explored. Employing interpretive phenomenological methods, we conducted multiple narrative interviews with each of 15 couples regarding illness challenges and couple responses. Interviews were conducted in varied contexts, including with the couple, and in group interviews with people with diabetes or spouses. The unit of analysis was the couple, and narrative themes within the text were explored within the context of holistic couple summaries. We identified three key aspects of couple support: (i) Assisting with the diabetes treatment regimen; (ii) Moderating social and contextual factors that impede diabetes care; and (iii) Providing relational care and empathy for living with this challenging chronic condition. Support reflecting cultural maintenance of Chinese beliefs and practices include other directedness, family centeredness, and concerns for harmony and balance. Bicultural support patterns were also apparent in spousal communication that was both indirect and direct, and relationships marked by both interdependence and respect for independence or autonomy, reflecting both Chinese and U.S. cultural orientations, respectively. Working clinically with second and third generation Chinese immigrants requires clinical assessment of and responsiveness to couples’ acculturation levels and bicultural skills. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; Asian American; coping behavior; cultural factor; ethnology; family; female; human; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; psychology; socioeconomics; spouse; verbal communication; Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Asian Americans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Narration; Socioeconomic Factors; Spouses"
"Radiotherapy toxicity",2019,"Radiotherapy is used in >50% of patients with cancer, both for curative and palliative purposes. Radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation to target and kill tumour tissue, but normal tissue can also be damaged, leading to toxicity. Modern and precise radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, may prevent toxicity, but some patients still experience adverse effects. The physiopathology of toxicity is dependent on many parameters, such as the location of irradiation or the functional status of organs at risk. Knowledge of the mechanisms leads to a more rational approach for controlling radiotherapy toxicity, which may result in improved symptom control and quality of life for patients. This improved quality of life is particularly important in paediatric patients, who may live for many years with the long-term effects of radiotherapy. Notably, signs and symptoms occurring after radiotherapy may not be due to the treatment but to an exacerbation of existing conditions or to the development of new diseases. Although differential diagnosis may be difficult, it has important consequences for patients. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","adult disease; Article; brain injury; cancer radiotherapy; childhood cancer; differential diagnosis; DNA damage response; follow up; functional status; human; inflammation; intensity modulated radiation therapy; lung injury; lung toxicity; malignant neoplasm; mucosa inflammation; organs at risk; pathophysiology; priority journal; quality of life; radiation injury; rectum injury; screening; skin toxicity; tissue injury; adverse event; epithelium cell; lung; lymph node; neoplasm; procedures; psychology; radiation exposure; radiation injury; radiation response; radiotherapy; x-ray computed tomography; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Lung; Lymph Nodes; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Radiation Exposure; Radiation Injuries; Radiotherapy; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"An integrative model of internalized stigma and recovery-related outcomes among people diagnosed with schizophrenia in rural China",2019,"Purpose: Internalized stigma, an adverse psychological process, severely impedes the lives of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and restricts them from social integration and recovery. The aim of this study was to empirically evaluate an integrative model of relationship between internalized stigma and patients’ recovery-related outcomes among people diagnosed with schizophrenia in a rural Chinese community. Method: A total of 232 people diagnosed with schizophrenia in Xinjin, Chengdu, participated in this study and completed measures of internalized stigma, social interaction, perceived social support, social functioning, and symptoms. The internalized stigma of mental illness scale (ISMI) was used to measure the internalized stigma. Path analysis was used to test the association between internalized stigma and recovery-related outcomes. Results: There were no significant differences in mean scores of ISMI by gender, age (18–64?years and ? 65?years), education, marital status, or economic capacity. Internalized stigma was negatively associated with perceived social support and social interaction. Furthermore, higher level of internalized stigma was associated with impaired social functioning, and a lower level of social functioning was significantly associated with more severe symptoms. Conclusion: Internalized stigma is associated with poor social interaction and weakened perceived social support in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, and is linked negatively to outcomes in their recovery. It is essential to tailor interventions related to reducing internalized stigma within a Chinese context and evaluate the effectiveness of anti-stigma intervention on recovery for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; China; female; human; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; psychology; rural population; schizophrenia; self concept; social stigma; Adult; China; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Rural Population; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Self Concept; Social Stigma"
"Stakeholder concerns of air pollution in Hong Kong and policy implications: A big-data computational text analysis approach",2019,"Stakeholder engagement is critical to the successful formulation and implementation of environmental policies. Text analysis can serve as an important means to decipher stakeholder (dis)agreements. Traditionally, researchers analyze texts using qualitative text analysis. Relying only on qualitative text analysis can no longer be sufficient to handle very large amounts of textual data. Now computational methods can be applied to help extract opinions in electronic texts. Our paper adopts a big data computational text analysis approach (keyword analysis, keyword co-occurrence, thematic analysis), based on a corpus of 2.4 million words, to compare concerns towards air pollution among three stakeholder groups (i.e. the government (GOV), the environmental groups (NGO) and the news media (MEDIA)) in Hong Kong, between 2002 and 2012, a period when air pollution was subject to rigorous policy debates and discussions. Our analysis shows the somewhat different concerns of the stakeholders. The stakeholders focus heavily on emissions and end-of-pipe pollution control. Though the advocation of sustainability since 1990s, the government-led command-and-control approach still dictates the discourse. Sustainability is featured more intensively by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Transboundary pollution (e.g. from Guangdong, China) is not a major concern for all stakeholder groups. Public health is a greater concern in MEDIA, as compared to the other two stakeholder groups. Future air pollution policy-making may direct more of its attention to the pressing concerns over the negative impacts of air pollution on health and its associated costs, with health experts getting more closely involved in the regulatory decision-makings. More information should be given to vulnerable groups, such as young children or workers in polluted environments. To better relate differential health risks of pollution in everyday life, both local and international governments should consider developing more personalized air pollution monitoring and health management systems for their citizens in future. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","air pollution; article; attention; big data; child; decision making; government; health care management; health hazard; Hong Kong; human; monitoring; pollution control; public health; thematic analysis; worker"
"A Territory-wide, Multicenter, Age- and Prostate-specific Antigen-matched Study Comparing Chemohormonal Therapy and Hormonal Therapy Alone in Chinese Men With Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer",2019,"Background: There is a lack of real-world data regarding the treatment outcomes of chemohormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone in Chinese men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Patients and Methods: We conducted a territory-wide, multicenter, age- and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-matched cohort study comparing chemohormonal therapy and hormonal therapy alone in Chinese men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Patient and disease characteristics were reviewed. The primary outcome was PSA progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included clinical progression-free survival and castration resistance-free survival. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: From January 2015 to July 2016, 32 Chinese men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were treated with chemohormonal therapy, and they were matched to 32 Chinese men who were treated with hormonal therapy alone. Patient and disease characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The chemohormonal therapy group had a significantly better PSA progression-free survival (P =.001) and castration resistance-free survival (P =.002) than the hormonal therapy group. There was no significant difference in the clinical progression-free survival between the 2 groups. Upon multivariate Cox regression analyses, the use of chemohormonal therapy was significantly associated with a longer time to PSA progression (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.73; P =.008) and a longer time to castration resistance (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.83; P =.015), but was not associated with clinical progression. Conclusions: The use of chemohormonal therapy could prevent PSA progression and the development of castration resistance when compared with hormonal therapy alone in Chinese men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostatic cancer. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.We conducted a territory-wide, multicenter, age- and prostate-specific antigen-matched cohort study comparing chemohormonal therapy and hormonal therapy alone in Chinese men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

"Grit is Associated with Lower Depression via Meaning in Life among Filipino High School Students",2019,"Grit—passion and perseverance for long-term goals—has been linked to a wide array of positive academic and psychological outcomes. However, limited research has been conducted to explore the association of grit with different indicators of well-being and psychological health. The primary objective of this study was to assess the associations among grit, meaning in life, and depression. There were 447 Filipino high school students who participated in the study. Results of structural equation modeling showed that grit was linked to higher levels of meaning in life dimensions (i.e., presence of meaning and search for meaning in life) and presence of meaning was associated with lower depression. Bias-corrected bootstrapping revealed that grit had an indirect negative influence on depression through the intermediate variable—presence of meaning in life. Theoretical and practical implications are elucidated. ?

"A longitudinal study on the prevalence and risk factors for depression and anxiety, quality of life, and clinical outcomes in incident peritoneal dialysis patients",2019,"? Background: Starting dialysis is an important life event. The prevalence and evolution of psychological symptoms at commencement of long-term dialysis is unclear. We examined the prevalence of and risk factors for depression and anxiety, and the quality of life (QOL) of incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and also the change of these parameters in the first year of PD in relation to clinical outcomes under the PD-first policy. ?? Methods: All patients commencing long-term PD from March 2011 to April 2015 were asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form questionnaire. Patient demographics and the incidence of hospitalization, peritonitis, exit-site infection, and all-cause mortality were studied. The HADS was repeated after 9 – 12 months. ?? Results: A high depression score was present in 39.6% of 191 patients at commencement of PD and was more common in diabetes patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 – 3.81). A high anxiety score was present in 23.6%, and the risk factors included younger age (OR 0.96 per year, 95% CI 0.94 – 0.99) and diabetes (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.20 – 5.57). Both high depression and anxiety scores were associated with an inferior QOL, overall and across most QOL domains. Depression and anxiety symptoms did not change in the first year of PD and were not associated with short-term clinical outcomes. ?? Conclusions: High depression and anxiety scores were prevalent in incident PD patients where PD-first policy is adopted and were associated with inferior QOL. There was no improvement after 1 year of PD. The impact of strategic interventions targeting patient groups at risk such as those with diabetes or of younger age warrants further investigation. ? 2019 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis.","albumin; hemoglobin; adult; all cause mortality; anxiety disorder; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical outcome; depression; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; genetic disorder; glomerulonephritis; glomerulus filtration rate; Hamilton Anxiety Scale; health care system; hemodialysis; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; hospitalization; human; kidney polycystic disease; kidney transplantation; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; nephrosclerosis; peritoneal dialysis; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; risk factor; Short Form 36; aged; anxiety; chronic kidney failure; depression; Hong Kong; mortality; peritoneal dialysis; prevalence; psychology; quality of life; risk factor; survival analysis; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Depression; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Peritoneal Dialysis; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survival Analysis"
"Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers in Surface Soils from the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve, China: Occurrence, Sources, and Potential Risk",2019,"A total of 39 lower brominated PBDE congeners in surface soils from the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve (YRDNR) were analyzed in the present study. The total concentrations of PBDEs (ΣPBDEs) ranged from “not detected” to 0.732?ng?g?1, with a mean concentration of 0.142?ng?g?1. The concentrations of the ΣPBDEs displayed no correlation with the content of the total organic carbon in the YRDNR. The ΣPBDEs concentrations in the Experimental Area were significantly higher than that of the Buffer Area and Core Area, and ΣPBDEs in soils in the North were lower than that of the South. PentaBDEs and HexaBDEs were the most abundant homologues, and the occurrence of PBDEs in the YRDNR may be attributed to the debromination and long range transport of DecaBDEs. Even though the cancer risk and mass inventory of PBDEs in the present study area were estimated to be very low, due to the widespread presence of PBDEs and the particularity of the natural reserve, vigilance should not be let up on the issue of environmental contamination caused by these compounds despite the gradual phase out of their commercial products in the world. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","polybrominated diphenyl ether; carcinogen; diphenyl ether derivative; flame retardant; cancer; concentration (composition); emission inventory; environmental fate; long range transport; PBDE; risk assessment; total organic carbon; cancer risk; China; contamination; debromination; electric potential; environmental protection; health hazard; human activities; inhalation; lifespan; method detection limit; priority journal; quality control; river; surface soil; total organic carbon; analysis; environmental monitoring; human; risk assessment; soil pollutant; toxicity; China; Shandong; Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve; Carcinogens, Environmental; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants"
"Distribution and Functional Implication of Secretin in Multiple Brain Regions",2019,"Secretin is a polypeptide hormone initially identified for its gastrointestinal functions. However, emerging evidences show wide distribution of secretin and secretin receptor across various brain regions from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus to cerebellum. In this mini review, we will firstly describe the region-specific expression pattern of secretin and secretin receptor in the brain, followed by a summary of central physiological and neurological functions mediated by secretin. Using genetic manipulation and pharmaceutical approaches, one can elucidate the role of secretin in mediating various neurological functions from simple behaviors, such as water and food intake, to more complex functions including emotion, motor, and learning or memory. At last, current weakness and future perspectives of secretin in the central nervous system will be discussed, aiming to provide the potency of using secretin or its analog for treating various neurological disorders. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","secretin; secretin; Article; behavior control; brain function; brain region; central nervous system; cerebellum; cognition; emotion; emotional stability; fluid intake; food intake; genetic manipulation; human; hypothalamus; immunoreactivity; motor activity; motor control; motor learning; neurologic disease; neuromodulation; pharmaceutical care; physiological process; protein expression; social status; animal; genetics; metabolism; movement (physiology); physiology; sensorimotor cortex; Animals; Cerebellum; Cognition; Emotions; Humans; Hypothalamus; Movement; Secretin; Sensorimotor Cortex"
"Sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer - effects on surgical outcomes and chemotherapy",2019,"Sarcopenia is found in up to 65% of pancreatic cancer patients. The definition and diagnostic methods for sarcopenia have changed over the years, and the measurement of skeletal muscle mass with cross-sectional imaging has become the most popular way of assessment, although the parameters measured vary among different studies. It is still debatable that there is an association between sarcopenia and postoperative pancreatic fistula, but most studies showed a higher risk in patients with sarcopenic obesity. Long-term survival is worse in sarcopenic patients, as shown by meta-analysis. Sarcopenia is also associated with decreased survival and higher toxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy, and chemotherapy also tends to potentiate sarcopenia. Treatment for sarcopenia still remains an area for research, although oral supplements, nutritional modifications and exercise training have been shown to improve sarcopenia. ?

"miR-137 mediates the functional link between c-Myc and EZH2 that regulates cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer",2019,"Platinum drugs are used in first-line to treat ovarian cancer, but most of the patients eventually generate resistance after treatment with these drugs. Although both c-Myc and EZH2 have been implicated in regulating cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, the interplay between these two regulators is poorly understood. Using RNA sequence analysis (RNA-seq), for the first time we find that miR-137 level is extremely low in cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells, correlating with higher levels of c-Myc and EZH2 expression. Further analyses indicate that in resistant cells c-Myc enhances the expression of EZH2 by directly suppressing miR-137 that targets EZH2 mRNA, and increased expression of EZH2 activates cellular survival pathways, resulting in the resistance to cisplatin. Inhibition of c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway re-sensitizes resistant cells to cisplatin. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses indicate that cisplatin treatment activates c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway. Importantly, elevated c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway in resistant cells is sustained by dual oxidase maturation factor 1 (DUOXA1)-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Significantly, clinical studies further confirm the activated c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway in platinum drug-resistant or recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Thus, our studies elucidate a novel role of miR-137 in regulating c-Myc-EZH2 axis that is crucial to the regulation of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","cisplatin; dual oxidase maturation factor 1; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 137; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; Myc protein; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; oxidoreductase; protein bcl xl; protein kinase B; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor EZH2; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; EZH2 protein, human; fusion protein; microRNA; MIRN137 microRNA, human; Myc protein; MYC protein, human; RNA; transcription factor EZH2; tumor protein; animal experiment; animal model; Article; c Myc miR 137 EZH2 signaling pathway; cancer resistance; cell proliferation assay; cell survival; chromatin immunoprecipitation; clonogenic assay; controlled study; correlation analysis; down regulation; ectopic expression; enzyme phosphorylation; EZH2 gene; female; gene expression; gene expression level; gene overexpression; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene c myc; ovary cancer; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; progression free survival; promoter region; quantitative analysis; RNA sequence; signal transduction; survival rate; upregulation; Western blotting; antagonists and inhibitors; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; ovary tumor; physiology; sequence analysis; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Proteins; Ovarian Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; RNA, Neoplasm; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction"
"How did Ebola information spread on twitter: Broadcasting or viral spreading?",2019,"Background: Information and emotions towards public health issues could spread widely through online social networks. Although aggregate metrics on the volume of information diffusion are available, we know little about how information spreads on online social networks. Health information could be transmitted from one to many (i.e. broadcasting) or from a chain of individual to individual (i.e. viral spreading). The aim of this study is to examine the spreading pattern of Ebola information on Twitter and identify influential users regarding Ebola messages. Methods: Our data was purchased from GNIP. We obtained all Ebola-related tweets posted globally from March 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015. We reconstructed Ebola-related retweeting paths based on Twitter content and the follower-followee relationships. Social network analysis was performed to investigate retweeting patterns. In addition to describing the diffusion structures, we classify users in the network into four categories (i.e., influential user, hidden influential user, disseminator, common user) based on following and retweeting patterns. Results: On average, 91% of the retweets were directly retweeted from the initial message. Moreover, 47.5% of the retweeting paths of the original tweets had a depth of 1 (i.e., from the seed user to its immediate followers). These observations suggested that the broadcasting was more pervasive than viral spreading. We found that influential users and hidden influential users triggered more retweets than disseminators and common users. Disseminators and common users relied more on the viral model for spreading information beyond their immediate followers via influential and hidden influential users. Conclusions: Broadcasting was the dominant mechanism of information diffusion of a major health event on Twitter. It suggests that public health communicators can work beneficially with influential and hidden influential users to get the message across, because influential and hidden influential users can reach more people that are not following the public health Twitter accounts. Although both influential users and hidden influential users can trigger many retweets, recognizing and using the hidden influential users as the source of information could potentially be a cost-effective communication strategy for public health promotion. However, challenges remain due to uncertain credibility of these hidden influential users. ? 2019 The Author(s).","article; diffusion; human; human experiment; plant seed; public health; social media; social network; telecommunication; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; information dissemination; procedures; social media; statistics and numerical data; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Information Dissemination; Online Social Networking; Social Media"
"Patterns of care and treatment outcomes for local recurrence of NPC after definite IMRT—A study by the HKNPCSG",2019,"Background: This study evaluates the contemporary care for patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma after failure of the primary course of intensity modulated radiotherapy. Methods: Eligible patients were identified through the Hong Kong Cancer Registry database. Patterns of care and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: Two hundred seventy-two patients with locally recurrent tumors were identified. Of them, 30.9% received surgery, whereas 35.7% received re-irradiation (re-RT). The 5-year overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 30.2%. Old age and advanced rT classification were adverse prognostic factors, whereas surgery (mainly in resectable recurrence) was associated with favorable survival outcome. The 5-year OS rates for patients who received surgery and re-RT were 56.3% and 21.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Early detection of resectable recurrence is of paramount importance as surgery for resectable tumors offers the potential to achieve excellent outcomes. Re-RT could be considered in selected patients with unresectable disease and favorable prognostic features. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","antineoplastic agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; Article; bone necrosis; brain injury; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer surgery; central nervous system infection; controlled study; cranial nerve paralysis; disease course; dose volume histogram; dysphagia; endocrine disease; female; follow up; graft necrosis; hearing impairment; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; major clinical study; male; nasopharynx carcinoma; overall survival; palatal fistula; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; private hospital; public hospital; re-irradiation; respiratory failure; stenosis; temporal lobe necrosis; treatment duration; treatment outcome; trismus; tumor recurrence; tumor volume; velopharynx stenosis; very elderly"

Materials and Methods: This pilot study included 65 medical students who were iPhone (Apple, Inc., Cupertino, CA) users with the built-in accelerometer and Health app. Main outcome measures were the change in daily walking distance before and after the release of Pok?mon Go (Niantic, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Results: Twenty-four (36.9%) medical students were active Pok?mon Go players. When compared with nonplayers, Pok?mon Go players on average walked 1.5, 1.2, 0.9, and 0.6 km more daily on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth day of the game, respectively (P < 0.05). Physical activity differences were not detected beyond the first week. Among Pok?mon Go players, higher intensity of gaming was associated with increased distance walked 50 days after the release of the game compared to previously (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In this pilot study, Pok?mon Go was associated with a transient increase in physical activity in the first week. Augmented reality games need to demonstrate a sustained positive health impact to be promoted as a new class of physical activity interventions. ? 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","exercise; female; human; male; smartphone; statistics and numerical data; video game; virtual reality; walking; young adult; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Smartphone; Video Games; Virtual Reality; Walking; Young Adult"
"Discovery of lipid biomarkers correlated with disease progression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry",2019,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) often results in recurrence or metastasis, and there are only a few clinically effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and personalized therapy. Metabolic changes have been widely studied using mass spectrometry (MS) of tissue lysates to identify novel biomarkers. Our objective was to identify lipid biomarkers that can predict disease progression in ccRCC by a tissue-based approach. We retrospectively investigated lipid molecules in cancerous tissues and normal renal cortex tissues obtained from patients with ccRCC (n = 47) using desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry (DESI-IMS). We selected eight candidate lipid biomarkers showing higher signal intensity in cancerous than in normal tissues, with a clear distinction of the tissue type based on the images. Of these candidates, low maximum intensity ratio (cancerous/normal) values of ions of oleic acid, m/z 389.2, and 391.3 significantly correlated with shorter progression-free survival compared with high maximum intensity ratio values (P = 0.011, P = 0.022, and P < 0.001, respectively). This study identified novel lipid molecules contributing to the prediction of disease progression in ccRCC using DESI-IMS. Our findings on lipid storage may provide a new diagnostic or therapeutic strategy for targeting cancer cell metabolism. Copyright: Tamura et al.

Celastrol was loaded into PEG-PCL nanoparticles, yielding nano-celastrol with optimal size, spherical morphology, good bioavailability, slower peak time and clearance in mice. Nano-celastrol (5 or 7.5 mg/kg/d of celastrol) was administered into diet-induced obese C57BL/6 N male mice for 3 weeks. As result, higher dose nano-celastrol reduced body weight and body fat mass in an equally effective manner as regular celastrol, although lower dose nano-celastrol showed less activity. Similarly, nano-celastrol improved glucose tolerance in mice equally well as regular celastrol, whereas higher dose nano-celastrol improved the response to insulin. As for macrophage M1/M2 polarization in liver, nano-celastrol reduced the expression of macrophage M1 biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS) in a dose-dependent manner and marginally increased the expression of macrophage M2 biomarkers (e.g., Arg-1, IL-10). Moreover, celastrol could cause anus irritation and disturb intestinal and colonic integrity, whereas nano-celastrol did not cause any injury to mice. Collectively, nano-celastrol represents a translatable therapeutic opportunity for treating diet-induced obesity in humans. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Insulin; Macrophages; Medical applications; Nutrition; Pathology; Polarization; Celastrol; Clinical application; Diet-induced obesity; Dose-dependent manner; Inflammation; Nanomicelles; Obesity; Spherical morphologies; Mammals; arginase 1; biological marker; celastrol; copolymer; glucose; inducible nitric oxide synthase; insulin; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; macrogol; polycaprolactone; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antiobesity activity; area under the curve; Article; body fat; body weight; C57BL/6N mouse; controlled study; diet-induced obesity; digestive system injury; drug dose comparison; drug half life; drug megadose; fat mass; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; glucose tolerance test; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; low drug dose; macrophage; male; maximum concentration; mean residence time; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; time to maximum plasma concentration"
"A literature analysis on anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF) using a bibliometric approach",2019,"We performed the current study to assess the citation performance of research works on anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. We searched Web of Science (WoS) to identify relevant publications and analyze them with reference to their publication year, journal title, citation count, WoS category, and article type. The bibliometric software (VOSviewer) was used for citation analyses of countries and journals and to generate a term map that visualizes the recurring terms appearing in the titles and abstracts of published articles. The literature search resulted in 7364 articles, with a mean citation count of 26.2. Over half of them (50.2%) were published during the past 5?years. Original articles constituted the majority (67.8%). The publications were mainly classified into WoS categories of ophthalmology (43.2%) and oncology (20.6%). The most prolific ophthalmology and cancer journals were Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science (7.3%) and Cancer Research (1.4%), respectively. The correlation between journal impact factor and citation count was weak to moderate (for journals with impact factor up to 5 and 10, respectively), and open-access articles had significantly more citations than non-open-access articles (p < 0.001). The frequently targeted tumors by anti-VEGF therapy included metastatic colorectal cancer (196; 49.2 citations per article (CPA)), breast cancers (167; 37.2 CPA), and renal cell carcinoma (122; 38.2 CPA). The frequently targeted eye pathologies were age-related macular degeneration (828; 18.2 CPA), diabetic macular edema (466; 10.8 CPA), and diabetic retinopathy (358; 31.9 CPA). These results indicate that anti-VEGF therapy has a wide range of applications and its publications are highly cited. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","vasculotropin inhibitor; age related macular degeneration; bibliometrics; breast cancer; cancer research; citation analysis; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; human; metastatic colorectal cancer; open access publishing; renal cell carcinoma; Review; software; Web of Science"
"DNA methylation at an enhancer of the three prime repair exonuclease 2 gene (TREX2) is linked to gene expression and survival in laryngeal cancer",2019,"Background: Genetic aberrations in DNA repair genes are linked to cancer, but less is reported about epigenetic regulation of DNA repair and functional consequences. We investigated the intragenic methylation loss at the three prime repair exonuclease 2 (TREX2) locus in laryngeal (n = 256) and colorectal cancer cases (n = 95) and in pan-cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results: Significant methylation loss at an intragenic site of TREX2 was a frequent trait in both patient cohorts (p = 0.016 and < 0.001, respectively) and in 15 out of 22 TCGA studies. Methylation loss correlated with immunohistochemically staining for TREX2 (p < 0.0001) in laryngeal tumors and improved overall survival of laryngeal cancer patients (p = 0.045). Chromatin immunoprecipitation, demethylation experiments, and reporter gene assays revealed that the region of methylation loss can function as a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA)-responsive enhancer element regulating TREX2 expression. Conclusions: The data highlight a regulatory role of TREX2 DNA methylation for gene expression which might affect incidence and survival of laryngeal cancer. Altered TREX2 protein levels in tumors may affect drug-induced DNA damage repair and provide new tailored therapies. ? 2019 The Author(s).","CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; exonuclease; messenger RNA; three prime repair exonuclease 2; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; DNA methylation; DNA responsive element; embryo; enhancer region; female; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene locus; human; human cell; human tissue; larynx cancer; major clinical study; male; overall survival; priority journal; protein expression; TREX2 gene"
"The role of male partner in utilization of maternal health care services in Ethiopia: A community-based couple study",2019,"Background: Ethiopia has recorded substantial progress in maternal health recently. However, poor utilization of maternal health care services is challenging further improvement. Although male partners are decision-makers in households, the impact of their involvement on maternal health care services has not been well studied. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the association between male partners' involvement in maternal health care on utilization of maternal health care services. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on male/female couples with a baby less than 6 months old (N = 210) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The main independent variable of the study was male partners' involvement in maternal health care. Two structured questionnaires were used to collect the data from men and women. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Results: Mean age in years was 28.7 (SD = 5.4) for women and 36.2 (SD = 8.8) for men. Half of the men (51.4%) have accompanied their partner to antenatal care (ANC) at least once. However, only 23.1% of them have physically entered the ANC room together. Overall involvement of male partners was poor in 34.8% of the couples (involved in two or fewer activities). After controlling for other covariates, the odds of having 1st ANC visit within the first trimester of pregnancy and skilled delivery attendant at birth were higher in women whose male partners took time to know what happened during ANC visits (AOR = 1.93; 95%CI = 1.04-3.60; AOR = 2.93; 95%CI = 1.24-5.6.90, respectively). Similarly, the odds of having at least one ANC visit, first ANC visit within twelve weeks, HIV testing, skilled birth attendant, and birth in a health facility were higher in couples with higher overall male partner involvement. Conclusion: The study demonstrated significant associations between male partners' involvement in maternal health care and utilization of some maternal health care services by female partners. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; Article; cross-sectional study; domestic partner; Ethiopia; female; first trimester pregnancy; groups by age; health care facility; health care utilization; health service; human; information processing; male; maternal care; obstetric delivery; prenatal care; structured questionnaire; birth; decision making; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; maternal health service; middle aged; multivariate analysis; patient attitude; pregnancy; spouse; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Ethiopia; Female; Health Facilities; HIV Infections; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Maternal Health Services; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Parturition; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Spouses; Young Adult"
"Interferon-γ upregulates Δ42PD1 expression on human monocytes via the PI3K/AKT pathway",2019,"Background: We recently identified a novel alternatively spliced isoform of human programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), named Δ42PD1, which contains a 42-base-pair in-frame deletion compared with the full-length PD-1. Δ42PD1 is likely constitutively expressed on human monocytes and down-regulated in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The mechanism underlying the regulation of Δ42PD-1 expression in monocytes remains unknown. Methods: By flow cytometry, we investigated the effect of Interferon-gamma (INF-γ) on the expression of Δ42PD1 in primary human monocytes as well as monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937 cells. In addition, signaling pathway inhibitors and Δ42PD1-specific blocking antibody were used to explore the pathway involved in INF-γ-induced Δ42PD1 upregulation, and to elucidate the relationship between Δ42PD1 and TNF-α or IL-6 production by INF-γ primed monocytes in response to pre-fixed E. coli. Furthermore, we assessed T-cell proliferation, activation and cytokine production as enriched CD4+ T cells were co-cultured with THP-1 or U937 cells, with or without Δ42PD1-blocking antibody. Results: Treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with IFN-γ resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase in the expression of Δ42PD1 on monocytes. Similarly, IFN-γ upregulates Δ42PD1 expression on human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. IFN-γ-induced Δ42PD1 upregulation was abolished by JAK inhibitors Ruxolitinib and Tasocitinib, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and AKT inhibitor MK-2206, respectively, but not by STAT1 inhibitor and MAPK signaling pathway inhibitors. JAK, PI3K-AKT, and MAPK signaling inhibitors abolished effectively the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in INF-γ-primed monocytes in response to pre-fixed E. coli. In contrast, Δ42PD1-specific blocking antibody did not affect the IFN-γ-induced priming effect. Furthermore, the MFI ratio of Δ42PD1 to full-length PD-1 (PD-1 Δ/F ratio) was significantly and positively correlated with TNF-α (P = 0.0289, r = 0.6038) produced by circulating CD14+ monocytes in response to pre-fixed E. coli. Notably, Δ42PD1 blockage significantly inhibited CD4+ T-cells proliferation and cytokine production in the co-culture conditions. Conclusions: We demonstrated that IFN-γ increases Δ42PD1 expression on human monocytes via activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway downstream of JAKs, and that the PD-1 Δ/F ratio is a potential biomarker to predict the functional state of monocytes. Notably, we revealed the Δ42PD1 play a role in T-cell regulation, providing a novel potential approach to manipulate adaptive immune response. ? 2019","2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; 8 [4 (1 aminocyclobutyl)phenyl] 9 phenyl 1,2,4 triazolo[3,4 f][1,6]naphthyridin 3(2h) one; CD14 antigen; delta 42 programmed cell death 1 protein; gamma interferon; interleukin 6; Janus kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; programmed death 1 receptor; protein kinase B; ruxolitinib; STAT1 protein; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; blocking antibody; gamma interferon; isoprotein; Janus kinase; lipopolysaccharide receptor; oncoprotein; PDCD1 protein, human; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; programmed death 1 receptor; adaptive immunity; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; coculture; controlled study; cytokine production; down regulation; Escherichia coli; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; lymphocyte proliferation; monocyte; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; protein expression; T lymphocyte activation; THP-1 cell line; U-937 cell line; upregulation; alternative RNA splicing; flow cytometry; genetics; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; monocyte; physiology; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; Alternative Splicing; Antibodies, Blocking; Flow Cytometry; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Janus Kinases; Lipopolysaccharide Receptors; Lymphocyte Activation; Monocytes; Oncogene Protein v-akt; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Protein Isoforms; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocytes; THP-1 Cells; U937 Cells; Up-Regulation"
"Relationship between neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and short-term prognosis in the chronic obstructive pulmonary patients with acute exacerbation",2019,"We retrospectively collected data from a large sample size of population and explore the relationship between neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and adverse outcomes, and assessed the clinical prognostic utility of NLR in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary patients with acute exacerbation (AECOPD). We reviewed 3 years medical case records, 622 patients were identified including 48 died and 574 alive. Compared with alive group, the died group had significantly elevated neutrophils, lymphocyte, and NLR level (P&lt;0.001). The high-sensitive C-protein level of died group was also higher compared with alive group (7.48 +? 4.2 vs 1.26 +? 0.56, vs P&lt;0.001). The univariate logistic regression indicated that elevated NLR level was associated with the increased of adverse outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 4.59, 95% CI: 2.27–8.94, P&lt;0.001). After adjusted potential confounding factors, the elevated NLR level was still associated with adverse outcomes in the chronic obstructive pulmonary patients with acute exacerbation (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.21–3.48, P=0.008). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for death at 90 days was 0.742 (95% CI: 0.554–0.881). NLR cutoff of &gt;4.19 had a sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 74.2%. Our results suggested that NLR, as a rapid, inexpensive and easily obtained blood routine index was associated with short-term adverse outcomes in patients with AECOPD. The elevated NLR predicted the increased the risk of 90-day mortality in patients with AECOPD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","protein C; adverse outcome; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical evaluation; comparative study; confounding variable; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease association; disease exacerbation; disease severity; female; human; lymphocyte; major clinical study; male; medical record; mortality rate; mortality risk; neutrophil; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; population size; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity"
"Can hospital accreditation enhance patient experience? Longitudinal evidence from a Hong Kong hospital patient experience survey",2019,"Background: Hospital accreditation is expected to improve health care quality and patient satisfaction. However, little and conflicting evidence is currently available to support its effect on patient outcomes, particularly patient experience. Hong Kong recently launched a pilot programme to test an infrastructure for accreditation of both private and public hospitals with the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards. This study aims to evaluate the longitudinal impact of hospital accreditation on patient experience in a publicly-funded university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted at three time points: 9 months pre- accreditation as baseline (T1), three (T2) and fifteen months (T3) post-accreditation. Acute care inpatients aged 18 to 80 were recruited on the second day of hospital admission to complete the Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire-15 (PPE-15). Baseline data was first compared to the 2005 Hong Kong average for public hospitals using t-tests. Data was then analyzed using ANOVA and multiple linear regression to evaluate differences across the three cross-sections and examine the effect of accreditation over time while controlling for covariates. Results: 3083 patients (T1 = 896, T2 = 1093, T3 = 1094) completed the survey for a response rate of 83.5, 86.1, and 83.8%, respectively. The hospital baseline domain and summary patient experience scores differed from the Hong Kong public hospital average obtained from the 2005 Thematic Household Survey. All domain and summary patient experience scores declined (improved) over the study period (T1 to T3). The multiple regression results confirmed the time point score comparisons with declining (improving) parameter estimates for T2 and T3 for all domain and summary scores except the 'continuity and transition' domain, for which the declining coefficient was only significant at T3. Conclusions: While hospital accreditation has not been shown to improve patient outcomes, this study suggests the accreditation exercise may enhance patient experience. Moreover, it suggests the quality improvement initiatives associated with accreditation may address areas of concern emphasized by Hong Kong patients, such as involvement in care and emotional support from providers. ? 2019 The Author(s).","accreditation; adult; aged; analysis of variance; article; emergency care; exercise; female; Hong Kong; hospital medicine; household; human; major clinical study; male; outpatient department; patient satisfaction; public hospital; questionnaire; teaching hospital; total quality management; accreditation; adolescent; epidemiology; health care quality; Hong Kong; hospital patient; hospitalization; middle aged; psychology; total quality management; very elderly; young adult; Accreditation; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Hospitals, Public; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Quality Improvement; Quality of Health Care; Young Adult"
"Perceptions of chinese towards dementia in hong kong—diagnosis, symptoms and impacts",2019,"The increasing prevalence of dementia has become a public health issue worldwide including China. This study aims to explore the perception of Chinese in Hong Kong towards the diagnosis, symptoms and impacts of dementia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among outpatients (without diagnosed dementia) attending a regional public hospital using a standard questionnaire. The results from 290 respondents showed that most preferred to be told about the diagnosis of dementia as soon as possible if they got it, in order to deal with the news and to access treatment and support early. Nearly two thirds of the respondents perceived practical issues (61.3%), physical health (61.0%), and emotional distress (58.4%) as their most fearful impacts, while legal issues (7.4%) were their least concerns. Family history/genes (79.1%) and brain injury (75.9%) were the most commonly perceived causes of dementia. For symptoms, respondents were more likely to identify cognitive impairments than undesirable behaviours. The accepting and proactive attitudes of the public indicate that there is a timely need of more public education about the disease, early screening and better continuity of care to fulfil the anticipated increase of the dementia patient population. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Risk factors for the development of post-operative enterocolitis in short segment Hirschsprung’s disease",2019,"Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to identify risk factors associated with the development of post-operative enterocolitis (HAEC), in short segment Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR-S). Methods: A retrospective study was carried out for post-operative patients with HSCR-S from 1997 to 2017. HSCR-S was defined as the most proximal extension of aganglionosis limited to the sigmoid colon. An episode of HAEC was defined as the presence of (1) vomiting or explosive diarrhea; (2) abdominal distension; (3) fever and (4) leukocytosis. Risk factors for the development of HACE were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Main results: The medical records of 96 patients were reviewed. The overall incidence of HAEC was 20.8% (n = 20) and 65.0% (n = 13) of HAEC occurred within the first year of operation. After a univariate logistic regression analysis, three risk factors for HAEC were identified: (1) presence of other major anomalies [OR: 1.43 (1.12–2.32), p = 0.041]; (2) creation of pre-operative defunctioning stoma [OR: 2.28 (1.47–3.23), p = 0.035]; (3) extension of aganglionosis to the sigmoid colon [OR: 1.89 (1.05–3.19), p = 0.049]. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, a significant association was demonstrated for creation of pre-operative defunctioning stoma [OR: 1.81 (1.08–3.22), p = 0.045] and extension of aganglionosis to the sigmoid colon [OR: 1.91 (1.37–2.98), p = 0.038]. Conclusions: The requirement of pre-operative defunctioning stoma and a more proximal extension of aganglionosis are risk factors for the development of post-operative HAEC in HSCR-S. Patients with these risk factors should be closely followed up especially during the first year after the operation. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","abdominal distension; aganglionosis; Article; child; diarrhea; Down syndrome; enterocolitis; female; fever; follow up; Hirschsprung disease; human; leukocytosis; major clinical study; male; medical record review; physical examination; post operative enterocolitis; postoperative care; postoperative complication; preschool child; priority journal; rectum; rectum biopsy; retrospective study; risk factor; sigmoid; vomiting; enterocolitis; Hirschsprung disease; infant; postoperative complication; risk factor; stoma; Child, Preschool; Enterocolitis; Female; Hirschsprung Disease; Humans; Infant; Male; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surgical Stomas"
"Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) as privileged molecular targets in neuroscience: Research literature analysis",2019,"Background: Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) were discovered nearly a century ago. This article aims to analyze the research literature landscape associated with MAOs as privileged class of neuronal enzymes (neuroenzymes) with key functions in the processes of neurodegeneration, serving as important biological targets in neuroscience. With the accumulating publications on this topic, we aimed to evaluate the publication and citation performance of the contributors, reveal the popular research themes, and identify its historical roots. Methods: The electronic database of Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was searched to identify publications related to MAOs, which were analyzed according to their publication year, authorship, institutions, countries/regions, journal title, WoS category, total citation count, and publication type. VOSviewer was utilized to visualize the citation patterns of the words appearing in the titles and abstracts, and author keywords. CRExplorer was utilized to identify seminal references cited by the MAO publications. Results: The literature analysis was based on 19,854 publications. Most of them were original articles (n = 15,148, 76.3%) and reviews (n = 2,039, 10.3%). The top five WoS categories of the analyzed MAO publications were Pharmacology/Pharmacy (n = 4,664, 23.5%), Neurosciences (n = 4,416, 22.2%), Psychiatry (n = 2,906, 14.6%), Biochemistry/Molecular Biology (n = 2,691, 13.6%), and Clinical Neurology (n = 1,754, 8.8%). The top 10 institutions are scattered in the United States, UK, France, Sweden, Canada, Israel, and Russia, while the top 10 countries/regions with the most intensive research on the field of MAOs are the United States, followed by European and Asian countries. More highly cited publications generally involved neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), serotonin, and norepinephrine (NE), as well as the MAO-A inhibitors moclobemide and clorgyline, and the irreversible MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. Conclusion: Through decades of research, the literature has accumulated many publications investigating the therapeutic effects of MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) on various neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and depression. We envision that MAO literature will continue to grow steadily, with more new therapeutic candidates being tested for better management of neurological conditions, in particular, with the development of multi-target acting drugs against neurodegenerative diseases. ? 2019 Yeung, Georgieva, Atanasov and Tzvetkov.","amine oxidase (flavin containing); amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme B; clorgyline; dopamine; moclobemide; noradrenalin; rasagiline; reactive oxygen metabolite; safinamide; selegiline; serotonin; serotonin uptake inhibitor; aggression; Alzheimer disease; apoptosis; Article; crystal structure; degenerative disease; depression; human; molecularly targeted therapy; nerve degeneration; neuroprotection; neuropsychological test; neuroscience; neurotoxicity; Parkinson disease; scientific literature; substantia nigra"
"International genomic definition of pneumococcal lineages, to contextualise disease, antibiotic resistance and vaccine impact",2019,"Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, caused by vaccine serotypes, but non-vaccine-serotypes remain a concern. We used whole genome sequencing to study pneumococcal serotype, antibiotic resistance and invasiveness, in the context of genetic background. Methods: Our dataset of 13,454 genomes, combined with four published genomic datasets, represented Africa (40%), Asia (25%), Europe (19%), North America (12%), and South America (5%). These 20,027 pneumococcal genomes were clustered into lineages using PopPUNK, and named Global Pneumococcal Sequence Clusters (GPSCs). From our dataset, we additionally derived serotype and sequence type, and predicted antibiotic sensitivity. We then measured invasiveness using odds ratios that relating prevalence in invasive pneumococcal disease to carriage. Findings: The combined collections (n = 20,027) were clustered into 621 GPSCs. Thirty-five GPSCs observed in our dataset were represented by &gt;100 isolates, and subsequently classed as dominant-GPSCs. In 22/35 (63%) of dominant-GPSCs both non-vaccine serotypes and vaccine serotypes were observed in the years up until, and including, the first year of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction. Penicillin and multidrug resistance were higher (p &lt; .05) in a subset dominant-GPSCs (14/35, 9/35 respectively), and resistance to an increasing number of antibiotic classes was associated with increased recombination (R2 = 0.27 p &lt; .0001). In 28/35 dominant-GPSCs, the country of isolation was a significant predictor (p &lt; .05) of its antibiogram (mean misclassification error 0.28, SD ± 0.13). We detected increased invasiveness of six genetic backgrounds, when compared to other genetic backgrounds expressing the same serotype. Up to 1.6-fold changes in invasiveness odds ratio were observed. Interpretation: We define GPSCs that can be assigned to any pneumococcal genomic dataset, to aid international comparisons. Existing non-vaccine-serotypes in most GPSCs preclude the removal of these lineages by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines; leaving potential for serotype replacement. A subset of GPSCs have increased resistance, and/or serotype-independent invasiveness. ? 2019 The Authors","chloramphenicol; cotrimoxazole; erythromycin; penicillin derivative; tetracycline; vaccine; antiinfective agent; Pneumococcus vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; child; female; gene isolation; genetic database; genetic recombination; genetic variability; genome analysis; genotype; geographic distribution; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multidrug resistance; multilocus sequence typing; phenotype; phylogeny; pneumococcal infection; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; Streptococcus pneumonia; whole genome sequencing; bacterial genome; biodiversity; classification; drug effect; genetics; genomics; global health; immunology; microbiology; molecular evolution; pneumococcal infection; procedures; serotype; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biodiversity; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Genotype; Global Health; Humans; Male; Pneumococcal Infections; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Serogroup; Streptococcus pneumoniae"
"Exploring the association between urbanisation and self-rated health of older adults in China: Evidence from a national population sample survey",2019,"Objectives This study investigated the association between urbanisation and self-rated health of older adults in China, particularly how different dimensions, rate and level of urbanisation are related to older people's health. Additionally, it examined the moderating effect of education on the association between each of the four dimensions of urbanisation and older people's health. Design The study uses a cross-sectional survey design. Participants This study analysed 236 030 individuals (aged 60-79 years) nested within 267 prefecture-level cities from 2005 China's 1% population sample survey. Outcome measures Self-rated health was the outcome variable. Four groups of predictors assessed prefectures' level and rate of urbanisation: land-use conversion, economic growth, population concentration and health services. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the association between self-rated health and the level and rate of urbanisation, after adjusting for individual-level covariates. Multiplicative interactions explored variations by education. Results The odd of reporting fair or poor health was negatively associated with the level and rate of population concentration (OR 0.93,95%CI 0.87 to 0.99 and 0.74,95%CI 0.59 to 0.93, respectively) and positively associated with the level of health services (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.19). Land-use conversion, economic growth and health service improvements (the forms of rate of urbanisation) were not significantly associated with self-rated health. Education had a moderating effect on the association between urbanisation and self-rated health. Conclusions Older people living in more densely populated areas and areas undergoing rapid population concentration were less likely to report fair or poor health. This result supports healthy migration and a  salmon bias' hypotheses. No urban health penalty was observed for the older adults in China; therefore, the following pathways linking urbanisation to health are unclear: lifestyle changes, environmental pollution and cultivated land reduction. ?

"Adopting YouTube to Promote Health: Analysis of State Health Departments",2019,"INTRODUCTION: We describe videos posted to the YouTube video-sharing Web site by US state health departments (SHDs) and associated institutional factors. METHODS: YouTube channels from SHDs were identified, their data retrieved, and their videos saved to a playlist on January 10, 2016. Ten randomly sampled videos from each channel were manually coded for topics. The 2012 Association of State and Territorial Health Officials profile survey was used to obtain information on staff, expenditure, and top 5 priorities for each SHD. Descriptive statistics and univariable regression were conducted. RESULTS: Forty-three SHDs had YouTube channels. Together, all SHDs posted 3957 videos, accumulated 12,151,720 views, and gained 6302 subscribers. In total, 415 videos were manually coded. Information about the agency (17.6%), communicable diseases (12.5%), and mother/infant health (8.9%) comprised the largest share of topics. No statistically significant association was observed between the log-transformed number of videos posted on an SHD's YouTube channel and any of the explanatory variables of SHD staffing and expenditure in 2011. The number of full-time employees (r = 0.34, p = 0.03), number of epidemiologists and biostatisticians (r = 0.41, p = 0.01), and 2011 total year expenditure (r = 0.38, p = 0.02) were positively correlated with the log-transformed number of views per YouTube video posted by SHDs. No meaningful patterns of statistical association were observed between the percentage of expenditure on a specific program area and the topics of videos. CONCLUSION: Most SHDs are using YouTube, which provides a unique opportunity for SHDs to disseminate health messages.","cross-sectional study; health care organization; health promotion; human; procedures; social media; statistics and numerical data; United States; videorecording; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Promotion; Health Systems Agencies; Humans; Social Media; United States; Video Recording"
"3D gelatin-chitosan hybrid hydrogels combined with human platelet lysate highly support human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation",2019,"Bone marrow and adipose tissue human mesenchymal stem cells were seeded in highly performing 3D gelatin–chitosan hybrid hydrogels of varying chitosan content in the presence of human platelet lysate and evaluated for their proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Both bone marrow and adipose tissue human mesenchymal stem cells in gelatin–chitosan hybrid hydrogel 1 (chitosan content 8.1%) or gelatin–chitosan hybrid hydrogel 2 (chitosan 14.9%) showed high levels of viability (80%–90%), and their proliferation and osteogenic differentiation was significantly higher with human platelet lysate compared to fetal bovine serum, particularly in gelatin–chitosan hybrid hydrogel 1. Mineralization was detected early, after 21 days of culture, when human platelet lysate was used in the presence of osteogenic stimuli. Proteomic characterization of human platelet lysate highlighted 59 proteins mainly involved in functions related to cell adhesion, cellular repairing mechanisms, and regulation of cell differentiation. In conclusion, the combination of our gelatin–chitosan hybrid hydrogels with hPL represents a promising strategy for bone regenerative medicine using human mesenchymal stem cells. ?

"Height and body mass index as Modifiers of breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: A Mendelian randomization study",2019,"Background: BRCA1/2 mutations confer high lifetime risk of breast cancer, although other factors may modify this risk. Whether height or body mass index (BMI) modifies breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers remains unclear. Methods: We used Mendelian randomization approaches to evaluate the association of height and BMI on breast cancer risk, using data from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 with 14 676 BRCA1 and 7912 BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 11 451 cases of breast cancer. We created a height genetic score using 586 height-associated variants and a BMI genetic score using 93 BMI-associated variants.We examined both observed and genetically determined height and BMI with breast cancer risk using weighted Cox models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Observed height was positively associated with breast cancer risk (HR = 1.09 per 10cm increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 1.17; P=1.17). Height genetic score was positively associated with breast cancer, although this was not statistically significant (per 10cm increase in genetically predicted height, HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.17; P=.47). Observed BMI was inversely associated with breast cancer risk (per 5 kg/m2 increase, HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90 to 0.98; P=.007). BMI genetic score was also inversely associated with breast cancer risk (per 5 kg/m2 increase in genetically predicted BMI, HR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76 to 0.98; P=.02). BMI was primarily associated with premenopausal breast cancer. Conclusion: Height is associated with overall breast cancer and BMI is associated with premenopausal breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Incorporating height and BMI, particularly genetic score, into risk assessment may improve cancer management. ? The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

"Pneumococcal lineages associated with serotype replacement and antibiotic resistance in childhood invasive pneumococcal disease in the post-PCV13 era: an international whole-genome sequencing study",2019,"Background: Invasive pneumococcal disease remains an important health priority owing to increasing disease incidence caused by pneumococci expressing non-vaccine serotypes. We previously defined 621 Global Pneumococcal Sequence Clusters (GPSCs) by analysing 20 027 pneumococcal isolates collected worldwide and from previously published genomic data. In this study, we aimed to investigate the pneumococcal lineages behind the predominant serotypes, the mechanism of serotype replacement in disease, as well as the major pneumococcal lineages contributing to invasive pneumococcal disease in the post-vaccine era and their antibiotic resistant traits. Methods: We whole-genome sequenced 3233 invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from laboratory-based surveillance programmes in Hong Kong (n=78), Israel (n=701), Malawi (n=226), South Africa (n=1351), The Gambia (n=203), and the USA (n=674). The genomes represented pneumococci from before and after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introductions and were from children younger than 3 years. We identified predominant serotypes by prevalence and their major contributing lineages in each country, and assessed any serotype replacement by comparing the incidence rate between the pre-PCV and PCV periods for Israel, South Africa, and the USA. We defined the status of a lineage as vaccine-type GPSC (?50% 13-valent PCV [PCV13] serotypes) or non-vaccine-type GPSC (>50% non-PCV13 serotypes) on the basis of its initial serotype composition detected in the earliest vaccine period to measure their individual contribution toward serotype replacement in each country. Major pneumococcal lineages in the PCV period were identified by pooled incidence rate using a random effects model. Findings: The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. These serotypes were associated with more than one lineage, except for serotype 5 (GPSC8). Serotype replacement was mainly mediated by expansion of non-vaccine serotypes within vaccine-type GPSCs and, to a lesser extent, by increases in non-vaccine-type GPSCs. A globally spreading lineage, GPSC3, expressing invasive serotypes 8 in South Africa and 33F in the USA and Israel, was the most common lineage causing non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease in the PCV13 period. We observed that same prevalent non-vaccine serotypes could be associated with distinctive lineages in different countries, which exhibited dissimilar antibiotic resistance profiles. In non-vaccine serotype isolates, we detected significant increases in the prevalence of resistance to penicillin (52 [21%] of 249 vs 169 [29%] of 575, p=0·0016) and erythromycin (three [1%] of 249 vs 65 [11%] of 575, p=0·0031) in the PCV13 period compared with the pre-PCV period. Interpretation: Globally spreading lineages expressing invasive serotypes have an important role in serotype replacement, and emerging non-vaccine serotypes associated with different pneumococcal lineages in different countries might be explained by local antibiotic-selective pressures. Continued genomic surveillance of the dynamics of the pneumococcal population with increased geographical representation in the post-vaccine period will generate further knowledge for optimising future vaccine design.

"Healthy Start Home Visiting Program—School-Based Model: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial",2019,"Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Healthy Start Home Visiting Program—School-Based Model (HSS), using a cluster randomized controlled trial design. Methods: Participants included 224 parents from 20 preschools randomized into intervention and wait-list control groups at the preschool level. Furthermore, 105 parents from the participating preschools were trained as parent ambassadors to assist in program delivery. They were randomized into intervention and control groups at the preschool level. Outcome measures included parent and teacher reports on children’s learning, parent report on children’s behavior and health, their own parenting, and direct assessment of children. Parent ambassadors completed measures on parenting and their children’s behavior before training and after program delivery. Results: There was significant improvement at postintervention in parenting, children’s behavior, and learning and health in the intervention group, compared with the control group. Conclusions: The results provided evidence on the effectiveness of the HSS program. ?

"The prevalence and years lived with disability caused by low back pain in China, 1990 to 2016: Findings from the global burden of disease study 2016",2019,"The aim of this work was to quantify the prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) caused by low back pain (LBP) in China from 1990 to 2016. Data from the GBD 2016 (Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016) were used. We analyzed the age-sex-province-specific prevalence and YLDs for LBP of 33 provinces/regions in China. Comparisons were made with the data retrieved from the 1990 GBD study. We estimated that 5.45 × 107 individuals had LBP in 1990, which rose to 6.73 × 107 in 2016. The age-standardized prevalence of LBP decreased from 5.6% (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI]: 4.9%-6.3%) in 1990 to 4.2% (95% UI: 3.8%-4.8%) in 2016. The YLDs for LBP increased from 6.2 million (95% UI: 4.3-8.3 million) in 1990 to 7.7 million (95% UI: 5.4-10.2) in 2016. Age-standardized YLD rate (per 100,000 person) decreased from 637.5 (95% UI: 449.9-848.8) in 1990 to 481.9 (95% UI: 338.6-637.0) in 2016. A female preponderance was observed for prevalence and YLDs. The prevalence and YLDs rate for LBP slightly decreased from 1990 to 2016 in China; however, the total individuals and YLDs increased. Low back pain still ranks as the second leading cause of YLD burden disease in China. Considerable attention should be paid for LBP, especially in the female population. ? 2018 The Author(s).","age; Article; baby boomer; China; disability; disability-adjusted life year; female; global disease burden; health care disparity; human; life expectancy; low back pain; male; mortality; prevalence; priority journal; sex difference; adolescent; adult; aged; child; complication; disabled person; global disease burden; infant; longitudinal study; middle aged; preschool child; prevalence; procedures; quality adjusted life year; retrospective study; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Disabled Persons; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Humans; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Low Back Pain; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult"
"Understanding the Higher-Order Approach to Consciousness",2019,"The higher-order theory (HOT) of consciousness has often been misunderstood by critics. Here, we clarify its position on several issues, and distinguish it from other views, such as the global workspace theory (GWT) and early sensory models (e.g., first-order local recurrency theories). For example, HOT has been criticized for overintellectualizing consciousness. We show that, while higher-order states are cognitively assembled, the requirements are in fact considerably less than often presumed. In this sense, HOT may be viewed as an intermediate position between GWT and early sensory views. We also clarify that most proponents of HOT do not stipulate consciousness as equivalent to metacognition or confidence. Furthermore, compared with other existing theories, HOT can arguably account better for complex everyday experiences, such as emotions and episodic memories. This makes HOT particularly useful as a framework for conceptualizing pathological mental states. ? 2019 The Authors","Cognitive systems; consciousness; emotion; Global workspace; Prefrontal cortex; Visual awareness; Biology; awareness; consciousness; controlled study; episodic memory; human; human experiment; mental health; metacognition; prefrontal cortex; review; theoretical study"
"Extent of lymphadenectomy for Barrett's cancer",2019,"Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) has become the predominant histological cell type in western countries due to the prevalence of obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus. There is some evidence that this is increasing in the East as well. Surgery aims at achieving an R0 resection with clear margins, together with adequate and appropriate lymphadenectomy. Siewert type I and II cancers are more likely to be associated with Barrett's esophagus (especially in western countries), while type III cancers are mostly proximal gastric cancers that have grown upwards to involve the EGJ. For type I cancers, most surgeons would perform an esophagectomy, with at least an infra-carinal lymphadenectomy. It is more controversial for type II tumors, with some surgeons preferring an esophagectomy, while others may opt for a proximal or total radical gastrectomy via an abdominal approach. All procedures can be performed using open or minimally invasive methods. In addition to oncologic reasons, the chosen surgical approach also depends on expertise available, safety issues, and postoperative quality-of-life considerations. More data are needed in this area. How to integrate knowledge and also multimodality treatment strategies is an active area of research. ? Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

"Gene expression imputation across multiple brain regions provides insights into schizophrenia risk",2019,"Transcriptomic imputation approaches combine eQTL reference panels with large-scale genotype data in order to test associations between disease and gene expression. These genic associations could elucidate signals in complex genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci and may disentangle the role of different tissues in disease development. We used the largest eQTL reference panel for the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to create a set of gene expression predictors and demonstrate their utility. We applied DLPFC and 12 GTEx-brain predictors to 40,299 schizophrenia cases and 65,264 matched controls for a large transcriptomic imputation study of schizophrenia. We identified 413 genic associations across 13 brain regions. Stepwise conditioning identified 67 non-MHC genes, of which 14 did not fall within previous GWAS loci. We identified 36 significantly enriched pathways, including hexosaminidase-A deficiency, and multiple porphyric disorder pathways. We investigated developmental expression patterns among the 67 non-MHC genes and identified specific groups of pre- and postnatal expression. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","ac110781.3 protein; actr5 protein; beta n acetylhexosaminidase; beta n acetylhexosaminidase A; chrna2 protein; dmc1 protein; eftud1p1 protein; fam205a protein; fragile X mental retardation protein; furin; gatad2a protein; gnl3 protein; guanosine triphosphatase; hif1a protein; igsf9b protein; immp2l protein; ino80e protein; mettl1 protein; MutL protein homolog 1; naga protein; nmral1 protein; pitpna protein; plppr5 protein; protein; sf3a1 protein; tac3 protein; thoc7 protein; timm29 protein; transcription factor 4; transcriptome; unclassified drug; transcriptome; adult; anterior cingulate; anxiety disorder; Article; basal ganglion; bipolar disorder; brain region; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; cerebellum cortex; comparative study; controlled study; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; expression quantitative trait locus; frontal cortex; gene expression; genetic association; genetic risk; genome-wide association study; hemisphere; hippocampus; human; hyperactivity; hypophysis; hypothalamus; intellectual impairment; major clinical study; major histocompatibility complex; mental disease; neurotransmission; nucleus accumbens; perinatal period; prenatal period; priority journal; putamen; schizophrenia; thyroid gland; transcriptomics; brain; case control study; gene expression; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; pathophysiology; procedures; quantitative trait locus; risk; schizophrenia; single nucleotide polymorphism; accuracy; enzyme activity; expression quantitative trait locus; genomics; prediction; prenatal development; schizophrenia; transcriptomics; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Gene Expression; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Risk; Schizophrenia; Transcriptome"
"Virotherapy-recruited PMN-MDSC infiltration of mesothelioma blocks antitumor CTL by IL-10-mediated dendritic cell suppression",2019,"Antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for immune surveillance, yet the blockade of eliciting such CTLs during oncolytic virotherapy remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that oncolysis of mesothelioma by modified vaccinia Tiantan (MVTT) induces damage-associated molecular patterns exposure. Although MVTT leads to regression of established mesothelioma dose-dependently, antitumor CTLs are rarely induced. Mechanistically, MVTT virotherapy generates C-X-C chemokines that recruit CXCR2-expressing polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) into tumor microenvironment, where they suppress dendritic cells (DCs) by producing IL-10 and halt CTL responses. During the virotherapy, however, depletion of PMN-MDSCs but not of monocytic (M)-MDSCs results in the induction of potent antitumor CTLs that not only eradicate established mesothelioma but also prevent the second tumor challenge. Our findings suggest that vaccinia virotherapy may combine strategies that prevent the chemotactic recruitment of PMN-MDSCs, block their suppression on DCs or deplete PMN-MDSCs in order to induce potent CTLs for tumor eradication. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","chemokine receptor CXCR2; gamma interferon; high mobility group B1 protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 10 receptor; Twist related protein 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell infiltration; cell proliferation; cell viability; chemotaxis; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; flow cytometry; immunohistochemistry; immunotherapy; mesothelioma; mouse; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; nonhuman; oncolytic virotherapy; polymorphonuclear cell; protein expression; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; Western blotting"
"The Gestalt of functioning in autism spectrum disorder: Results of the international conference to develop final consensus International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health core sets",2019,"Autism spectrum disorder is associated with diverse social, educational, and occupational challenges. To date, no standardized, internationally accepted tools exist to assess autism spectrum disorder–related functioning. World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health can serve as foundation for developing such tools. This study aimed to identify a comprehensive, a common brief, and three age-appropriate brief autism spectrum disorder Core Sets. Four international preparatory studies yielded in total 164 second-level International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health candidate categories. Based on this evidence, 20 international autism spectrum disorder experts applied an established iterative decision-making consensus process to select from the candidate categories the most relevant ones to constitute the autism spectrum disorder Core Sets. The consensus process generated 111 second-level International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health categories in the Comprehensive Core Set for autism spectrum disorder—one body structure, 20 body functions, 59 activities and participation categories, and 31 environmental factors. The Common Brief Core Set comprised 60 categories, while the age-appropriate core sets included 73 categories in the preschool version (0- to 5-year-old children), 81 in the school-age version (6- to 16-year-old children and adolescents), and 79 in the older adolescent and adult version (?17-year-old individuals). The autism spectrum disorder Core Sets mark a milestone toward the standardized assessment of autism spectrum disorder–related functioning in educational, administrative, clinical, and research settings. ?

"Surgical Treatment of Advanced Staged Hypopharyngeal Cancer",2019,"It is not uncommon for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer to present at an advanced stage of disease. Surgical treatment provides a cure for the tumour with immediate relief from obstruction to the airway and the swallowing passage. Careful planning of surgery is important to ensure good outcome of treatment and prevent complications, some of which may be fatal. The shape of the hypopharynx resembles that of a funnel, with a wide circumference above in continuity with the oropharynx, and a small circumference below where it joins with the cervical oesophagus. As a result, while small tumours require the partial removal of the hypopharynx, large tumours, especially those involving the post-cricoid region, warrant a complete, circumferential pharyngectomy. For tumours that invade the cervical esophagus, transcervical approach is still feasible, and this is facilitated by the removal of the manubrium, allowing access to the tumour and resection with clear margins. In the presence of synchronous tumours lower down in the esophagus, pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy is indicated. Successful reconstruction of defects after tumour extirpation allows proper wound healing and early delivery of adjuvant radiotherapy. It is also important to ensure quick recovery of the long-term swallowing function. It ranges from the use of the soft tissue flap with skin island that is sutured as a patch to the remnants of the pharyngeal mucosa, to the use of a visceral flap, such as the free jejunal flap, to repair the circumferential pharyngectomy defects. The treatment protocol is personalized according to the extent of the tumour and the characteristics of the patients. ? 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

"BRCA2 loss-of-function germline mutations are associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma risk in Chinese",2020,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) occurs with highest frequency in China with over 90% mortality, highlighting the need for early detection and improved treatment strategies. We aimed to identify ESCC cancer predisposition gene(s). Our study included 4,517 individuals. The discovery phase using whole-exome sequencing (WES) included 186 familial ESCC patients from high-risk China. Targeted gene sequencing validation of 598 genes included 3,289 Henan and 1,228 moderate-risk Hong Kong Chinese. A WES approach identified BRCA2 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in 3.23% (6/186) familial ESCC patients compared to 0.21% (9/4300) in the ExAC East Asians (odds ratio [OR] = 15.89, p = 2.48 × 10?10). BRCA2 LOF mutation frequency in the combined Henan cohort has significantly higher prevalence (OR = 10.55, p = 0.0035). Results were independently validated in an ESCC Hong Kong cohort (OR = 10.64, p = 0.022). One Hong Kong pedigree was identified to carry a BRCA2 LOF mutation. BRCA2 inactivation in ESCC was via germline LOF mutations and wild-type somatic allelic loss via loss of heterozygosity. Gene-based association analysis, including LOF mutations and rare deleterious missense variants defined with combined annotation dependent depletion score ?30, confirmed the genetic predisposition role of BRCA2 (OR = 9.50, p = 3.44 × 10?5), and provided new evidence for potential association of ESCC risk with DNA repair genes (POLQ and MSH2), inflammation (TTC39B) and angiogenesis (KDR). Our findings are the first to provide compelling evidence of the role of BRCA2 in ESCC genetic susceptibility in Chinese, suggesting defective homologous recombination is an underlying cause in ESCC pathogenesis, which is amenable to therapeutic options based on synthetic lethality approaches such as targeting BRCA2 with PARP1 inhibitors in ESCC. ? 2019 UICC","BRCA2 protein; DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2; BRCA2 protein; BRCA2 protein, human; adult; aged; Article; BRCA2 gene; cancer risk; China; Chinese; cohort analysis; controlled study; DNA repair; East Asian; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetic variability; germ line; germline mutation; heterozygosity loss; heterozygote; high risk patient; Hong Kong; human; loss of function mutation; major clinical study; male; missense mutation; MSH2 gene; mutational analysis; pedigree; POLQ gene; prevalence; priority journal; somatic mutation; tumor gene; whole exome sequencing; Asian continental ancestry group; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; esophagus tumor; exome; genetics; middle aged; penetrance; tumor suppressor gene; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; BRCA2 Protein; China; Cohort Studies; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Exome; Female; Genes, BRCA2; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germ-Line Mutation; Humans; Loss of Heterozygosity; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation, Missense; Pedigree; Penetrance"
"Validation of the LOCOMO-25 and its minimum clinically important differences in domain scores for Chinese patients with low back pain and neck pain",2019,"Background: The 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (LOCOMO-25) was developed to assess any decline in mobility functions. This study aims to validate the LOCOMO-25 in Chinese patients with chronic low back pain and/or neck pain. Methods: Adult patients with chronic low back pain and/or neck pain completed the LOCOMO-25, SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, ODI, VAS and/or NDI. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α). Test-retest reliability was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients. Construct validity was assessed by Spearman correlation tests against other outcome measures. Sensitivity to detect differences between groups was assessed by Mann–Whitney U or Kruskal–Wallis H test, where appropriate. Intergroup comparison was performed further in terms of domain scores and their changes at test-retest. Results: A total of 111 patients were consecutively recruited. LOCOMO-25 demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.915) and test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation: 0.705 to 0.826). LOCOMO-25 was significantly correlated with all domains of SF-36, EQ-5D, ODI, NDI, and VAS (p < 0.01). It was found to be sensitive in differentiating between patients with neural compression (32.8 ± 16.9) and without (21.2 ± 12.7), with history of fall(s) within the previous one year (30.8 ± 16.0) and without (24.2 ± 15.1), requires assistive devices for ambulation (40.6 ± 21.6) or independent (23.6 ± 13.1) and various pain levels (mild: 17.2 ± 10.6; moderate: 23.5 ± 11.7; severe: 38.5 ± 16.5). Patients with neural compression scored significantly higher in the domain of pain and patients requiring assistive devices for ambulation scored significantly higher in the domains of ADL and social functions. The minimum detectable differences for various domains of the LOCOMO-25 score included pain (2.76), activities of daily living (6.07), social function (1.59), and mental health status (2.06). Conclusions: LOCOMO-25 has been validated in Chinese patients with chronic low back and neck pain with satisfactory psychometric properties, and with individual domain minimum clinically important differences. There is adequate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity and sensitivity to detect differences between patients with/without neural compression, different ambulatory statuses and pain severity. ? 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association","25 question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale; adult; aged; Article; Chinese; construct validity; daily life activity; disease duration; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; geriatric assessment; health program; health survey; human; internal consistency; low back pain; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental health; minimum detectable change; motor dysfunction assessment; Neck Disability Index; neck pain; Oswestry Disability Index; outcome assessment; prospective study; Short Form 36; social status; test retest reliability; visual analog scale"
"Molecular biomarkers for prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor",2019,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the development of molecular markers, especially circulating biomarkers, remains largely undone for the prognosis of GIST. We discussed the clinical-pathological characteristics of GIST and identified potential biomarkers for guidance of therapy and prognosis of GIST. Around 90% of GISTs contain mutations in KIT or PDGFRA and the remaining 10% of GISTs are wild-type. Recent studies have indicated that various DNAs and miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis of GIST, including KIT, PDGFRA, other DNAs (such as BRAF, SDH, SETD2 and ROR2), and microRNAs (miRNAs). The pressing need and challenges in the development of circulating prognostic biomarkers for GIST are also discussed. Although challenges remain, DNAs and miRNAs are promising circulating biomarkers for surveillance and prognosis of GIST. Advances in clarification of aberrant molecular alterations may open new avenues for exploration of reliable and robust biomarkers to improve the management of GIST. ? 2018, Federaci?n de Sociedades Espa?olas de Oncolog?a (FESEO).","2 methylacyl coenzyme A racemase; B Raf kinase; circulating tumor DNA; imatinib; microRNA; microRNA 221; microRNA 222; molecular marker; phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein; platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor; protein serine threonine kinase; protein tyrosine kinase; receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor; somatomedin C receptor; STAT3 protein; succinate dehydrogenase; sulfaethidole; tumor marker; tumor marker; adjuvant chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cancer tissue; DNA methylation; exosome; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; gastrointestinal tract; gene deletion; gene expression; gene mutation; gene overexpression; human; immunohistochemistry; interstitial cell of Cajal; metastasis; next generation sequencing; protein expression; recurrence free survival; Review; tumor microenvironment; upregulation; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; genetics; mortality; pathology; prognosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; Humans; Prognosis"
"Hepatitis B core-related antigen levels after HBeAg seroconversion is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is a novel serological marker for hepatitis B virus infection. Its clinical significance after HBeAg seroconversion has not been defined. We aimed to determine the relationship between HBcrAg levels after spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 207 chronic hepatitis B patients with documented time of HBeAg seroconversion were enrolled. HBcrAg and HBsAg were checked within 3?years (as baseline), at 5 and 10?years after HBeAg seroconversion. HBV DNA was measured at the baseline. Multivariate Cox regression model was used to investigate the predictors for HCC development. The median follow-up time was 13.1 (11.8-15.5) years. Fourteen patients developed HCC (15-year cumulative incidence: 7%). The median level of HBcrAg at baseline was significantly higher in patients who developed HCC when compared with patients without HCC (5.68 vs 4.78 log U/ml, respectively; P?=.003). Cox proportional hazards model indicated that age of HBeAg seroconversion older than 40?years (hazard ratio (HR): 4.60; P?=.049), presence of baseline cirrhosis (HR: 6.23; P?=.003) and a higher baseline HBcrAg (HR: 1.75; P?=.032) were independently associated with HCC development. A cut-off value of baseline HBcrAg level ?5.21 log U/mL yielded an AUROC of 0.74 with a negative predictive value of 97.7%. High HBcrAg levels within 3?years after HBeAg seroconversion were independently associated with the development of HCC in chronic hepatitis B patients. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; adult; area under the curve; Article; cancer incidence; cancer inhibition; comorbidity; controlled study; female; follow up; hazard ratio; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; seroconversion"

"Is the treatment outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma inferior in elderly patients?",2019,"In view of the increasing life expectancy in different parts of the world, a larger proportion of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requiring oncological treatment is expected. The clinicopathological characteristics of HCC in elderly patients and in younger patients are different. Elderly patients, in general, also have more comorbidities. Evaluation of the efficacy of different HCC treatment options in elderly patients is necessary to optimize treatment outcomes for them. Treatment modalities for HCC include hepatectomy, liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and molecular-targeted therapy with sorafenib. In this review, current evidence on the risks and outcomes of the different HCC treatments for elderly patients are discussed. According to data in the literature, elderly patients and younger patients benefited similarly from HCC treatments. More clinical data are needed for the determination of selecting criteria on elderly HCC patients to maximize their chance of getting the most appropriate and effective treatments. As such, further studies evaluating the outcomes of different HCC treatment modalities in elderly patients are warranted. ?The Author(s) 2019.","checkpoint kinase inhibitor; sorafenib; antineoplastic agent; cancer immunotherapy; chemoembolization; evidence based medicine; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver resection; liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation; Review; treatment outcome; age; aged; comorbidity; comparative study; disease free survival; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; molecularly targeted therapy; mortality; patient selection; procedures; survival rate; treatment outcome; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; Comorbidity; Disease-Free Survival; Hepatectomy; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Middle Aged; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Patient Selection; Radiofrequency Ablation; Sorafenib; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"
"Characteristics, mechanism and long-term ablation outcome of atrial tachycardias after mitral valvular surgery and concomitant Cox-MAZE IV procedure",2019,"The incidence of atrial tachycardia (AT) after rheumatic mitral valvular (RMV) surgery has been well described. However, there have been few reports on the characteristics, mechanism, and long-term ablation outcome of ATs after RMV surgery and concomitant Cox-MAZE IV procedure. The present study reviewed consecutive patients who underwent AT ablation between May 2008 and July 2013. All patients were refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and had a history of RMV surgery and Cox- MAZE IV procedure. A total of 34 patients underwent AT ablation after RMV surgery and concomitant Cox- MAZE IV procedure, and presented 57 mappable and 2 unmappable ATs. The 57 mappable ATs included 14 focal-ATs and 43 reentry-ATs. Ten of the 14 focal-like ATs were located at the pulmonary vein (PV) antrum and border of a box lesion. Of the 43 reentry-ATs, 16 were marco-reentrant around the mitral annulus (MA) and 16 around the tricuspid annulus. There were 41 atypical ATs (non-cavotricuspid isthmus related) including 16 ATs related to the box lesion and 21 ATs related to other Cox-MAZE IV lesions. The AT were successfully terminated in 33 (97.1%) patients. After mean follow-up of 46.9 ± 15.7 months, 25 (73.5%) patients maintained sinus rhythm without AADs after a single procedure and 28 (82.4%) patients after repeated procedures. The recurrent ATs after RMV surgery and concomitant Cox-MAZE IV were mainly reentry mechanism, and largely related to LA. An incomplete lesion or re-conductive gaps in a prior lesion might be the predominant mechanisms for these ATs. Catheter-based mapping and ablation of these ATs seems to be effective and safe during a long-term follow-up. ? 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

"Psychometric validation of the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire in patients with spondyloarthritis",2019,"Background: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) has a significant impact on patients' quality of life due to functional impairments. Generic health instruments like the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) is important for the cost-utility analysis of health care interventions and calculation of quality-adjusted life years. However, the applicability of the EQ-5D health measure in Chinese patients with SpA is currently unknown. Hence, the aim of the study is to test the psychometric properties and to validate the use of the EQ-5D health measure for utility analyses in Chinese patients with SpA. Methods: Prospective and consecutive recruitment of 220 Chinese patients with SpA was conducted. Demographic data including smoking and drinking habits, education level, income, and occupation was collected. Disease-associated data including disease duration, the presence of back pain, peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease was also recorded. Questionnaires regarding disease activity and functional disability (BASDAI, BASFI, BASGI, BASMI, ASDAS, ODI), mental health (HADS depression and anxiety), and the EQ-5D scores were recorded. SF-36 scores were used to verify the findings. Baseline correlations were performed along with test-retest reliability, validity, and internal consistency tests. Specifically, the relationship between EQ-5D and disease activity and functional scores was studied. Results: EQ-5D scores achieved acceptable internal consistency and reliability. A ceiling effect was observed for all domains of the EQ-5D except for pain/discomfort. No floor effect was observed. Significant negative correlations were observed between ODI, HADS, BASFI, BASMI, BASDAI, and ASDAS-CRP and with EQ-5D. A higher disease activity was well-differentiated by EQ-5D, as with the disability and mental health scores. Conclusions: The EQ-5D demonstrates satisfactory psychometric properties for assessment of SpA patients. It has high utility for demonstrating changes in disease activity and disability. ? 2019 The Author(s).","C reactive protein; adult; Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score; anxiety; Article; backache; Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index; Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index; Chinese; controlled study; dactylitis; demography; depression; disease activity; disease duration; drinking behavior; educational status; enthesitis; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; functional assessment; functional disease; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; income; inflammatory bowel disease; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; occupation; Oswestry Disability Index; prospective study; psoriasis; psychometry; questionnaire; Short Form 36; smoking; spondylarthritis; test retest reliability; uveitis; validation study"

"Exome sequencing identifies molecular diagnosis in children with drug-resistant epilepsy",2019,"Objective: Early onset drug-resistant epilepsy is a neurologic disorder in which 2 antiepileptic drugs fail to maintain the seizure-free status of the patient. Heterogeneous clinical presentations make the diagnosis challenging. We aim to identify the underlying genetic causes of a pediatric cohort with drug-resistant epilepsy and evaluate whether the findings can provide information on patient management. Methods: We include patients with drug-resistant epilepsy onset before 18?years of age. Singleton clinical chromosomal microarray (CMA) followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed using genomic DNA. In the first-tier analysis of the exome data, we aimed to identify disease-causing mutations in 546 genes known to cause, or to be associated with, epilepsy. For negative cases, we proceeded to exome-wide analysis. Rare coding variants were interrogated for pathogenicity based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Results: We recruited 50 patients. We identified 6 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations, giving a diagnostic yield of 12%. Mutations were found in 6 different genes: SCN8A, SCN1A, MECP2, CDKL5, DEPDC5, and CHD2. The CDKL5 variant was found to be mosaic. One variant of unknown significance (VUS) in KCNT1 was found in a patient with compatible clinical features. Of note, a reported pathogenic SCN5A mutation known to contribute to Brugada syndrome, was also found in the patient with an SCN1A mutation. Significance: Our study suggests that singleton WES is an effective diagnostic tool for drug-resistant epilepsy. Genetic diagnosis can help to consolidate the clinical diagnosis, to facilitate phenotypic expansion, and to influence treatment and management options for seizure control in our patients. In our study, a significant portion of the genetic findings are known to be associated with an increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). These findings could assist with more appropriate management in patients with epilepsy. ? 2018 The Authors.

"SF-6D utility scores of smokers and ex-smokers with or without respiratory symptoms attending primary care clinics",2019,"Introduction: The aim of this paper is to find out generic preference-based Short-Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D) utility scores of smokers and ex-smokers with varying cigarette exposure, with and without respiratory symptoms. Methods: Seven hundred thirty one people aged ?30 with a history of smoking who attended 5 public primary care clinics completed a cross-sectional survey using SF-6D utility score, Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale (BCSS?) and office spirometry. Results: Most of the subjects were men (92.5%) in an older age group (mean age 62.2 ± 11.7 years). About half of them (48.3%) were current smokers while the other half (51.7%) were ex-smokers. More than half of them (54.2%) reported mild respiratory symptoms (mean BCSS score 0.95 ± 1.12). The most common symptoms were sputum (45.1%), followed by cough (34.2%) and breathlessness (6.0%). The SF-6D overall utility score was 0.850 ± 0.106. The subjects reported significantly lower SF-6D scores when they had breathlessness (0.752 ± 0.138; p = < 0.001), cough (0.836 ± 0.107; p = 0.007), sputum (0.838 ± 0.115; p = 0.004) or any of the above symptom (0.837 ± 0.113; p < 0.001). In both groups of current smokers and ex-smokers, there was no statistically significant difference in the scores among light, moderate or heavy smokers. In the Tobit regression model of factors affecting SF-6D utility score, subjects who reported more respiratory symptoms (i.e. higher BCSS?) had lower SF-6D scores (B = - 0.018 ± 0.007, p < 0.001), while men had higher SF-6D scores than women (B = 0.037 ± 0.031, p = 0.019). Subjects who attended middle or high school had higher SF-6D score than those attended the University or above. The presence of airflow obstruction was not associated with the score. Conclusions: The study yielded SF-6D utility scores of smokers and ex-smokers with different reported cigarette exposure, which could be useful in future clinical studies and cost-effectiveness analysis. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; airway obstruction; Article; cigarette smoking; clinical feature; controlled study; coughing; dyspnea; ex-smoker; exposure; female; functional status assessment; human; male; middle aged; primary medical care; quality of life; respiratory system; Short Form 6 Dimensions utility score; smoking; spirometry; sputum analysis; aged; complication; cost benefit analysis; cross-sectional study; health status indicator; primary health care; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; smoking; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Cough; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dyspnea; Ex-Smokers; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Quality of Life; Smokers; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Anti-cancer activities of S-allylmercaptocysteine from aged garlic",2019,"While most types of malignancies remain recalcitrant to treatment, application of natural products or their analogs in daily life has offered some hopes as an effective prophylaxis against cancer onset and progression in the past decades. Emerging evidence supports a link between garlic consumption and decreased cancer incidence. Notably, aged garlic extract (AGE) exhibits stronger anti-cancer activities than that of fresh garlic, by virtue of enrichment of several AGE-specific organosulfur compounds, including S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC). In this review, we summarize the up-to-date mechanistic pathways associated with the anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic and pro-apoptotic effects of SAMC in various cancer models. Based upon the proven safety and improved understanding on its anti-neoplastic properties, SAMC has gained recognition as a promising daily food supplement for cancer prevention or management. ? 2019 China Pharmaceutical University","aged garlic extract; cysteine derivative; garlic extract; organosulfur derivative; s allylmercaptocysteine; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; cysteine; S-allylmercaptocysteine; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer inhibition; cancer model; cancer prevention; cancer therapy; colon cancer; dietary supplement; drug effect; drug mechanism; erythroleukemia; garlic; human; liver cancer; lung cancer; metastasis inhibition; nonhuman; ovary cancer; proapoptotic activity; prostate cancer; stomach cancer; thyroid cancer; analogs and derivatives; animal; apoptosis; chemical structure; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; metabolism; neoplasm; signal transduction; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Cysteine; Disease Models, Animal; Garlic; Humans; Molecular Structure; Neoplasms; Signal Transduction"
"Yeast-produced subunit protein vaccine elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies that protect mice against Zika virus lethal infection",2019,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a serious public health concern due to its ability to induce neurological defects and its potential for rapid transmission at a global scale. However, no vaccine is currently available to prevent ZIKV infection. Here, we report the development of a yeast-derived subunit protein vaccine for ZIKV. The envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV was produced as a secretory protein in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The yeast-derived EDIII could inhibit ZIKV infection in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it had acquired an appropriate conformation to bind to cellular receptors of ZIKV. Immunization with recombinant EDIII protein effectively induced antigen-specific binding antibodies and cellular immune responses. The resulting anti-EDIII sera could efficiently neutralize ZIKV representative strains from both Asian and African lineages. Passive transfer with the anti-EDIII neutralizing sera could confer protection against lethal ZIKV challenge in mice. Importantly, we found that purified anti-EDIII antibodies did not cross-react with closely related dengue virus (DENV) and therefore did not enhance DENV infection. Collectively, our results demonstrate that yeast-produced EDIII is a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine candidate. ? 2019 The Authors","envelope protein; neutralizing antibody; Zika virus vaccine; animal experiment; animal model; antigen binding; Article; cellular immunity; controlled study; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; vaccine production; yeast; Zika fever"

"Chronic hepatitis B and metabolic risk factors: A call for rigorous longitudinal studies",2019,"Long-term nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is effective in suppressing viral replication and reducing liver-related complications. However, HBV-related liver events can still occur in different patient sub-groups. There is emerging evidence that, similar to chronic hepatitis C virus infection, metabolic risk factors may play a role in the disease process of chronic HBV. While the mechanistic nature of metabolic-HBV interactions remains uncertain, studies in different HBV-infected populations have demonstrated that hepatic steatosis, increased body-mass index, diabetes, or a combination of different metabolic risk factors are associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. The impact of metabolic risk factors is especially prominent in patients with quiescent virological activity, including on-treatment patients with effective viral suppression. As the proportion of on-treatment chronic HBV patients increases worldwide, longitudinal studies determining the relative risks of different metabolic parameters with respect to clinical outcomes are needed. Future studies should also determine if metabolic-directed interventions can improve disease outcomes in chronic HBV. ? The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

"Real-time estimation of the influenza-associated excess mortality in hong kong",2019,"Statistical models are commonly employed in the estimation of influenza-associated excess mortality that, due to various reasons, is often underestimated by laboratory-confirmed influenza deaths reported by healthcare facilities. However, methodology for timely and reliable estimation of that impact remains limited because of the delay in mortality data reporting. We explored real-time estimation of influenza-associated excess mortality by types/subtypes in each year between 2012 and 2018 in Hong Kong using linear regression models fitted to historical mortality and influenza surveillance data. We could predict that during the winter of 2017/2018, there were ?634 (95% confidence interval (CI): (190, 1033)) influenza-associated excess all-cause deaths in Hong Kong in population ?18 years, compared to 259 reported laboratory-confirmed deaths. We estimated that influenza was associated with substantial excess deaths in older adults, suggesting the implementation of control measures, such as administration of antivirals and vaccination, in that age group. The approach that we developed appears to provide robust real-time estimates of the impact of influenza circulation and complement surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed deaths. These results improve our understanding of the impact of influenza epidemics and provide a practical approach for a timely estimation of the mortality burden of influenza circulation during an ongoing epidemic. ?

"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals the landscape of intra-tumoral heterogeneity and stemness-related subpopulations in liver cancer",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is heterogeneous, rendering its current curative treatments ineffective. The emergence of single-cell genomics represents a powerful strategy in delineating the complex molecular landscapes of cancers. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility and merit of using single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect the intra-tumoral heterogeneity and analyze the single-cell transcriptomic landscape to detect rare cell subpopulations of significance. Exploration of the inter-relationship among liver cancer stem cell markers showed two distinct major cell populations according to EPCAM expression, and the EPCAM+ cells had upregulated expression of multiple oncogenes. We also identified a CD24+/CD44+-enriched cell subpopulation within the EPCAM+ cells which had specific signature genes and might indicate a novel stemness-related cell subclone in HCC. Notably, knockdown of signature gene CTSE for CD24+/CD44+ cells significantly reduced self-renewal ability on HCC cells in vitro and the stemness-related role of CTSE was further confirmed by in vivo tumorigenicity assays in nude mice. In summary, single-cell genomics is a useful tool to delineate HCC intratumoral heterogeneity at better resolution. It can identify rare but important cell subpopulations, and may guide better precision medicine in the long run. ? 2019","cathepsin E; CD24 antigen; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; Hermes antigen; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer stem cell; carcinogenicity; cell heterogeneity; cell subpopulation; controlled study; CTSE gene; feasibility study; fluorescence activated cell sorting; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; human; human cell; in vitro study; liver cancer; liver carcinogenesis; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; oncogene; personalized medicine; priority journal; protein expression; RNA sequence; single cell analysis; stem cell self-renewal; transcriptomics; upregulation"

Ten studies with a total of 536 adolescent and adult patients were included, of which 5 evaluated RA deformation, 2 studied LA deformation and 3 assessed deformation of both atria. Seven studies used speckle tracking echocardiography, 2 employed tissue Doppler imaging and 1 applied cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking. Main findings were (i) reduced regional and/or global RA and LA strain and strain rate consistent with reduced conduit, reservoir and contractile function of the two atria in patients; (ii) associations between RA and LA deformation indices suggestive of atrial–atrial interaction; and (iii) relationships between RA deformation and indices of right ventricular systolic and diastolic function.

"TSPYL2 is a novel regulator of SIRT1 and p300 activity in response to DNA damage",2019,"Protein acetylation and deacetylation events are finely regulated by lysine-acetyl-transferases and lysine-deacetylases and constitute an important tool for the activation or inhibition of specific cellular pathways. One of the most important lysine-acetyl-transferases is p300, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell growth, DNA repair, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. A well-known target of p300 is constituted by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability and whose activity is known to be controlled by post-translational modifications, among which acetylation. p300 activity toward p53 is negatively regulated by the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which deacetylates p53 preventing its transcriptional activation and the induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. However, the mechanisms responsible for p53 regulation by p300 and SIRT1 are still poorly understood. Here we identify the nucleosome assembly protein TSPY-Like 2 (TSPYL2, also known as TSPX, DENTT, and CDA1) as a novel regulator of SIRT1 and p300 function. We demonstrate that, upon DNA damage, TSPYL2 inhibits SIRT1, disrupting its association with target proteins, and promotes p300 acetylation and activation, finally stimulating p53 acetylation and p53-dependent cell death. Indeed, in response to DNA damage, cells silenced for TSPYL2 were found to be defective in p53 activation and apoptosis induction and these events were shown to be dependent on SIRT1 and p300 function. Collectively, our results shed new light on the regulation of p53 acetylation and activation and reveal a novel TSPYL2 function with important implications in cancerogenesis. ? 2018, ADMC Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare.","E1A associated p300 protein; nuclear protein; nucleosome assembly protein 1; protein p53; sirtuin 1; testis specific protein Y encoded like 2; unclassified drug; apoptosis; Article; carcinogenesis; cell death; controlled study; DNA damage; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme regulation; human; human cell; priority journal; protein acetylation; protein function; protein targeting"
"Associations of growth from birth to puberty with glycemic indicators at ~17.5 years: Evidence from Hong Kong's “Children of 1997” birth cohort",2019,"Background: From an evolutionary biology perspective, where growth and reproduction trade-off against longevity, we assessed the associations of growth from birth to puberty by phase with later glycemic indicators and any differences by sex. Methods: In the population-representative Hong Kong Chinese “Children of 1997” birth cohort (n = 8327), the relation of initial size (weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at birth, length/height-for-age z score (LAZ) at 3 months or body-mass-index-for-age z score (BAZ) at 3 months based on the World Health Organization growth standards/references) and growth at different phases (WAZ gains from 0 to 2 and 2 to 8 years, LAZ or BAZ gains from 3 months to 3 years, 3 to 8 years and 8 to 14 years) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at ~17.5 years, was assessed using adjusted partial least squares regression. Additional analyses further considered growth in late and early infancy. Results: This study included 3276 of the cohort participants. Higher WAZ gain from 2 to 8 years, LAZ and BAZ gains from 3 to 8 years were consistently associated with higher FPG, adjusted for maternal and infant characteristics, family history of diabetes and household income. Also, higher BAZ gain from 3 to 8 years was associated with higher HbA1c. These associations did not differ by sex. Conclusions: Our findings suggest different mechanisms could underlie the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance. Factors that drive specific growth at different phases need to be evaluated to better inform child growth management for long-term health outcomes. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Establishing Pure Cancer Organoid Cultures: Identification, Selection and Verification of Cancer Phenotypes and Genotypes",2019,"Precision medicine requires in vitro models which will both faithfully recapitulate the features of an individual's disease and enable drug testing on a wide variety of samples covering the greatest range of phenotypes possible for a particular disease. Organoid technology has immense potential to fulfill this demand, but it will be necessary to develop robust protocols that enable the generation of organoids in a dependable manner from nearly every patient. Here we provide a user's guide, including detailed step-by-step protocols, to the establishment, isolation and verification of gastric cancer organoids. Selection strategies include omission of growth factors, addition of drugs, isolation of distinct phenotypes and generation of monoclonal lines. For confirmation of cancer identity, we use sequencing, drug selection, karyotyping and histology. While we specify these protocols for human gastric cancer organoids here, the methods described are applicable to organoids derived from other tissues as well. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","growth factor; Article; cancer cell culture; cancer organoid culture; cancer tissue; clinical protocol; controlled study; drug choice; genotype; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; isolation procedure; karyotyping; organoid; phenotype; practice guideline; priority journal; sequence analysis; stomach cancer"
"Cell lineage-specific genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of patients with paediatric-onset systemic lupus erythematosus",2019,"Patients with paediatric-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) often present with more severe clinical courses than adult-onset patients. Although genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling has been performed in adult-onset SLE patients, parallel data on paediatric-onset SLE are not available. Therefore, we undertook a genome-wide DNAm study in paediatric-onset SLE patients across multiple blood cell lineages. The DNAm profiles of four purified immune cell lineages (CD4?+?T cells, CD8?+?T cells, B cells and neutrophils) and whole blood were compared in 16 Chinese patients with paediatric-onset SLE and 13 healthy controls using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. Comparison of DNAm in whole blood and within each independent cell lineage identified a consistent pattern of loss of DNAm at 21 CpG sites overlapping 15 genes, which represented a robust, disease-specific DNAm signature for paediatric-onset SLE in our cohort. In addition, cell lineage-specific changes, involving both loss and gain of DNAm, were observed in both novel genes and genes with well-described roles in SLE pathogenesis. This study also highlights the importance of studying DNAm changes in different immune cell lineages rather than only whole blood, since cell type-specific DNAm changes facilitated the elucidation of the cell type-specific molecular pathophysiology of SLE. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescent; Article; B lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell lineage; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; DNA microarray; female; gain of function mutation; gene ontology; genome-wide association study; human; loss of function mutation; male; neutrophil; pyrosequencing; systemic lupus erythematosus"

The time required for volumetric assessments was evaluated statistically with respect to the potential influence of gender, age, sinus side, sinus volume, sequence of measurement, and selection threshold of the software. The resulting average sinus volume of the 174 sinuses from 87 patients was 16.9 cm3. The average time required to measure one sinus volume was 91.8 s. Sinuses from male patients required a longer time (median of 95.5 s) for the measurements than their female counterparts (median of 87.5 s). Measurement time increased with increasing age, sinus volume and selection threshold based on calculated grey values provided by the software. The volumetric measurements and measurement times exhibited a high intra-observer agreement. The volumetric measurements were highly reproducible. Each measurement was completed within 4 minutes, though there was a marked difference in the mean measurement time between the two observers. Semi-automated volumetric measurement of the maxillary sinus with commercially available software is feasible, efficient, and reproducible. Based on these favorable findings, practitioners might consider using such volumetric instead of linear measurements to plan and analyse outcomes of sinus grafting procedures in daily clinical practice.","adult; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; female; human; male; maxillary sinus; software; Adult; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Female; Humans; Male; Maxillary Sinus; Software; Spiral Cone-Beam Computed Tomography"
"Associations between commuting and well-being in the context of a compact city with a well-developed public transport system",2019,"Introduction: Negative impacts of long commuting time on people's well-being have been found in many suburbanized private car-dominant cities. However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding this association in a compact city with a well-developed public transport system. Taking Hong Kong as an example, the current study aims to explore the associations between modes of transport and commuting time with well-being. Methods: The study used the data of 990 commuters from the first wave of the Hong Kong Panel Survey for Poverty Alleviation in 2015. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to test the associations of commuting time and commuting modes with well-being. The well-being outcomes included obesity measured by self-reported body mass index (BMI), mental distress (CHQ-12), self-rated health (SRH) and satisfaction with life (SWLS-5). Results: After the confounding variables were adjusted, significant association have been found between commuting time and satisfaction with life [-0.14, 95% CI: (?0.03, ?0.00)]. More specifically, those who commute 60–89 min [-1.57, 95% CI: (?2.98, ?0.16)], 90–119 min [-2.36, 95% CI (?4.56, ?0.16)] and 120 min or more [-4.85, 95% CI (?9.11, ?0.59)] report significantly lower satisfaction with life than those who commute within 30 min. Moreover, excessive commuting time (90–119 min) has been found significantly associated with obesity with an odd ratio of 2.80 [95% CI: (1.30–6.04)]. Conclusions: In Hong Kong, commuting time over 60 min is associated with negative satisfaction with life, and commuting time over 90 min is associated with higher risk of obesity. Policymakers of a compact city with a well-developed transport system should be informed of the negative impacts of long commuting time on well-being. ? 2019",""
"Transitioning into spousal caregiving: Contribution of caregiving intensity and caregivers' multiple chronic conditions to functional health",2019,"Background both caregiving intensity and caregivers' multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) are important aspects of caregiving that might affect the health and well-being of older spousal caregivers, but few investigations have simultaneously modelled their impact during the transition into spousal caregiving. Objective to examine the differential effects of caregiving intensity and caregivers' MCCs on functional health over time among individuals entering the spousal caregiver role. Methods a total of 1,866 non-caregivers at the baseline were followed over a 4-year period (2011-2015). The effects of transitioning into caregiving (transitioned into low-intensity and transitioned into high-intensity versus never-caregiver) and caregivers' MCCs (reported before and during the transitioning period versus no MCCs) on functional health at the follow-up were estimated using mixed-effects regression models. Results transitioning into spousal caregiving was associated with a decline in functional health, particularly for those transitioned into high-intensity caregiving, and for those who reported MCCs when transitioning into the caregiver role. The association between transitioning into spousal caregiving and functional decline was strongest for high-intensity caregivers reporting MCCs when transitioning into caregiving, followed by low-intensity caregivers reporting MCCs when transitioning into caregiving. Conclusion the results highlight the contribution of transitioning into high-intensity caregiving and caregivers' MCCs to the functional health decline of spousal caregivers. Caregiver support interventions should target spousal caregivers who have newly entered a demanding caregiving role; clinical attention should be emphasised for the development of caregivers' own MCCs coinciding with the transitioning period. ?

"Cultural differences in humor perception, usage, and implications",2019,"Humor is a universal phenomenon but is also culturally tinted. In this article, we reviewed the existing research that investigates how culture impacts individuals' humor perception and usage as well as humor's implications for psychological well-being. Previous research has substantiated evidence that Easterners do not hold as positive an attitude toward humor as their Western counterparts do. This perception makes Easterners less likely to use humor as a coping strategy in comparison with Westerners. Despite this difference, Westerners and Easterners have similar patterns in the relationship between their humor and psychological well-being index, though the strength of the relationship varies across cultures. Implications and potential future research avenues discussed. ? 2019 Jiang, Li and Hou.",""
"Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rats (Rattus spp.) from the Hainan Province, China: Molecular detection, species/genotype identification and implications for public health",2019,"Wild rats (Rattus spp.) carry many zoonotic pathogens including Cryptosporidium. Due to the close proximity of rats to humans in urban environments, the potential for disease transmission is high. Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite which when ingested causes serious human illness. Despite its importance, genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium in wild rats in the Hainan province of China has not been performed. In this study, we analyzed the occurrence and genetics of Cryptosporidium in wild rats from Hainan, China. From December 2017 to October 2018, 150 wild rats were captured and fresh fecal material was collected from intestinal sections. Rat species were identified by PCR-based amplification and analysis of the vertebrate cytochrome b (cytb) gene. Cryptosporidium was examined by PCR amplification of the partial small subunit of ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). C. viatorum were subtyped by PCR analysis of the gp60 gene. A total of four rat species were identified including Asian house rats (Rattus tanezumi) (n = 46), brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) (n = 56), Edward's long-tailed rats (Leopoldamys edwardsi) (n = 38) and muridae (Niviventer fulvescens) (n = 10), with Cryptosporidium positive rates of 73.9%, 28.6%, 55.3% and 40.0%, respectively (average infection rate: 50.0%, 75/150. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of four Cryptosporidium species and two genotypes including C. viatorum (n = 11); C. occultus (n = 2); C. muris (n = 1); and C. erinacei (n = 1); rat genotypes III (n = 13) and IV (n = 47). Three novel subtypes of C. viatorum were identified in 6 of the 11 infected Edward's long-tailed rats: XVcA2G1a (n = 4), XVcA2G1b (n = 1) and XVdA3 (n = 1). The identification of human pathogenic C. viatorum and zoonotic C. occultus, C. muris and C. erinacei, suggested that wild rats infected with Cryptosporidium pose a threat to human health. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to control the rat population in Hainan, China. The need to improve the public awareness of the risk of disease transmission from wild rats to humans is also highlighted. ? 2019 The Authors","cytochrome b; Article; bacterium isolation; China; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; Cryptosporidium muris; disease transmission; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; feces analysis; gene expression; gene sequence; genotype; geographic distribution; infection rate; microorganism detection; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; population dynamics; prevalence; public health; rat; sequence analysis; species identification"
"Chronic methylmercury exposure induces production of prostaglandins: Evidence from a population study and a rat dosing experiment",2019,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a well-known environmental neurotoxicant affecting millions worldwide who consume contaminated fishes and other food commodities. Exposure to MeHg has been shown to associate positively with some chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanism is poorly characterized. MeHg had been shown to affect prostaglandin (PG) regulations in in vitro studies, but neither in vivo nor human studies investigating the effects of MeHg on PG regulations has been reported. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the association between MeHg exposure and serum PG concentrations in a cross-sectional study among human adults followed by a validation investigation on the cause-effect relationship usin a rat model. First a total of 121 women were recruited from two cities: Wanshan and Leishan in Guizhou, China. Statistical analysis of the human data showed a positive association between blood total mercury (THg) levels and serum concentrations of PGF2α, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, and PGE2 after adjusting for site effects. In the animal study, adult female Sprague?Dawley rats were dosed with 40 μg MeHg/kg body weight/day for 12 weeks. Serum 15-deoxy-PGJ2 and 2,3d-6-keto-PGF1α concentrations were found to increase significantly after 6 and 10 weeks of MeHg dosing, respectively, while serum PGF2α concentration increased significantly after 12 weeks of MeHg dosing. Combined results of our human and rat studies have shown that chronic MeHg exposure induced dysregulation of PG metabolism. As PGs are a set of mediators with very diverse functions, its abnormal production may serve as the missing mechanistic link between chronic MeHg exposure and various kinds of associated clinical conditions including neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases. ? 2019 American Chemical Society","Cardiology; Mercury compounds; Rats; Abnormal production; Cardio-vascular disease; Cause-effect relationships; Clinical conditions; Cross-sectional study; Neurodegeneration; Population studies; Serum concentration; Sprague-Dawley rats; Neurodegenerative diseases; 15 deoxy delta12,14 prostaglandin J2; 6 oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha; leukotriene A4; mercury; methylmercury; prostacyclin; prostaglandin; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2 alpha; thromboxane A2; thromboxane B2; mercury; methylmercury derivative; prostaglandin; bioaccumulation; experimental study; metabolism; methylmercury; organic compound; physiological response; pollution effect; pollution exposure; rodent; serum; blood; cardiovascular disease; concentration (composition); laboratory method; toxicity; animal experiment; animal model; arachidonic acid metabolism; Article; blood level; China; controlled study; female; hormone metabolism; human; liquid chromatography; long term exposure; maternal plasma; metabolomics; nonhuman; normal human; population research; prostaglandin blood level; prostaglandin release; rat; adult; animal; cross-sectional study; environmental monitoring; Oryza; Sprague Dawley rat; China; Guizhou; Wanshan; Animalia; Pisces; Rattus; Adult; Animals; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Oryza; Prostaglandins; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley"
"Age-Specific Associations of Renal Impairment and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Burden in Chinese with Ischaemic Stroke",2019,"Background: Recent studies in Caucasians with transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke have demonstrated significant age-specific associations between cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) burden on magnetic resonance imaging and renal impairment. We aimed to validate these findings in a large cohort of Chinese with ischaemic stroke. Methods: In 959 Chinese with ischaemic stroke who received a brain magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Hong Kong, we determined the age-specific associations of renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) with neuroimaging markers of SVD as well as with the SVD score. Results: Although renal impairment was associated with the SVD score in univariate analysis in all patients (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.24-2.09, P &lt;.0001), these associations were attenuated after adjusting for age and sex (P =.38). Similar findings were noted in patients with ischaemic stroke due to SVD and non-SVD subtypes. However, in 222 of 959 patients aged &lt;60, renal impairment was independently associated with an increasing microbleed (adjusted odds ratio 6.82, 2.26-20.59), subcortical (4.97, 1.62-15.24) periventricular white matter hyperintensity (3.96, 1.08-14.51) and global SVD burden (3.41, 1.16-10.04; all P &lt;.05) even after adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Nevertheless, there were no associations between renal impairment and individual neuroimaging markers of SVD nor with the SVD score in patients aged ?60 after adjusting for age and sex (all P &gt;.05). Conclusions: In Chinese with ischaemic stroke, renal impairment was independently associated with microbleed, white matter hyperintensity and global SVD burden in individuals aged &lt;60, but not in those aged ?60, suggesting that there may be shared susceptibilities to premature systemic disease. ? 2019 The Authors","danaparoid; age; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular disease; Chinese; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease burden; ethnic difference; female; glomerulus filtration rate; human; kidney dysfunction; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perivascular space; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; white matter; age; Asian continental ancestry group; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; epidemiology; ethnology; glomerulus filtration rate; Hong Kong; kidney; kidney disease; middle aged; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; very elderly; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Brain Ischemia; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Hong Kong; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke"
"Identification and characterization of GLDC as host susceptibility gene to severe influenza",2019,"Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) was prioritized as a candidate susceptibility gene to severe influenza in humans. The higher expression of GLDC derived from genetic variations may confer a higher risk to H7N9 and severe H1N1 infection. We sought to characterize GLDC as functional susceptibility gene that GLDC may intrinsically regulate antiviral response, thereby impacting viral replication and disease outcome. We demonstrated that GLDC inhibitor AOAA and siRNA depletion boosted IFNβ- and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in combination with PolyI:C stimulation. GLDC inhibition and depletion significantly amplified antiviral response of type I IFNs and ISGs upon viral infection and suppressed the replication of H1N1 and H7N9 viruses. Consistently, GLDC overexpression significantly promoted viral replication due to the attenuated antiviral responses. Moreover, GLDC inhibition in H1N1-infected BALB/c mice recapitulated the amplified antiviral response and suppressed viral growth. AOAA provided potent protection to the infected mice from lethal infection, comparable to a standard antiviral against influenza viruses. Collectively, GLDC regulates cellular antiviral response and orchestrates viral growth. GLDC is a functional susceptibility gene to severe influenza in humans. ? 2018 The Authors.

"A brief mindfulness-based family psychoeducation intervention for Chinese young adults with first episode psychosis: A study protocol",2019,"Family psychoeducation (FPE) has been recommended as a major component in the treatment of psychosis. Many previous studies have implemented an intensive program design that often only emphasized improvements in patients' illness outcomes but the benefits for caregivers were limited. There have been calls for a time-limited but cost-effective FPE program to mitigate the looming reality of the suffering of people with psychosis and their families. A Brief Mindfulness-Based Family Psychoeducation for psychosis program is developed to reduce caregivers' burden and promote young adult's recovery. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare this intervention with an ordinary FPE intervention. Both arms will involve six sessions, with a total contact time of 12 h. 300 caregivers of young adults who have experienced first episode psychosis within last 3 years will be recruited. Program effectiveness will be assessed by comparing outcomes measuring the caregivers' burden, mental health symptoms, positive well-being, and the young adult's mental health symptoms during the study and at 9-month post-randomization. The role of expressed emotions, interpersonal mindfulness, and non-attachment in mediating these outcomes will be explored. An additional qualitative approach Photovoice is selected to explore the complex family experiences and the benefits of mindfulness from the caregivers' personal perspectives. ? 2019 Lo, Ho, Lau, Lo, Mak, Ng, Wong, Wong, Lui, Lo, Lin, Poon, Choi and Leung.",""
"Early diastolic strain rate measurements by cardiac MRI in breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab: a longitudinal study",2019,"We evaluated temporal changes in early diastolic strain rates by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) as an early detector of trastuzumab-induced ventricular dysfunction. We conducted a prospective, multi-centre, longitudinal observational study of 41 trastuzumab-treated breast cancer women who underwent serial CMR (baseline, 6, 12, and 18?months). Two blinded readers independently measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), peak systolic strain parameters (global longitudinal strain [GLS] and global circumferential strain [GCS]), and early diastolic strain rate parameters (global longitudinal diastolic strain rate [GLSR-E], global circumferential diastolic strain rate [GCSR-E], and global radial diastolic strain rate [GRSR-E]), by feature tracking (FT-CMR) using CMR42. There was a significant decline in peak systolic strain GLS and GCS at 6?months (p = 0.024 and p < 0.001, respectively) and 12?months (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively), followed by recovery at 18?months, which paralleled decline in LVEF at 6?months (p = 0.034) and 12?months (p = 0.012). Conversely, early diastolic strain rates GLSR-E and GCSR-E did not significantly change over 18?months (p > 0.10), while GRSR-E was marginally significant at 12?months (p = 0.021). There was no significant correlation between changes at 6?months in LVEF and GLSR-E or GRSR-E (p > 0.10), and a marginally significant weak correlation between LVEF and GCSR-E (p = 0.046). Among trastuzumab-treated patients without overt cardiotoxicity, there was no consistent temporal change in FT-CMR-derived diastolic strain rate parameters up to 18?months, in contrast to decline in systolic strain and LVEF. Systolic strains by FT-CMR are likely more useful than diastolic strain rates for monitoring subclinical trastuzumab-related myocardial dysfunction.

"Genetic landscape of RASopathies in Chinese: Three decades' experience in Hong Kong",2019,"RASopathies are a group of genetic disorders due to dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, which is important in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. These include Noonan syndrome (NS), Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, and Costello syndrome (CS), clinical manifestations include growth retardation, developmental delay, cardiac defects, and specific dysmorphic features. There were abundant publications describing the genotype and phenotype from the Western populations. However, detailed study of RASopathies in Chinese population is lacking. We present here the largest cohort of RASopathies ever reported in Chinese populations, detailing the mutation spectrum and clinical phenotypes of these patients. The Clinical Genetic Service, Department of Health, and Queen Mary Hospital are tertiary referral centers for genetic disorders in Hong Kong. We retrospectively reviewed all the genetically confirmed cases of RASopathies, including NS, NSML, CFC syndrome, and CS, over the past 29 years (from 1989 to 2017). Analyses of the mutation spectrum and clinical phenotypes were performed. One hundred and ninety-one ethnic Chinese patients with genetically confirmed RASopathies were identified, including 148 patients with NS, 23 NSML, 12 CFC syndrome, and eight CS. We found a lower incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in individuals with NSML (27.3%), and NS caused by RAF1 mutations (62.5%). Another significant finding was for those NS patients with myeloproliferative disorder, the mutations fall within Exon 3 of PTPN11 but not only restricted to the well-known hotspots, that is, p.Asp61 and p.Thr731, which suggested that re-evaluation of the current tumor surveillance recommendation maybe warranted. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","aspartic acid; B Raf kinase; K ras protein; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 2; Raf protein; threonine; A2ML1 gene; adolescent; adult; Article; BRAF gene; cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome; child; Chinese; cohort analysis; controlled study; Costello syndrome; exon; experience; female; gene; gene mutation; genetic disorder; Hong Kong; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; incidence; LEOPARD syndrome; major clinical study; male; malformation syndrome; MAP2K1 gene; mutational analysis; myeloproliferative disorder; Noonan syndrome; oncogene H ras; oncogene K ras; oncogene N ras; phenotype; population genetics; PPP1CB gene; priority journal; PTPN11 gene; RAF1 gene; retrospective study; RIT1 gene; SHOC2 gene; SOS1 gene; tertiary care center"
"Serum anti-neuraminidase antibody responses in human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections",2019,"Haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titres are a correlate of protection for influenza virus infection, but several studies have also demonstrated the protective role of anti-neuraminidase (anti-NA) antibodies. However, there is limited data on anti-NA antibody responses in naturally occurring human influenza. We investigated anti-NA antibody responses to pandemic N1 and seasonal N1 in 18 RT–PCR-confirmed patients with naturally acquired pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 disease detected as part of a prospective community study of influenza. There were increases in neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) antibody titres to both pandemic and seasonal N1 antigens, with greater fold increases in those who had low levels of anti-pandemic N1 titres in acute sera. Of 18 patients with pandemic H1N1 infection, fourfold increases in antibody were observed by HAI in 11 (61%) patients, by anti-pandemic N1 inhibition in 13 (72%) or either in 15 of them (83%). Prior seasonal H1N1 virus infections had elicited cross-reactive anti-pandemic N1 antibody titres in some people prior to the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Antibody responses to the anti-N1 pandemic 2009 virus and cross-reactive responses to anti-seasonal N1 antibody were seen in influenza A pandemic 2009 infections.

"Selection for antimicrobial resistance is reduced when embedded in a natural microbial community",2019,"Antibiotic resistance has emerged as one of the most pressing, global threats to public health. In single-species experiments selection for antibiotic resistance occurs at very low antibiotic concentrations. However, it is unclear how far these findings can be extrapolated to natural environments, where species are embedded within complex communities. We competed isogenic strains of Escherichia coli, differing exclusively in a single chromosomal resistance determinant, in the presence and absence of a pig faecal microbial community across a gradient of antibiotic concentration for two relevant antibiotics: gentamicin and kanamycin. We show that the minimal selective concentration was increased by more than one order of magnitude for both antibiotics when embedded in the community. We identified two general mechanisms were responsible for the increase in minimal selective concentration: an increase in the cost of resistance and a protective effect of the community for the susceptible phenotype. These findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution and selection of antibiotic resistance, and can inform future risk assessment efforts on antibiotic concentrations. ? 2019, The Author(s).","antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial activity; coliform bacterium; concentration (composition); experimental study; microbial community; Escherichia coli; Suidae"

"PEC-GRAPPA reconstruction of simultaneous multislice EPI with slice-dependent 2D Nyquist ghost correction",2019,"Purpose: To provide simultaneous multislice (SMS) EPI reconstruction with k-space implementation and robust Nyquist ghost correction. Methods: 2D phase error correction SENSE (PEC-SENSE) was recently developed for Nyquist ghost correction in SMS EPI reconstruction for which virtual coil simultaneous autocalibration and k-space estimation (VC-SAKE) was used to remove slice-dependent Nyquist ghosts and intershot 2D phase variations in multi-shot EPI reference scan. However, masking coil sensitivity maps to exclude background region in PEC-SENSE and manually selecting slice-wise target ranks in VC-SAKE are cumbersome procedures in practice. To avoid masking, the concept of PEC-SENSE is extended to k-space implementation and termed as PEC-GRAPPA. Furthermore, a singular value shrinkage scheme is incorporated in VC-SAKE to circumvent the empirical slice-wise target rank selection. PEC-GRAPPA was evaluated and compared to PEC-SENSE with/without masking and 1D linear phase correction GRAPPA. Results: PEC-GRAPPA robustly reconstructed SMS EPI images from 7T phantom and human brain data, effectively removing the phase error-induced artifacts. The resulting residual artifact level and temporal SNR were comparable to those by PEC-SENSE with careful tuning. PEC-GRAPPA outperformed PEC-SENSE without masking and 1D linear phase correction GRAPPA. Conclusion: Our proposed PEC-GRAPPA approach effectively removes the artifacts caused by Nyquist ghosts in SMS EPI without cumbersome tuning. This approach provides a robust and practical implementation of SMS EPI reconstruction in k-space with slice-dependent 2D Nyquist ghost correction. ? 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","Article; artifact reduction; calibration; echo planar imaging; image artifact; image reconstruction; intermethod comparison; neuroimaging; Nyquist ghost correction; sensitivity analysis; signal noise ratio; simultaneous multislice echo planar imaging"
"Development of the Asia Pacific Lupus Collaboration cohort",2019,"Aim: The aim of this manuscript is to describe the development of the Asia Pacific Lupus Collaboration (APLC) cohort. Method: The APLC cohort is an ongoing, prospective longitudinal cohort. Adult patients who meet either the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Modified Classification Criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Classification Criteria, and provide informed consent are recruited into the cohort. Patients are routinely followed up at 3- to 6-monthly intervals. Information on demographics, clinical manifestations, treatment, pathology results, outcomes, and patient-reported quality of life (Short-form 36 version 2) are collected using a standardized case report form. Each site is responsible for obtaining local ethics and governance approval, patient recruitment, data collection, and data transfer into a centralized APLC database. Results: The latest APLC cohort comprises 2160 patients with >12?000 visits from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. The APLC has proposed the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) as a treat-to-target (T2T) endpoint, and reported several retrospective and cross-sectional analyses consistent with the validity of LLDAS. Longitudinal validation of LLDAS as a T2T endpoint is currently underway. Conclusion: The APLC cohort is one of the largest contemporary SLE patient cohorts in the world.

"Effect of Kinesio taping on electromyographic activity of leg muscles during gait in children with developmental coordination disorder: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Kinesio tape (KT) on lower limb muscle activation pattern in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) during walking.Design:A parallel-group randomized controlled trial.Setting:University laboratory setting.Participants:Twenty-five children with DCD were randomly allocated to the KT group (mean age=7.97 years) and 24 to the control group (mean age=8.04 years).Intervention:KT group received KT application to the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles whereas the control group received no intervention.Measurements:Peak muscle activation (in percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction [%MVIC]) in the lower limbs during gait was measured by means of surface electromyography, electrogoniometry, and foot contact switches.Results:Gastrocnemius medialis activation during mid stance (23.46%MVIC, 95% CI=-32.53, -14.39) and late stance phases (3.25%MVIC, 95% CI=-5.67, -0.81) of gait increased after the application of KT in the KT group compared to baseline values. The KT group demonstrated 26.87%MVIC (95% CI=26.87, 7.11) higher gastrocnemius medialis muscle peak activation during mid stance phase at post-test when compared with the control group. Moreover, gastrocnemius medialis and biceps femoris muscle peak activation during loading response decreased by 8.36%MVIC (95% CI=2.71, 14.02) and 3.54%MVIC (95% CI=1.08, 6.01), respectively, in the control group overtime.Conclusions:The application of KT on children with DCD had an increased gastrocnemius medialis muscle activation during stance phase. KT could be incorporated into gait re-education programmes to facilitate muscle contraction in these children. ? 2019 the Author(s).

"Residential relocation and obesity after a natural disaster: A natural experiment from the 2011 Japan Earthquake and Tsunami",2019,"Natural disasters are often associated with forced residential relocation, thereby affected people experience a change of food environment that results in the increased body mass index. However, there are a few studies that examined whether a change in food environment caused risk of obesity after a natural disaster. To address this question, we leveraged a natural experiment of residential relocation in the aftermath of the 2011 Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. Our baseline data came from a nationwide cohort study of older community-dwelling adults conducted 7 months prior to the disaster. By chance, one of the field sites (Iwanuma City, Miyagi Prefecture) was directly in the line of the tsunami. Approximately 2.5 years after the disaster, we ascertained the residential addresses and health status of 3,594 survivors aged 65 years or older (82.1% follow-up rate). Fixed effects multinomial logistic regression showed that shortened distances to food outlets/bars increased the risks of transitioning from BMI in the normal range (18.5–22.9) to obesity (?25.0) (Odds ratios: 1.46 for supermarkets; 1.43 for bars; 1.44 times for fast food outlets). Radically changed food access after a natural disaster may raise the risk of obesity among older survivors. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Clinical considerations when adding a sodiumglucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor to insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus",2019,"A consensus meeting was held to discuss add-on therapy of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. The objectives were to affirm the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors as an add-on to insulin, empower clinicians to minimise the risk of adverse events, and provide clinical guidance. Administration of SGLT2 inhibitors as an add-on therapy to insulin is associated with significant reductions compared with placebo in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, insulin dose, and body weight without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Compared with traditional therapies, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown cardiovascular and renal benefits. Adding an SGLT2 inhibitor to insulin increases the risk of urinary tract and genital tract infections. The use of SGLT2 inhibitor is also associated with a slightly increased incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients who may benefit most from add-on therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors include those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, high insulin doses, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Routine monitoring for diabetic ketoacidosis is controversial, and patient and clinician education is essential to minimise risk. The decision to adjust insulin dose when adding an SGLT2 inhibitor is dependent on patient factors, but the insulin dose should not be reduced beyond 20% prior to the first dose of SGLT2 inhibitor. Patients should temporarily discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors during fasting, acute illness, or low/reduced carbohydrate intake. If ketonuria is detected, SGLT2 inhibitors but not insulin should be immediately discontinued and medical advice sought. ?2019 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.","hemoglobin A1c; insulin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; acute disease; Article; awareness; body weight; body weight gain; carbohydrate intake; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; coronary artery atherosclerosis; diabetic ketoacidosis; drug efficacy; drug safety; dyslipidemia; education; fasting; genital tract infection; glucose blood level; heart failure; human; hypoglycemia; incidence; insulin sensitivity; insulin treatment; ketonuria; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; randomized controlled trial (topic); urinary tract infection"

"High plasma FGF21 levels predicts major cardiovascular events in patients treated with atorvastatin (from the Treating to New Targets [TNT] Study)",2019,"Background: Higher plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels predict incident cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes patients. However, whether FGF21 levels predict cardiovascular events in statin-treated patients in the general population is unknown. We investigated whether FGF21 levels predict major cardiovascular event (MCVE) in the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial participants. Methods: After 8-week run-in on atorvastatin 10 mg/day, 10,001 patients with stable coronary disease in the TNT trial were randomized to 10 mg or 80 mg/day of atorvastatin for a median of 4.9 years. We analyzed data from 1996 patients with plasma FGF21 levels measured at randomization. Among them, 1835 patients had FGF21 measured one-year post-randomization. Results: Higher ln-transformed FGF21 levels at randomization were associated with higher risk of incident MCVE (adjusted hazards ratio per SD increase = 1.18, P = 0.019). At 1-year post-randomization, FGF21 levels were lower in patients randomized to receive 80 mg versus 10 mg atorvastatin (186.9 versus 207.5 pg/mL respectively, P = 0.006). Higher ln-transformed FGF21 levels at 1-year post-randomization were also associated with higher subsequent risk of MCVEs (adjusted hazards ratio per SD increase = 1.24, P = 0.009). However, changes in FGF21 levels over 1-year were not related to subsequent MCVE risk. FGF21 levels had significant incremental value in net reclassification improvement in MCVE risk prediction. Conclusions: Higher plasma FGF21 levels are associated with higher CVD risk in statin-treated high-risk patients. Higher dose atorvastatin is associated with a reduction in FGF21 levels. FGF21 provides incremental value in CVD risk prediction in statin-treated patients. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","atorvastatin; fibroblast growth factor 21; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; atorvastatin; biological marker; fibroblast growth factor; fibroblast growth factor 21; hypocholesterolemic agent; adult; Article; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diastolic blood pressure; drug dose comparison; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glucose blood level; high risk patient; human; hypertension; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; mean corpuscular volume; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; smoking; systolic blood pressure; urea nitrogen blood level; aged; blood; cardiovascular disease; coronary artery disease; predictive value; Aged; Anticholesteremic Agents; Atorvastatin; Biomarkers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests"
"A chronological map of 308 physical and mental health conditions from 4 million individuals in the English National Health Service",2019,"Background: To effectively prevent, detect, and treat health conditions that affect people during their lifecourse, health-care professionals and researchers need to know which sections of the population are susceptible to which health conditions and at which ages. Hence, we aimed to map the course of human health by identifying the 50 most common health conditions in each decade of life and estimating the median age at first diagnosis. Methods: We developed phenotyping algorithms and codelists for physical and mental health conditions that involve intensive use of health-care resources. Individuals older than 1 year were included in the study if their primary-care and hospital-admission records met research standards set by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and they had been registered in a general practice in England contributing up-to-standard data for at least 1 year during the study period. We used linked records of individuals from the CALIBER platform to calculate the sex-standardised cumulative incidence for these conditions by 10-year age groups between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2015. We also derived the median age at diagnosis and prevalence estimates stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity (black, white, south Asian) over the study period from the primary-care and secondary-care records of patients. Findings: We developed case definitions for 308 disease phenotypes. We used records of 2 784 138 patients for the calculation of cumulative incidence and of 3 872 451 patients for the calculation of period prevalence and median age at diagnosis of these conditions. Conditions that first gained prominence at key stages of life were: atopic conditions and infections that led to hospital admission in children (<10 years); acne and menstrual disorders in the teenage years (10–19 years); mental health conditions, obesity, and migraine in individuals aged 20–29 years; soft-tissue disorders and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in individuals aged 30–39 years; dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction in individuals aged 40–59 years; cancer, osteoarthritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cataract, diverticular disease, type 2 diabetes, and deafness in individuals aged 60–79 years; and atrial fibrillation, dementia, acute and chronic kidney disease, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, anaemia, and osteoporosis in individuals aged 80 years or older. Black or south-Asian individuals were diagnosed earlier than white individuals for 258 (84%) of the 308 conditions. Bone fractures and atopic conditions were recorded earlier in male individuals, whereas female individuals were diagnosed at younger ages with nutritional anaemias, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urinary disorders. Interpretation: We have produced the first chronological map of human health with cumulative-incidence and period-prevalence estimates for multiple morbidities in parallel from birth to advanced age. This can guide clinicians, policy makers, and researchers on how to formulate differential diagnoses, allocate resources, and target research priorities on the basis of the knowledge of who gets which diseases when. We have published our phenotyping algorithms on the CALIBER open-access Portal which will facilitate future research by providing a curated list of reusable case definitions.

"A systematic measurement of street quality through multi-sourced Urban data: A human-oriented analysis",2019,"Many studies have been made on street quality, physical activity and public health. However, most studies so far have focused on only few features, such as street greenery or accessibility. These features fail to capture people’s holistic perceptions. The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method. The classification was tested with experts. The analytical framework developed through this study contributes to human-oriented urban planning practices to further encourage physical activity and public health. ? 2019 by the author.

"A natural “GA” insertion mutation in the sequence encoding the 3′UTR of CXCL12/SDF-1α: Identification, characterization, and functional impact on mRNA splicing",2019,"The CXCL12 gene produces a series of transcript variants through alternative splicing at the 3′ end of its pre-mRNA. This study explores the biological activities of these alternative transcripts and the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CXCL12 transcription and RNA splicing. We identified a “GA” insertion mutation in the region of CXCL12α DNA encoding the conserved 3′UTR. This variant transcript was named CXCL12-3′GA+. The mutation occurred at a frequency of 13.2% in healthy Chinese individuals. However, its frequency in healthy Caucasians was 22.6%, significantly higher than what was observed in the Chinese. Genomic analysis indicated that the GA+ mutation likely encodes a G-quadruplex structure in close proximity to a cluster of important AU-rich elements (AREs) that are well-established regulators of mRNA stability at the 3′UTR. Experiments using molecular constructs encoding the 3′UTR of CXCL12 revealed that the GA+ allele can significantly increase gene expression compared to the WT allele. Further studies uncovered that the WT allele was associated with the production of a 225-bp minor transcript isoform (MTI) through alternative splicing resulting in the deletion of exon 2. ARMS-PCR using samples collected from cultured PBMCs of WT/GA+ genotype carriers indicated that the GA+ allele was preferentially transcribed compared to the WT allele. In summary, the study demonstrates that a GA insertion in the region encoding the 3′UTR of CXCL12α may affect gene expression through alternative mRNA splicing. This finding provides a basis for understanding how multiple elements in the sequence encoding the 3′UTR of the CXCL12 gene regulates its transcription and may lead to insights about diseases involving abnormal CXCL12α expression. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","guanine quadruplex; stromal cell derived factor 1alpha; CXCL12 protein, human; isoprotein; stromal cell derived factor 1; 3' untranslated region; alternative RNA splicing; Article; AU rich element; Caucasian; Chinese; controlled study; CXCL12alpha gene; gene expression; gene locus; gene mutation; heterozygote; human; human cell; normal human; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; RNA stability; alternative RNA splicing; animal; Asian continental ancestry group; cell culture; dna mutational analysis; gene expression regulation; gene frequency; genetics; HeLa cell line; molecular cloning; mouse; nucleotide sequence; RNA splicing; 3' Untranslated Regions; Alternative Splicing; Animals; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Base Sequence; Cells, Cultured; Chemokine CXCL12; Cloning, Molecular; DNA Mutational Analysis; European Continental Ancestry Group; Gene Frequency; HeLa Cells; Humans; Mice; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Protein Isoforms; RNA Splicing; RNA Stability"
"Targeted genomic profiling identifies frequent deleterious mutations in FAT4 and TP53 genes in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular mechanisms underlying HBV-associated HCC pathogenesis is still unclear. Genetic alterations in cancer-related genes have been linked to many human cancers. Here, we aimed to explore genetic alterations in selected cancer-related genes in patients with HBV-associated HCC. Methods: Targeted sequencing was used to analyze six cancer-related genes (PIK3CA, TP53, FAT4, IRF2, HNF4α and ARID1A) in eight pairs of HBV-associated HCC tumors and their adjacent non-tumor tissues. Sanger sequencing, quantitative PCR, Western-blotting and RNAi-mediated gene knockdown were used to further validate findings. Results: Targeted sequencing revealed thirteen non-synonymous mutations, of which 9 (69%) were found in FAT4 and 4 (31%) were found in TP53 genes. Non-synonymous mutations were not found in PIK3CA, IRF2, HNF4α and ARID1A. Among these 13 non-synonymous mutations, 12 (8 in FAT4 and 4 in TP53) were predicted to have deleterious effect on protein function by in silico analysis. For TP53, Y220S, R249S and P250R non-synonymous mutations were solely identified in tumor tissues. Further expression profiling of FAT4 and TP53 on twenty-eight pairs of HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues confirmed significant downregulation of both genes in HCC tumors compared with their non-tumor counterparts (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Functional analysis using RNAi-mediated knockdown of FAT4 revealed an increased cancer cell growth and proliferation, suggesting the putative tumor suppressor role of FAT4 in HCC. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of FAT4 and TP53 in HCC pathogenesis and identifies new genetic variants that may have potentials for development of precise therapy for HCC. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cadherin; FAT atypical cadherin 4; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha; interferon regulatory factor 2; protein p53; unclassified drug; cadherin; FAT4 protein, human; protein p53; tumor marker; tumor suppressor protein; ARID1A gene; Article; cancer genetics; cancer growth; cancer tissue; computer analysis; controlled study; down regulation; FAT4 gene; gene; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic variability; Hepatitis B virus; HNF4alpha gene; human; human cell; human tissue; indel mutation; IRF2 gene; liver cell carcinoma; mutation rate; mutational analysis; non synonymous mutation; personalized medicine; PIK3CA gene; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; Sanger sequencing; sequence analysis; synonymous mutation; TP53 gene; tumor suppressor gene; virus carcinogenesis; allele; complication; dna mutational analysis; gene expression profiling; gene frequency; genetics; genomics; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; mutation; procedures; tumor cell line; virology; Alleles; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cadherins; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Mutational Analysis; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Frequency; Genomics; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; INDEL Mutation; Liver Neoplasms; Mutation; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"Two truncating variants in FANCC and breast cancer risk",2019,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with 22 disease-causing genes reported to date. In some FA genes, monoallelic mutations have been found to be associated with breast cancer risk, while the risk associations of others remain unknown. The gene for FA type C, FANCC, has been proposed as a breast cancer susceptibility gene based on epidemiological and sequencing studies. We used the Oncoarray project to genotype two truncating FANCC variants (p.R185X and p.R548X) in 64,760 breast cancer cases and 49,793 controls of European descent. FANCC mutations were observed in 25 cases (14 with p.R185X, 11 with p.R548X) and 26 controls (18 with p.R185X, 8 with p.R548X). There was no evidence of an association with the risk of breast cancer, neither overall (odds ratio 0.77, 95%CI 0.44–1.33, p = 0.4) nor by histology, hormone receptor status, age or family history. We conclude that the breast cancer risk association of these two FANCC variants, if any, is much smaller than for BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations. If this applies to all truncating variants in FANCC it would suggest there are differences between FA genes in their roles on breast cancer risk and demonstrates the merit of large consortia for clarifying risk associations of rare variants. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The unmet provision of allergy services in Hong Kong impairs capability for allergy prevention – Implications for the Asia Pacific region",2019,"Introduction: There is a high and rising prevalence of many allergic diseases in the Asia Pacific, including Hong Kong (HK), which is unmatched by a commensurate provision of clinical allergy services. Method: This review highlights progress and deficiencies in allergy service and training in HK. The allergy work force was estimated from the numbers of doctors practicing allergy registered with the HK Medical Council Specialist Register in Immunology and Allergy; Paediatric Immunology and Infectious Diseases (includes allergy); Paediatrics; and Immunology (as a discipline of Pathology). The numbers of trainees were estimated from the trainee lists of the Hong Kong Colleges of Physicians, Paediatrics and Pathology. The numbers of allergy clinics were estimated from existing services in Hospital Authority public hospitals in HK. Results: In the last 3 years, two new drug allergy clinics have been established in public hospitals, and for the first time in 20 years, Hong Kong has a trainee in adult allergy. The current ratio of allergists per head of population has improved slightly from 1:1.46 million in 2014 to 1:1.17 million, but it is still low compared to many countries. There are 5-fold more paediatric allergists than adult allergists per head of population in HK. Discussion: Hong Kong is not equipped to take advantage of major public health advances in allergy prevention. If the unbalance of adult to paediatric allergists remains uncorrected, continuing care for allergic children as they grow into adulthood will be an increasing problem. Conclusion: Hong Kong still has an unmet need for allergy specialists and is ill equipped to exploit recently discovered public health opportunities to prevent allergy. This review provides recommendations to improve allergy service provision and training, including the creation of Centres of Excellence in allergy to drive the growth of the specialty. ? 2019, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

"Injectable cell-encapsulating composite alginate-collagen platform with inducible termination switch for safer ocular drug delivery",2019,"Effective retinal drug delivery remains a challenge for treating vision-threatening diseases. Encapsulated-cell therapy (ECT) can provide local drug delivery without repeated invasive injections but is plagued by unsteady performance and biosafety issues. Here, an injectable composite alginate-collagen (CAC) ECT gel with a Tet-on inducible pro-caspase 8 mechanism that acted as an orally-inducible biosafety switch was developed for safer drug delivery. The optimised gels (2 mg/ml collagen, 1.5% high molecular weight alginate and 50,000 cells/gel) could be effectively terminated in vitro (?20 pg/ml Doxycycline) and in vivo (1 mg/ml oral Doxycycline after 48 h). Also, they displayed effective proliferation control and continuous delivery of bioactive glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) with no significant gel degradation in vitro and in rat vitreous. Most importantly, intravitreally injected gels demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in Royal College of Surgeons rats with degenerating retina in reducing photoreceptor apoptosis and retina function loss. Furthermore, double gel injections into the same eye yielded better outcomes without compromising gel viability. Retrieved gels showed no host-tissue attachment or cell-protrusion 6 months post-implantation. The CAC ECT system exhibited mechanical stability, good encapsulation power, cell viability support, multiplexed GDNF dosage, and compatibility with different cell types (HEK293 and ARPE-19) without immunosuppressant, making it an attractive, safe and well-controlled platform for treating various eye diseases. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alginate; Biohazards; Cell death; Collagen; Mechanical stability; Ophthalmology; Rat control; Targeted drug delivery; Biosafety; Composite hydrogels; Encapsulated cell therapies; Neuroprotection; Retina; Controlled drug delivery; alginic acid; caspase 8; collagen; doxycycline; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; animal experiment; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; biosafety; cell proliferation; controlled study; degradation; drug delivery system; drug inhibition; encapsulation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; molecular weight; nonhuman; photoreceptor; priority journal; rat"
"Peri-operative optimisation of elderly and frail patients: a narrative review",2019,"With increasing life expectancy and technological advancement, provision of anaesthesia for elderly patients has become a significant part of the overall case-load. These patients are unique, not only because they are older with more propensity for comorbidity but a decline in physiological reserve and cognitive function invariably accompanies ageing; this can substantially impact peri-operative outcome and quality of recovery. Furthermore, it is not only morbidity and mortality that matters; quality of life is also especially relevant in this vulnerable population. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a patient-centred and multidisciplinary approach to peri-operative care. The assessment of frailty has a central role in the pre-operative evaluation of the elderly. Other essential domains include optimisation of nutritional status, assessment of baseline cognitive function and proper approach to patient counselling and the decision-making process. Anaesthetists should be proactive in multidisciplinary care to achieve better outcomes; they are integral to the process. ? 2019 Association of Anaesthetists","cognitive defect; decision making; frailty; geriatric assessment; geriatric care; geriatric patient; human; malnutrition; nutritional status; patient counseling; perioperative period; postoperative complication; Review; shared decision making; surgical risk; aged; cognition; daily life activity; frail elderly; nutritional status; perioperative period; procedures; very elderly; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Frail Elderly; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Nutritional Status; Perioperative Care"
"Screening Of Pulmonary Hypertension in Methamphetamine Abusers (SOPHMA): Rationale and design of a multicentre, cross-sectional study",2019,"Introduction: Methamphetamine misuse is classified as a 'likely' risk factor for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Nevertheless, the actual prevalence of and a screening strategy for PAH in methamphetamine users have not been established. We plan to study the prevalence of PAH and identify its independent risk factors among methamphetamine users. Methods and analysis: The Screening Of Pulmonary Hypertension in Methamphetamine Abusers (SOPHMA) study will be a multicentre, cross-sectional screening study that will involve substance abuse clinics, hospitals and rehabilitation facilities in Hong Kong that cater to more than 20 methamphetamine users. A total of 400 patients who (1) are ?18 years at enrolment; (2) report methamphetamine use in the last 2 years; (3) are diagnosed with methamphetamine use disorder; and (4) voluntarily agree to participate by providing written informed consent will be included. Patients will undergo standard echocardiography-based PAH screening procedures recommended for those with systemic sclerosis. Right heart catheterisation will be offered to participants with intermediate or high echocardiographic probability of PAH. For participants with a low echocardiographic probability of PAH, rescreening will be performed within 1 year. The primary measure will be the prevalence of PAH in methamphetamine users. The secondary measures will be the risk factors and a prediction model for PAH in methamphetamine users. Ethics and dissemination: The SOPHMA study has been approved by the institutional review board. The findings of this study will provide the necessary evidence to establish universal guidelines for screening of PAH in methamphetamine users. Our results will be disseminated through immediate feedback to study participants, press release to the general public, as well as presentation in medical conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals to healthcare providers and academia worldwide. ? 2019 Author(s).","methamphetamine; Article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cross-sectional study; Doppler echocardiography; echocardiography; false negative result; heart catheterization; human; major clinical study; methamphetamine dependence; multicenter study; prevalence; pulmonary hypertension; receiver operating characteristic; rescreening; risk factor; screening; secondary analysis; systemic sclerosis; systolic blood pressure"
"Growth hormone peak modifies the effect of BMI on increased systolic blood pressure in children with short stature",2019,"Blood pressure (BP), especially systolic BP (SBP), is higher in adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) patients than in normal controls. Additionally, obesity is a known risk factor for hypertension, and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is an important cause of short stature. For children with GHD, attention has been directed solely towards height. Few studies have assessed its potential impact on BP. Here, we investigated the effect of body mass index standard deviation score (BMISDS) on BP in children with short stature. This study included 736 children with short stature divided into two groups based on peak growth hormone (GH) level in GH provocation tests [severe GHD (SGHD) group = 212 children; non-SGHD group = 524 children]. We found that SBP was significantly higher in the SGHD group than in the non-SGHD group (p = 0.045). Additionally, there was a significant positive association between BMISDS and SBP in the SGHD group (β = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.40–4.84, p < 0.001), but no association between these variables was observed in the non-SGHD group. Thus, SGHD patients had a higher SBP than non-SGHD patients. BMISDS is a significant factor for higher SBP in SGHD patients but not in non-SGHD patients. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Treatment of Chinese adolescents with anorexia nervosa in Hong Kong: The gap between treatment expectations and outcomes",2019,"Background and objective Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders. AN is associated with individual vulnerability, societal and family factors. There has been limited research in Asia regarding the patients or their families’ perceptions on its treatment. This study explored the perceived treatment outcomes among Chinese families having adolescents with AN. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted on parents of adolescents with AN recruited through an eating disorder association in Hong Kong to understand their views and experiences regarding the help-seeking and treatment process. Results The parents expressed dissatisfaction towards help-seeking and treatment outcomes, including relationships with health professionals, hospitalization, health professionals’ knowledge of AN, understanding of the treatment model and parents’ role, amount of psychological support, and coordination among health professionals. The parents were unclear about the treatment plan as they received little explanation from the health professionals. The parents perceived that the AN treatment only focused on weight restoration with limited psychological support. Home diet monitoring was seen as a harsh task which worsened the relationship with their children. The parents often needed to take up the coordinator role and search around for different health professionals and integrate their advices by themselves. Conclusions The study shows that limited psychoeducation, communication and coordination in the treatment for AN are major problems in a Chinese context. Open communication between the health professionals and the parents about the expected treatment outcomes and limitations is needed to enhance their mutual trust. Besides, treatment should emphasize not only family involvement but also empower them to fight against AN. ? 2019 Sun et al.

"The positive impacts of early-life education on cognition, leisure activity, and brain structure in healthy aging",2019,"Education in people's early lives are positively related to their cognitive function, but its modulating effects on detailed cognition domains, its interaction with leisure activities and the associated brain changes have yet to be investigated. This report used data from 659 cognitively normal community dwelling elderly who completed neuropsychological tests, leisure activities measurement, and 78 of them underwent structural and diffusion MRI scans. We found that: (i) the highly educated elderly had a better cognitive functioning in multi-domains, higher frequencies of participation in knowledge-related leisure activities, and slower age-related reductions of executive function; (ii) the intellectual and social types of leisure activities mediated the association between education and multiple cognitive domains, including memory, language, attention and executive function; (iii) there was a significant age by education interaction on the gray matter volume of the anterior brain regions and white matter integrity; and (iv) the interaction between age and education affected cognition indirectly through white matter integrity analyzed using structural equation model. Overall, our results revealed that high education in early life served as a protective factor in aging that may help to postpone cognitive and brain reserve decline in cognitively normal aging. ?

"Integrative Palliative Cancer Care in Hong Kong: An Overview and an Example from the East",2019,"Cancer is the most common cause of mortality worldwide. Although recent advances of multiple modality cancer management have significantly improved the cure and control rates, a significant proportion of patients are still refractory to the standard and available treatments. Early initiation of palliative care can reduce cancer suffering, improve health-related quality of life and possibly prolong survival. It also allows patients and their caretakers to perceive the trajectory of their cancer, so that better and advanced care planning can be contemplated and implemented. The traditional beliefs and perceptions of cancer also differ significantly between the East and the West, which may also affect the preferential approach to palliative care. This review provides an overview of palliative care services in Hong Kong, as compared with other parts of the world. In addition, we shall also explore how cancer perceptions affect the decision-making on palliative care. ? 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists","Article; decision making; health care quality; health care system; Hong Kong; human; length of stay; malignant neoplasm; palliative therapy; patient care; patient preference; perception; priority journal; risk factor; terminal care"
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of benign thyroid nodule is safe and efficacious in patients who continue taking an anti-coagulation or anti-platelet agent in the treatment period",2019,"Background: High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation is a promising treatment for benign thyroid nodules but because bleeding complications can occur following any intervention to the thyroid gland, the safety and efficacy of HIFU ablation were evaluated in patients who continued taking an anti-coagulation or anti-platelet agent during treatment. Methods: From 2015 to 2017, 303 patients who underwent a single-session ablation for a benign thyroid nodule were analyzed. The primary study endpoint was thyroid bleeding, intra-lesional or peri-thyroidal hematoma or neck bruising diagnosed within 4 days of the treatment. Other endpoints included treatment-related complications, extent of nodule shrinkage and symptom score. Nodule volume was estimated by ultrasound. Extent of nodule shrinkage (by volume reduction ratio) (VRR)= [Baseline volume–volume at 6-month]/[Baseline volume] × 100. Obstructive symptom score (by 0– 10 visual analog scale, VAS) was evaluated after treatment. Results: Twelve patients continued taking an anti-coagulation or anti-platelet agent while the other 291 patients did not during treatment. No patients in either group suffered active thyroid bleeding, intralesional/pericapsular hematoma or subcutaneous neck bruising in the first 4 days of treatment. Complication rate and the 6-month VRR were comparable between the two groups (0.0% vs. 1.7%, p = 1.000 and 55.96% vs. 61.29%, respectively, p =.073). Conclusions: HIFU ablation is a feasible treatment in patients who continue to take an anti-coagulation or anti-platelet agent during treatment and might be preferable in patients who continuously require an anti-coagulation or anti-platelet agent for one reason or another during treatment. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"A propensity-matched analysis of clinical outcomes between open thyroid lobectomy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of benign thyroid nodules",2019,"Background: High-intensity focused ultrasound is a promising, nonoperative treatment for benign thyroid nodules. Our study aimed to compare treatment outcomes of single-session high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation with open lobectomy after propensity score matching. Methods: After propensity matching, we compared treatment-related morbidity, treatment time, duration of hospitalization, improvement in symptom score, cost, and acoustic parameters of consecutive patients who underwent high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation or lobectomy. All eligible patients completed the computerized, multidimensional voice program and Voice Handicap Index questionnaire before, and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Results: The matched cohort comprised 154 patients (77 in each group). Although treatment-related morbidity was comparable between the two groups (P =.368), treatment time (P <.001), duration of hospitalization (P <.001), and medical cost (P <.001) were less in the high-intensity focused ultrasound group. After high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, the 6-month nodule shrinkage (mean ± SD) was 64% ± 26% and the 6-month symptom improvement score was comparable with lobectomy (P =.283). At 6 months, none of the acoustic parameters were changed from the baseline in both groups (P >.05), and the Voice Handicap Index questionnaire did not differ between the two groups (P >.05). Conclusion: Despite having similar treatment-related morbidity and voice outcomes, there were possibly some advantages with high-intensity focused ultrasound during open lobectomy, including the avoidance of a neck scar, shorter treatment time and duration of hospitalization, and lower medical cost. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","thyroxine; adult; Article; bleeding; comparative effectiveness; comparative study; female; health care cost; Horner syndrome; human; hypothyroidism; major clinical study; male; miosis; outcome assessment; priority journal; propensity score; ptosis (eyelid); questionnaire; scoring system; subtotal thyroidectomy; thyroid nodule; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment response; adverse event; economics; high intensity focused ultrasound; hypothyroidism; length of stay; middle aged; propensity score; retrospective study; statistical analysis; thyroid nodule; thyroidectomy; time factor; voice; Female; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Humans; Hypothyroidism; Length of Stay; Male; Matched-Pair Analysis; Middle Aged; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Thyroid Nodule; Thyroidectomy; Time Factors; Voice Quality"
"Linking stemness with colorectal cancer initiation, progression, and therapy",2019,"The discovery of cancer stem cells caused a paradigm shift in the concepts of origin and development of colorectal cancer. Several unresolved questions remain in this field though. Are colorectal cancer stem cells the cause or an effect of the disease? How do cancer stem cells assist in colorectal tumor dissemination to distant organs? What are the molecular or environmental factors affecting the roles of these cells in colorectal cancer? Through this review, we investigate the key findings until now and attempt to elucidate the origins, physical properties, microenvironmental niches, as well as the molecular signaling network that support the existence, self-renewal, plasticity, quiescence, and the overall maintenance of cancer stem cells in colorectal cancer. Increasing data show that the cancer stem cells play a crucial role not only in the establishment of the primary colorectal tumor but also in the distant spread of the disease. Hence, we will also look at the mechanisms adopted by cancer stem cells to influence the development of metastasis and evade therapeutic targeting and its role in the overall disease prognosis. Finally, we will illustrate the importance of understanding the biology of these cells to develop improved clinical strategies to tackle colorectal cancer. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"Consensus statements on diagnosis and management of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults in Hong Kong",2019,"Objective: The estimated prevalence of chronic idiopathic constipation in Hong Kong is 14%. An expert panel of local gastroenterologists has created a set of consensus statements with the aim of providing localised guidance on the diagnosis and management of this common condition by primary care physicians. Participants: An expert panel consisting of seven local gastroenterologists convened in August 2018 in Hong Kong. Evidence: Published primary research articles, meta-analyses, and guidelines and consensus statements issued by different regional and international societies on the diagnosis and management of chronic idiopathic constipation were reviewed. Consensus process: Draft consensus statements were prepared prior to the meeting. The consensus statements were finalised during the meeting with contributions from the panel members based on their collective knowledge and clinical experience. Conclusions: A total of 11 consensus statements were created, including five concerning patient assessment and diagnosis, two relating to non-pharmacological management, and four on pharmacological management. These consensus statements are intended to provide guidance to local general practitioners and primary care physicians on managing patients with chronic constipation in daily clinical practice. ? 2019 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine.","laxative; linaclotide; adult; anxiety; Article; awareness; blood cell count; calcium blood level; cancer risk; Chinese medicine; chronic constipation; clinical practice; colonoscopy; consensus development; drug effect; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal motility; glucose level; Hong Kong; human; intestinal dysmotility; intestine preparation; irritable colon; liver transplantation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pelvic floor disorder; physical activity; physical examination; physiotherapy; prevalence; primary medical care; prospective study; quality of life; rectum hemorrhage; risk factor; thyroid function; thyroid function test; vomiting"
"Mathematical models of transmission dynamics and vaccine strategies in Hong Kong during the 2017–2018 winter influenza season",2019,"Two mathematical models described by simple ordinary differential equations are developed to investigate the Hong Kong influenza epidemic during 2017–2018 winter, based on overall epidemic dynamics and different influenza subtypes. The first model, describing the overall epidemic dynamics, provides the starting data for the second model which different influenza subtypes, and whose dynamics is further investigated. Weekly data from December 2017 to May 2018 are obtained from the data base of the Centre of Health Protection in Hong Kong, and used to parametrise the models. With the help of these models, we investigate the impact of different vaccination strategies and determine the corresponding critical vaccination coverage for different vaccine efficacies. The results suggest that at least 72% of Hong Kong population should have been vaccinated during 2017–2018 winter to prevent the seasonal epidemic by herd immunity (while data showed that only a maximum of 11.6% of the population were vaccinated). Our results also show that the critical vaccination coverage decreases with increasing vaccine efficacy, and the increase in one influenza subtype vaccine efficacy may lead to an increase in infections caused by a different subtype. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","influenza vaccine; disease transmission; epidemic; influenza; numerical model; vaccination; vaccine; winter; Article; disease surveillance; disease transmission; drug efficacy; drug safety; herd immunity; Hong Kong; mathematical model; priority journal; seasonal influenza; simulation; vaccination; virus strain; winter; China; Hong Kong"
"Survival differences in multiple myeloma in Latin America and Asia: a comparison involving 3664 patients from regional registries",2019,"In previous observational studies, we have separately characterized patients with multiple myeloma (MM) both from Latin America (LA) and from Asia. Here, we analyze these two datasets jointly, in order to assess the overall survival (OS) in these two world regions. Data were available from 3664 patients (1968 from LA and 1696 from Asia); all of whom diagnosed between 1998 and 2007. Approximately, 26% of patients in both world regions underwent transplantation. OS (from diagnosis of MM) was explored with Kaplan–Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. Patients from LA were significantly younger and had hypercalcemia more often than Asian patients, who in turn had higher proportions of anemia and International Staging System (ISS) stage III disease. The median OS was 56?months in LA, and 47?months in Asia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.91; P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, age, ISS stage III, anemia, hypercalcemia, and world region remained significantly associated with OS (P < 0.001 for all covariates). These results were largely driven by patients not undergoing transplantation, as no difference in OS emerged between the two world regions in univariable or multivariable analysis for transplanted patients. Despite adverse prognostic features differentially favoring each region, and adjusting for such differences, we found an OS advantage for patients from LA, in comparison with contemporaneous patients from Asia. Whether this is due to different biological features, differences in access to novel agents (especially thalidomide in earlier periods of the study), unmeasured confounders, or the play of chance, remain unknown. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; age; anemia; Article; Asia; autotransplantation; cancer staging; confidence interval; controlled study; covariance; demography; disease association; female; hazard ratio; health survey; human; hypercalcemia; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; overall survival; priority journal; South and Central America; survival analysis; aged; clinical trial; comparative study; disease free survival; epidemiology; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; multiple myeloma; register; survival rate; Aged; Asia; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Latin America; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Staging; Registries; Survival Rate"
"A program to improve the hand hygiene compliance of Hong Kong preschoolers with an insight into their absenteeism",2019,"Background: Hand hygiene prevents cross-infection and is the most effective defense against contagious diseases. Preschoolers, without proper hand hygiene skills, are a vulnerable group to such diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hand hygiene compliance training of preschoolers in Hong Kong improves their hand hygiene knowledge and performance, and whether the training reduces their absenteeism resulting from influenza symptoms. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design. A total of 110 preschoolers participated in a program consisting of 4 training sessions on hand hygiene. Before and after the program, their hand hygiene knowledge was assessed by 10 true or false questions, and their handwashing skills were assessed by photos of their hands taken before and after handwashing. Before handwashing, a fluorescent stain gel was used to cover their hands. To determine whether a causal relationship existed between compliance and absenteeism, the preschoolers’ absenteeism data were collected during a period of 3 months for analysis. Results: Significant differences were found in hand hygiene knowledge on handwashing steps, duration, and after playing with toys. Percentage increases were recorded for 8 questions. There was significant improvement in hand hygiene performance on the fronts and the backs of fingers, thumbs, and fingertips (P <.05). The findings showed a decrease in absence rates with influenza symptoms for the month before (31%), during (30%), and after (25%) the completion of the program in all participating schools. Discussion: After the training program, the participants’ hand hygiene knowledge and performance considerably improved. They washed their hands more thoroughly and there was a significant reduction in absences owing to influenza. Conclusions: Good cooperation between schools and families is found to be important in helping students build positive attitudes and habits, even in performing simple routines like hand hygiene. ? 2018","Article; attitude to health; behavior change; child; China; female; fluorescence analysis; hand washing; health program; human; human experiment; infection prevention; influenza; male; preschool child; pretest posttest design; program evaluation; protocol compliance; school attendance; school health service; symptom"

"Socioeconomic and geographic variations in the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of dyslipidemia in middle-aged and older Chinese",2019,"Background and aims: Unevenly socioeconomic development and nutrition transition might bring large variations in the epidemiology of dyslipidemia. We aimed to estimate the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of dyslipidemia in different socioeconomic statuses and geographic regions in China, and to assess the associated factors and comorbidities of dyslipidemia. Methods: We included participants aged 45 years and above from a nationally representative investigation: the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2011. Dyslipidemia was defined based on the 2016 guideline of Chinese Prevention and Treatment of Dyslipidemia in adults. Multivariable logistic regression was adopted to assess the potentially associated factors and commodities of dyslipidemia. Results: In 2010, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was 42.84% among people aged 45 years and above. Low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was the most common type of dyslipidemia. The awareness, treatment and control rates among dyslipidemic subjects were 20.27%, 14.41% and 4.94%, respectively. In dyslipidemic patients who were under treatment, the control rate was 34.26%. People aged 50–59 years were at a significantly higher risk of dyslipidemia than those aged 45–49 years. Male gender, living in North China, overweight, obesity, central obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hyperuricemia were significantly associated with a higher risk of dyslipidemia. Current alcohol drinking and underweight were linked to a lower prevalence of dyslipidemia. Conclusions: Our study revealed a high prevalence of dyslipidemia among middle-aged and older Chinese. The awareness, treatment and control rates were far from ideal and geographic inequality was highlighted. More efforts are needed to prevent and manage dyslipidemia in China. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; age; aged; Article; attitude to health; China; Chinese; cohabiting person; comorbidity assessment; diabetes mellitus; drinking behavior; dyslipidemia; educational status; female; geographic distribution; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; high risk population; human; hypertension; hyperuricemia; major clinical study; male; married person; middle aged; obesity; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; social status; triacylglycerol blood level; underweight"
